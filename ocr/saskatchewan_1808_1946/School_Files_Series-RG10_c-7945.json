(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 129-6-5 of 27th inst. re repairs at the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout.\n\nI was in Winnipeg yesterday and went into the matter very closely with Messrs Munford Midland Ltd., Dr. Westgate and Colonel Marmegan, of the Indian School Committee.\n\nThe following are absolutely necessary repairs and replacements to put the school in running condition:\n\n- Fire Hose, $81.15\n- Tools etc., $500.00\n- Iron Uptakes $18.00\n- Refills for Extinguishers $18.64\n- Lighting Plant & freight $990.00\n- Engine for Pump $200.00\n- Battery repairs $25.00\n- Piston leathers and valves $14.84\n- Saw & Belt $150.00\n- Munford Midland account for inspection report, loan of engine etc. $210.00\n- Labour installing lighting plant $75.00\n- Renovating wiring $300.00\n- Cement Mixer $175.00\n- Repairs to building $1029.00\n\nThere will also be a certain amount of freight and other minor expenses.\n\nAfter discussing the matter with the above gentlemen Mr. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian School Committee, sent you a night lettergram saying that as you could not authorize an expenditure of more than $2500.00, the school committee would advance a further $1500.00 so as to make possible the carrying on of the school without closing.\n\nEven if this is agreed to, the school would still be run at a great handicap owing to the trouble with the water tower.\n\nPlease note that in our latter of Sept. 29th we estimated the amount of damage done outside the engine room and engine etc., $2000.00. This of course did not include lighting plant etc.\nThe Fire Hose, Refills for Extinguishers and certain other articles have already been supplied under authority of your previous letters.\n\nI saw the Reverend Principal at the General Hospital, and he is a very sick man, and I do not think he will be of much use around the school for a considerable time.\n\nHe informs me that the work in course of completion of the Barn, Meet House and Silo should be left till his return to the school.\n\nSome of the material has been ordered and the work is underway.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nNovember 3rd, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReplying to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of the 28th ultimo, requesting to be informed if it would be possible for the Department to purchase the electrical energy required for power purposes at the Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout, rather than generate it at the school, I would say that, in the town of Sioux Lookout, there is only a local steam plant, operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and that no power would be available for distribution to the school. The Sioux Lookout School is located on Pelican Lake, a distance of approximately 7 to 8 miles from the town.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, November 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, in further reference to the cost of the work required in repairing the damage occasioned by fire in the engine room at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. It is noted that, after consultation with Messrs. Mumford Medland, Limited, and the authorities of the Missionary Society of the Anglican Church in Winnipeg, it is found the total cost of carrying out the repairs to the building, repairing the electric light plant and supplying the new equipment required will be approximately $4,000.\n\nThe Department understood, from previous correspondence, that an expenditure of approximately $2,500.00 would carry out the repairs occasioned to the building and equipment.\n\nWhile the cost of completing the repairs occasioned by the fire is an unforeseen expenditure - no funds being specially provided - it will, however, be necessary to place the building and equipment in a satisfactory condition to carry on the school work. The Department will, therefore endeavour to provide the full amount required in purchasing the equipment, as mentioned in your letter, and in carrying out the repairs to the building and plant, to an amount which must be kept within $4,000.00. We are not prepared\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\nto consider the offer made by the church authorities, to advance the sum of $1,500, on the understanding that repayment would be made during the next fiscal year.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of carrying out the repairs and supplying the equipment in your hands. All purchases should be made from firms on the approved list and the work should be completed at as early a date as possible in order to have the building and plant placed in a good state of repair.\n\nYou should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials purchased. Full particulars should be given regarding any outside labour employed, viz.: number of days or hours employed and rates paid. I would request that you forward all accounts covering the cost at the one time and as soon after the work is completed as possible.\n\nIt is noted the Principal desires that the work which is now under way, in connection with the barn, root-house and silo, be deferred until he is able to return to the school and resume his duties. This matter should be referred to the Department before any further work is performed. Full details should be given, regarding the cost of the work to be done. It is noted that some of the material has been ordered and part of the work underway.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Mr. Agent Edwards has been written and given instructions to proceed with the repairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr McGill,\n\nI am in receipt of the Secretary's letter #129-6-5 of 4th instant authorizing an expenditure of $4000 for repairs to Sioux Lockout School.\n\nMr H. McKinnon, M.P., phoned me up yesterday and informed me he had received a telegram from the Minister re purchases of materials and labour on this work. He wanted to know if we were having the work done by Kenora firms, and I informed him that we were getting prices, and that we had had a report from Mumford and Medland's man in Winnipeg, who estimated what we would require, and also that as this firm had installed the engines, and the school authorities desired Mumford-Medland to do the necessary work of putting things in shape again, we would probably give them the work providing their prices were right, as authorized by Ottawa, and that the work of repairing the buildings would go to the Contractor in Sioux Lockout who was so we were informed the only firm there for this building work.\n\nMr McKinnon seemed very annoyed that work should be awarded to Winnipeg firms, although any firms in Kenora who might wish to tender would have to get nearly all their supplies &c from Winnipeg.\n\nMr McKinnon gave me the names of firms in Kenora he wished me to contact and get prices from, and I am obeying his instructions, but I do not think they will be in a position to do the work as satisfactorily or as cheaply as Mumford Medland. However I am awaiting their tenders and will give the work to the cheapest firm providing they can give me assurance the work will be satisfactory and everything put into good working order.\n\nMr McKinnon asked me if I had a preferred list for Kenora, I informed him we had not, but on any special jobs I received instructions where to obtain prices &c, he said I should have this and he would see I received it immediately; he rather blamed the Department for not having sent this before but I informed him we had never received any complaints from anyone as to where we purchased materials or with whom we dealt as we used good judgment.\nIt is very unfortunate, this will delay starting the work, particularly as the weather is so cold and the lakes are freezing up, and the pipes at the school are exposed to the weather, but I consider it is the only thing to do under the circumstances, and as soon as we are in position to go ahead with the work we will do so.\n\nPlease let me know immediately if these arrangements meet with your approval.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, November 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the repairs which you were authorized to have carried out at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. It is noted that the local member furnished you with names of firms in Kenora from whom to obtain prices and that you have asked these firms to quote. This is satisfactory. You should arrange to give the work to the firm quoting the lowest price. The Department understands this applies only to the work in connection with the equipment and repairs required to the electric light system and water supply and not to the carpentry work required in repairing the engine room and other damage caused by fire to the building. You should cooperate, as far as possible, with the local member mentioned in your letter, with a view to having the work satisfactorily carried out and at the lowest possible expense.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McKinnon, Esq., M.P.,\nKenora / Rainy River,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th inst re repairs and replacements to buildings and equipment at Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom your letter it appears you are under a misapprehension.\n\nNo arrangements had definitely been decided upon as to who was to do this work, all that had been done was to get an estimate from the firm in Winnipeg who had supplied and installed the engines in the buildings as to what damage had been done and an estimate as to the cost of repairs and materials necessary to make good the damage done to the machinery. The reason this firm was asked to make the estimate was that they have supplied the plant previously in the school and the Church and School authorities asked me to get their advice, and this firm was on the preferred list.\n\nI asked the School authorities to get me a price for repairs to the buildings and they got Mr. Wright Contractor of Sioux Lookout, who they informed me was the only available Contractor.\n\nNo purchases would have been made until we got prices from different firms who would have been eligible to tender, and until we had been to the school again to see if we were employing the right people and that their prices were right.\n\nI have seen all the firms you mentioned and am getting prices from them, but there is no doubt that the firm who is the lowest price will have to get the Winnipeg firm to supply a lot of the materials and also to send his own men down to do some of the work.\n\nWe purchase everything we can in Kenora, except where there is a big difference in prices, and I think this is the proper thing to do.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McKinnon, M.P., in reply to one of his, as Mr Meikle, my clerk, informed me Mr McKinnon was in on Saturday whilst I was out of Town and that he was very annoyed and seemed to think the work had already been awarded to some Winnipeg firm, which was not the case.\n\nI saw Mr Mumford, on Saturday, he and other firms had not been asked to tender, the only thing we had got, was an estimate from Mumford and Medland as to what it would cost to make good the damage done by the fire, and this firm sent a man down to make an estimate for which they were charging us, and also for the rent of engines temporarily to give light and water, whilst we were awaiting the decision of headquarters.\n\nMr Mumford informed me Mr Fife (one of the firms from Kenora) who I was asked to get a price from, had been in to see him, and informed him a Kenora firm had to get the work, and asked Mr Medland if he would do the work for Fife. Should he be awarded the work, Mr Medland agreed to do this, although both his firm and Fife's had been asked to put in a price.\n\nIf Fife does this, he will, no doubt, put in a lower price, and will probably get the work, but he will only be able to do this, by getting the engines &c Medland can supply, as they happen to have suitable ones on hand, and they are working on an electric light contract they have at Hudson, 7 miles from the School.\n\nI am writing this letter for your information, as Mr Meikle informs me Mr McKinnon has to go to Toronto, and that he was going to Ottawa after to see you, and I think you should have all the information on hand.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cheyne of the Cheyne Electric, there, both of Kenora, who inspected the school and then made a tender on the work to be done.\n\nOn discussing the matter with the Acting Principal, the Contractors and later with Dr. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian Residential School Commission, it was decided, if possible to only do temporarily carpenter work and save wherever possible to a later date, so as to enable us to put in a water tank, as the tower in present use is almost useless.\n\nMumford Medland Co. made a tender of $2844.39, Fife Hardware of $2755.23 and the Cheyne Electric of $3080.20, for the material and labour including a 2000 gal. tank so as to put the water and lights in good serviceable condition.\n\nIn addition to the above we have accounts of $100.63 for C.N.R. work on fire. $750.98 Mumford Medland, expert, wages and accounts for other material supplied by them and other firms.\n\nIn connection with the rebuilding so as to enable the school to get a tank, the school and church authorities agreed to limit the amount of repairs, which will cost $300.00.\n\nThis work will be given to Mr. Edmonds of Sioux Lookout who is the lowest tenderer.\n\nAs the names of Fife Hardware Co. and Mr. F. Edmonds were given to us by Mr. H. B. McKinnon Kenora and their tenders were lowest we wired you last night asking if we could award the contracts to them.\nIf your reply is favourable, work will be started immediately on contract basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your telegram of 17th inst. re repairs at the Sioux Lookout Residential School, and have today notified the A.T.Fife Co and F. Edmonds to proceed with the work.\n\nWe inclose a copy of a letter to the Principal in the hospital at Winnipeg and have also sent a copy to the acting Principal.\n\nReferring to your letter 129-6-5 of 4th inst., last paragraph, the acting Principal informs us the work in connection with the Barn, Root House and Silo is being left over as instructed except that the barn floor is being completed.\n\nThe cement cost $262.50 and the labour and other material for work already done or in course of completion will cost about $300.00, and in this way there will be a saving on the amount authorized in your letter to the Principal which was approximately $840.00.\n\nThe Acting Principal also informs us that they can do without the Hay Mower, Hay Rake, and Ensilage Cutter, for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\nReverend J. F. J. Marshall,\nWest 1-108 General Hospital\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Marshall:\n\nWe hope you are getting better and did not wish to bother you with the school fire when you were so sick, however everything is getting straightened out.\n\nThe Fife Hardware Co. of Kenora have the contract to put the equipment in condition, and P. Admonds, of Sioux Lookout for the carpentry work.\n\nWe intend placing a 2000 gal. water tank in the school and this will do away with the troubles with the water tower.\n\nThe Contractor will be starting work immediately, so you have no need to worry in this connection. We understand they were short of wood at the school but no doubt this will be attended to. We believe that the floor in the barn is new in but Mr. Mayo wants some wood blocks for this.\n\nHe informs us that the interior painting is practically finished including the Chapel, Dormitories, Staff Sitting Room etc. He will require about $150.00 for labour and $150.00 for material for the work already done or in course of completion.\n\nThe work that is not done in the barn ceiling, Ray loft floor and joists and silo pit, these we think will have to be left over till you return, as the Department does not wish to go to any further expense, owing to the cost of the fire.\n\nI saw the Bishop yesterday and believe he is taking up the matter of new pupils with Canon Sanderson. If there is any way we can help, let us know.\nI expect to be in Winnipeg 4th or 5th December, and will drop in and see you then.\n\nKind regards and wishing you a speedy recovery\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

They estimate $250.00 for this work, the school authorities to do the necessary labour.\n\nThey also say that the water pipe from the lake to the school broke some years ago and was temporarily repaired, the pipe passes over a ledge of rock and owing to the heaving of the ground with the frost, this pipe has broken or cracked and is leaking air, causing a lot of trouble. They would like to have authority to dig this pipe up and replace it with a copper one, or blast away the rock ledge.\n\nIt is hard to estimate this cost but presume it would be $50.00 to $100.00.\n\nThe Fire Escapes are all at the back of the building and close to the engine house, the most dangerous place and they would like to have two escapes erected at the front of the building or one at each side.\n\nSome of the telephone poles require renewing and they would like authority to do this.\n\nWe would suggest the school authorities be instructed to do this themselves.\n\nThe Principal would also like an amount set aside next Spring for Painting outside, and general repairs,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

T. Fife & Co., giving details of the work they agreed to carry out in supplying material and labour to replace equipment destroyed by fire, including a 2,000 gallon water tank, lights, plant, new equipment, etc. You should, also, forward the quotations of Fred Edmonds for rebuilding the walls and roof of the engine room, installing new windows, etc. Please obtain and forward these quotations at the earliest possible date, in order that payment of the accounts can be made before the end of March, next.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the water pipe from the lake; installing fire escapes at the front of the building or at each side; and replacing telegraph poles, I have to say that we will have no funds during the balance of the present fiscal year to authorize any of the above work. You should bring these matters to the attention of the Department in May, next, and, at that time, give full particulars regarding the work required, together with an estimate of the cost.

At that time you should investigate fully the request made by the Principal and advise the Department what work you consider should be done. You should, also, inspect the whole school and let us have a general report regarding present conditions under the management of the Acting Principal, Mr. F. A. Mayo. At the same time, you might advise whether or not it is likely that Rev. Mr. Marshall will be able to resume duties.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the following amounts are provided in the current year's appropriation for the Sioux Lockout Residential School:\n\n- Purchase of rake, seed drill, plough and cultivator - $500.\n- General repairs - $500.\n\nThe above items were requested in the Estimates and were included in our Appropriation. While it is not absolutely necessary that the money provided should be expended for the purposes mentioned in the Appropriation, at the same time you should keep in mind that it will not be possible to consider a total expenditure of more than $1,000. at the Sioux Lockout Residential School for repairs and equipment during the present fiscal year.\n\nWhen replying, you should return Mr. Mayo's letter.\n\nEncl. Yours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 28, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing communication received from the Acting Principal of the Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nInspector Hamilton is being instructed to visit this school in the near future and report regarding the Acting Principal's request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nApril 20, 1937.\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending you a list of requirements that are very necessary for our School this summer:\n\nFirst: The water line as I explained to you back in the winter has a leakage somewhere and we will have to dig it up to ascertain where the leakage is, that will involve a considerable amount of labour.\n\nWe had somewhat similar trouble about six years ago and found the breakage to be in one of the joints, caused through a pipe that was lying on a rock. Instead of the rock being blasted out when the line was put in, the pipe was bent over the rock which left it bearing hard on the rock. Although this is a way below the frost line I have been told by two different engineers that a pipe bearing hard on rock like that is very apt to break. Any way, there is a leakage and we are not able to get our water without priming the pipe every time we pump and sometimes that fails. We have been carrying on during the winter as best we could as it would have been double the work digging through frost.\n\nI would like the Department to give us a little help with the expense of this.\n\nI am also asking for engine and jump and connections that we could place over the top of the well and connect up to the present water line. It would give us an unlimited supply of water in case of fire as our tank, engine and pump are enclosed in the main building and if a fire occurred in the building like happened last fall we would have no provision at all to fight the fire.\n\nOf course the pump and engine would have to have a little house to enclose it over the well but would be always ready for emergencies.\nCaptain Edwards.\n\nIf the Department could allow us Five Hundred Dollars it would cover the expense of this as we should do most of the work ourselves.\n\nI hope you will see the necessity of giving us some further fire protection to what we have.\n\nSecondly: The fire escapes and roof on boiler room, hall and the kitchen. I pointed out to you in the winter the necessity of getting these roofs repaired. The water is coming through and destroying the lath and plaster, also the ceiling in places.\n\nWe have ten feet lying here to repair and fix these places. I have not attempted to do anything with that at present as the wet would destroy it.\n\nRemoving the fire escapes round to the front of the building, which was suggested by Dr. Westgate, who has written the Department on this matter. I had a man out here to give me a price on the cost of this and I feel sure that Two Hundred Dollars would cover these items.\n\nThirdly: The uptakes and pipes leading from boilers to the chimney will have to be renewed before next winter as they are burnt through in several places. The cost of these pipes will be Ninety Dollars.\n\nI would also like to get sufficient galvanized sheets to line the engine room and cover the boiler room ceiling. It was a metallic ceiling that saved the building from total destruction last fall.\n\nAs the funds were cut down to the minimum when repairs were done last fall, the lining of the engine room with metal was not able to be considered.\n\nSeventy-five Dollars would cover the cost of metal for that. We would put it on ourselves.\n\nFourthly: Our telephone line is down in several places, in fact, it needs new poles and re-stringing. Would the Department allow us One Hundred Dollars towards this expense?\nCaptain Edwards\n\nFifthly: I would like to call your attention to the outside condition of the building. The School has not been painted outside since 1929, therefore is very badly in need of paint for preservation. In a number of places, windows particularly, it is down to the bare wood. The amount allowed for painting the building in '29, that is, the School and all the out buildings, was Eight Hundred Dollars, Five Hundred Dollars for paint and Three Hundred Dollars for labour. Although there is a little extra work now I think that will very well cover the cost.\n\nI should very much like to purchase the paint from the Bradham-Henderson people again in Winnipeg, as we found their paint of first class quality. The labour can be obtained locally again.\n\nI should very much like to get an early reply as possible to these requirements as you know our season is very short here and we would like to be able to get right away to work at some of these things.\n\nI would also like to get permission from the Department to take down the old wooden gravity tank. It is a great eye-sore to us. It also spoils the yard for boys play ground.\n\nWould you kindly put these matters before the Department for consideration at your earliest convenience,\n\nand oblige,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFred A. Mayo,\n\nActing Principal.\n\nPAM/GED.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n536 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN., June 5th, 1937.\n\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School (C.E.)\nKenora Agency - Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested in Department letter 129-6-5, dated April 28th, I inspected the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School on May 26th, 1937.\n\nI found 92 pupils enrolled, 45 in the junior room and 47 in the senior room. Miss Dole is the teacher for the juniors and Miss Kilford for the seniors. I consider the class room work only fair; the reading could scarcely be heard and there was no expression. The children appeared indifferent and displayed lack of interest. Miss Kilford is only supplying and Miss Dole started her work last September; consequently neither of the teachers have had much chance to make a showing.\n\nThe children were clean, and both boys and girls had their hair neatly trimmed and combed. Their clothes and footwear appeared quite satisfactory.\n\nThe girls' dormitories were well aired, clean, and all beds neatly made. The row of posts supporting the roof on top of this dormitory were all loose. Apparently the lower floors have sunk and the roof is holding its original pitch. These posts should be tightened by means of blocks, and I am writing Mr. Mayo, instructing him to have this work done.\n\nThe boys' dormitories were both in good condition. The school was built for 130 pupils. Consequently with only 92, there is no overcrowding. One toilet bowl was\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nlooking at the connection and I pointed this out to the principal, requesting him to have it repaired at once.\n\nThe building throughout was clean, and the interior decoration in fair condition.\n\nThe boys' washroom needs V-joint in the lower part of the wall. These walls were originally plastered but the plaster is badly broken and V-joint would be more serviceable.\n\nThe roof leaks over the passage leading to the boiler room and this should be repaired at once. Mr. Mayo has wallboard with which to fix the walls. I am authorizing this very necessary repair.\n\nThe fire hose are in good repair and extinguishers and axes are located on each floor throughout the building. The fire escapes are on the back of the building, directly over the kitchen and boilers, and the inside stairs pass down along the same side of the building. A different arrangement is absolutely necessary. I consider the fire escapes should open directly off the dormitories and these could be located either at each end of the building or in front. A veranda across the front with sliding poles from one floor to the next would be ideal. I hesitate to make a definite recommendation until a new principal is appointed.\n\nThe water system now in use I consider good, but believe another tank is necessary, as well as the pump suggested by Mr. Mayo. The stand pipe leaked too badly to be of use and was too costly to heat during the winter.\n\nIt is necessary at once to repair the pipe line and I am writing asking Mr. Mayo to do this. The well needs some repairs and a new trap door should be provided and locked.\n\nAt present, a lid 24\" square is simply laid on top of the platform, which is not safe where little children are concerned. I am also writing regarding this matter.\nThe cattle number 32 head. I consider, at a school located such as this one is, that 15 milk cows would meet their requirements and that only two or three heifer calves should be raised. All the feed must be shipped in and I am sure it costs over $2,000 per year for feed, besides the full time services of a man. This is a bush country and even sufficient pasture is not available.\n\nThe cattle are in good condition and receive excellent care. This herd was tested some time back for Bang's disease but Mr. Marshall did not kill all the reactors. The inspector made a re-test this spring and insisted on the disposal of the two reactors and their offspring. Mr. Mayo has the four head isolated and will carry out instructions. I approve of having milk for the pupils but do not approve of expensive hobbies which the principals sometime acquire. A grade herd of 12 or 15 good milk cows is all that is needed and the young stock should not be raised because the purchase of feed makes this impossible. I am sure a 3 year old heifer, raised under present conditions, will cost three times the price of a good milking grade cow. A herdsman gives all his time in the care of this stock, which makes an added expense of at least $600.00 per year, and board. In a wooded country such as this, where all feed must be purchased and shipped in, only producing animals should be kept and the number should be reduced to the minimum.\n\nThe poultry house is used as a stock barn. I consider poultry a necessity and they certainly do not require grain in quantities to prohibit keeping a reasonable number. I think the Department should insist that certain stock and poultry be kept at each school and, if necessary limit the quantity.\nThe cultivated land does not exceed 18 acres. They have 4 good horses, a Fordson tractor, disc harrows, plough breaker and garden scuffler. I consider they have plenty of machinery for their cultivated land. There are no hay meadows, consequently there is no need for a mower or rake.\n\nThe telephone line needs repairing but there is staff enough at the school to do this work.\n\nThe building would be better for a coat of paint; but if the necessary program of work is carried out, there will be little, if any, money for the purchase of paint.\n\nThe staff at this school is the largest I have known, considering the number of pupils. Not counting Mr. Marshall, there are six men and, as pointed out above, the farm work is little more than gardening; outside of the cows and four horses there is no stock and all feed is purchased. There are eight lady members on the staff but I have no doubt they are kept busy.\n\nMr. Marshall, in my opinion, is still a very sick man and I doubt if he will again be able to do any work. He is confined to his bed, is very weak and has a trained nurse in constant attendance. Dr. Westgate is away and will not be back for a month. Before incurring any large expenditure, I would like to discuss matters with Dr. Westgate and learn his plans in connection with the principalship. A new principal will have his own ideas and by waiting we may save considerable expense. The work authorized should not cost more than $150.00. I will again write the Department after discussing the situation with Dr. Westgate.\n\nAttached is Mr. Mayo's letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

The material required to repair the roof was listed as follows -\n\n- 12 sheets galvanized iron\n- 12 metallic shingles\n- 6 metallic ceiling sheets\n- 4 lbs. solder\n- 5 gals. turpentine\n- 5 \" paint oil\n\nThe labour was to be supplied from the school staff.\n\nDr. Westgate has returned and strongly recommends the pump and engine suggested in the first paragraph of Mr. Mayo's letter to Agent Edwards, which letter the Department have on file. This outfit, Fairbanks Morse state, will cost $400.00 No.B, Winnipeg.\n\nI am enclosing a clipping of the unit. I agree that this extra pump is needed as at present the fire protection is indeed very weak.\n\nAnother pressure tank is needed and the Vulcan Iron Works state this will cost approximately $700.00 for 2,400 gals.

The veranda makes this system ideal. The veranda would cost approximately $500.00, which is very little more than would be required to change the present fire escapes. The school is willing to provide most of the labour for building the veranda.\n\nThe uptake and pipes from the boiler need renewing and this will cost approximately $100.00. These pipes are badly burned and must be renewed. I feel the following is necessary and would recommend that authority be granted for the work -\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Already authorized    | $100.00|\n| Pump and engine       | $400.00|\n| Tank, 2,400 gals.     | $700.00|\n| Boiler repairs        | $130.00|\n\nIf funds are available, the veranda should be erected as outlined and this would give adequate means for escape in case of fire.\n\nI realise only $1,000.00 is provided for repair at this school but I am convinced the work outlined should be carried out and, with freight charges, the total expense will no doubt reach $1600.00.\n\nThe telephone line has been repaired and I consider the painting can wait, although Dr. Westgate made a strong plea that a quantity be provided.\n\nI will be absent for almost a month and would ask that the Agent, Mr. Edwards, be instructed concerning the improvements recommended.\n\nMr. Mayo would like permission to remove the old stand pipe. It is now only an eye sore and the lumber...\ncould be used in building a pump house which will be required for housing the new pump unit. I would recommend that permission be granted to dismantle the stand pipe. I understand the necessary labour will be provided by the school.\n\nDr. Westgate assures me all reactors will be destroyed and the herd will be reduced to only sufficient to accommodate the school. The cost of feed makes it impossible to continue keeping the number now carried.\n\nI have received no definite commitment regarding Mr. Marshall's future but, as stated before, I doubt if he will recover sufficiently to again take charge of the school. Mr. Mayo is reliable and is doing good work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, July 28th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Hamilton has written to the Department with reference to repairs and improvements that you have requested at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. In forwarding this letter, Mr. Hamilton enclosed the attached page from a catalogue.\n\nPlease let me have as soon as possible full particulars regarding the engine required. You should state the horse power, number of gallons per hour, suction, etc., and, at the same time, you should return the attached.\n\nMr. Hamilton also mentioned that another pressure tank is needed. Please let me have definite information regarding this, stating the diameter and height. I understand from Mr. Hamilton's letter that you desire a tank with a capacity of 2,400 gallons.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. A.

Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours dated July 28th, I am sorry for this delay, I have not been at home and did not get your letter.\n\nWhat we need is a pump only, Typhoon type as #5 as on leaflet Gal per Hour 2500, Suction 2\" Discharge 2' and the necessary fittings to connect it to service line in the well. We have a six H.P. engine which we can use for the purpose which will save the Dept expense of engine.\n\nWe also badly need the extra pressure tank as our reserve supply from the one tank of three thousand gal is very small. We have room by pulling out a partition and a little alterations in the boiler and engine rooms. These alterations would not exceed an expense of $200, and the tank and connections. I can get a price for this expenditure from a local man who did our rebuilding last winter if you give me the permission, we should then be well equipped in case of fire with a water supply.\n\nI would also like to have the permission to dismantle the old building with wood tank as we should need the lumber for pump house over well and there would be then only a little iron to supply for roof which would not amount to more than $10.\n\nThe veranda as suggested by Mr Hamilton would also be the solution for the fire escapes and if you can grant the expenditure of the $500 to put the framework and roof and one floor this fall we should be very grateful as it would relieve our responsibility, the present fire escapes are of little or no use; an early reply to this would greatly oblige as the season is going very quickly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFred.

The overall length we have shown is the outside of the heads while the 7'0\" is shown as the inside diameter of the tank, making it 7'0-7/8\" outside, in order to suit standard dies for heads.\n\nOn checking over the capacity of the tank to the above sizes we note it will only hold 2300 U.S. gallons, while your order calls for 2400 gallon capacity, although you do not state whether you are figuring on Imperial or U.S. gallons. The measurement of 9'0\" would have to be over the shell in order to give 2400 Imperial gallons, and this would make the tank over 2 feet longer overall.\n\nKindly advise if sizes given on sketch, and position of connections are satisfactory.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFred A. Mayo, Esq.,\nActing Principal,\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter No. 129-6-5 dated October 7th and would state that I am not quite clear what total amount is allowed for this work.\n\nYou refer to my report dated July 15th. As pointed out, I already authorized the expenditure of $100.00. The balance required may reach the $1225.00 and I would like to know if the expenditure may be authorized providing this total amount is not exceeded.\n\nMr. Emonds will visit the school this week and submit his estimate in connection with the work.\n\nI realize only $1000.00 is allowed for repairs and I am not sure that more expenditure than the $100.00 authorized by me has not been incurred. I am sorry to trouble you further but feel I should be clear on the matter before committing the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of October 29 with reference to certain work required at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your letter of July 15 last you reported in part as follows:-\n\n\"The uptake and pipes from the boiler need renewing and this will cost approximately $100.00. These pipes are badly burned and must be renewed. I feel the following is necessary and would recommend that authority be granted for the work.\n\nAlready authorized, approx. $100.00\nPump and engine 400.00\nTank, 2,400 gals. approx. 700.00\nBoiler repairs 125.00\nTotal $1325.00\n\nIn order to secure the necessary information, it was found necessary to write the Principal for more details in connection with the pump engine and tank recommended in your letter. He replied by stating that the engine was not necessary, but gave full particulars regarding the pump and tank.\n\nAn order was therefore placed with the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works Limited and a copy of this is enclosed for your information.\n\n(you will note)\nYou will note that the cost of the equipment purchased by the Department is $1,007 and the addition of $100 already authorized by you makes a total expenditure of $1107; consequently, when the Department wrote you on October 7 we were under the impression that the additional expenditure required would be in the neighborhood of $200.\n\nWith this in mind, I feel that you will now be in a position to authorize the necessary alterations in the boiler and engine room, as we considered from your letter that the total cost of these would be approximately $200.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Our fire escapes are all on the rear of the building and down onto the boiler room and kitchen roofs and the same side of the building as the stairway. The most logical place to expect fire from would be the engine room, boiler room or kitchen and if such a thing as fire did occur, we should have no exit.\n\nDr. Westgate and Inspector Hamilton when down here last summer both recommended that fire escapes should be moved to the front of the building and suggested a verandah should be erected with sliding poles from each floor which would give exit from all dormitories and rooms.\n\nParticulars of same have been submitted to you for this year's consideration.\n\nI would like to remind you and call your attention to this and sincerely hope that in this year's appropriation you will be able to grant us this protection which would greatly relieve our anxiety and responsibility.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFred.

G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n629 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th regarding fire escapes, which was turned over to me by Mr. Mayo.\n\nEvidently the question of moving the fire escapes from the back of the building to the front of the buildings has been under discussion. It was first looked into as a matter at the time of our visit to Dr. Westgate's hut when we measured them we found there would be more than half of these stairways to be discarded. They do not come to the windows on the front the same as they do on the back. To stretch them out from the windows in the front would be a different angle from what they trend and as they are riveted to the side pieces it would take considerable labour to drill the holes by hand. The stretch on the girls' side is divided into five different pieces, two of them being short pieces coming to an opening in the middle of the stairway.\n\nThen again, the moving of these fire escapes to the front of the building would not overcome the greatest difficulty that we have to contend with, that is, ice and snow. In the winter time these fire escapes have always been nothing less than death traps owing to the fact that the building has no screen trough and that there is a continual drip from the roof onto the centre of the stairway of these fire escapes, making them very dangerous. We carry out the Department's instructions as well as we can in keeping the fire escapes free of snow and ice and we try to keep them free of ice all through the winter; but it is absolutely impossible. I have worked on these fire escapes myself together with boys and before we get down to the bottom the top part is lead again. Then there is the danger of the accumulation of ice on the roof sliding off when least expected. Now this accumulation is not just mere icicles but we have seen them fall during a blizzard as high as twelve to fifteen inches and in some cases these chunks have damaged the fire escapes and smashed in the doors so that I wish to bring before your attention the fact that removing them from the one part of the building to the other is only moving out of the frying pan into the fire.\n\nI, personally, have brought this matter before the different government inspectors who have visited the school from time to time. I have also submitted recommendations and prices for other types of fire escapes. I made a study of fire escape systems in the buildings in Winnipeg and Toronto, especially their schools and strongly recommended a spiral tank fire escape such as are in use in the Winnipeg Public Schools but the Department thought they were too expensive.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\nI understand that a recommendation was put in last year which I think would overcome a lot of our difficulty regarding fire escapes, that is building a verandah on the front of the school, giving exit from the dormitories and with a chute or stairway from floor to floor. The cost of such a verandah might be round about one thousand to twelve hundred dollars. I am just making a rough estimate as I have not obtained any prices on lumber for some time.\n\nThe main thing is to have doors opening out of the dormitories directly on whatever type of fire escape may be installed. The present type, which is on the back of the building only touches the two smallest dormitories and then you have to climb up out of a window and in one place over the top of a dwelling before reaching the fire escape itself. So I have always contended that so far as a help in case of fire they would only cause delay and waste of time. We are therefore depending entirely on our regular stairway as the chief exit in case of danger. So that I wish you will place your report before the Board next month and attention should be made or money expended on moving the present fire escapes from the back to the front of the building and I strongly recommend either the spiral tank or the verandah system of fire escape.\n\nI have just received my duties and find a number of important things need immediate attention. None of these matters were discussed with me during my illness and I have a great deal to read up to find out what has been going on.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\nJohn F. J. Marshall (signed)\n(Rev.) J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter dated March 2nd, I enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. Marshall, principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI submitted a report on June 5th, 1937, on this school and in the report pointed out the need for some immediate action in connection with the fire escapes. Mr. Marshall suggests the spiral tank type of fire escape or a verandah, as suggested in my report. I am of the opinion that the type of fire escape suggested would be very expensive and perhaps cost as much as it would to build the verandah. The verandah will serve two purposes - as a means of escape in case of fire and, if closed in, will help to make the main building warmer.\n\nIn discussing this with Mr. Maye some months ago, he was of the opinion that $600.00 would go a long way towards building the verandah and perhaps another year it could be completed and enclosed with storm sash, necessitating a further expense of approximately $500.00.\n\nThe school needs the best protection we can give, and I am convinced that the verandah would supply this protection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Night Watchman's Salary Cheque.\n\nI have been requested by the Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Winnipeg, to trace the Night Watchman's salary cheque for the amount of One Hundred and Twenty Dollars, ($120.00) for the months of October, November and December, 1937. This comes under letter from the Department No.129-3-6, Oct. 28, 1937.\n\nIt seems this cheque has not been received by the office in Winnipeg. I find on our files that the requisition for Night Watchman's salary for the quarter of October, November and December, 1937 was sent in with the quarterly returns on Jan. 13, 1938.\n\nI wrote to Capt. Edwards who gave me the following information: \"Our records show that voucher No. 6681 in the name of F.A.Mayo for One Hundred and Twenty Dollars, ($120.00) Night Watchman's allowance for the period of October, November and December, 1937 had been sent in from here on Jan. 14, 1938.\"\n\nThe Assistant Secretary Treasurer in a letter under date Sept.7,1938: \"Will you be good enough to take up the matter again with Captain Edwards and ascertain if he can find any record of voucher #6681 having actually been mailed to the school or to this office.\"\n\nI may say that we have no record of it being received in the school. Mr. Fred A. Mayo who was at the time acting principal during my illness said he had no further record of it.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you could let us know if this cheque has been issued. If it has been issued and returned to you please give us dates and the signature of who signed it.\n\nWe regret very much to have to bother you on this matter but the Auditors would like this cleared up before the end of this quarter.\nThe Secretary\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.)

He further advises that you have informed him that you issued Voucher 6661 and forwarded it to the Department on January 14 last.\n\nWe have checked all our records very closely and cannot find that this voucher reached us. I would, therefore, appreciate it if you would issue a new voucher and forward same in order that the amount due the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School, for the services of night watchman for the months of October, November and December, 1937, may be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I note that Indian Agent Edwards has informed you that he forwarded Voucher 2651. We have carefully checked our records and can find no trace of this voucher having reached this office. Under the circumstances I am requesting Indian Agent Edwards to issue another voucher and as soon as it is received a cheque will go forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Marshall,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nRiviere Lockout, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReference my letter to you of 30th ultimo, and your reply of the 3rd instant re boiler inspectors report on the boilers at your school.\n\nI took up the matter with the Department of Ottawa and their letter dated 8th inst., authorized me to arrange for a new uptake pipe between the boiler and the smoke stack of the heating boilers at your school.\n\nYou inform me in your letter that you are writing to the Fort Augustus Shipbuilding Company who built these boilers to ascertain the cost. As soon as you get this providing the cost is reasonable, you may order them, get the accounts in quadruplicate, certify each receipt, and forward to me for transmission to Ottawa for payment.\n\nI do not know why the Boiler Inspector missed getting in the need for water, burned out, he generally includes those in his reports. Let me know what these would cost and I will see if I can get them for you.\n\nAs regards the sewing machines, you say many of the stoves are almost ruined through same that the manufacturers advised a new wheel which would cost $200.00. If so, Toronto, and that you would dismantle the machine and install the new wheel without costs. I am communicating to Ottawa about this.\n\nLet me know what the Inspector suggested as safety devices in the laundry. He recommended certain precautions at the \"Glenmore,\" C. and \"Collin Jeffrey Schools,\" and those have been carried out.\n\nI say Fifo today and informed him Chymo had made the necessary repairs regarding the wiring, and that now everything is in first class order. Says the cost will be borne by his Company or Chymo. I will write Doctor \"regate\" to this effect.\n\nI am happy to inform you that Julia Land died at the Fort William Sanatorium the 6th instant; we could not get in touch with her mother so asked Inspectorium for her to be buried at Fort William. Agent Burrows having asked for us, we had not received your letter of the 3rd. We have orders for her to be buried at Fort William. She will be buried where other Indians are so no doubt her grandfather old Robert Land will be satisfied; will you write him and the mother, it might be better said from you. I had previously written the mother that Julia would likely come away very soon.\n\nSorry I have not been able to visit you lately but stress of work must be my excuse. This has been the busiest fall we have ever had, and the Indians have had a hard time to exist.\n\nWith kindest regards, and trusting your health is still improving.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\n12th September, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReference your letter #129-6-5 of 9th instant re replacement of uptakes for the boilers at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI trust you approve our purchasing these from the Fort Arthur Shipbuilding Company, as they originally supplied them, and know exactly what is required.\n\nAs regards grates for boiler, the replacement will cost $30.00, and I shall be glad to receive authority for this if approved.\n\nI should also like to know what you would like done as regards purchasing a new wheel for the washing machines at a cost of $32.00 and freight from Toronto.\n\nWaiting your early reply,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nSeptember 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant it is noted that you intend to secure the uptakes for the boilers at the Sioux Lookout Residential School from the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company who originally supplied these boilers.\n\nThe grates may be replaced at a cost of $30.00.\n\nYou may also purchase a new wheel for the washing machine at a cost of $28.00 plus freight from Toronto.

This is very necessary as the only loft floor we have is shiplap and it allows the dust and pieces of hay to fall through and it is very hard to keep the milk clean at milking time even if the cat walks across the floor. Estimated cost $500.00\n\n3. Lumber and material to seal in root house. This is a very necessary item and has been requested for years. I may say we have lost that amount in potatoes and vegetables being frozen in the course of the years since the root house was built. Estimated cost $400.00\n\n4. Cement and jip-rock to pack walls of engine room and place on the rafters to make engine room more fire proof. Estimated cost $400.00\n\n5. Fencing, wire. Estimated cost $350.00\n\n6. Purchase of remainder of lots #26, 27, 28, facing on the river, total acreage about 137 acres. This amount was withheld at the time the school was built until the decision of the Hydro Power was made.

The pump house being located so close to the water we also put up an eight inch cement foundation and fitted in rock to eighteen inches and put an entire cement floor in. This raising of the well and pump house, I believe, should take care of the rise of water caused by the extra heavy rains in the spring and the backing up of this lake on account of the dam at Bas Falls and flooding of LaSeul.\n\nWhen we dismantled the tower and tower tank we saved a considerable amount of lumber with which we were able to erect the pump house so that there was no extra expense caused for material other than the cement. We now have a pump house 12' x 12', with cement foundation and floor. Cement covered well and the two pressure tanks in full working order, so that I think our water supply should be adequate for our needs. The cement that we used I would like replaced later on as we had it on hand to complete the feed alleys in the barn but owing to the amount of work on hand at the present season we are unable to finish it. We used thirty-two bags of cement in all.\n\nThe pump and well caused us much delay as we were not able to complete it owing to the circumstances over which we had no control; that is, the extremely high water in this area. We had to get down a considerable distance below lake level to make the necessary connections which would have involved considerable expense in cribbing if we had not waited for the water to go down.\n\nI am enclosing copy of letter from Inspector Hamilton as no reference number is given.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nGR\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n539 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN., November 26th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 129-6-5 dated November 19th, and regret that unfortunately there has been some misunderstanding in connection with the expenditure authorized at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI was worried about this matter and on October 29th, 1937, I wrote the Department pointing out the amount already authorized, the balance required, and asking that I be advised what further expenditure might be incurred. The Department replied on November 10th, file 129-6-5, and would draw your attention to the following paragraph: \"Hon. A.A. quoted me that the total of $1107.00 had been expended and I gathered from the reading of the remainder of this letter that I was free to authorize a further expenditure of approximately $800.00; With this in mind, I wrote Mr. Mayo on December 3rd, 1937, pointing out that the work could be carried out and emphasizing the fact that the amount of $800.00 allowed must not be exceeded. A copy of this letter was attached to our letter to you, file 211-11 A, of December 3rd.\n\nIn this connection, I quote the following extract from a letter received from Mr. Mayo, dated November 30th, for your information -\n\n\"I have this day seen Mr. Otto and while he is quite willing to do this work, he does not care to quote a price for it so I have arranged with him to do our end and assist with the installing the tank and pump etc. at rate of $50.00 per month. I will find some labour to assist him from this end. I don't think I shall need to keep him much over the month. I will manage to get the iron for the boiler room and keep under the $200.00 you mention.\"\n\nThe Department will note that Mr. Mayo thoroughly understood what work was to be carried out and that this work did not include the dismantling and taking down of the tower. It was quite clear from my letters that approximately $800.00 was to be used to install the equipment and the balance to put the metal ceiling on the boiler room. I suggested in the letter that if\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe money authorized were not sufficient, he could perhaps arrange for the labour from his own staff.\n\nThe Department will note from the closing sentence of the extract quoted from Mr. Mayo's letter, that it was his intention to get the lumber for the roof of the boiler house before purchasing this was purchased and put on, as well as the pipe and pump installed. Apparently Mr. Mayo has spread the amount of money further than anticipated as some was used in dismantling the tower. I do not think he should be seriously criticised for this. The small amount of money paid in wages would not likely have purchased the lumber required for the pump house.\n\nI understand that all authorities terminated at the end of the fiscal year and I figured this matter was satisfactorily closed at that time. I am returning the voucher and trust that the explanation given meets your approval and that funds are available to make the necessary payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Inspector Hamilton's report on the Sioux Lookout Indian residential school visited on June 2, 1939.\n\nThe proposed veranda across the front, to be used as a means of fire escape, is under construction. Mr. Marshall states it will yet require about $600.00 for material and $100.00 for labour. I consider both figures quite conservative, especially as regards to labour. In fact, Mr. Marshall is prepared to do most of the labour except for certain finishing work which requires first class carpenters. This veranda is most urgently needed as a fire escape and indeed is perhaps the cheapest, of a suitable kind, that can be constructed. I trust funds are available to complete this work.\n\nThe barn is in good repair but Mr. Marshall would like lumber to refloor the upstairs of the barn. The present floor has dried out, allowing all kinds of dust and dirt to filter through. A second floor, with paper between, would prevent this and make the stable much warmer for the cows during the winter months.\n\n(Sgd.) A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa,\nJune 20, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your report of the 2nd instant on your inspection of the Sioux Lookout Indian residential school. In this report you mention that the verandah across the front of the building is under construction and that the Principal estimates that an expenditure of approximately $700.00 for material and labour will be required to complete it.\n\nIn reviewing our files I find that the last communication we received with regard to the erection of this verandah was your letter of May 16, 1938. At that time we supplied cement, galvanized iron, nails and lumber. No subsequent request for additional material has been received from the Principal.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an amount of $500.00 only for repairs and improvements at the Sioux Lookout school. Owing to the present setup of our appropriation it is practically impossible to exceed this amount.\n\nPlease communicate with the Reverend Principal and let me have requisitions covering the material which you consider should be supplied, it being understood, of course, that the cost of the material requested will not exceed $500.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached account has just been received from Indian Agent Swartman. No authority was requested or given for the expenditure and you should, therefore, point out to Mr. Swartman that before expenditures are incurred it is necessary to secure the Department's authority.\n\nIn official letter of the 28th ultimo you were informed regarding the amount available in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Sioux Lookout school. As far as I am aware the Department did not purchase the tractor and consequently it is practically impossible for us to consider expending any money on repairs. I should appreciate your communicating with Mr. Swartman in connection with this voucher and advising me what portion, if any, of it should be considered as a fair charge against our appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nReference is made to your letter of the 9th August, file 213-11A, relative to Voucher No. 118 covering repairs to the tractor and water systems at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThese were both emergency repair jobs which occurred before the undersigned took office as Indian Agent at Sioux Lookout. However, since the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School is now in the Sioux Lookout Agency the accounts have been certified and forwarded for attention in the usual manner.\n\nRev. Marshall of the Sioux Lookout School informs us that as both these repair jobs were urgently necessary when the break-downs occurred and as the Department had assumed responsibility for a previous repair on the water system he went ahead and had the work done, feeling that same would meet with the Department's approval.\n\nHe states that likewise, the Department had assumed the responsibility for the costs in regard to a previous major break-down of the tractor and as same was being used continuously for cutting furnace wood for heating operations - this occurred last winter - that no objection would be raised to his proceeding with the repairs at once.\n\nMr. Marshall states that he informed Mr. Indian Agent Frank Edwards as to the steps he had taken and that no doubt if the change in Agencies had not occurred just at this time, authority would have been obtained for the expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) C. Swartman\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n53rd Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 129-6-5, dated July 31st, I am returning the voucher together with a letter of explanation from Mr. Swartman, and I would draw your attention to the closing paragraph of his letter. It is possible Agent Edwards overlooked this matter if it occurred about the time of the transfer.\n\nYou will also note it is stated that repairs of this nature have been paid in the past and if this is true, and the case urgent as stated by Mr. Marshall, I think the matter should be favourably considered. In any event there should be no question as to the repairs needed to the water system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo together with copy of letter received from Indian Agent Swartman regarding voucher 118 for $156.32 issued in favour of the Sioux Lookout Indian residential school.\n\nWhile it is no doubt true that in the past the Department has paid for repairs to the tractor, at the same time I would point out that this equipment was not purchased by us and present regulations do not permit our expending money for repairs to equipment purchased by the school authorities.\n\nWe are, however, prepared to pay the amount of $14.79 covering the cost of repairs to the hot water system. I return the voucher which was enclosed with your letter in order that you may prepare a new voucher for the amount of $14.79.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the snow will soon be gone work should be commenced on the\nfront verandah and fire escape to try and bring it to completion.\nWhen we stopped on it last November we found we had to use more\nof the galvanized iron slipped up under the main shingles of\nthe roof so that we could not complete covering the roof of the\nverandah and we are short twenty pieces as follows:\n\n14 pieces 8 foot length\n6 pieces 6 foot length.\n\nWe would like very much if the Department would sanction the\npurchase of this as soon as possible. We can put it on and that\nwill get the work covered in.\n\nWe have built as far as we can with what labour we have and have\nnow come to the place where we need a first class carpenter to\ndo the finishing work. The re-adjustment of radiators which are\nunder the present windows and piping can be done by our own\nengineer. The window spaces have to be cut down and made in to\ndoor frames and that is a ticklish proposition in itself as well\nas putting down the top floor and the trimming of the outside\nverandah fire escape. There are also two sets of stairs to be\nbuilt so you can see that this will require more than a jack knife\ncarpenter. We would like to be able to engage one by day labour.\nThe school can provide him with board and room and render what\never helpers assistance is required. A good carpenter could be\nobtained locally as there are several of them in Sioux Lookout.\n\nGalvanized iron can be obtained from the J.H. Ashdown Co. Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, who supplied the last lot. Estimated cost about\nTwenty-Five Dollars.\n\nGalvanized iron shipped flat: 14 sheets 96\"x30\" 28 gauge\n6 sheets 72\"x30\" 28 gauge\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAm enclosing list of material necessary to complete the verandah. All lumber on hand has been checked up by Mr. Harju, the carpenter, and together we have gone over the things that will be required to finish the job. I may say we have kept our nose down so far as we could, and the carpenter went out put up the frame work and laid the biggest part of the sub floor. We also used bridge timbers which we got from the Canadian National when they were replacing their bridge at the Fourth Mile. This meant buying four lengths of 12 x 12, 30' longs and 5 1/2 x 10, 12' longs. We also used on the sub floor some of the material that was saved out of the tank when it was taken down. We are assisting the carpenter in every way possible, keeping the lumber at his hand and putting one of the men on to help him when he needs extra help in putting on long boards.\n\nYou will also note that in all the material so far there has been no request for nails as we have supplied them out of school funds.\n\nThere should be a certain amount of paint procured and would suggest that we buy white lead, oil and turpentine and we can add the color to it ourselves. Mr. McLaughlin our Nightwatchman and gardener is a painter by trade and he would be delighted to be willing to brush for a short time. Even one hour could help preserve the lumber and keep it from cracking.\n\nPaint I have taken this matter up with Mr. Harju and Mr. McLaughlin, they are both of the opinion that about\n\n100 lbs white lead\n20 gals. raw linseed oil\n5 gals. turpentine\n\nwould be sufficient to give the work a priming coat and one covering coat. I haven't any prices on paint or oils as these fluctuate with the market.\n\nAs regards the railing for the top that we were speaking of using 3/8\" iron pipe. This would take 150 lin. ft. 3/8\" galvanized iron pipe together with the necessary fittings.\n\nI am also enclosing list of material and necessary hardware.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Rev.)

Marshall,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to your order of material supplied for repairs to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School on purchase order #129-6-5, order $3200, material supplied by Geo. Farlinger, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nThis material arrived here last night about seven o'clock and on checking it over this morning with the carpenter we find that there is only about two or three items that will be usable to complete our present job. On the bill of material sent in to the Indian Office at Sioux Lookout we had on it \"Note - All the above material to be in clear B.C. Fir,\" and as for Hardware \"All above in antique copper.\" The lumber is the commonest spruce, some of it not even planed. I asked Indian Agent Swartman when he was out here when we checked up on what would be needed to complete the work if he would suggest to you the advisability of purchasing this small order from the Beaver Lumber Company who had supplied the finishing material so that we would be sure to have all the different sizes and types of wood match. Now most of this material is for two stairways and steps at the front of the school and needs clear B.C. fir.\n\nThe stairway material which consists of:\n\n- 22 pcs. 2x6 - 10 No. 1 Com. fir,\n- 3 pcs. 2x12 - 12 No. 1 Com. Fir.\n- 4 pcs. 2x10 - 16 No. 1 Com. fir.\n- 6 pcs. 2x4 - 16 No. 1 Com. fir.\n\nThis is nothing more than common spruce and jack pine. The 1100 Lin. feet of 2x2 spruce is just 2x4 scantling re-sawn and not even planed. This material had been asked for in fir as it is to be made up into the spindles on the stairs, the 350 of 2x2 quarter round is also spruce.\nThe Secretary,\n\nThe Hardware: The hinges are just the common iron hinges and the mortise locks are plain brass. We asked for all these to be in antique copper so as to match up the different rooms in which they are to be placed.\n\nWould it not be possible to have these things exchanged for what is called for on our bill by returning the material that is of no use to us to Geo. Farlinger and getting the correct material from the Beaver Lumber Company.\n\nWe are awaiting your early reply as this is going to hold up the work by the end of the week.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Re:) J.F.J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nAugust 23, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copy of a letter received by this branch from Rev. J.F.J. Marshall, Principal of the Sioux Lookout Residential School. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nYou will note that the Principal is anxious to know if it would be possible to have this lumber exchanged for what is called for on his original requisition. Inasmuch as it is desirable to complete this repair work prior to the opening of the school your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nR.A. HOEY,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised that the building material delivered to the school site, Pelican, Ont., is unsatisfactory, particularly the first four items calling for #1 Common fir, - for which I am informed that you supplied \"common spruce and jack pine\".\n\nThis is most unfortunate, as we had planned to use the material immediately before the re-opening of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School at Pelican, Ont. The delay in arranging to supply the grade of lumber required will result in considerable inconvenience.\n\nIf you were in doubt as to the exact grade of material specified, - we suggest that as indicated on our request for quotation, it was advisable for you to communicate with Indian Agent Swartman, Sioux Lookout, Ont., and to secure any needed information from him.\n\nI trust, however, that we may expect your fullest cooperation in replacing the lumber delivered with the grade specified in your tender, and on our purchase order, and in supplying the balance of the order to the satisfaction of Indian Agent Swartman. Please advise by return mail as to what you are prepared to do in the matter, and as to what extra charge you will make to supply the exact grade of material required by Mr. Swartman.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

J.F.J. Marshall's letter of the 21st instant had been included in the requisition we received from your office:\n\n(a) \"Note - All the above material to be in clear B.C.

No grade was specified. Beaver Lumber Company's quotation was on 2\"x2\" Spruce. There was no mention on the requisition of the old copper finish for the lock sets, transom catches or other hardware.\n\nIn sending out the requests for quotation we used the description given on the requisition, and the order was awarded on the basis of the tenders received to the firm submitting the lower quotation. Under the circumstances, there...\nthere are difficulties involved in cancelling the order, and before considering such action, I wish to ascertain what steps Mr. Farlinger proposes to take to adjust matters.\n\nW.

J. F. J. Marshall, Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School that he found it necessary some time ago to purchase 2000 lineal feet of 1 x 6 Spruce Drop Siding, at a cost of $46.70 from the Beaver Lumber Company at Sioux Lookout in order to keep the work moving and not hold up the carpenter due to lack of material.\n\nA requisition covering this delivery is attached.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGifford Stewartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\n/R\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Verandah\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nReference is made to Rev. J. F. J. Marshall's letter to the Secretary dated August 21st, concerning material supplied for building the combination verandah and fire-escape at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Marshall states that he asked the undersigned to suggest to the Purchasing Board that the material be supplied by the Beaver Lumber Company. This is quite correct but I did not consider it was within my province to do so as I understood tenders would be called - although possibly I should have pointed out that the Beaver Lumber Company had already supplied some materials used in another part of the job. In order to use the material already used and avoid a patchy looking effect it is only logical B. C. fir be supplied and I would suggest that arrangements be made to return the lumber that is unsuitable to the G. E. Farlinger Lumber Company.\n\nOur Requisition No. 51, dated July 17th, specified hardware in 'Antique Copper' in order to conform with the hardware already installed throughout the balance of this building. This is another point Mr. Marshall has called to our attention.\n\nPlease let us have your comments as to the possibility of having this material supplied as requested by the Reverend Mr. Marshall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nPATRICIA LUMBER COMPANY LIMITED\n\nSIUS LOOKOUT, Sept. 5th, 1940.\n\nMr. W.

Referring to material for Indian School Site, Pelican, Ont.\n\nThe first four items as referred to in your letter was not supplied in spruce and jack pine. It was supplied in clear norway pine, which is the best grade of lumber manufactured in Canada. We supplied this in clear norway as we do not stock the lumber that was ordered, which was no 1 common fir, which is a very much inferior grade of lumber than the norway pine shipped.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 24th inst., we shipped the day this letter was received the first four items on your order the quantities specified in No. 1 B.C. Fir, and the manager at the Indian School sent it back with the boat by which it was sent and the norway pine shipped at first was also returned. We had to secure this No. 1 B.C. Fir from another dealer, wishing to satisfy.\n\nI enclose account for order No. 3200 deleting the first four items of order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) G. E. Farlinger.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Farlinger, Patricia Lumber Company, Sioux Lookout, Ont., will you please advise if the building material listed on the attached invoices is satisfactory to Mr. Swartman.\n\nI interpret Mr. Farlinger's letter to mean that he has supplied all except the first four items of Purchase Order #3200, as these are not included in the account. If Mr. Farlinger will not supply these four items in a satisfactory grade, kindly arrange to have Indian Agent Swartman procure same from the Beaver Lumber Company, Sioux Lookout, Ont., or elsewhere, and advise this office of the action taken by Mr. Swartman to complete delivery.\n\nW.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn my way back to Winnipeg from Ottawa, I visited our Sioux Lockout School, not knowing until I arrived that about forty of the children were afflicted with measles. I was informed that they brought the disease with them when returning from their summer vacation, and that it was now reported to be widespread in the semi-remote Indian settlements from which they came. As there were approximately one hundred children in the School, with prospects that all would gradually be afflicted, we sent a nurse to assist the one on the staff in looking after them. Under the circumstances you will readily understand that other children cannot be admitted until those who are ill have recovered.\n\nMr. Marshall, the Principal, was not quite so well as he had been for the past year or two, having sustained some injury to his back when the School motor-boat he was driving collided in the darkness with a canoe operated by a man and his wife who were visitors in that part. The School boat had \"navigation\" lights burning, but there was no light on the canoe, and had it not been that Mr. Marshall was running at a very moderate rate, the results might have been much more serious than they were. Just before the collision, the man and woman in the canoe stood up, with the result that the woman was thrown into the water. She was rescued, however, by Mr. Marshall, but when he managed to get her over the side of his boat she fell against him, causing him to strike his back against part of the boat's furnishings. Mr. Marshall was able to move about at the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\ntime of my visit, and as he has a very capable staff, no department of the work is being neglected.\n\nThere are two important requirements at this School to which I feel it my duty to refer, namely,\n\n(1) Paint for all buildings. As they have not been painted, so far as I know, since they were built, I will include this item in the list of our requirements for next year.\n\n(2) The new verandah is nearing completion, and I found the materials and workmanship to be of first rate quality. It did seem to me to be a great pity that no provision was made for glazing the spaces between the supporting pillars. This action is strongly recommended by the Principal, and also by the carpenter foreman, partly as a means of preventing rain and snow from beating in, with injurious effects on the material fabric, and partly as a means of increasing the comfort and usefulness of the verandah space itself.\n\nThe nearest estimate of the cost of glazing the nine large spaces, with three window sash in each, two of the same to be on pulleys, was $200.00 (it would be somewhat more if the carpenter had to come back again at a later date to do the work instead of finishing it off now), and I am wondering if this sum could be secured from any unexpended balance you may have in connexion with any of our other schools.\n\nAs the Principal informed me that he had secured without cost to your Department $125.00 worth of material used in building the verandah, I greatly hope you may be able to authorize the glazing suggested. Should the cost exceed the $200.00 estimated, our Commission will agree to find the balance. Immediate action will be necessary if the work is to be done before the men now building the verandah leave the School.\n\nI greatly appreciated the opportunity afforded me during my recent visit to Ottawa of discussing together some of the problems of the Indian educational work, and I am more convinced than ever that this work, with all its difficulties, is well worthwhile. The development and strengthening of the physical, intellectual and moral fibre of the Indian segment of our country's population, must surely help to strengthen the position of our country as a whole.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the time of my recent visit to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School on November 16th fire drills were carried out which proved to be quite satisfactory. From the time the alarm sounded when the children were in their class rooms they were all outside in two minutes. This was a surprise alarm. The practice drills were then repeated with the children in the dormitories in order to demonstrate the value of the new verandah fire-escape. This was also highly satisfactory. The children were all out of the building in less than three minutes. The verandah appears to be a very valuable addition insofar as fire escape is concerned as well as adding to the appearance of the building.\n\nA few discrepancies were noted in the fire protection system but these could be remedied at no great cost. These are listed as follows:\n\n(1) There are no bells in the dormitories. The bells are in the corridors and are scarcely audible in the dormitories with the doors closed.\n\nOn the girls' side of the building there is only one bell on the first floor in the corridor and none on the top floor at all, although it has been wired for a bell. For some reason the bell has never been installed. I would recommend that an electric bell be placed in each of these dormitories in addition to the existing bells in the halls.\n\nThe bells should be screened with heavy mesh wire to prevent the children from molesting them.\n\n(2) There are no bells in the laundry, boiler-room, engine-room, dining-room nor in the connecting basement halls and with the machinery in operation it is almost impossible to hear the alarm from the floors above. It is recommended that a double bell be installed in the basement, one above the door in the engine-room - which would serve both engine-room and boiler-room. A second bell of the same type should be placed above the door in the laundry - which would serve the laundry as well as the laundry kitchen hall.\n\n(3) Extra fire hose - 1\u00bd inch - should be readily available at all times. All the fire hose is now on the racks and is in fair condition but there is no spare hose. At least 500 feet should be available as extra hose.\n\n(4) Additional ....\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n(4) Additional 'Foamite' Fire Extinguisher refills are required. Two dozen new ones should be on hand.\n\nIt was also noted that the short rubber hose on most of these chemical fire extinguishers was brittle and could be broken by a pull or twist. These hose should be replaced.\n\nA requisition listing the necessary requirements and replacements is attached hereto.\n\nIn addition to the equipment it is estimated that an expenditure of approximately $12.00 would be required for electrician's wages to complete installation of fire bells and additional wiring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nNov. 15th 1940\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO The Principal, Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\n\nPelican - Mile 5 west of Sioux Lookout.

You enclosed a requisition for 6 fire alarm gongs 6\", 2 double gongs 4\" and 400' of covered electrical wire. On obtaining prices from different firms it was found that these will cost in the vicinity of $300.00. This appears to be a rather heavy expenditure, especially in view of your statement that the system could be remedied at no great cost. Possibly you had in mind a cheaper type of bell from that included on the requisition and on which we have obtained quotations. Please let me hear further from you in regard to this matter.\n\nWould it not be possible to install a siren alarm on the steam boiler? This could be done at very reasonable cost and when in operation should rouse everyone in the school.\n\nThe recharges for the fire extinguishers at present in the school have already been ordered and arrangements are also being made to secure the fire hose, nozzles, spanners and fire axes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nThe Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in urgent need of the hose replacements which were placed on order on Nov. 9, 1940.\n\nFor your information I may say that when we have a fire drill the basement hose is run out and turned on, thus enabling us to test the hoses. The hose is then dried and put on the rack on the top floor, thus the hose from upstairs work down to the basement and they all get their turn in testing.\n\nDuring the last fire drill the hose on the basement rack was taken out and we found that it had to be condemned as there were too many holes in the hose.\n\nI am giving you this information to notify you that we are minus one hose on our racks in the school building proper and request that the order be rushed through as soon as possible as this leaves us in a very precarious position.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this very important matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeo. L. Marshall,\nActing Principal.\n\nSioux Lookout\nJAN 18 1941\nIndian Agency\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter received today from the Sioux Lockout Indian Residential School advising us that the hose on one of the racks has become unserviceable.\n\n600 feet of hose was listed on our requisition No. 39 of November 15th, 1940, which will rectify the matter when received.\n\nIn the meantime, in order to give the School adequate protection in this respect we have arranged to secure 300 feet of hose on loan from the Ontario Forestry Branch. This will be delivered to the School Monday, January 20th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Hoey's letter of January 16th, file 129-6-5, with respect to fire alarm equipment recommended for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. My letter of November 14, 1940, to which you refer was written from notes made at the time I was making the inspection but it was not anticipated that eight electric bells or gongs with the necessary wiring would cost $300.00. Would it be possible to have substitutions made that would bring the cost of these installations down to the neighborhood of $100.00? The description furnished was from an old General Electric catalogue with no prices shown - the only one available - and a notation \"or similar\" was made.\n\nThe matter of installing a siren alarm will be investigated upon my next visit to the school and a report furnished on the subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGifford Gowanlock\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther reference is made to Mr. Hoey's letter of January 16th, file 129-6-5, with reference to the fire alarm system at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI have taken this matter up with the Acting Principal and learn that the steam boilers only carry a pressure of two pounds and are not in use from May to September. The compressed air water tank has a maximum pressure of 75 pounds but as the water is used the pressure drops and since the pump is not working all the time it is doubtful if a siren would be satisfactory or reliable if attached to the compressed air tank. These facts would seem to preclude the use of the steam boiler and compressed air tank unless there is a type of siren alarm that could be adopted to operate from such a low pressure.\n\nAs previously pointed out, there is only one gong installed on the girls' side of the building, although on the top floor on the girls' side there are wires for a gong which has never been installed. When a fire alarm sounds it is necessary for the staff members to go around to each bed in order to wake the children up\u2014which requires a great deal of extra time. It has been brought to my attention that it takes the girls twice as long to get out of the building as it does the boys during a night fire drill although during day drills the girls are often out sooner than the boys.\n\nIn order to remedy the situation I would suggest that one gong could be installed on the top floor attached to the existing wires. This would help considerably and there should be no additional costs. This would not complete the fire alarm system but would go a long way toward improving it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGifford Swireman,\nIndian Agent,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo with further reference to the fire alarm system at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nProvided the cost will not exceed $50.00 you may arrange for the installation of one or more gongs on the top floor of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A Sill has to be built in to the eaves. This winter we have kept the roof well shovelled off to prevent the water dripping in to the verandah on mild days. This would be impossible to prevent during rain storms.\n\n\"2. The windows were set in in a hurry in the Fall to save the verandah from damage by snow and bad weather. It was very late in the fall when Mr. Harju put in the windows and it was impossible for him to continue owing to the lateness of the season. If it is at all possible we would like this work completed.\n\nThe School will be able to supply the necessary material for finishing this work if the Department supply us with the Carpenter. We do not want to use unskilled labor on such a good piece of work - therefore, we would like to get Mr. Harju back to complete the job.\"\n\nIt is recommended that we be authorized to engage the services of a carpenter for this work - which should be done during the next month or six weeks - before the spring rains commence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is understood that Mr. Harju will be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring your visits to the School you have observed from time to time how the outside of the main school building is deteriorating from lack of paint. In our Estimates for 1941 we asked for paint for the main school building. For your information the school was last painted in 1929 and for the last eight years we have been estimating for paint for the school. However, nothing has been done in this connection to date.\n\nThe last few winters the school has been very difficult to heat, especially the north side while a north wind is blowing. At times we have had to move children from the classroom to one of the other back rooms and have also had to utilize the Chapel in this connection.\n\nA great many of the boards on the outside of the building have no paint on at all and they are warping. There is also considerable space between them, so much so that in places the builders paper between the siding has also become dilapidated by the weather. If the building is left in this condition it is going to cost more as each year goes by.\n\nYou will remember from our last conversation regarding paint on the school that we thought it would be unwise to re-paint it as the boards will all have to be scraped and a large number replaced. This would take considerable time and labour. Instead we thought it might be better to Insul-Brick the building.\n\nSince then I have taken the liberty of calling on Mr. Josgrove, Manager of the Beaver Lumber Company who very kindly came out and measured up the building and gave us an estimate of the cost of Insul-Bricking the main school building.\nMr. G. Swartman,\n\nThe total estimated cost, including labour and material will be One Thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, ($1750.00). Of this Fifteen Hundred Dollars would be for material and the balance for labour. The Insul-Briak, as you know, is fire-proof and has an insulating value. I believe in the long run this would be the most economical and should be able to stand up for a good many years.\n\nShould the Department see their way clear to complete this work I think it would be a great improvement in the appearance of the building. It would be more especially appreciated now by all concerned as you are aware the road is now completed from Sioux Lookout to the Trans Canada Highway and the last few summers we have had a large number of American Tourists coming out to go through the building and it is certainly most unsightly for our Southern visitors to see and take back a report such as they might with the School in its present condition.\n\nWe realize the handicap the Department is placed under owing to the present conflict, however, we think if it is at all possible this should be done now.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeo. L. Marshall,\nActing Principal.\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nApril 12, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached please find copy of letter received from the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, requesting that steps be taken to have the outside of the school covered with Insul Brick siding.\n\nOwing to the present condition of the exterior of the building, I would recommend that something be done in this direction during the coming summer. It is realized at this time that no unnecessary expenditure should be made, but I believe a saving would be accomplished if an Insul Brick siding was applied.\n\nThe present siding (6\" drop) has shrunk and warped to such an extent in some places that there is a space of half an inch or more between the boards - which has allowed moisture to get in and has started to rot the boards.\n\nThe other alternative would be to paint the building but the necessary preparation - inserting new pieces of siding scraping and painting the weathered boards - would make the cost of the job out of all proportion to what would actually be accomplished.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGifford S.

It would appear, however, very desirable to undertake such repair work and this re-siding, in the judgment of the Department, would contribute substantially to the durability and general appearance of the school building.\n\nWe have in the estimates of this year two items -- $500.00 for the construction of a root house and $300.00 for painting. I am anxious to know if the Acting Principal would be prepared to abandon the construction of the root house for this year. If he were prepared to do this, and also to contribute $300.00 from school funds, it might be possible to proceed with the re-siding of the building. You might, at your convenience, discuss this matter with him again and send forward any recommendations you may care to offer, keeping in mind the limited funds at our disposal. This amount, I should add, cannot be exceeded in view of the critical times in which we find ourselves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G. Smartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nR.A.

Additional amounts were included for other items, but in view of the addition of the outside walls of the main school building and in view of the difficulty caused by wet conditions of securing all the funds required for Indian educational work; our Commission keenly desire that precedence be given to the question of saving the walls of the main building from further deterioration. The completion of the root house and other requirements may be allowed to stand over for another year.\n\nFrom information received from Mr. G.L. Marshall, Acting Principal of this School, it appears that during the last few winters the School management has had considerable difficulty in heating the building, especially along the north side when a north wind is blowing. He states that at times it had been necessary to move the children from the classroom on that side to one of the other back rooms and that the Chapel had also been used for classroom purposes.\n\nAs the School has not been painted for twelve years, he states that many of the boards on the outside of the building have no paint at all and have warped so much that there is a considerable space between them, leaving the builder's paper exposed to the weather.\nFrom communications received from Mr. Marshall, I gather that he has talked the situation over very carefully with Mr. Indian Agent Swartman, with the result that they consider it would be a waste of money to attempt to re-paint the building. They recommend that it be Insul-bricked instead and have estimated the total cost including labour and material at $1,750. Of this amount approximately $1500. would be required for material.\n\nIn support of their recommendation they point out that Insul-bricking is not only fire-proof but has, as its name implies, an A1 insulating value as well. Our Commission have approved this recommendation and strongly recommend that action be taken immediately. Should your Department agree to this expenditure, our Commission, in view of the urgency and importance of the need, would be willing to contribute should any contribution be necessary, the sum of $200. to help to meet the total cost.\n\nShould you agree to the work being undertaken at once, I will be obliged if you will notify your representative and Mr. Marshall accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW/KH\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to Mr. Henry's letter, File 129-6-5 of April 17th with respect to re-siding the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School with Insul Brick, I wish to advise that the Secretary of the Commission, Dr. Westgate agreed to meet two hundred dollars ($200.00) of the cost. His letter to the Acting Principal was dated April 28th.\n\nThe Acting Principal informs me he would be prepared to abandon the construction of the root house if the funds could be applied for the purpose under discussion.\n\nThe following is an approximate list of the main items and quantities that would be required for the job:\n\n- Insul Brick siding #1329 Jasper Blend (Sample enclosed) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 135 squares\n- Insul Brick cement \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4 gals.\n- Insul Brick armoured corner \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 700 lin. ft.\n- Copper nails \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 150 lbs.\n\nIt is estimated that three hours labour are required to apply each square which would bring the cost of labour to approximately $325.00, unless the job was contracted. There is material at the school for scaffolding and very little if any would have to be purchased.\n\nIn view of the opinion that the total cost would be more than the available funds I would suggest that for this year we arrange to have the material applied to the North and South sides (back and front) of the building only. The present siding material on the ends, east and west, is in better condition than the facing north and south. Funds could be raised to supply material for these surfaces separately, as well as for the whole. It would of course be necessary to have assurance that the material used would be available for another year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nMay 1, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 78 Allotment: 10-691\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. G.

It was reported to us by the Indian Agent and the Principal that the school is deteriorating from the lack of paint. A great many of the boards on the outside of the building have no paint on at all and are warping. In view of this condition it is believed that it would be unwise to repaint it as the boards would all have to be scraped and a large number replaced. This would take considerable time and labour. The cost of painting the building would be between $500.00 and $1000.00 and in a few years' time it would have to be repainted. Instead it was recommended that it would be preferable to insul brick the building.\n\nThe total expenditure involved would be the cost of the material plus $325.00 for labour. Toward the latter item the school management is prepared to pay $200.00.\n\nBy placing insul brick on the building its condition will be greatly improved and painting in future will be unnecessary. In view of the above I recommend the purchase of insul brick.\n\nR.A.

It has been exceedingly difficult to secure the services of a carpenter locally to quote a price on the work. Mr. O.A. Hardju, whom we had previously engaged is no longer available.\n\nMr. Wisenberg, a local carpenter has sized up the job and states he would not be willing to contract for the work but would take it on an hourly basis at .75\u00a2 per hour. He estimates it would require four men working approximately six weeks to complete the job.\n\nWe also had Mr. Preiss of Hudson, Ont., who is a carpenter and builder estimate on the work. He quotes $825.00 to complete the job. He could commence immediately but Mr. Wisenberg informs us he would be unable to undertake the work before the middle of August.\n\nI am not familiar with the work nor the ability of Mr. Preiss. Wisenberg has the reputation of being a first class carpenter and has had considerable experience with this type of work.\n\nBoth Wisenberg and Preiss strongly recommend that Insul-Bric mould be used around the windows and doors instead of the present casings. They claim that such a heavy wooden casing would detract from the whole appearance of the insul-bric. Approximately 2000 ft. of mould would be required. This retails locally at .42\u00a2 per foot. In lots of 100 or more we could purchase same for .33\u00a2 per foot. I am also informed that no labour costs would be saved by using the old casing material.\n\nPlease let me have your advice regarding the foregoing at your earliest convenience in order that we may get the work under way before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the installation of the Art-Bric siding on the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the cost of the labour will be at least $825. In your letter of April 25, last, you stated that the labour would cost approximately $325. It is difficult for us to reconcile these two quotations. When your letter of April 25 was received, careful consideration was given and with the amount of funds available it was decided that we could proceed with the work. The new quotation, involving an expenditure of over $500 more, makes it extremely difficult for us to decide what action should be taken.\n\nI would appreciate your advising why there is such a difference in the quotations supplied.\n\nAn immediate reply is expected to this letter. At that time you should state the name of the firm from whom you have secured the quotation for the Insul-Bric mould.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.

Our original estimate was based on quotations furnished by Mr. O. Hardju and from the North American Lumber Co'y. The North American Lumber Co'y, estimated 3 hours labour per square. Their labour figure was .80\u00a2 per hour. There were 135 squares furnished for the job which brought the total figure to $324.00. Hardju's estimate was based on 5 weeks labour working 10 hours a day at .70\u00a2 per hour for himself and .40\u00a2 per hour for a helper, making a total of $330.00.\n\nSince the above estimates were furnished, Hardju is no longer available and the North American Lumber Co'y informs me they are unable to secure carpenters for immediate work. They could not estimate when carpenters could be obtained.\n\nThe Beaver Lumber Company quotes $3.75 per 100 lineal feet for mould in B.C. fir. This material is now also obtainable from the George E. Farlinger Company at $3.00 per 100 lineal feet. This is pine and when painted would be just as suitable as fir.\n\nThere is another carpenter in Town whom I have asked to estimate on the job, Mr. [Frank Hakala], but he is working on a contract at present and will not be finished until sometime next month. His estimate will be forwarded as soon as received. If this does not prove satisfactory I would suggest arrangements be made with a contractor from some outside point to do the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.

He states he did not have an opportunity to examine all the siding that may have to be replaced, but the length of time required for the job will also depend on the amount of the old siding that will have to be replaced.

It is noted that on the voucher you submit the cost is $40.00 a thousand. Please let me know from whom you obtained prices on this shiplap and any other information that you have available as we have to obtain a purchase order before the account can be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nNovember 1, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of advance of $550.00 to pay wages due to the men employed applying the Insul Bric siding at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, and to advise that the work has now been completed.\n\nFinal pay list are in and it is found that the total due for wages is $510.75. Consequently we will require an additional $160.75 to pay the men in full.\n\nIt is noted that I submitted the figure of $350.00 as quoted by Mr. Hakala in August, and when I approached him on the subject of the discrepancy between his original estimate and actual cost he explained that this was partly due to general increase in wages since August\u2014at the time he was employing helpers at 35\u00a2 and 40\u00a2 per hour and was charging 60\u00a2 per hour for his own services. He also pointed out that the present rate locally for experienced carpenters is 75\u00a2 per hour. Hakala also states that there was more work required for the application of the siding than he estimated due to so many windows and corners, also that possibly $20.00 to $25.00 in labour costs could have been saved by using the old window casings instead of the new brick mould, but that much of the old moulding was partly rotten and would eventually have to be replaced.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGilford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOctober 8 To: Account rendered for material supplied to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School $109.94\n\nGifford Morrison\nOctober 20th, 1961\nSioux Lookout\n\nOctober 10th, 41\n\n285\n\n109.94\n\nPatricia Lumber Co., Ltd., Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nAccount rendered for material for Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nGifford Swartman.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 267\n\nOffice of the Sioux Lookout Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 10th, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 285, amounting to $1,093.94 in favour of Patricia Lumber Co., Ltd., Sioux Lookout, Ont., for Account rendered for material for Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\n38-43, The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave., N.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nYour communication of January 8th, addressed to the Superintendent of the Bar Falls Power Plant, Goldpines, Ontario, has been submitted to the Commission for attention and reply.\n\nFor your information the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario supplies power to the Town of Sioux Lookout and the Hamlet of Hudson. We understand that the school which you refer to is some five or six miles from Pelican Narrows, and would be at least that distance from the Commission's nearest line.\n\nAt the present time all extensions to consumers in rural districts throughout the province have been curtailed, for the purpose of conserving materials such as iron, steel, copper, etc., for war purposes, and therefore, under such circumstances, it would be impossible for the Commission to supply service to the school until the present war is over.\n\nIn any event, the construction of five or six miles of line would cost anywhere from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00, and it would be necessary for the Commission to be assured of a sufficient revenue from power supplied to meet the carrying charges on the capital investment, as well as to meet the cost of energy supplied.\n\nAs it is impossible, under present war conditions, to make any capital expenditure at the present time, we would recommend that the matter be withheld in abeyance until the war is over, at which time the Commission would be pleased to go into further details.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTOJ/AP (sgd) R.T. Jeffery, Chief Municipal Engr.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWINNIPEG, MAN. January 26, 1942.\n\nRe A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhen our Commission learned that new batteries would soon be required at their Sioux Lookout School they began to explore the possibility of having this School linked up with the Ear Falls Power Plant which provides the Town of Sioux Lookout with power and light.\n\nOn the 8th inst. I wrote to the District Superintendent (Mr. W. Dowds) of this Power Plant at Goldpines, Ontario, inquiring about the possibility of securing the electric service we needed. On January 13th he replied stating that he was forwarding my letter \"to his superiors in Toronto\".\n\nFrom Toronto I have received the enclosed letter written on January 21st by the Chief Municipal Engineer.\n\nWhile his letter does not appear to embody much hope of our securing the hydro electric service we desire, I might point out that he is mistaken in his understanding that our School is so far away as five or six miles from the nearest point on their power line. I have the assurance of the Principal that the School is not more than a mile, or a mile and a fraction, from the nearest point of the power line, and I am wondering if this fact would alter the decision set forth in the enclosed letter. The cost of installation, if the School management provided the poles, should not amount to a very great deal more than the cost of a new set of batteries, and our Commission\nJanuary 26, 1943.\n\nwill be very grateful if you will take this matter up direct with the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario and do what you can to secure their service for this School.\n\nShould it be impossible to persuade the Power Commission to furnish us with this service during the duration of the war, then it will be necessary to have 56 new battery cells provided with the least delay possible. The ones now in use have been there since the School was built in 1926.\n\nIt is practically certain also that a new engine will be required to generate the light as the Lister engine which has been in use so long, is about worn out, and it is practically impossible to secure repair parts for this engine at the present time.\n\nI have inquired from the Globalite Batteries Ltd., regarding the cost of 56 cells, and they inform me that the type they recommend (W 1S, 110 volt, 270 amperes) would cost approximately $875.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nCommending this very important matter to your careful and sympathetic consideration, believe me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBB: A.\n\nEnc.\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Dr. Westgate in connection with the electrical plant at the Sioux Lookout Residential School. He has forwarded to us a copy of a letter which he has recently received from the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario in connection with having the school linked up with the Ear Falls Power Plant.\n\nThe Chief Municipal Engineer of the Commission considers such action impossible due to the fact that the school is some five or six miles from Pelican Narrows and he states the line would have to run from there to the school. You have advised Dr. Westgate that the school is not more than a mile or a mile and a fraction from the nearest point on the power line. While I have no doubt your information is correct, at the same time I understand that it might not be possible to run a line from the nearest point to the school. Might I suggest that you discuss the question again with the Company's lineman who could give you definite information regarding the closest point to the school from which power could be obtained. As soon as you have an opportunity to do so you should write to me and we will again take up the matter with the Hydro Electric Commission.\n\nI was very much interested in the statement in Dr. Westgate's letter to the effect that the battery at present in use was originally installed in the school in 1926. This is a considerable period for batteries to be in use and I should appreciate your outlining in detail the methods that you have adopted to take care of\n\nRev. A.B. Cheales,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nthis battery. This information might be very valuable to us at other residential schools where apparently the management have considerable difficulty in prolonging the life of the batteries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant with reference to the Sioux Lookout Residential School. Before communicating again with the Hydro Electric Power Commission I feel that some additional information is required and consequently I am writing to the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School. A copy of this letter is enclosed for your information.\n\nAt the present time our funds are so limited that it is practically impossible to consider purchasing a new set of batteries. I presume that the Lister engine to which you refer is the one purchased in 1936.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of Jan. 29th received for which we thank you. As per your request I have made inquiries as to the nearest point at which our School could be linked up with the Ear Falls Power Plant.\n\nMr. E.J. Cole, Manager of the Sioux Lookout Hydro has just informed me that they supply power to the Airways Beacon, situated a mile and a small fraction from the School. The power line from Sioux Lookout is run cable-like under Pelican Lake and up over the railway track to the Beacon, situated four and a half miles from Sioux Lookout. Our School is situated about a quarter mile directly in from the Five Mile Post. I trust that when your Department is aware of the true facts concerning our nearness to the power line and our urgent need of some such reliable source of power that we shall not be deprived of such for the duration of the war.\n\nI regret that I am unable to give you any first-hand information as regards the care of our batteries now in use as I took over the Principalship here late as June 15th last. It is true some of the batteries have been in use for many years while others have been replaced. At the present, however, they are in no condition to be relied upon to supply us with either light or power. In an institution such as our School it is, to say the least, most difficult to have to use our lamps and lanterns periodically, but when one presses the fire alarm button and there is no response due to weakness of batteries it is high time, in my opinion, that something was done.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(The Rev.) A.B. Charles,\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 5)\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 29th ultimo, #129-6-5, and with it the copy of your letter to the Principal of our Sioux Lookout School, dealing largely with the question of the lighting system at this institution.\n\nI have made a hurried examination of our files to ascertain when the Lister engine, to which you referred, was supplied, and I think you are right in your understanding that it was purchased in 1936, that being the year when the Engine room was considerably damaged through fire.\n\nWith regard to the length of service given by the batteries, we communicated with the Globelite Co. in Winnipeg, and learned that they had not supplied the school with any batteries since 1926.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn co-operation with the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada this Department operates an Indian residential school at Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nThe engine and batteries which generate the electricity for this school are in such condition at the present time that it will be necessary to replace them in the immediate future. Due to war conditions it is extremely difficult to secure such equipment. Consequently we are deeply interested in the endeavour made by the management to secure Hydro connections for the Sioux Lookout School. I understand that Rev. T.B.R. Westgate wrote to you last month in regard to this matter and he has forwarded to us a copy of your letter to him dated January 31, 1942. In that letter you stated that the nearest point on your line would be approximately 6 miles from the school. Is it possible that you have been misinformed regarding this matter? I make this inquiry in view of a letter I have just received from the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School, part of which reads as follows:\n\n\"I have made inquiries as to the nearest point at which our school could be linked up with the Ear Falls Power Plant.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to inform you that I was a little indefinite in the statement as regards the distance of our School from the Airways Beacon. Due to our being so very busy and short-handed on the Staff I just made an estimate of the distance after discussing it with others, hence the inaccuracy of this statement, namely, that the distance of our School from the Beacon was approximately a mile.\n\nJust last night on my walk back on the track from Sioux Lookout I noted that the Beacon is about five hundred yards east of the four mile post. This would make the approximate distance of our School from the Beacon one and three quarter miles.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(The Rev.) A.B.

Cheales\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Residential School Commission,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have endeavored to list different materials in order of the urgency of our need for the same. As to batteries, we have just received word from the local Indian Agent that they are arriving within ten days. We wish to tender our sincere thanks for your efforts in procuring same.\n\nThe Hot Water Tank now in use is in very poor condition. There are at least eight pit holes along the side from end to end. The tank sprung a leak every two or three weeks during last winter and holes were promptly plugged. On his last visit the boiler Inspector suggested having the tank replaced. We strongly urge that a new tank be prepared and shipped to us ready for installation, so that we will not suffer the inconvenience of being without hot water when the cold weather sets in.\n\nAs regards the farm, we have never had sufficient wire to enclose the fields in which we grow vegetables for our own consumption. The result is that the cows are continually breaking through the makeshift fence and destroying our produce. We would be obliged indeed therefore if wire as listed could be shipped to us at earliest convenience.\n\nThe White Lead, Turpentine and Linseed Oil are required for the painting of brick moulding around all windows and doors of the school building. This work, I believe, should have been completed by the contractor who put on the Insul Bric. Due to cold weather the painting was not done, and the moulding will deteriorate if left as it is. We hope to be able to do it ourselves with the help of the men on the staff.\n\nBarn Paint has been requisitioned because the paint is scaling off the barn, and we feel that painting in time will preserve the building, which is a credit to the school.\n\nDrinking Fountains have been ordered for two of the children's dormitories. We had 26 to 36 pupils in each dormitory. During the night they often require a drink. For this purpose they have had a jug or pail of water just inside the door on the floor or on the small table, with one enamel cup beside it from which all drink. We consider this very unsanitary, and inviting the spread of disease germs. Thus we feel the need of drinking fountains is urgent.\n\nThe roof of the new verandah on the school building leaks like a sieve in several places. This we hope to repair at a cost of about fifty dollars. The foundation of the school building and residence is cracked, so that at times of heavy rain, water come in on the basement floors. We have a few bags of cement on hand, but may have to get an experienced man locally to assist in the repair of the same.\n\nFaithfully yours, (sgd) A. B. Cheales, Principal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 5)\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI informed the Principal of our Sioux Lockout School that, according to your letter of the 30th ultimo, #160-2, an appropriation of $1000.00 was available for repairs, improvements, etc., there this year, and requested him to let me have a list of the repairs, improvements, etc., he felt should be undertaken. Attached hereto you will find a copy of his list and a copy of his covering letter.\n\nI have noted his request for fencing, and while I know this to be very necessary I realize the possibility that it may not be procurable at present.\n\nThe condition of the roof of the new verandah as reported by the Principal is a matter which I suggest the local Indian Agent be asked to take up with the man who did the work. It seems to me that they should be asked to remedy this without any further charge either to your Department or to our Society.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\n[Signature]\nEncl.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nJuly 84, 1948\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nSieuze Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 10-002\n\nSHIP TO: REV.

Please let me know when the present water tank was installed and from whom the quotation of $350.00 was secured. A rough diagram of the tank should be supplied, showing the position of the holes to which the connecting pipes are attached.\n\nWe have also been requested to approve an amount of $50.00 for repairs to the school verandah and $50.00 for repairs to the school foundation. It appears that the roof of the new verandah on the school building leaks like a sieve. There is no reason for this condition continuing and you should have it repaired immediately on the understanding that the cost will not exceed $50.00. You may also arrange for the repairs to the foundation at a cost of $50.00.\n\nThe Reverend Principal visited the office yesterday and stated that some small sections of the building were not properly completed with the Insul-Bric which the Department supplied last year.

I have indicated in pencil the location of seven pits along the top, which have been mended.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the tank was installed not long after the erection of the school\u2014in the early 1930s or just previous. The quotation of $500 was not secured from any firm. We were unable to find a tank of this dimension listed in any catalogue, thus we just doubled the price of a tank one half the size.\n\nFor any further information I would like to refer you to the Provincial Boiler Inspector, Mr. Kelly of Fort Arthur who has visited our school twice in the past year. Thanking you,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. A. B. Charles\nSioux Lookout, Ont.,\nSept. 12th, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to Mr. Phelan's letter of July 24th,\nFile 123-6-5 with respect to repairs, replacements, etc.,\nreceived at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\nwe have today received a sketch of the water tank\nrequested, showing the position of the holes with connecting\npipes. Same is attached hereto, also copy of letter from\nthe Rev. Principal supplying information as requested in\nparagraph three of your letter.\n\nRegarding the roof on the new verandah at the\nschool, my inquiries reveal that the leaks were caused by\nthe nails in the corrugated iron roofing not being soldered.\nThe school authorities were to attend to this themselves but\nneglected to do so. It is estimated that two men working for\npart of two days could complete the job. When the roof expands\nit has a tendency to draw the nails, and in order to make a\ngood job with corrugated iron roofing, the nails should always\nbe soldered. The cost of this repair should not exceed $25.00\nalthough an expenditure of $50.00 has been authorized.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the foundation,\nI had an opportunity to inspect and examine the requirements\nvery thoroughly last week, accompanied by Mr. Klym who is\nexperienced in such matters. Mr. Klym estimates that approx-\nimately forty bags of cement will be required and $35.00 or\n$40.00 required for labour. This will be in excess of the $50.00\nauthorized for the job, but it is essential and I recommend that\nthe additional funds required be provided. It is expected that\nwe can commence the job about September 25th. The cause of\nthe trouble is due to lack of eave troughing on the building.\nOriginally a cement open drainage system was built around the\nfoundation of the building to carry off the water from the\nroof. This however, did not prove to be very satisfactory\nafter it had been heaved and cracked by frost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\nOS:AK\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF SIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nVOTE: 78 Allotment: 19-415\n\nSHIP TO: REV.

It is noted that the repairs to the foundation may exceed the original amount of $50.00 already authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you please bring the following matter to the attention of your Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nWe feel that you should know of the rather difficult situation in which we are placed at times. For the past year or more, since I became principal, we have had only the large launch with \"Kermath\" engine as a means of getting to town by water in summer. This launch has been in use since the school was built and it has sprung leaks at different times; the bottom also getting quite rotten and unserviceable.\n\nI bought an 18 foot Peterborough from Bowley House, which is the only other means we have of travelling on water. Last fall we managed for a month or more before freeze-up by borrowing an outboard Johnson motor from Ontario Lorentz (local), and using it on my Peterborough. A few weeks ago, when our launch sprung...\nanother leak, I had to call on forestry again and they readily and willingly loaned me the help outboard they had\u2014a 1\u00bd H.P.\n\nWhen we have to make several trips each week to town\u2014a distance of seven miles, this is very inconvenient. We get there, but it requires over three hours on the water with the small 1\u00bd H.P. engine. Then again, we have two pupils 12 and 14 years of age who have to go to Sioux Lookout for pneumothorax treatment every ten days. A somewhat faster means of travel would be much more convenient and not so tiring.\n\nConsidering the foregoing will you please let me know if your Department will finance the purchasing of a five or seven horse power outboard engine (Johnstone) for our school. A three H.P. motor would be a convenient size for use on my Peterborough which is in good condition and which I would be willing to sell very reasonably, that it might be the property of the school.\n\nWishing to hear from you soon,\n\nfaithfully yours,\n\n(Rev.) Alan R. Charles\nSioux Lookout,\nSeptember 18th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached please find letter handed to me today from the Reverend Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School with respect to repairs required for the School Boat. The craft is certainly in need of reconditioning and my inspection reveals that a new bottom may be required. The planks appear to be rotten from the keel to the water line. This should have been attended to in the spring before the boat was launched. It is recommended that authority be given to have the necessary repairs made as soon as possible. The estimated cost is $100.00, although it will depend on how much of the planking must be replaced.\n\nThe School should have some sort of an auxiliary boat and engine, but the one owned by the Reverend Principal is too small. It is only suitable for one or two passengers as well as the man running the engine. The boat described in the letter is only 1\u00bd long. I would also recommend that the school be provided with an outboard motor, to be used strictly for business purposes only.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this School is without a general utility or handyman as most of their equipment shows lack of attention or repairs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1948.\n\nEXD\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant and also letter received by you from the Principal of the Sioux Lookout Residential School sent forward therewith.\n\nIt would appear that certain repairs to the school boat are urgently needed and that these will likely cost $100.00. In view of the urgency of the matter you are authorized to take the steps necessary to have these repairs completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nI note your reference to an outboard motor. I am not at all sure that we can secure, at this date, outboard motors. However, if you send forward more particulars I shall be glad to submit the matter to the Purchasing Division.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.

I would suggest that Mr. A. G.

If the season permits, we will have the boat brought into Sioux Lookout from the School, in order that we can proceed with the work in the early spring. Will it be necessary to obtain authorization for this expenditure at a later date?\n\nThe transportation to and from the School has been somewhat of a problem all fall, and in order to improve the situation, and provide for any emergency, a smaller boat with an outboard motor should be provided. This would also prove an economy as it would be much cheaper to operate and could do much of the work done with the boat referred to above.\n\nI shall go into this matter at greater length and detail after discussing it more fully with the Reverend Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

The Rave Troughing I mentioned during my visit at the Indian Affairs Office last August. The rain water from the roof rests on, and has cracked the foundation in several places. This has resulted in both Basement Playrooms floors being flooded at times of rain.\n\n2. Plumbing connections throughout the school are very much in need of a thorough checking over and repairs put in where required. Toilets, taps and pipe unions are forever sprung leaks.\n\n3. The Sewage System is also in need of a thorough inspection. The Main Drain backs up occasionally causing a flood on the Laundry or Kitchen floors. We conclude there is a break in the Drain Tiling, and intended to investigate and if possible repair this Fall. Being very short-handed on staff however, we have been quite unable to do all that is to be done.\n\nThe present system of Toilets in Girls' and Boys' Lavatories is quite old\u2014a water tank near the ceiling which flushes the toilets once every few minutes. Then there are no covers at all on the toilets, which is quite unsanitary. We could make the Toilets do for a time if necessary, but would urge that proper covers be made for them.\n\nA large pipe is required to convey smoke from the two large boilers to the Chimney. Last Fall this pipe had small holes burnt through it at the time of a Chimney fire. A large sheet of galvanized tin was wrapped tightly, completely round it and made secure with metal bands.\n\nAs regards the farm, three implements are urgently needed; this year we had about ten acres of hay and green feed all of which we had to cut and rake by hand. This resulted in some feed being spoiled by wet weather before we were able to complete harvest and storing. Our hay acreage is increasing each year. Much the same is true as regards the potato crop. We plant and harvest the potatoes by means of a plow and this necessitates much scratching by hand to land all the potatoes. In a wet season such as we have had the past two years some of the crop is lost. A Gang Plow is required as we are quite unable to do the necessary fall Plowing with a walking plow.\n\nLastly having no other boat or engine to travel on the water, we are indeed handicapped when our launch springs a leak (as happened this Fall), or the engine refuses to start. We do feel that we should have an auxiliary outboard engine of some type, and a Peterborough to use in case of emergency.\n\nI have discussed all the above requirements with our local Indian Agent, and with his approval I respectfully submit same.\n\nIt seems odd to me but Local Indian Agent informs me that the list of requirements submitted to him in June, (a copy of which I enclose) is the 1943-4 list. Believing it to be the 1943-5 I have as per your recent request, prepared another list dated Oct. 8th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Today, serious thought is being given to preserving gutters, metal flashings, ventilators, etc., in order to make them last as long as possible. Painting alone is not the answer. The real answer is to apply measures which will maintain the sound quality with the least time and labor. Don\u2019t tackle any metal protection program until you are sure that you have found the most efficient, labor-saving methods. And if you own a building with an all metal roof, don\u2019t delay. Metal roofs are difficult and costly to replace with any material. Let the Tremco Man show you how to save that metal roof from decay. Tremco must be inside attention on the under side as well as the top. Tremco methods require the least amount of labor to prepare and treat either surface.\n\nGOOD FLASHINGS NEED NOT BE MADE OF METAL\n\nTremco Membrane Flashings Are SPEEDY - Are RELIABLE - Are DURABLE!\n\nTremco Membrane Flashings have been in use for years. They permit expansion and contraction and remain watertight. The cost is only a few cents per foot, and rapid installation is easily learned by anyone. They are ideal for replacing flashings between roof and parapets or around projections. This same membrane can also be put to work reinforcing other weak spots in your roof. Don\u2019t be without this handy material for roof work.\n\n\u201cYou Can\u2019t Buy Experience By the Barrel\u201d \u2014 But It\u2019s Yours For the Asking \u2014 ASK THE TREMCO MAN\n\nA. R. MITCHELL\n123 St. Anthony Ave.\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nA. R. MITCHELL\n185 SIMPLE AVENUE,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nTELEPHONES - 67458 - 59788\nCONSERVE WHAT YOU HAVE -\nMAKE YOUR PRESENT ROOF LAST!\n\nNobody wants to waste valuable time and labor when there are bigger jobs to be done than working on a roof. Neither does anyone want to waste valuable materials on extensive roof repairs which could have been avoided.\n\nIn order to spend the least amount of effort on your roof, inspect your roof regularly, twice each year, and apply simple, well planned treatment as soon as the need is apparent. Tremco methods of maintaining roofs have saved thousands of roofs and prolonged their life beyond the expectations of their owners.\n\nDO THE JOB RIGHT, AND ROOF REPAIRS WILL LAST LONGER\n\nThe first step in doing the job right is knowing the exact condition of the roof. The next step is knowing what measures will best repair those conditions. The final step is proper application of these measures. When you inspect your roof with the aid of the Tremco Man you obtain skillful diagnosis of conditions and intelligent recommendations. When you apply Tremco measures, the actual work is done under the instruction of the Tremco Man. The job is done right and lasts longer.\n\nCopyright 1942 by The Tremco Manufacturing Co.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nRepairs needed at Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply to your letter 129-6-1, dated March 5th, concerning the repairs required, I would report as follows:\n\nMumford and Medland cannot allow the expert, Mr. Montgomery, time off at present from urgent war work to visit the school. Mr. Montgomery suggested sending the engine in, but this will leave the school without light and power for a week at least, and Mr. Cheales thinks this unwise. The work could perhaps best be done late in June or in July, by either sending the engine in or having Mr. Montgomery go out. By that date he might be free from some of the war work. I would be glad to know if the authority to do the work can be extended into the coming fiscal year.\n\nMr. Swartman states, \"It is estimated that the joints and nail heads of the verandah roof could be soldered in two working days by a competent man. The cost for this job with materials would be about $20.00. You will recall we were discussing the possibility of treating the roof with pitch and sand. I am not familiar with this method and am unable to get any price or estimate locally for such a job.\" The soldering will perhaps need to be repeated each spring as the tin moves with the frost and thus the nails become loose. The Tremco Manufacturing Company, through its local salesman, recommends using the following:\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 3 rolls of 6\" Tremco roofing | 1        | $2.67      | $7.91 |\n| 1 \" 12\"                       |          |            |       |\n| 35 gals. of Tremco Roof Preserver | 1.60   |            | $56.00|\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 5)\nIf this material were supplied no doubt the work could be carried out by some of the men on the staff. This is, of course, more expensive than using the tinsmith, but it should give a fairly permanent job, especially if the work is carefully done. The enclosed \"cut\" will show how the work is done. After the strips of roofing have been fastened down over the joints it is well to give the remaining tin a coat of the Tremco Roof Preserver, as it prevents rusting and thus increased the life of the roof. Kindly advise if the material can be purchased at once.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa\nMarch 19, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. A.G.

Help in painting\n\nThe most serious drawback to our accomplishing a good paint job on the school buildings this summer is our lack of experienced help.\n\nMy General Assistant who is practically invalid, has tendered his resignation. The Engineer plans on leaving to work for the Int. Forestry Branch during the summer. This leaves only the Farm Instructor who is kept busy tending to the farm.\n\nFurthermore, I have the boys off for two months holiday during the summer, while pupils are away on holiday. I have decided to remain at the school and help all I can with the painting. At present I can see little chance of much help except for that of the senior boys. I plan on asking two or three of these boys who will be graduating June 30th, to remain here and help me with the painting during July and August. We will offer to pay them a salary to make it worth their while.\n\nI have had some experience in painting while in Mission Work in Northern Manitoba. I do feel though, that with so much of this work to do we should, if at all possible, have the help of an experienced painter such as yourself. Not only would the paint job be more satisfactory, but the boys would profit by the supervision by one who would know all the important phases of painting.\n\nDo you think that your Department could possibly obtain the services of such a person, and employ him to help us for at least two or three weeks during the summer?\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery Truly\n\n(The Rev.)

Cheales,\nPrincipal.\n\nPhone 248\n\nSIoux LOOKOUT, Ont., April 7 1943\n\nMr. G. Swartman\nIndian Agent\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith the coming of Spring we have a great deal of painting to do to the buildings on the school premises.\n\nOn the school building itself, the moulding around the many windows and doors must be painted. We were able to get only a start on this job last fall. Then the barn and outbuildings\u2014storehouse, icehouse and chicken house\u2014are all badly in need of painting, before the exterior weathers more, making a successful paint job practically impossible.\n\nThe paint which was ordered last year, and which we now have on hand, is not sufficient to accomplish this task. Then in addition to the paint, we will require shingle stain. This, I neglected to order last year at the time of ordering the paint. Whether the shingles were stained years ago or not is uncertain. It is possible that they are dull grey in appearance and weathered. To stain them before painting the buildings would, in our opinion, not only improve the appearance of the buildings, but would preserve the shingles for from three to four years longer service.\n\nWe estimate therefore that we will require the following:\n\n1, 2 5 gal. kgs Red Barn Paint\n2, 2 5 gal. kgs Shingle Stain (Green)\n\nTrusting that you may be able to supply us with above at your convenience.\n\nThanking you\n\nVery Truly,\n\n(The Rev.) A. B. Cheales\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 5)\nSioux Lookout, Ont., April 12th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttached hereto please find copy of letter recently received from the Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School with respect to painting barns and the trimming of the main building. Owing to shortage of help and bad weather this work was not attended to last fall and I am afraid if we do not make some definite arrangements to complete the job this Spring that it is liable to be postponed for another year. The trimming, applied at the time the building was covered with Insul Brick siding in the fall of 1941, should have been painted last spring. If this is left too long without paint it becomes so badly weathered that it is practically impossible to paint it. It is therefore urgently recommended that authority be granted to employ a professional painter at a cost not to exceed $50.00 in order to attend to this necessary work.\n\nRev. Cheales has also pointed out that some of the older boys would gain valuable experience working under the supervision of a qualified painter.\n\nEnc.\n\nGS:K\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had particularly in mind, the 1926 Fordson tractor at our school. We have had, to say the least, several nerve wrecking experiences with this old tractor. In June 1941 a serious break occurred to this tractor while at work in the field so that it was of no use for months. During the past several winters we have had to build a fire under the tractor in order to get it started to enable us to saw wood with it; this a regular weekly experience. Periodically it would break down in one place after another so that we had to resort to Mandisswe to keep up a supply of fuel. This spring a part of the inside of the tractor broke, crashing out a large hole in the head and break case, an irreparable break. We have tried for months through the Indian Residential School Commission, Winnipeg to obtain a new tractor with no results as yet. We sincerely hope that such will be available by September at the latest.\n\nA Hay Mower and Rake have been requisitioned for in past with no result. As we are growing more and more hay each year, it has become practically impossible to harvest the crop entirely by means of hand scythe and rake. We trust therefore, that this equipment may be available in not too distant future. We are endeavouring to rent a mower to harvest this year's crop.\n\nTrusting the foregoing information satisfactory and hoping that, if at all possible, the Indian Department will hasten the procuring of a tractor for our school.\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery truly yours\n\n(The Rev.)

In order to finish the barn roof, and stain the roofs of the other three outbuildings, we will need at least an additional ten gallons of stain.\n\nThe barn and ice house have been given the first coat of red paint. Eight gallon of the fifteen gallon of red paint have been used. In order to do a good job by giving all outbuildings two coats of paint, we will need another five gallon of red barn paint.\n\nWhile stain and paint could possibly be purchased locally, it would facilitate considerably our completing the painting in good time.\n\nRusting that we may receive the above in due time, and thanking you\n\nVery truly yours\n\n(The Rev) [Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S.\nKindly include with above 12 gallons Linseed Oil\n\nTotal required---\n\n1, Shingle Stain (Green) 10 gal.\n2, Paint (red, barn) 5 \"\n3, Linseed Oil 12 \"\nSioux Lookout, Ont., July 29th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find copy of letter from the Reverend Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School with respect to paint required to complete the work at the school, also Requisition listing his requirements.

The main sewer line is apparently blocked and the sewage has backed up into the dining room portion of the basement, and fumes, sewer gas etc, are throughout the building. Temporary measures have been taken to clear the moisture from the basement and it was not until yesterday that I was able to get in touch with a plumber who would undertake the supervision of the necessary repairs. He is unable to give me even an approximate price, as it will largely depend on the amount of excavating necessary, providing some of the sewer tiles or soil pipes are broken. If complete excavation is necessary, it would probably cost three or four hundred dollars.\n\nI have requested Mr. Hamilton to purchase a long sewer rod in Winnipeg and ship immediately, in order that the plumber may commence the necessary probing without further delay. I trust this action is approved, and regret that at present I am unable to supply an estimate of the cost. Dr. Bell suggests that this work be attended to immediately before any serious condition develops at the school.\n\nG.

As you will know, this school was erected by the Government and the sewage system now in use, installed at that time.\n\nFor your information I enclose a plan of the system as furnished by the Principal and about which he writes as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Enclosed you will please find a rough plan of the Sewage drain at our school. I regret that there was apparently no blueprint or correct plan of any kind to be found. I have endeavoured therefore to make it as clear as possible. There are no doubt some errors and omissions in this plan but I trust it will give you a general idea.\"\n\nIn this connection I may say that we understand that the full plans of the sewage system would be in the possession of the Department.\n\nAs stated we have asked Mr. Cheales to get in touch with Indian Agent Swartman and endeavour to secure a local Plumber to look into the matter and submit an estimate of the repairs he considers must be carried out.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I will be obliged if you will\nlet me know if the plans mentioned are available and also if your Department will be prepared to assume the full responsibility for the repairs which, it is evident, must be effected in the very near future.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary & Treasurer.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the sewage system at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.

He stated the sewer at the school was blocked and the liquid was backing up in the school. The local plumber had no rods. I purchased these from Marshall-Wells and they were shipped the same day.\n\nI received a letter yesterday concerning this matter which reads as follows:\n\n\"Referring to your letter of September 4th, file 213-11 ACE with respect to the repairs needed for the plumbing and sewage system at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I wish to advise that the necessary work required is now under way. The sewer rod arrived yesterday and I proceeded to the school with two good plumbers. They found a break in the sewer tile between the septic tank and the point where the pipe comes out of the basement. This will require excavating and replacement. The septic tank itself apparently has not been operating satisfactorily for some months. It will have to be excavated, pumped out and completely examined. Needless to say, this is a very messy job, and it is extremely difficult to secure adequate help to undertake the work. However, one of the plumbers will remain on the job until it is completed. We have also engaged two labourers for the excavating. It is estimated that the labour costs will approximate $150. The materials, apart from the sewer rod, etc., might amount to $25.00, although this will depend largely on the amount of repairs necessary to the septic tank.\"\n\"We have already written the Department requesting approval for the action we propose taking.

A tractor is required principally to be used with the wood saw. If a tractor is not available, possibly a good heavy duty stationary engine might be obtained.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nGS:X\nDear Sir,\n\nAs directed by Dr. Alderwood Secretary, Indian Res. School Commission, we submit the following list of what we wish the Dept. of Indian Affairs to purchase for us this year out of the amount still available for the use of our school. We have endeavoured to list items in order of the urgency of our need.\n\n1. We have no Flue Cleaner with brush and require same just as soon as it can possibly be provided.\n\n2. The large smoke pipe leading from the boiler to chimney is in a dangerous condition and has burnt through in one or two places. It is badly bent and has at least two patches on it. We have been urged by the Boiler Inspector to have it replaced before the real cold weather sets in. A diagram of the pipe is enclosed.\n\n3. The Hot Water Tank was listed on our previous estimates, and a detailed description along with diagram was sent to the Commission or the Department. We enclosed another diagram of this tank showing how it is fitted from end to end along the upper side. We would urge that an effort be made to replace this tank as soon as possible. The present tank appears to have been made in two sections joined together in the centre. (see diagram)\n\n4. Our only Stillson Wrench was accidently broken recently; a tool badly needed regularly.\n\n5. The Water Glasses on both our Cold Water tanks need replacing.\n\n6. A plow as listed has been ordered on previous estimates. Each year more land is being cleared and broken, and we now seldom get more than half of the land plowed before freeze up sets in. Having only a One-Narrow Walking Plow, we are thus handicapped.\n\n7. A Laundry Stee as listed was recently ordered from Ashdown's Winnipeg but their invoice lists same as One Stock. This store is urgently needed as the one now in use is falling to pieces. Said store is used not only for heating of the Laundry irons, the Laundry work, but senior girls do considerable ironing by hand.\n\n8. Tractor. Though we have had considerable correspondence as regards tractor, no definite word has been received to date as to one being shipped. Unless one is procured for us we are faced with the rather impossible problem of having to saw our winter wood supply by hand. Though we have a small one cylinder engine which is sometimes used for sawing, it has not the power required for sawing the larger wood needed in the furnaces, and keeping an adequate supply of wood on hand. We would urge therefore that if possible, any amount of grant left be used towards the purchase of a tractor. Any assistance the Department of Indian Affairs could give in speeding up the procuring of a tractor would indeed be appreciated.\n\n9.

I might say that most of the equipment at this school, especially in the boiler and engine room, is not in a very good state of repair, due entirely to lack of maintenance. We had a man working at the school repairing the sewage system who is a qualified engineer, plumber, steam fitter etc. He informed me that he would be willing to take on the job for $60.00 a month with board. This would mean about $10.00 a month more than the School Commission pays for the position. In conversation with Rev. Cheales yesterday he advised that the position of engineer has already been filled; Mr. Hodgson who was formerly farm instructor and teamster being promoted to this.\n\nI would strongly urge that the school be given a grant of say $120.00 to be applied to the salary of a qualified engineer and that arrangements be made to have Mr. F. Pratt, referred to above, engaged for this work.\n\n[Signature]\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6215, file 470-5, part 5)\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1943.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letters of the 9th instant, with reference to the Sioux Lookout Residential School. You must have misunderstood me when you were in the Department, as I certainly did not intend to intimate to you that the Department could pay the salary of the engineer, either in whole or in part. Members of the staff at residential schools are hired by the school management and paid by them from their per capita grant or other receipts. I simply wanted to have on file a definite statement from you to the effect that you consider the present engineer of the Sioux Lookout School is sufficiently competent to adequately look after the machinery that is under his care. It is my intention to communicate with the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. in regard to this matter.\n\nWith regard to the requests made by the principal, you may authorize him to purchase a boiler flue cleaner with brush which it is noted can be secured from Ashdown's in Winnipeg at a cost of $6.20.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure a new smoke stack and a hot water tank, although at the present time I am not exactly certain that the information given is sufficiently detailed to satisfy their requirements.\n\nYou may also purchase the water glasses for the cold water tanks.\n\nIf the Principal supplies exact information regarding the type of laundry stove he considers is necessary, an endeavour will be made to secure it in the future. We have not yet received any information that will permit our submitting the matter to the Purchasing Branch.\nIt is not our present practice to supply farm machinery to residential schools and consequently favourable consideration cannot be given to the request for a plow.\n\nWhat has been said regarding farm machinery applies also to the tractor, though it is noted that you consider a heavy duty, stationary engine would be suitable. In this case too detailed information will have to be supplied to this office regarding the type of engine required before adequate consideration can be given to the Principal's request.\n\nI regret that at the present time we are unable to supply the flags, as these are extremely difficult to secure. We hope to have some in stock within the next few months and, if so, will keep in mind the request from the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nR.A.

Mr. Hoey did not give me the impression that the Department would pay the salary of an engineer, either in whole or in part. I am also unable to find anything in my correspondence that would indicate I entertained such an idea. However, I did recommend that the Department provide a grant to the School in order that they might employ a competent man at $60.00 per month.\n\nMr. Pratt, applicant for the position was in to see me today and stated that he had been in communication with the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. They had offered him a monthly wage of $57.50. He informed he would not accept for less than $60.00 per month. I am passing this information along in case it is decided to allow a grant to cover the difference.\n\n[Signature]\nOxford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to Mr. Heay's letter of October 15th, File 129-6-5 with respect to certain equipment required at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I am enclosing herewith copy of letter from the Principal wherein he furnishes specifications regarding Laundry Stove needed.\n\nIt is noted that he has not supplied detailed specifications with respect to stationary engine. I am of the opinion that a good second-hand heavy duty truck engine might fill his requirements, although there are none to be purchased locally.\n\nGS:K\n\nIndian Affairs.

Swartman\nIndian Agent\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nQuoting File I44;78\n\nYou state in yours of Oct. 16th, that if we could give you exact specifications regarding Laundry Stove required, the Department will endeavour to secure one for us.\n\nThe stove was listed on our 1943-4 estimates as:\n\n\"Charm Laundry Stove\" Page # H148, Amdown's Winnipeg.\n\nOne requisite in particular is that the stove purchased have a large surface on which the (sand) Flat Irons may be heated. A stove such as the \"Charm\" with top 14\"x20\" or somewhat larger, would be satisfactory, particularly as we could have a back placed around the outside of the Fire box, on which additional irons could be placed for heating.\n\nWe trust that this type of stove may still be obtainable as the one now in use is cracked beyond repair in several places, and may fail to please any day.\n\nAs regards a machine for the sawing of the school wood, we feel that a heavy duty stationary engine would be quite satisfactory. An engine with plenty of power to operate a saw blade 36\" in diam. is required. We have no power at the present time for sawing wood, other than a small one cylinder engine which will drive the through only the small logs. I have thought to ask our man who is also in the bush to cut the logs into three foot lengths to fit into the furnaces. As soon as real cold weather sets in we will be unable to keep enough fuel cut, even if we have two or three men cutting in the bush. We trust therefore, that you may be able to assist us in procuring a stationary engine, with the least possible delay.\n\nThanking you,\n\n(The Rev.)

I, therefore, trust that you will be able to arrange for its early purchase.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to Mr. Hoey's letter of November 25th File 129-6-5, with attached memorandum from the Departmental Purchasing Agent with respect to the Gasoline Engine required for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I have to advise as follows:\n\nAt present a seven horsepower single cylinder Lister engine from the auxiliary pump-house is in use as a temporary arrangement for sawing the wood. Rev. Cheales informs me that this engine does not deliver sufficient power to saw large logs. Many of the logs used for fuel-wood are up to 20\" in diameter, and with the small engine the saw will efficiently handle pieces up to about 10\".\n\nI might point out that the engine in present use should be returned to the pump-house as soon as possible in order to be available in the event of fire.\n\nLast year the saw was driven by the 1926 Fordson tractor motor, 15-20 horse-power. If a smaller engine is supplied it would be necessary to re-model the whole sawing outfit, consequently under the circumstances I believe it would be advisable to obtain the 8-9 horse-power engine.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\n\nIndian Affairs.

A.B. Cheales, Principal of the School.\n\nIt will be in order to invoice for this smoke pipe at $69.00 f.o.b. Sioux Lookout, Ontario, Dominion sales tax included, or $57.00 more than the figure, $32.00, indicated on our purchase order No. 20885 dated Nov. 2nd, 1943.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you would expedite delivery of this smoke pipe as it is urgently needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nBridge & Iron Works Limited,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nSioux Lockout, Ont., January 5th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Heating System, Principal's Residence\nSioux Lockout Indian Residential School\n\nI have been informed by the Reverend Principal of the Sioux Lockout Indian Residential School that he has received a Hot Water Heating System from Cranes Limited, Fort William, for installing in the residence. Inspector Hamilton informs us that there is no authority for any expenditure in connection with installation of same, and apparently the School Commission will not undertake the expense.\n\nThe residence urgently requires additional heat, and it is recommended that the installation be proceeded with immediately. Until a competent steam-fitter or plumber inspects the proposed installation, it is impossible for me to give an estimate of the cost. It is suggested that I be given authority to engage a competent man to submit an estimate, providing the installation is the responsibility of our Department. We have no correspondence on file here regarding the purchase of a heating unit, nor is the Reverend Principal able to shed much light on the arrangements, other than that he believes the purchase to have been made by the Commission.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 10, 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to a new heating system for the Principal's residence at the Sioux Lookout Residential School. It is difficult to understand why it has not been possible to decide who ordered this equipment. Certainly it was not ordered by this Branch, nor does a review of our files show that any request for such an installation has been received within the past year. I think you will realize that it is almost impossible for us to approve heavy expenditures without our authority having first been obtained. Otherwise it would be impossible for us to control our appropriation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Sioux Lookout Indian Res.

This should read as follows:\n\n\"Grant towards salary of night watchman at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School during January, February and March, 1944.\"\n\nG.S.: K\n\nIndian Agent.\nSioux Lookout, Ont., January 18th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to Mr. Phelan's letter of January 10th, File 129-6-5, with respect to heating system for the Principal's residence at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I wish to report as follows:\n\nRev. Cheales informs us that the new plant, which includes radiators and pipes, was purchased by the Commission at considerable cost, and that they do not now wish to go to the expense of the installation. Personally I am not sure that the new radiators are required. To install same would involve a considerable amount of labour and expense which might be avoided if the present radiators could be used with a new heating plant. Last fall when Mr. Carroll, the local plumber and steam fitter, was attending to the sewage system at the School, he made a hasty examination of the existing heating system in the Principal's residence and made certain recommendations or suggestions for improving same, but as I recall, this would not run into a large sum of money.\n\nThis portion of the school certainly requires additional heat and it is recommended that either the Department or the School Commission make arrangements to have this attended to without further delay, and before spending any money on the installation or equipment, that a qualified man be engaged to look the situation over and submit his recommendations.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, in which you state that the radiators and pipes for the Principal's residence at the Sioux Lookout School were purchased by the M.S.C.C. This was a rather unusual procedure and, as the matter stands now, we are still uninformed regarding the cost of installation. As pointed out in official letter of January 10, it is difficult for us to authorize expenditures without knowing their amount. I, therefore, suggest that you have someone decide how much of the equipment that has been given by the Commission should be installed and the cost of the necessary work. When you forward this information the matter will have further consideration.\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nExtract from Crane Limited letter of February 15th, 1946.\n\n\"The most logical and most economical procedure would be to install a separate steam heating boiler having this piped up to the existing piping to make a complete heating unit separate entirely from the school heating plant. We are attaching quotation based on our interpretation of your requirements and shall be glad to have your instructions regarding shipment.\"\n\n\"We are now submitting quotation on a Steam Heating Boiler, Electric Condensation Pump and Receiver for use on 110Y C.C. Current Automatic Electric Damper Regulator with Room Thermostat Automatic Draft Regulator and Pressuretrol and Vacuum Vent; all designed to provide a complete Steam Heating System in your school residence at Pelican with automatic control of room temperature and designed to operate under vacuum the greater part of the time.\n\n\"This system complete as described would cost you $380.00 F.O.B., Pelican. The cost of wiring for the Controls is not included in this figure. We quote you an alternative price of $320.00 if the Automatic Temperature Control equipment were omitted.\"\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nAugust 31st, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWe have a letter from the Indian Residential School Commission in Winnipeg pointing out the need for repairs to storm windows, glazing broken panes, storm doors, coal chutes etc., in order to conserve heat at the Sioux Lookout School, particularly in the basement. If this does not prove satisfactory, the alternative suggested of installing separate steam heating plant for the Principal's residence would appear to be the only solution. The letter goes on to state that since the school was erected by the Department it is therefore a governmental responsibility, and we are requested to arrange to have the necessary work done, before winter sets in. The attached extract of a letter from Cranes Limited, was enclosed with this letter.\n\nRev. Cheales, the Principal, informs us that approximately $500.00 is owing to Cranes Ltd., for material supplied during the past six months. He has requested that the Department pay this account. Since the negotiations for the work and materials were carried out directly between the School and Cranes, I am not familiar with the arrangements, although I do know that during the sub-zero weather the Principal's residence is very cold. Some time in the fall of 1943 it appears that the Principal or the School Commission ordered a complete new heating system from Cranes and after it was delivered to the school, it was found that it was not exactly what was required. I understand part of the material was used, the rest returned.\n\nFrom the foregoing you will see that it is somewhat difficult for me to make any specific recommendations at this stage. However I felt that this should be brought to your attention and the matter presented as I see it.\n\nG. A. Swetman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, September 7, 1944.\n\nMr. Gifford Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 31, in which you intimate that a letter, relating to repairs at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, has been received by you from the Residential School Commission at Winnipeg.\n\nThis is the first occasion in our experience where the Commission have communicated with an Indian agent in respect to repairs at a residential school, and the procedure is somewhat unusual. It would be more satisfactory to all parties concerned if the principal of the school communicated with us through you with regard to the repairs that may be urgently needed to the building. As you are no doubt aware, under existing regulations all purchases of material are made by the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nI find it difficult to understand the reference to a three hundred dollar expenditure for materials supplied from Crane's Limited. If this expenditure was authorized by the Department and the purchases made through our Purchasing Agent, then vouchers for the amount should be sent forward. If, however, this expenditure was incurred without departmental authority, we cannot accept responsibility for the payment.\n\nI may state, for your information, that there is an amount of $700.00 included in this year's estimates for repairs at the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nR.

The one in use is cracked, and in my opinion unsafe. The Indian boys assist in the work and when the saw is cracked it is possible for a portion to come apart. The saw travels at a terrific speed and should only be in operation when the equipment is in first-class working order.\n\nThe saw required should be at least 36 inches in diameter, although 38 inches would be even better.\n\nI understand from Mumford & Medland that a 36\" saw will cost $47.00 and a 38\" saw will cost $54.00, f.o.b. Toronto, both subject to 30% discount. It might be advisable to purchase the saw in the East and have it shipped direct to Mr. Cheales, Principal of the School, thus avoiding any unnecessary delay.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba, dated February 16, 1945.\n\nThe school throughout is badly in need of painting. The walls are dark and dull and the condition can only be changed by two or three coats of paint. The truth is the services of an experienced painter are required for from six weeks to two months. The work should be started at one end of the building and carried out in a methodical manner from top to bottom; and I would suggest the halls be done first. Mr. Cheales has requested a quantity of paint, but this will not begin to cover the area requiring painting. However, it will be a start and I recommend it be granted.\n\n| Item                  | Quantity |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Gloss white           | 12 gal.  |\n| Ivory                 | 12 \"     |\n| Cream                 | 12 \"     |\n| Buff, light           | 10 \"     |\n| Green tint            | 4 \"      |\n| Linseed Oil (Boiled)  | 12 \"     |\n| Linseed Oil (Raw)     | 12 \"     |\n| Turpentine            | 10 \"     |\n| Brushes               |          |\n| 1 - 1\u00bd\"              |          |\n| 2 - 3\"               |          |\n| 2 - 4\"               |          |\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n*Ottawa, February 20, 1945.*\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT 10-891 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

HAMILTON,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, dated February 16, 1945.\n\nThe kitchen range is apparently quite old and in need of several repair parts. I suggested to the Principal that he list the parts needed and find out if they are available; and if so, the price. The wash sink leaks and consequently dirty water has got in around the stand which holds the tubs. The result is quite a sour smell. These tanks should be renewed.\n\nThe kitchen floor is cement and very hard on the feet. If Battleship linoleum is available the floor should be covered. The full size of the kitchen is 16' x 25'. All should be covered, but if funds are not available, then the portion most essential measures 10' x 16'. This is between the kitchen range and the table where the staff member does most of the work. AA quality of linoleum should be supplied.\n\nThe boiler room was quite tidy and the equipment in fair condition. This boiler room is very cold and a lot of heat is lost even before it reaches the school. I would recommend that the roof of the room be sealed in with plaster board and gyprock insulation be used overhead. The doors should be repaired and refitted. The above improvements will save many a cord of wood and I am sure the heating of the school will not be the problem it is today.\nOttawa, February 21, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to your letter of February 16, with regard to your inspection of the Sioux Lookout School, it is noted that the Principal is endeavouring to obtain the parts required for the kitchen range.\n\nI am not certain that we will have funds available for the wash sink and the linoleum for the kitchen floor in the current year's appropriation. However, I will review our financial position carefully and, if possible, these will be supplied. If they do not reach the school before the end of March, the request for them should be renewed in April. At that time the school management should also let us know the quantity and type of material required for the insulation of the boiler room.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

This was authorized in your letter of March 5th, 1945, File 129-6-5.\n\nIn view of the estimated cost to put the engine in running condition, and the fact that it is an old obsolete model, I thought it would be worth while to inquire if Reverend Chellas has written to the Kermath people inquiring if they have a later model, in good condition, for sale, but I presume they would have mentioned this as an alternative when submitting the report on the engine.\n\nIt might also be possible to obtain a St. Lawrence or a Buchanan engine. Both these firms, a few years ago, were manufacturing marine motors which were very suitable for this type of boat. You are probably aware that the hull is not in very good condition but it should be possible to get another year's use out of it, and the engine could be installed in a new hull which might be built locally at a reasonable figure. Another alternative which might prove more economical would be to obtain a complete new outfit, or a used boat if possible, in good condition, through the War Assets Corporation. Nothing else seems to me quite so desirable as a boat whose main characteristic should be a sturdy boat with a reliable motor, something about 25' with sufficient beam to make it sea-worthy.\n\nIn my opinion a good boat is just as necessary at this school as the lighting plant or kitchen stove, and I believe many of the difficulties at the Sioux Lookout school during the past few years have been largely due to lack of transportation. I cannot stress too strongly the necessity for taking steps to remedy this condition.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nApril 4th, 1945\n\nRev. R.B. Cheales,\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nRev. Sir:-\n\nYour engine has just arrived and has been physically examined by our Superintendent and Shop Foreman.\n\nI am afraid Sir, that this is one of those rare cases where Mr. Engine is just about at the last gasp. She has, practically speaking, run herself out of her useful life in the ordinary sense.\n\nWe have had quite a conference as to what to do, as we fully appreciate your circumstances and the positive necessity of having transportation this coming Summer.\n\nThe engine, unfortunately, is many years obsolete, and even at that, as during war time we are not building any parts or equipment for even standard engines, except certain models for use in the war Services, the difficulty of getting parts,- is paramount.\n\nI appreciate also, that a change in engines would mean a complete change in your installation in the boat. And unfortunately-very few engines are available and would not be suitable.\n\nIn round figures- it would cost in the neighborhood of $500.00 to completely, rebores, and refit this engine throughout- as not only the engine proper is in badly worn shape, but all of the accessories, including the reverse gear-are also in the same condition.\nWe operate under Dept. M&S price formulae in our costing, limited to 5% profit on a fixed overhead.\n\nSo that, anyway, the only way we could handle it would be on this cost plus basis, which would be, of course, for your protection.\n\nThat the engine can be successfully rebuilt is without doubt, but it will require extensively building even the camshaft would have to be ground and all new bearings throughout, which are not very frequently required. The cylinders reboared, new pistons, crankshaft ground, all new bearings throughout\u2014 all new valve springs, valve guides, valves and about 75% or 80% of the reverse gear\u2014 outside of other bearings and your accessories, such as pumps, generators and distributors etc.\n\nI am giving you this estimated figure, purely for estimated purposes, as I do not know whether your Service or the Dept. of Indian Affairs will accede to this.\n\nIf so, I would like you to let me know IMMEDIATELY and we will make every endeavor to hurry the job along as fast as possible, although I cannot give you any date when it can be shipped, as it would depend upon the services and the supply and the priorities we can obtain.\n\nOne thing is positively certain\u2014that your engine would not have functioned very many more miles as it stood. So, whether you wish to have it replaced by some other manufacturer, or whether you want us to go ahead with this on the basis above mentioned\u2014is for your kindly decision and may I stress again, the urgency of getting that information to us as rapidly as possible please.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nCaptain L.S. Webster\nOF THE GOOD SHIP \"KERMATH.\"\nOttawa, April 19, 1945.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the repairs required for the engine in the boat used by the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. In view of the information contained in your letter and the letter from the Company, I do not think that it would be advisable to expend such a large sum of money in repairing an engine which would in all probability be out of order in a comparatively short space of time.\n\nYou mention the possibility of securing a St. Lawrence or a Buchanan engine. Our Purchasing Branch is doubtful if we can secure an engine of either type, or for that matter, any marine engine, at the present time. However, we are prepared to make every possible endeavour to secure an engine, but before formally placing the matter in the hands of our Purchasing Branch, it will be necessary for us to have very detailed information regarding the size and type of engine required. Your reply should contain this information and, of course, should include the horse power of the engine and specific information regarding the size and capacity of the boat in which the engine will be placed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nApril 16th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of February 21st, File 129-6-1, with respect to materials required for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, particularly to the request for a small boat, as stated in the second paragraph of this letter.\n\nIn our letter of April 11th we mentioned the necessity for a larger boat with a good motor. The boat (Peterborough skiff) recommended by Inspector Hamilton, would not take the place of the motor boat, but would serve a very useful purpose. I understand such a craft could be purchased for approximately $150.00, and Rev. Chasles has a suitable motor to use on this type of boat. It would be found economical to use a boat of this description for trips to town with one or two passengers when the weather was suitable, instead of using a larger boat.\n\nI understand these boats are now in stock and it would be possible to have one landed here in less than two weeks time, providing funds were available for the purchase. It is estimated that the ice will be out of the lakes and rivers here within ten days and it is very important that the School should have some means of water transportation as soon as the ice goes out.\n\n[Signature]\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 129-6-1, in a letter dated February 16, 1945, Inspector Hamilton wrote regarding the Sioux Lookout School as follows:-\n\n\"The school has a 8 H.P. outboard motor and if provided with a boat the consumption of gasoline could be greatly reduced. It is not necessary always to take the large boat when going to Sioux Lookout. I attach a clipping of what Mr. Cheales considers a suitable craft. It is a Peterborough craft with a four foot beam.\"\n\nApril 19, 1945.\nOttawa, April 19, 1945.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, in connection with that portion of Inspector Hamilton's report of February 16 in which he suggested the possibility of securing a small boat for use at the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nIn view of the contents of official letter of today's date, regarding the repairs required to the large boat at this school, I regret that funds at our disposal at the present time will not permit our purchasing a small boat, provided we have to incur the expenditure required to purchase an engine for the large boat.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your enquiry of the 6th inst., I desire to inform you that after careful consideration, we have decided neither of the alternatives mentioned therein would be suitable. We think the enamel would chip too easily, and so become unsightly in near future.\n\nSince it is practically only the bottom of the sink which is badly pitted, we have decided to send the old one in, and have a new tank installed in the same frame. It would be rather difficult for us to get along without a sink until the holidays, and trust therefore, that we may be able to get this work done in July. If the Department wishes that we have this improvement made earlier, we will, on request, arrange to get along meantime.\n\nThanking you,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(The Rev.)

It was originally equipped with a Ford marine motor. I understand this did not prove particularly satisfactory and some years later a Kermath - Farr Model 6 was installed. This engine was rated at 60 H.P. The Elliott Bros., local boat and skii builders, inform me, that in their opinion, the boat was overpowered and suggest a modern motor of 35 or 40 H.P. would be ample for such an old hull.

Swartman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nRe: Inquiry 16th Inst\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is a list of the quantity and type of materials required for the insulation of the boiler room, as well as covering for the boilers:\n\n- 35 Sheets 4'x8' Gyprock (for ceiling)\n- Rock Wool - 3000'\n- 5000 Red Brick - common\n- 2 Rolls Lime\n- 15 Bags Cement\n- 1 Keg - Nails 1\u00bd\" Common\n\nWe have not as yet received the necessary parts for the kitchen range. The parts required for the McLary \"CHEF\" range are as follows: (Replacement for top of range)\n\nOne piece for top front, 49\" long by 6\" wide. (overall)\nTwo pieces for top, semicircular in centre, to contain lid section.\nEach of these two pieces, length 22\u00bd\", width 10\u00bd\" with lid in centre of these two pieces an area of top of oven 28\u00bd\" x 21\" is covered.\nPipe Bricks - 9\"x6\"\nTop Damper - with rod attached.\nOne arm - for top front, with hole 11/8\" diam. also pipe 25\" long to fit into this arm.\nOne shaker handle - $5.95.\n\nLastly as regards the wash sink, you have requested the exact size of this sink, the measurements of which are:\n\n(McLary's Kitchen Equipment)\n\nLength of Sink - overall - 50\"\nWidth \" inside - 48\"\nHeight \" overall - 26\"\nWidth \" inside - 24\"\n\nThe sink is divided into two sections by a partition across the centre, each section having separate drain hole.\n\nDepth at front and side - 18\"\nHeight at back, from bottom of sink to top of back - 57\"\n\nWe have just received notification from Mr. Phelan that General Steel Ware is unable to supply a sink of this type. He also sends us particulars regarding two white enamel sinks which could be procured, but we have decided that neither of these would be suitable and have written advising him to this effect.\n\nAs mentioned in yours of the 16th, we consider it would be advisable to send the old sink in and have a new tank installed in its place. This should however, be difficult to get along without the work until the fall holidays. If it was possible to have the work done early in July, if your Department would like to have it done earlier, please let me know and we will arrange to send it as directed.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nA.B. Charles, Principal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, May 4, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Agent Swartman has forwarded to this office a copy of his letter to you, of April 30. This was attached to a copy of his letter dated April 18 from the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School. No action is being taken on this letter until we hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout School,\nYour file 129-6-5, dated May 4th.\n\nIn my report dated February 16th, 1945, on this School, I recommended the repair work outlined by Mr. Cheales.\n\nThe boiler room is not at present sealed in overhead and therefore is very cold. This condition allows the escape of much of the heat badly needed throughout the main building. I presume Mr. Cheales has measured the room and the quantities of material should be fairly accurate.\n\nThe wash sink could be sent to Dufault Sheet Metal and Retinning Company, 693 Tache Avenue, St. Boniface, to be repaired. The cost will depend on the condition of the frame, and the size and weight of galvanized metal used.\n\nA.G.

A.B. Cheales, Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School:\n\n\"As we are re-decorating the school kitchen, we would indeed like to have the linoleum to put down on this rather dreary floor. We trust that this may be obtained in some rather light, mottled green shade, with continuous pattern throughout\u2014not a dark color.\n\n\"The chairs for pupils' dining-room, cream separator, sewing machine, toilet-seats and covers, circular-saw, and last but not least a boat of some type, are needed just as soon as ever possible.\n\n\"With our old Kermath Marine engine in Toronto, our outboard engine awaiting repairs, and no boat to put it on, when repair is available, we are indeed stranded, even as in winter. This, you will agree, is a most trying state of affairs, especially in case of sickness or accident. We trust that you may be able to convince the Indian Department of our immediate need of some type of boat with which we could at least get a pupil to hospital when deemed necessary.\"\n\nThese matters were all taken up in my report dated February 16th, 1945. I might add the saw was authorized and the order placed with Mumford, Meadland. The saw was to have been shipped within a few weeks. I am checking on this matter and no doubt the saw will be supplied.\n\nPlease advise Mr. Cheales concerning the other matters and forward a copy of your letter here for the files, so I can check on my return from the North in August.\n\n[Signature]\nAld.

The boys were very proficient but the girls, especially the younger ones were unable to use the escape with any degree of confidence. However, the Reverend Principal assured me he would see to it that they had plenty of practice in future. I might add that under certain conditions in the winter months, the iron pole fire escapes are dangerous for the inexperienced.\n\nAt the Sioux Lookout School the poles are inside the building. This arrangement permits the pupils to have more practice, although the efficiency of the arrangement is open to question. At the Sioux Lookout School twenty-two of the older pupils are enrolled in the Air Cadets.

(RC 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nDuring the interval between treaty payments, I took the opportunity to visit Pelican School, in company with Mr. Swartman. Generally the condition of the school was good, but attention should be drawn to two features which have in one case direct, and in the other indirect relation to the physical welfare of the pupils. Firstly, the boys' dormitory and to a lesser extent the girls' are overcrowded. In the former the beds are so close that they touch at the sides. This is bad, especially where the children are as susceptible to respiratory disease and tuberculosis as are Indians. It might be possible to put up quarters outside the school for the farm employees, who at present occupy an entire upper dormitory, freeing this space for pupils. Alternatively, double-decker beds, 18\" to 2' apart, would be better from a droplet-infection standpoint. Until something permanent can be done, the pupils should sleep head to foot alternately. I do not wish to be over-critical, but from the standpoint of public health the designation of a couple of three-bed rooms in Indian schools as preventoria is a travesty; if the entire residential school is not a preventorium what are we spending our money for?\nExtract from Report of Gordon L.

Firstly,\nthe boys' dormitory and to a lesser extent the girls' are\novercrowded. In the former the beds are so close that\nthey touch at the sides. This is bad, especially where\nthe children are as susceptible to respiratory disease\nand tuberculosis as are Indians. It might be possible to\nput up quarters outside the school for the farm employees,\nwho at present occupy an entire upper dormitory, freeing...\"\nthis space for pupils. Alternatively, double-decker beds, 18\" to 24\" apart, would be better from a droplet-infection standpoint. Until something permanent can be done, the pupils should sleep head to foot alternately. I do not wish to be over-critical, but from the standpoint of public health the designation of a couple of three-bed rooms in Indian schools as preventoria is a travesty; if the obscure residential school is not a preventorium what are we spending our money for?\"\n\nI would appreciate receiving your comments on the above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, October 31, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nI attach account amounting to $189.94, covering emergency repairs to equipment at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School inspected April 16, 1946.\n\nAt present there are enrolled Boys - 74, Girls - 83, a total of 157 Pupils. The grades are arranged in three classrooms and the pupils are making fair progress.\n\nThe dormitories were tidy and the beds neatly made. The beds are very close together and I am convinced that there is overcrowding.\n\nOne small dormitory about 16' x 36' x 10' high is used to accommodate staff members. If this were used for the pupils it would certainly relieve the crowded situation in the larger dormitories.\n\nThe laundry was not in use on the day of inspection. The stove used for heating the flat irons is only a cheap sheet metal stove and should be replaced at once. If a proper laundry stove is not available then a small kitchen range should be provided. I instructed Mr. Cheales, the Principal, to have the stove moved at once from its present location and to see that the pipes are made secure and the flue will be closed with sheet metal. For some unknown reason the owner had set the stove in one corner of the laundry room and the fire box and pipes were almost against the wall.\n\nIn my last report I stated that the building needed painting throughout and gave a list of paint which was supplied. Mr. Cheales stated he had been unable to secure his help and so none of the paint has been used. If this school is to be put in good condition a foreman with at least three helpers should be engaged for a month or six weeks. This work should be done in the summer while the children are away on holidays. The work should be started at one end of the building, and carried out in a methodical manner from top to bottom.\n\nA night watchman has been provided but on checking I find that the stations were only punched at 12, 2 and 4. I instructed Mr. Cheales that in the future the night watchman should make hourly rounds, starting at 9 p.m. and continuing until 6 a.m. He should visit all the stations and use his punch clock. In this way there would be an accurate record and reasonable protection.\nThe school is heated with wood. The supply at the school is small. The policy at this point in the past has been to start in and get the wood as required during the fall and winter. The pupils assist with the work. I think in fairness to the pupils and for the safety of all that there should always be available at the school at least a four months' supply of wood. I consider it the Principal's duty to hire men to cut, saw and split the wood before the snow is heavy and dangerous. I would request that this matter be brought to the attention of the Principal and also Dr. Alderwood.\n\nAt present eight cows are being milked. The supply of milk fluctuates about 15 gallons at night and 10 or 12 gallons in the morning. Cheese is now made to freshen so the quantity will gradually be increased.\n\nMr. Cheales stated that each week he received from plowing approximately 360 lbs. of beef, 70 lbs. of fish and 26 dozen eggs. He allowed the children one meal with two eggs each, two meals of fish although it appears slim rations. The arrangement leaves four days or about 640 meals that must be provided for with the 260 lbs. of beef of which probably 40 or 50 lbs. is bone. I consider the meat ration insufficient.\n\nA quantity of vegetables was grown at the school; but if the information supplied by Mr. Cheales is correct the children must have received a very light helping of potatoes. He stated their crop of 180 bushels lasted for six weeks. I purchased bread for 1\u00bd pence, most of them growing children could only provide a small helping and certainly no second serving. I would like to see the pupils provided with a good serving of meat, potatoes, gravy and if possible one other vegetable. Such a meal with a good helping of warm bread and dessert would I am sure provide a fairly adequate meal. Bread is used as a spread on bread and for some desserts the bread is spread with peanut butter, jam, honey, syrup or black molasses. Other desserts consist of pudding, dried apples, or prunes. The variety is quite good, but the quantity per individual at times appears small.\n\nThere has been a lot of sickness at the school during the winter; and some of the children appear pale and somewhat run down. No doubt now that the warm weather has come the children will be out more and health conditions will improve.\n\nThe war years has made it difficult to secure suitable staff help. At present several new working are well along in years and would recommend that as soon as possible they be able to replace the younger men and women. A younger staff would be more interested in the projects and would be able to join the pupils in these amusements. They would also have a greater capacity for work. Mr. Cheales claims some of the members are not physically fit to carry out the duties which go along with their position, thus it is impossible to keep the school as clean and tidy as is expected. The question of staff was also mentioned in my previous report.\n\nI am enclosing a classroom Growth Record Chart published by the Manitoba Department of Health and Public Welfare. I believe a similar chart should be issued to all.\n\nIndian Affairs.

BRANCH\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe refer to your letter of May 10th, 1946, in which you quote a paragraph from Inspector Hamilton's visit to our Sioux Lookout Residential School. We agree that the availability of wood for immediate consumption was no doubt low at the time of the inspector's visit but feel Inspector Hamilton has promoted a completely wrong impression, inasmuch as stating, and I quote: \"I consider it the Principal's duty to cut, saw and supply the wood because the work is heavy and dangerous. We have for several years employed at least three men for wood-cutting and sawing and have throughout this entire winter retained them at salaries and food costing in excess of $1,230.00 for the year. To elaborate on my point may I quote you a paragraph from a letter received in this office April 29th from our Principal. \"We have three men still working at the wood, and assigning Mr. William (Farm Instructor) in other ways, who will be entitled to another months' salary early next week. Will you please, therefore, send us the amount requested ($300.00) that we may pay the men and keep our account (fuel) in the local bank in good standing?\"\n\nI personally visited the school last fall and wood-cutting operations were under way but the boys did not appear to be doing more than the normal task of stacking the cut-lengths into piles. Dr. Alderwood and I feel confident that you need have no worry in respect to the boys being over-worked or employed in a highly dangerous occupation.\n\nYou will perhaps recall the statement in Dr. Gordon Bell's report mentioning the fact that school dormitory space was at that time being utilized for a gang of labourers. This happened so be our wood-cutters and although we feel alternative arrangements must and will be made for their accommodation in the future; it proves beyond doubt that we had employed men for this very purpose.\n\nThank you for drawing Inspector Hamilton's comment to\n\nOVER\nour attention and we are writing our Principal again stressing\nthe importance of neither over-working the boys or employing\nthem where risk of physical injury is imminent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJChF/DH\n\nAssistant Secretary-treasurer.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1946.\n\nTo: Chas.

CHEALES\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe: Estimates for current year\nPainting of school interior\n\nOn our list of estimates for the year 1946 submitted through local Indian Agent August 31/45, you will please note we listed:\n\nBuilding of a garage $500.00\n\" \" \" dock $400.00\nMaterial for well $300.00\n\nWe have already converted an outshed into a garage large enough for two cars; the school well is apparently in need of little repair, while the construction of a dock can be postponed for another year. I would urge that the amount of $1200.00 be granted to meet a more urgent need.\n\nYou will note from Doctor Bell's report on his last visit to our school, his statement that the whole interior of the school is in need of painting this summer. When Mr. Hamilton visited our school last year he remarked how much it was in need of re-decorating. On his recommendation over fifty gallons of paint was provided by your department for this purpose. This paint is still on hand. We have endeavoured for months to get local men to do the work, but all seem to have too much work in town to come out to the school. Again, on his recent visit just a few weeks ago, Mr. Hamilton agreed we need a crew of five or six painters to undertake and complete the work while the pupils are on holiday.\n\nMight I suggest therefore, that approximately $1200.00 of the amount granted by your Department to our school for this year, go toward painting of the school and residence interior. Furthermore, since we have been unable to obtain painters locally, will you please authorize either Mr. Swartman (absent for several weeks on treaty) or the Principal of the school, to secure painters wherever possible that the work may be begun early in July.\n\nSecondly, in regard to current year's estimates, we listed:\n\nBuilding of a small storehouse $500.00\nSmall Ammonium refrig. Plant $700.00\n\nIt will not be possible to have this storehouse built this year. Might we suggest therefore, that about $1200.00 be granted\nward either of the following:\n\n1. Having the school linked up with the Hydro line, via the new school road, which would require approximately three miles of poles and wiring.\n\n2. Constructing of a small residence near the school for the use of the Farmer or Engineer, both of whom are often married men desiring a separate residence.\n\nAs to the other items on our list of estimates, we still require them as listed, namely:\n\n- Eave troughing for school building: $250.00\n- Mattresses (single bed), at least 4 dozen: $275.00\n- Chairs, dining room: 1 dozen: $50.00\n- Cream Separator large: $60.00\n\nTrusting we may have a reply from you at earliest convenience, particularly as regards painting of interior of school, and constructing of a small residence for Farmer.\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery truly yours,\n(The Rev.)

The total amount requested is approximately $3,700.00. It was not found possible to include this amount in the current year's appropriation. As a matter of fact, we have only allotted for your school an amount of $500.00. We are prepared, however, to allow a slightly larger amount if the work you recommend is absolutely essential. Under the circumstances, it would be appreciated if you would give your requirements further consideration and let me hear from you again.\n\nYour quotation of $1,200.00 for labour for painting appears very high. Are we to understand that the 50 gallons of paint which we supplied and which you still have on hand would be sufficient to do the painting that is needed?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Neary's letter of July 19th File 129-6-5 (W.T. 1), with respect to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI only recently had an opportunity to discuss the situation with Reverend Cheales, and my impression is that he is very much discouraged and feels that he has not been given the consideration he deserves both by the School Commission and the Department. I understand he is resigning in the near future.\n\nRegarding requirements, Rev. Cheales has already stated these, and from what I have seen, every item listed is a necessity. My recommendations are as follows:\n\n1. Paint, and all materials necessary for the painting, should be supplied immediately, including lime for patting the walls and arrangements made to hire painters to do the necessary work. The work to be done as soon as paint can be supplied and painters are available. This has already been recommended by Inspector Hamilton, and a fairly recent report from Doctor Bell indicates the necessity of this work. The whole interior is so dingy and drab that it must be as depressing for the staff as it is for the pupils.\n\n2. A portion of the linoleum on the floor in the kitchen and dining room should be re-laid. There should be cement set between the cement floor and the linoleum, and this should be well cemented in order to keep it from bulging.\n\n3. Mattresses are urgently required\u2014approximately two dozen. We have no record during the past five years of mattresses being supplied to this School.\n\n4. Chairs are also badly needed. During the term, many of the children had to sit on boxes around the dining-room tables. In the winter, these boxes should be replaced. We have had some of the Indian parents tell us that while their children are at home they at least have chairs to sit on, if they wish, and in many cases this is quite true.\n\n5. A complete installation of eaves-troughing is required. This should be arranged so that it may be taken down in the fall, as the ice and snow which accumulate on the roof in the winter has a tendency to break the eave-trough. Without eaves-troughing the rain runs off the roof and finally into the playrooms. This of course makes the playrooms useless during a rainy period.\n\n-------over\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 6)\nIndian Affairs Branch - Cont'd.\n\nThese are some of the most important items as well as paint brushes etc., which Reverend Chales has listed.\n\nI know it will be quite a big undertaking to put this building in proper condition but very little was spent on maintenance during the war years. It might be a good idea if arrangements could be made to have some expert from the Engineering Branch look the situation over at this School.\n\nInspector Hamilton's instructions concerning the removal of the laundry stove to a safer location, and the proper installation of pipes, referred to in your letter of May 8th, have been carried out. The wood situation is about the same, and the night watchman makes hourly rounds at night until May 1st.\n\nUntil other arrangements are made for housing the staff members, they will have to continue using the small dormitory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe. File I29-6-5\n\nWe have as yet hardly recovered from the discouraging note in yours of June 19th., to the effect that your department has allotted the sum of but $500. for the current year's requirements at our school. It is inconceivable, to say the least, just why this school should be practically overlooked in this way, despite the fact that both Inspector Hamilton of the Indian Affairs, Winnipeg, and Dr. Bell, (the school Doctor) strongly recommended, on their recent visit to the school, that improvements be made.\n\nYou state further that you are prepared to allow a slightly larger amount if the work recommended is absolutely essential. I wish to go on record in reporting that such work as mentioned in the accompanying list is absolutely essential. Furthermore, unless a considerable sum is spent on repair and redecorating of the school building soon, it will not be a suitable place in which to house from 140 to 160 children and 17 of a staff. For instance, even as I write there are pools of water all over the floors in school basement, pupil's playroom, dining room and kitchen, from rain which has been falling intermittently for three days and running directly in through cracks in the foundation. Reason, no eave troughs ever put on school building, rain water rests on narrow walk round foundation causing depressions and cracks through which it runs into basement. Only solution I can see, is repair to foundation and eave troughs. Then again, the school veranda roof, not having sufficient slope, and many nail holes, leaks like a sieve, resulting in pools of water, //and, if cold enough, ice forming on veranda and fire escape stairs. We have applied tremco roofing, which lasts for a season, but if snow and ice left on roof during winter this material comes off with it. A solution would be putting more of a slope to the roof, and applying tremco or shingles.\n\nAs to redecorating interior of school, might I urge the need for action in this. The whole interior is terribly drab, dull, and prison like, never having been painted in over fifteen years. Being unable to obtain painters last summer I painted ceiling of pupil's dining room, and one dormitory myself. I found it a most tedious task -- alone -- and I do not intend a similar venture this summer. There being but one man here besides myself during the summer, and no boys, we can do little or nothing in this regard. The only way therefore, to get the job done satisfactorily and in record time, is to hire a number of painters, locally or elsewhere.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We hope to cover more of the basement floor with this material, but require linoleum cement, and carpet felt for this purpose.\n\nEnclosed is list of immediate requirements at our school, which, I again emphasize, are absolutely essential, and we would indeed appreciate the co-operation and aid of the department in getting on with the work promptly, before the pupils return from holiday.\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(The Rev.)

You will note that we are going ahead with practically all the repairs which you have requested.\n\nThis has been a most difficult summer for departmental officials. There has been a very heavy flood of requests for repairs, improvements and replacements from practically every Residential School in Canada. This had been anticipated as a natural result of the war years. But coupled with this have been the increases in costs of materials and labour. As a result we have been very sorely pressed to spread our very limited appropriations over the wide range of expensive requests received.\n\nYour letter is but one of the many that have been received, pointing out the urgent needs for repairs and improvements. We allotted you $500.00 as a temporary measure in our letter of June 19. During the summer we have kept your needs among the most urgent and pressing. Now we are in a position to allot more money. We hope you will understand the circumstances. If you could but see those appealing letters, you would better realize our position.\n\nWhen this year's repairs are completed, will you discuss thoroughly with Indian Agent Swartman your next year's requirements, so that they will be ready for submission by him for appropriations.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. A. B. Charles,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 19, 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSicamous Lockout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the Sicamous Lockout School, you may purchase locally the following:\n\n- 3 rolls of carpet felt,\n- Lime for plaster,\n- Cement for plaster,\n- 12 Ordinary Kitchen Chairs,\n- 3 Heller Centers,\n- 5 Paint brushes.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the paint, oil, varnish, linoleum cement and mattresses.\n\nYou may make the necessary arrangements for labour, but it is hoped that you will keep the costs as low as possible.\n\nWith reference to recommendation 5 in your letter, I am writing to the Survey and Engineering Branch, requesting that one of their officials look over the surveying situation.\n\nI have written separately to the Reverend Mr. Charles enclosing a copy of this letter.\n\nBernard F. Beatty,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 19, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nSicamous Indian Residential School\n\nIn a recent letter to the Branch the Reverend Principal wrote as follows:\n\n\"Furthermore, unless a considerable sum is spent on repair and redecorating of the school building soon, it will not be a suitable place in which to house from 140 to 150 children and 17 of a staff. For instance, even as I write, there are pools of water all over the floors in school basement, pupils' playroom, dining room and kitchen, from rain which has been falling intermittently for three days and running directly in through cracks in the foundation. Reason - no eave troughs ever put on school building, rain water rests on narrow walk round foundation causing depressions and cracks through which it runs into basement. Only solution I can see is repair to foundation and eave troughs. Then, again, the school verandah roof, not having sufficient slope and many nail holes, leaks like a sieve, resulting in pools of water, and, if cold enough, ice forming on veranda and fire escape stairs. We have applied trowel roofing, which lasts for a season, but if snow and ice left on roof during winter this material comes off with it. A solution would be putting more of a slope to the roof, and applying trowel, or shingles.\"\n\nIndian Agent Swartman has also commented on the above situation. Could you please have one of your officials inspect this school in order that the cost of necessary improvements can be ascertained.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, his report was not in sufficient detail to permit us to outline definitely what was considered necessary and some additional data were required. These data have now been received and we are having a plan prepared, together with an outline of what is considered necessary to overcome their difficulties. As the work will involve excavation and etc., it is not considered advisable to proceed with the same during the present fiscal year. However, an estimate of what is required together with the probable cost will be prepared and forwarded so that money can be made available early in the coming fiscal year.\n\n(Signed) D. B.

He was replaced by the Reverend Mr. Fisher, former Principal of Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. At the time Miss McCready visited this school, Mr. Fisher had only been there a fortnight. He has since visited the office and I feel certain that he will do everything possible to improve conditions at this school. I have suggested to Miss McCready that she visit this school again in the near future.\n\nIt is my intention to do as follows with these reports:\n\n(a) To send one copy to the Religious denomination concerned with the request that they be passed to the Principals of the schools inspected.\n\n(b) After the Head Office has seen copies of these reports, then I would like to send them to the\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect for the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI enclose herewith for your information a copy of my report to our Indian and Eskimo Commission on the site for the proposed School for the Lac Seul area. This report has been adopted by the Commission, and in due course our General Secretary will forward to your Department the action taken by the Executive Committee of our Society on the same.\n\nAn effort is being made to secure the services of the Rev. J.F.J. Marshall, Missionary to the Indians at Jack River, Norway House, for the position of Acting Principal from July 1st next. As he is now receiving $100.00 a month Bishop Dewdney is apprehensive that he may not be willing to accept a smaller amount.\n\nIn my opinion he is well worth the $100.00 and believe it would be to the advantage of your Department to secure him at this rate and pay his travelling expenses to Sioux Lookout, rather than engage an inferior man at a smaller allowance.\n\nI should, I suppose, address this letter with the enclosure either to the Secretary or to the Deputy Superintendent General, but I am forwarding it to you in keeping with my promise in this connection.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 2,\n1925\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a report with reference to our trip to the Lac Seul area for the purpose of selecting a site for the new residential school. I understand that the Rev. Mr. Marshall is a very practical man, and if he is appointed as Acting Principal it might be possible that we could arrange to employ him as Inspector of Construction on the work and in that way pay his salary. This matter will be taken up as soon as the contract is let for the building.\n\nI may say that the Ontario government have been communicated with officially with reference to the land we selected, but to date we have not heard from them. As soon as the site has been secured I will be glad to advise you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. CUMBERLAND,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. H.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 8)\nOttawa, 16 January 1947.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSIoux LOOKOUT, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation this afternoon, I wish to confirm the authority given you to purchase a new jacket heater and boiler from Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg, at a cost of approximately $930.00. It is understood that this is an emergency replacement at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease let me have a written communication from your office regarding the matter in order that we may have written information for our Purchasing Branch.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\n13th January 1947.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nThe Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I reported to you by telephone a few days ago, the hot-water jacket for supplying hot water to the whole of our school building cracked in such a way that it has been found impossible to repair it by welding. This means it will be necessary for a new one to be supplied as early as possible.\n\nMay I ask you to take immediate steps to approach the Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, with a view to obtaining the necessary replacement.\n\nFrom my personal observation since coming here last September, I would say the old hot-water jacket was not large enough. There never appeared to be sufficient hot water for our needs, and I would suggest that the Department be asked to supply something rather larger, possibly more of the boiler type of heater. The hot water storage tank is of about 2000 gallons capacity, and this should be a guide as to what is required.\n\nI feel sure the Department will not need to be reminded of the urgency of this matter, as at the present time we are entirely without hot water throughout the building, and we are hard put to it to carry on the laundry, wash rooms, and kitchen.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) G.W. Fisher,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to report that the hot water jacket heater at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School is broken. An expert welder from one of the local garages examined it and reported that repairs would be impossible. It had cracked a few years ago and temporary repairs were made at that time.\n\nVulcan Iron Works in Winnipeg advise they can supply a suitable unit for $935.00. This is larger than the one originally installed and should prove adequate to take care of the 2,000 gal. hot water storage tank.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter I am phoning the Dept. today. A copy of Mr. Fishzer's report on the subject is attached hereto.\n\nG3/jf\n\nEncl. 1\n\nJAN 20 1947\n\nG. Swertman,\nIndian Agent.\n**G.H.WOOD & CO.

Conditions in this school have improved when compared with last year. In carefully going over the children's weight it is noted that a gradual increase has occurred in almost every pupil since admission last September which would indicate that the diet is adequate in calories. I beg to recommend that an additional dormitory for help be erected at this school. I understand that the Rev. Principal has made application for this and it will do much to prevent overcrowding as at present the help are sleeping in the school building.\n| DATE       | INVOICE | DEBITS   | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|\n| March 28   | A 9071  |          |         |         |\n| 12         | Playground Balls @ Ea.$1.60 | $ 21.60 |\n| 6          | Playground Bats @ I 40 | $ 40    |\n| 1          | Volley Ball @ (1 Volley Ball Back Order) | $ 75    |\n| 2          | Volley Ball Nets @ $ 8.80 | $ 17.60 |\n| 2          | Footballs, Complete @ $ 7.75 | $ 17.50 |\n|            |         |          |         | $ 73.85 |\n| C.N.X.

Swartman,\nThe Indian Agency,\nSIOUX LOOKOUT, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing an estimate of the cost of providing dwelling space for locally hired staff, who at present occupy Dormitory \"C\" in the school building. With a pupilage of 71 boys this dormitory is urgently needed to provide adequate space for these boys.\n\nIf part of our present warehouse is taken for the above project, it will be necessary to provide additional warehouse space. This can be done by making a floor three feet below the plate of the building used for an ice-house, which would give an icehouse with nine foot walls, with warehouse space above. The warehouse would be entered by building an outside stairway.\n\nThe prices given are approximate, and are based on prices for material obtained from the Beaver Lumber Co., and the Patricia Lumber Co., of Sioux Lookout.\n\nIt is hoped the Department of Indian Affairs will see its way clear to provide funds for this work.\n\nAs you know, the whole of the interior of the School building requires re-decorating, and even if the Department were to provide the necessary materials, it would not be possible for the school staff to undertake this work.

An expert welder from one of the local garages examined it and reported that repairs would be impossible. It had cracked a few years ago and temporary repairs were made at that time.\n\nVulcan Iron Works in Winnipeg advise they can supply a suitable unit for $935.00. This is larger than the one originally installed and should prove adequate to take care of the 2,000 gal. hot water storage tank.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter I am phoning the Dept. today. A copy of Mr. Fisher's report on the subject is attached hereto.\n\n(Sgd.) G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\n13th January 1947.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I reported to you by telephone a few days ago, the hot water jacket for supplying hot water to the whole of our school building cracked in such a way that it has been found impossible to repair it by welding. This means it will be necessary for a new one to be supplied as early as possible.\n\nMay I ask you to take immediate steps to approach the Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, with a view to obtaining the necessary replacement.\n\nFrom my personal observation since coming here last September, I would say the old hot water jacket was not large enough. There never appeared to be sufficient hot water for our needs, and I would suggest that the Department be asked to supply something rather larger, possibly more of the boiler type of heater. The hot water storage tank is of about 2,000 gallons capacity, and this should be a guide as to what is required.\n\nI feel sure the Department will not need to be reminded of the urgency of this matter, as at the present time we are entirely without hot water throughout the building, and we are hard put to it to carry on the laundry, wash rooms and kitchen.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) G.W.

Mr. Swartman gave me authority to purchase this material.\n\nIn thinking over matters, I have come to the conclusion that rough lumber could be used in the place of the ship-lap asked for, without impairing the appearance of the work in hand, since this lumber would in any case be covered by wall board.\n\nSince the lumber required, will be made from trees cut on the School's concessions, there will be no stumpage dues, therefore the saw-mill operator will supply rough lumber for $45.00 per M. B. M. He will also supply the planed plank for steps etc. at $60.00 per M. delivered at the school. As you will see this will considerably reduce costs.\n\nWhen you get this, you will have already received my Night Letter re this matter.\n\nThe reason I have sent you this wire is: that the operator of the saw-mill, which is portable, wishes to move to another location as soon as possible.\n\nI shall be glad if you could send me an accountable cheque for the $175.00 allowed for labour costs.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gow\nRe: Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nOn Thursday, June 26, an examination was made of the above mentioned school with the view of determining the cause of leakage of water into certain parts of the school's basement, together with a suggested remedy and estimate of cost.\n\nAt times of rain it was reported that considerable water leaks through the front wall of the building and to a lesser extent through a side wall into the kitchen and girls' lavatory (see accompanying sketch). Good natural drainage is provided on three sides of the building. In front of the school, where the serious leakage occurs, a level lawn extends some 50 feet to an embankment. There are no eavestroughs on the building; consequently all storm water from the roof falls at the foundation walls, causing erosion scouring. A three-foot concrete walk in the form of a shallow \"U\" has been built partially around the school to prevent scouring and to lead the water away. This walk is now badly broken, very uneven, and has pulled away from the foundation walls. Instead of leading water from the foundation, it retains much water allowing it to seep through the ground near the foundation.\n\nIt is believed the following work would remedy the existing situation:\n\n1. Damp proof the north foundation wall from grade to footing,\n2. Lay 4\" field tile along this front wall at floor elevation connected to a line of tile leading to the edge of the embankment.\n3. Rebuild the grade in the vicinity of the kitchen and girls' lavatory to allow rainwater to run away from the building.\n\nD.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAug 26, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Indian Residential Schools,\nSicamous Indian Agency, Ont.\n\nYour attention is directed to our memorandum of October 26th, 1946, with which we forwarded a copy of Mr. Dew's letter of October 26th, 1946, replying to our request for an inspection report and estimate of cost for the repair of certain faults which had developed at the above schools.\n\nIt is evident that Mr. Dew did not have staff available to carry out this assignment until June 26th last, at which time Mr. Stormeter carried out an inspection. Under date of July 7th last, Mr. Stormeter submitted a report to Mr. Dew with an estimate of cost. Copies of the report and Mr. Dew's covering letter are attached for your information.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Stormeter confines his report to conditions affecting the school basement, and that no reference is made to ventilating repairs, the need for which was pointed out to Mr. Dew when the matter was initiated by our letter to him dated August 26th, 1946.\n\nOn analyzing Mr. Stormeter's report, it appears that he considers three items of work would prevent infiltration of water into the basement, namely:\n\n1. Damp proofing the north foundation wall from grade to footings.\n2. Lay a line of 4\" field tile along this front wall at floor elevation, connected to a line of tile leading to the edge of the embankment.\n3. Rebuild the grade in the vicinity of the kitchen and girls' lavatory, to allow rainwater to run away from the building.\n\nCommenting on these items we may say that in Item 1, we feel from Mr. Stormeter's estimate of cost, the type of damp proofing in mind, is an application of pitch or waterproof paint to the exterior of the north wall. If conditions are as described by the Reverend Principal, from whom a quotation was contained in Mr. Hoey's memorandum of August 19th, 1946, and in Mr. Stormeter's attached report, this treatment will not be satisfactory. It is recommended that a concrete waterproofing be applied to the exterior of the north foundation wall, consisting of two layers of heavy asphalt saturated felt with three coats of pitch binder applied hot. Over the membrane waterproofing there should be applied a protective coating one inch thick, composed of one part of cement to 5 parts of sand, to which should be added hydrated lime, amounting to 10% of the volume of cement. This treatment should be satisfactory for the north wall.\n\nReferring to Item 2, the laying of a line of 4\" field tile along the northerly wall, connecting to a runoff through the embankment should be satisfactory.\n\nEnclosure,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn replacing excavated material, it should be graded away from the building.\n\nMr. Storer's third recommendation to rebuild the grade in the vicinity of the kitchen and girls' lavatory is a definite requirement. In regard to an 8\" top layer of impervious clay 4 feet wide should be placed to drain away from the building. In addition however, it appears advisable to this Service to waterproof the inside of the west wall of the kitchen, and the second floor of the girls' hall where leaks have been noted. The treatment may be to apply two coatings of integral waterproof cement mortar, to a thickness of 5/6\". A good bond could be specified as no settlement of the building need be considered; the treatment should be successful in preventing further dampness at these points.\n\nWe estimate, that to carry out the work outlined herein Mr. Storer's estimate of $287.15 would be increased to approximately $390.\n\nAs previously stated, Mr. Storer's report makes no reference to the verandah roof. This item should not be a difficult matter for the Indian Agent or the school authorities to handle.\n\nIf work on the basement walls is approved, it is recommended that authority be granted for Mr. Dow to engage labour, and to purchase materials to the best advantage locally.\n\nJ.Mill\nChief Engineer.\nAugust 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of August 19th and previous correspondence relative to the above, I am enclosing for your information, copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills dated August 28th, together with copies of Mr. Gow's letter and Mr. Storsater's report referred to therein.\n\nMr. Mills' recommendations regarding what should be done to correct the situation with respect to water leaking into the basement of this school, are concurred in.\n\nIf you wish to have this work proceeded with will you kindly secure authority for Mr. Gow to engage labour and purchase material to the best advantage locally, and transfer $675 to our Engineering and Construction Service.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant\n\nIndian Affairs.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Estimates 1948-49,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nThe Principal of the above-mentioned school advises that the following services are needed. They are listed in the order of urgency indicated by him and with his remarks:\n\n(a) MAJOR REPAIRS TO BUILDINGS\n\nDepartmental Engineers have inspected the cracks in our foundations and the useless cement footing. Parts of the basement become flooded during periodical heavy rains, causing much inconvenience and discomfort. The footing should be removed, the foundations laid bare, and either tar, Tremco or Aquella applied to seal all cracks.\n\n(b) MAJOR REPAIRS TO WATER SUPPLY\n\nThere is an auxiliary or emergency pump engine in the pump house situated on the lake shore by the well. In case of emergency, water cannot be pumped by this engine from the well as the short piece of intake pipe from the well to the pump was cracked by frost two or three years ago and never repaired or replaced. At present, in case of emergency, water is pumped direct from the lake through a length of 2-inch piping. In winter there are obvious difficulties with this, and repairs should be effected before the frost sets in.\n\nThe well is about 4\u00bd feet square and about 8-10 feet deep. There is a bad crack horizontally about 6 inches wide just below the water level. This needs repairing and sand and dirt which has washed in needs to be cleaned out.\n(c) NEW CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS\n\nAn outside residence, preferably an eight-roomed duplex centrally heated to serve as married quarters for either farm instructor or engineer and also as quarters for the night watchman and permanent outside helper or for the accommodation of Indian visitors. There is more visiting here than I have found elsewhere.\n\nWith a full staff there is no waiting room in the school for visitors, no guest room, and, of course, no suitable accommodation for married staff members. There is a general shortage of storage rooms.\n\n(d) WARDROBES\n\nAdditional wardrobes of the type commonly supplied by the Department, for the children's clothing. At least a dozen could be built in the passage on the second floor, and another two or three dozen could be built into the four main dormitories. There is a general shortage of these.\n\n(e) GYMNASIUM AND WORKSHOP\n\nA two-storey outside building to serve as a gymnasium and workshop is desirable.\n\n(f) BREAD SLICING MACHINE\n\nA bread slicing machine (110 volt D.C.) is needed in a school with a large enrolment to eliminate one of the chores. Miss McCready, a recent visitor from the Nutrition Division, Dept. of National Health & Welfare, has strongly recommended this addition to our kitchen facilities.\n\n(g) REPLACEMENT OF GARAGE\n\nThe shed which serves as a garage is fit to collapse and its foundation also needs repair. It should be torn down and rebuilt as far as possible with the lumber salvaged to serve as a combined garage and workshop.\n\n(h) WATER LINE\n\nOwing presumably to the site of the former water tower, water is at present pumped into the school tanks by a circuitous channel and the lift is something like 25 feet. It could be brought by a straight and shorter course from flowing water and the lift reduced to 10 feet.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous letter, I am not certain whether you can assist us in the provision of machinery but,\nin case you can, I quote the following from the Principal's submission:\n\n\"Medium-sized Fordson Tractor for general farm work.\n\nThe school formerly owned one. There is a good deal of land, heavy clay for the most part, which could be cultivated more economically and efficiently with a tractor than with horses. A fair amount of freighting has to be done throughout the year and our local roads are bad. A tractor would help to keep roads open and do heavy hauling.\"\n\nAnything you can do towards the inclusion of these services in your Departmental Estimates for 1948-49 will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/BP\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant re requirements at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThe contents of your letter will receive very careful consideration when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor General G.R.

Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MD\nOttawa, October 24, 1947.\n\nMr. Gifford Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 6th instant and previous correspondence with reference to the request of the Sioux Lookout Residential School for 1,000 bags of Zonolite. Purchase of this material will involve an expenditure of over $1,100., as it will cost approximately $1.14 a bag, f.o.b. Sioux Lookout.\n\nWe have already authorized considerable expenditure at the Sioux Lookout School this year and our funds are becoming limited. In addition we are not certain if the school staff are capable of properly insulating the building even if the material was supplied.\n\nWe would like you to give the matter further consideration and write to us again.\n\nBernard F.

However, when that time does come, we shall ask you to give consideration to the provision of the oil heater.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/3F\nOttawa, October 31, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th instant with reference to heaters that you consider are necessary at the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of these heaters would be approximately $57.65, plus the cost of the stove pipes and elbows.\n\nIn order to expedite the matter, I suggest that you place the order and when you receive the account from Eaton's you should forward it to this office for payment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor Gen.

C. R. Turner\n\nMr. P. N. Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nInsulating of Attic,\nAnglican Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nIn a recent letter the Principal of our school at Sioux Lookout mentioned the need of insulating the attic, pointing out that a considerable saving in fuel would be effected if this were done.\n\nI wrote him for particulars and in reply he stated that he understood that your Agent there had requisitioned 1,000 bags of Zonolite for this service and that he understood that your Purchasing Branch had invited tenders for its supply.\n\nLater I requested the Principal to make inquiry of your Agent and find out how the matter stood. He has just replied that he has been in touch with your Agent who has informed him that the work had not been approved by Ottawa.\n\nThe Principal goes on to say that, apart from the heavy consumption of fuel, the fact that the attic is not insulated creates a dangerous situation which he describes as follows:\n\n\"The entire roof of this school is covered with metal sheeting. Snow settles on it and since a great deal of heat goes out through the roof, this thaws and freezes into ice. Dangerous icicles form and falling ice sheets are a positive menace to the children, particularly on the girls' side. One or two in recent times have had narrow escapes from serious injury or death. The wooden outside steps from the chapel and the cement walk around the footing of the school show evidence of this periodical battering.\n\n\"From the point of view of efficiency and economy, it\nwould be money well spent to insulate this building.\"\n\nThe Principal advises that the only expenditure necessary would be the actual cost of the insulating material because his engineer is an experienced carpenter and builder who can easily perform the work of installing the insulation.\n\nI understand that some funds still remain in the allotment provided in your 1947-48 Estimates for this school which would go far towards the cost of the insulating material. If this is correct and if there is no technical objection to installing this insulation, it will be appreciated if the matter can be reconsidered. It would appear from what has transpired that the Principal's recommendation has the support of your Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/BP\nMr. P. N.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRefrigeration Facilities,\nAnglican Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario\n\nRecently I have been drawing the attention of several of our Principals to the extremely uneconomic practice of purchasing small quantities of meat at a time and in every case the reason given is lack of refrigeration facilities. I then asked for reports on the existing refrigeration facilities.\n\nAs regards Sioux Lookout, the Principal's report is as follows:\n\n\"Our refrigeration facilities are certainly not modern. Outside there is an icehouse which probably stands on poor foundations since it has settled on one side. Here it is very difficult to keep a week's supply of fresh meat and fish in good condition during the summer months. Inside the school, in the pantry, there is an old-fashioned icebox refrigerator, 5 ft. high by 4 ft. wide by 27 ins. deep.\n\nI rather think that Mr. Fisher requested from the Department as part of the 1947 appropriation for this school an ammonia refrigerating unit operated by 110 V. D.C. electric plant. The locker would have to be big enough to hold up to about 400 lbs. meat, etc. There is room in the pantry for a good-sized Frigidaire or similar unit capable of serving the domestic needs of a school of this size. Perhaps I should add that the principal's residence has a smallish ice-box refrigerator which seems to be very imperfectly insulated.\"\n\nI imagine that, if the various services we have requested already for this school (insulation of attic, overhaul\nof heating system, provision of heaters) are carried out, the allotment in this year's estimates for this school will be exhausted. Further, I presume that your Departmental Estimates for 1948-49 already are prepared and it is now too late to make special provision for any additional items in them. However, I presume also that, following your normal practice, you have made some provision in your 1948-49 Estimates for general services at each school, including Sioux Lookout, and perhaps this would cover the provision of adequate refrigeration facilities there next spring; if not, would you be good enough to keep this service in mind when you prepare your Supplementary Estimates for 1948-49?\n\nThe storage of meat, fish, etc., should present no problem at Sioux Lookout from now until the end of next winter but I would like to see more adequate refrigeration installed there before the warm weather sets in next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/EP.\nOttawa, November 18, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letters of the 8th and 12th instant regarding the following matters in connection with the Sioux Lookout Residential School:\n\n(a) Refrigeration Facilities\n(b) Heating System\n(c) Insulation of Attic.\n\nWe are communicating with Indian Agent Swartman. On receipt of his reply your communications will have further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor Gen. G.R.

Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nRe: Insulating Attic - Sioux Lookout Residential School\n\nWe have received another letter from the M.S.C.C. in connection with the above. This letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The Principal goes on to say that, apart from the heavy consumption of fuel, the fact that the attic is not insulated creates a dangerous situation which he describes as follows:\n\n'The entire roof of this school is covered with metal sheeting. Snow settles on it and since a great deal of heat goes out through the roof, this thaws and freezes into ice. Dangerous icicles form and falling ice sheets are a positive menace to the children, particularly on the girls' side. One or two in recent times have had narrow escapes from serious injury or death.

In your letter of October 29th you\nexpressed doubt that the staff alone could properly\napply the material. Possibly a new engineer has been\nengaged since your letter was written.\n\nPlease let me have a further letter from you\nin regard to this matter.\n\nBernard F.

There was a heating expert from Cranes Ltd., in Fort William, who visited the School a few years ago and made certain recommendations. I do not know whether these were carried out or not. I have requested the Principal to check on this.\n\nWe shall endeavour to have Mr. E. Carroll (employed as a stationary engineer and handyman by the Canadian National Railways) go out to the School at the first opportunity and size up the situation.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wickenden assures me that members of the School staff under the supervision of Mr. Otto, the engineer, could apply the Zonolite. The installation of the material is actually quite simple but nevertheless I am unable to guarantee they would do a proper job. However, Mr. Wickenden is more familiar with the capabilities of the engineer than I am.\n\nAs pointed out in our letter of October 29th the insulation would cut down the fuel costs and naturally add to the comfort of pupils and staff. It should also tend to prevent the snow from melting on the roof and creating a hazard to the pupils when playing outside, as well as causing damage to basement windows.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have had numerous complaints from Indian parents during the past few years on the condition of the meat supplied to the pupils. The ice-box in the pantry is certainly not very efficient particularly in the warm weather when it is required most.\n\nA refrigerating unit or frigidaire installation would overcome all this difficulty. Would it be possible to obtain something along this line from War Assets, although it may be difficult to obtain a plant operated by ILO v. (D.C.).\n\nSwartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 8)\nRe: New Equipment (Electrical) For the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nThe following information is required:\n\n1. A detailed description of the generator now in use including all available information regarding watts capacity, voltage, speed and type of winding. Nameplates are usually furnished on the generator giving this information.\n\n2. Describe in detail the control panel listing all equipment and describe exactly how the prime mover is controlled i.e., whether automatic relay electric start, manual push button electric start or by some other method.\n\n3. Have the controls given any trouble in the past and if so state fully and give dates. Are the controls now operating satisfactorily?\n\n4. Determine how many days the fully charged battery will supply the load demand before recharging is necessary.\n\n5. List the wattage of all lighting outlets, appliances and motors (indicating their service) in use in each building supplied by the lighting plant and state the time in hours each is used daily. Observations should be taken each day over a period of one week, the results tabulated and forwarded with the report.\n\n6. Prepare a sketch showing the relative locations of all buildings supplied with electricity and indicate the distance between same. Mark the location of power plant and power lines between buildings.\n\n7. Give any additional information in detail concerning the operation of the equipment at the school, that requires power in its operation, and which may have a bearing on the size of the diesel electric unit required.\nYesterday we had Mr. L. A. Anderson of the Fairbanks Morse Co., of Winnipeg, visiting the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the purpose of inspecting the pumping equipment etc.\n\nHis recommendation is to replace the present generating unit with a complete new Diesel 110 Volt A.C. outfit. This would mean that a separate electric motor would be used to drive the line shaft or a motor for each of the various pieces of equipment operated by electric power. Such an outfit would cost in excess of $6,000.00 which is probably out of the question. Mr. Anderson informs us that the Fairbanks Morse stock a Continental motor 20 H.P. at $850.00 which is immediately available to replace the Lister. He also reports that the generator requires an overhaul. The bearings are loose and the commutator is worn. This should be attended to immediately. The auxiliary pump is also reported beyond repair and should be replaced with a new 2500 gallon typhoon pump.\n\nSome years ago I recommended that an investigation should be made as to the possibility of extending the hydro into the school. There is at present a power line to the Radio Range Station situated approximately two miles from the school.\n\nGS/VE\n\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\nVK230 23/22 COLLECT DL-WINNIPEG MAN 29 330P\n\nW M VINCENT\nDEPARTMENT PURCHASING AGENT DEPARTMENT OF MINES\nAND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT.\n\nRETEL SORRY WE HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER IN A 14 H.P.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 8)\nEnclosed herewith, is a letter from the Rev. D. C. Wickenden, Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, with respect to the purchase of an electric refrigeration unit for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nI have inspected this refrigerator and it appears to be in first class shape. There is the matter of converting or replacing the motor from A.C. to D.C. I believe Mr. Cosco might be induced to supply the proper motor to be included in the price he is asking for the refrigerator.\n\nIt is recommended that if the purchase of this machine be approved, an agreement be made with the vendor to install it in the school.\n\nGS/VE\n\nW. Swartwood,\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\nRev. D. G. Wickenden,\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Residential School\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nMay 6, 1948\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of February 19 concerning the type of refrigeration installation required at this school, and further to recent conversations upon the subject, I now wish to submit the following recommendation in writing.\n\nThe proprietor of Cosco's Grocery, Sioux Lookout, Mr. Pete Cosco, intends to enlarge his premises this summer and, incidentally, to increase his refrigeration facilities. He has for disposal about the end of June a Walk-in Refrigerator of the type and dimensions required here. It has a 6 ft. by 8 ft. floor with a nine foot ceiling. There is a blower type coil in the refrigerator and freon gas is compressed by a Brammer compressor operated by a half H.P. motor. The manufacturers are Ryan Bros., Winnipeg. I understand that the refrigerator has been in operation for about five years. It is in excellent condition and has been regularly inspected and maintained. Mr. Cosco is asking $350.00 for it.\n\nPersonally, I feel satisfied that The Indian Affairs Branch could do no better in purchasing a refrigeration plant for this school than by dealing with Mr. Cosco. I, therefore, request that you satisfy yourself that this is a good business opportunity and that you will kindly submit my recommendation to The Director of The Indian Affairs Branch. It should be noted that the motor for this installation is for 110 v., A.C., whereas we should need a 110v., D.C. motor. An exchange of motors through some Winnipeg agency would involve little extra expense.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The latter will be unable to deal with matters calling for urgent attention at the school owing to absence on Treaty trips.\n\nLast October I, when writing to our Administration in Ottawa in connection with your Departmental Estimates for the year 1948-9, I listed as Urgent our need at this school of outside accommodation for married staff members. This need has become the more apparent during the current year, for our ability to retain the services of our young farm instructor, married since October last and with his wife expecting a child next month, will depend upon our providing him with suitable married quarters. Whereas none in the school itself, positively. For the summer months he is prepared to take up quarters in the warehouse, where a single room, 9 ft. by 23 ft., was lined with ten-tent and otherwise made fit for habitation last fall. At present this room is entirely lacking in furniture and equipment, apart from a new kitchen range and stove pipes provided by our Administration. A double bed can be transferred from the school, but for other necessary items we have to look to the government for assistance. I may say that this warehouse is built over the main school root-house - this cellar being decidedly unsatisfactory for the safe storage of potatoes etc., in severe weather - and for this reason Mr. A. G. Doucet is opposed to any additional expenditure by The Indian Affairs Branch with a view to making permanent married quarters in the warehouse.\n\nWe had the idea of hauling a commodious log structure from its present site in a pasture, where it has been used as a coal shed or implement shed, to better one, and of applying for a grant for building material and labour in order to have it converted into a dwelling. But to this scheme Mr. Doucet also said No. He was not satisfied with the present condition of the shed. He did say, however, that you might be prepared to provide a two-bedroomed prefabricated bungalow of the type erected for the Forestry Branch and latterly for small day schools etc.\n\nSince it is absolutely vital to the success of our school...\nwork in general that we secure and retain the services of able-bodied men I am making this urgent request that immediate sanction be given for the provision this summer of such a dwelling as Mr. Doucet recommends. I may say that I have on my staff a young man skilled in the use of tools who will be here during July and August and free to work full time on such a building project. We will be returning to college in the fall. It would also be possible for my two other male workers to devote a good deal of time to the building, provided it is undertaken without delay.\n\nMr. Swartman advised me some while ago that no funds were provided in the appropriation for the year 1948-9 for further work on the branch road to the school, but suggested that I provide for an amount of, say, $2000.00 towards road improvement in my estimates for next year. May I state now that while the road needs considerable attention I would much rather see such a large sum devoted to improvement of our actual school premises and establishment as being far more vital to the well-being of both pupils and staff.\n\nLet me add another word to give point to my request. Lack of married quarters, as much as anything else, has kept the school without an engineer (other than the principal) since the retirement of our former engineer at the close of 1947. It appears that the only prospects for the position of engineer have been married men with families, and for such, as I have already said, there is no proper room inside or outside the school. Those charged with the administration of this school are placed in an unfavorable light when things go wrong with the pupils, as they do occasionally. Any inefficiency, however, attributable to staff deficiencies resulting from inadequate accommodation, cannot fairly be blamed upon us.\n\nI append a list of furniture needed to make our warehouse ready for occupancy and I trust that you will kindly have these articles supplied at your earliest possible convenience. In ordering I am considering the possibility that some of the items may later be transferred to permanent married quarters:\n\nOrder from Eaton's S.& S. Cat. '48 or similar:\np.354 Congoleum, 2 yds. wide (J) 78-L76 4\u00bd yd.@ $2.55\ndo. do.

(as commonly supplied for staff rooms)\n\nIn conclusion I should be glad to know what is the total sum provided in the appropriations for new construction, repairs etc. at this school and any information you can give me respecting the walk-in refrigerator requested for this school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has for disposal about the end of June a walk-in refrigerator of the type and dimensions required here. It has a 6 ft. by 8 ft. floor with a nine foot ceiling. There are blowers operating in the refrigerator and frozen gas is compressed by a Brunner compressor operated by a half H.P. motor. The manufacturers are Ryan Bros., Winnipeg. I understand that the refrigerator has been in operation for about five years. It is in excellent condition and has been regularly inspected and maintained. Mr. Casco is asking $350.00 for it. Personally, I feel satisfied that the Indian Affairs Branch could do no better in purchasing a refrigerator plant for this school than by dealing with Mr. Casco.\"\n\n\"There is the matter of converting or replacing the motor from AC to DC. I believe Mr. Casco might be induced to supply the proper conversion to make the machine more suitable for the refrigerator. It is understood that Mr. Casco would be prepared to install the machine in the school.\"\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

School.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, the Superintendent, is away paying treaty, and will not return until the end of the month. Apparently nothing has been done by him regarding the setting up of the new Lister Diesel Engine, which was recently purchased. As stated in my letter of May 26th, it is necessary to have it mounted on a new frame, as the engine purchased is 1000 revolutions, and the old engine was 600 revolutions. The generator also needs overhauling and setting up.\n\nI am enclosing herewith the price of Mumford, Medland for this work, which does not include a man going down to set up the plant - $674.00.\n\nWill you please advise me what to do in this matter? I am going to Sioux Lookout on Thursday, and will advise the condition of the school and plant, as apparently we will have to do a lot of repair work this summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Attention Mr. W. Davis.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to the diesel generating equipment for the Indian School at Sioux Lookout, we have checked the generator and find that the commutator needs some repair and complete rewind of the rotor will probably be required. Since this is an old type machine it is difficult to estimate the total cost of reconditioning it, we would say it would be in the neighborhood of $200.00.\n\nOur records regarding the generator available at Gordon School, show that it is only 3 KW., and consequently not large enough to use for this job.\n\nAs an alternative to repairing your present generator, we would offer the following new machine.\n\nONE - Only 6 KW. Marble Card Generator, 125/160 volts, D.C. 1800 R.P.M., shunt wound, 400C rise.\n\nPRICE .................................................. $ 374.00.\n\nWe could then mount this machine on a fabricated steel base with the diesel engine and supply a suitable V-belt drive. This together with the present switchboard would provide a complete unit for the school at Sioux Lookout.\nOur price for the above including repairs to the switchboard would be\n\nPRICE ........................................... $300.00\n\nThis would make a total for the whole job of\n\nTOTAL PRICE .................................... $674.00.\n\nThis would be Net, f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nThe generator can be supplied immediately from Winnipeg stock, and work on the unit could commence immediately upon receipt of your instruction.\n\nTrusting that we shall receive your valued order to proceed with this work, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMEDLAND MACHINERY LIMITED.\n\n(Sgd TG.H.

Since then, however, he has heard nothing further about the matter. What further brought the question of a refrigerator to mind at this time was the fact that a Mr. Pete Cosco of Sioux Lookout is dismantling such a refrigerator and wonders if the Indian Affairs Branch is interested in purchasing it for the school.\n\nRefrigeration is of vital concern in the safe and hygienic keeping of economical cuts of meat and early action in this connection would be appreciated.\n\nI am sure the Indian Agent at Sioux Lookout could inform you accurately regarding the condition of Mr. Cosco's plant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE: 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO: Rev.

Superintendent Swartman writes as follows:\n\n\"The proprietor of Cosco's Grocery, Sioux Lookout, Mr. Pete Cosco, intends to enlarge his premises this summer and, incidentally, to increase his refrigeration facilities. He has for disposal about the end of June a walk-in refrigerator of the type and dimensions required. It is in a first floor, six foot floor with a nine foot ceiling. There is a blower type coil in the refrigerator and freon gas is compressed by a Brunner compressor operated by a half H.P. motor. The manufacturers are Ryman Bros., Winnipeg, and the whole refrigerator has been in operation for about five years. It is in excellent condition and has been regularly inspected and maintained. Mr. Cosco is asking $350.00 for it.\n\nPersonally, I feel satisfied that the Indian Affairs Branch would do no better in purchasing a refrigerator plant for this school than by dealing with Mr. Cosco.\"\n\n\"There is the matter of converting or replacing the motor from AC to DC. I believe Mr. Cosco might be induced to supply the proper motor to be included in the price he is asking for the refrigerator. It is understood that Mr. Cosco would be prepared to install the machine in the school.\"\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

There is nothing on hand to spare for this purpose, since staff rooms, in many cases, are inadequately or poorly furnished. I have only requisitioned for articles essential to ordinary comfort and to the credit of the institution. Table tops in the children's dining hall are in bad condition in some instances and the linoleum in staff bathrooms is worn into holes. Metal angle for the corners of dining tables was off the market for some time, but no doubt this very necessary item is to be obtained nowadays.\n\nI trust that the list will be approved and the articles supplied in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\n27th July 1948\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nThe Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nVOTE Allotment\n\nSHIP TO The Principal, Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\n\nPELICAN, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required See covering letter.\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n| Quantity | Description | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------|------------|-------|\n| 4        | Fire Hose - Chas.

All the items and repairs listed are very necessary.\n\n(a) The electric ironer for the laundry would eliminate the necessity of employing a man with papers as is required at present. The ironer now in use requires certain repairs before it is servicable.\n\n(b) The engine in the Pumphouse is in a very bad state of repair and should actually be replaced, but I believe we could have it repaired or overhauled so that it would serve its purpose for another year. The intake is now being repaired by the plumber and helpers who are at present working on the septic tank system.\n\n(c) Regarding the foundation, it is difficult to estimate the repairs required. I had Mr. Head, contractor, look it over, and he was of the opinion that considerable excavating would be required before it could be properly inspected, but as mentioned in a previous letter, he is in a position to take on the work required. On this type of job, he will only work on a cost plus 10% basis. I would suggest that the necessary work in connection with the repair of the foundation be attended to this fall. There were certain recommendations submitted by an Engineer of the Engineering and Survey Branch about two years ago and the\nwork could be carried out according to his suggestions.\n\n(e) The road leading to the School has not had any maintenance for the past two years. It requires considerable graveling and filling in certain sections. At present it is almost impassable, particularly in wet weather. However, I believe that for an expenditure of approximately $500.00, the road could be put in shape to handle the necessary traffic until early next summer. I would recommend that sufficient funds be provided next year to do a proper repair and maintenance job on the road. This would probably require $3000.00 or $4000.00 depending on the extent of the work.\n\n(f) Painting: A paint job is badly required, both inside and outside from the basement to the top floor. Some of this work could be carried out during the fall, but it is rather difficult to do much indoor painting while the children are in school. It is also difficult to estimate the cost of such a job since a great deal of preparatory work is necessary such as plastering, cleaning the walls, preparing surfaces, crack filling etcetera, prior to painting. However, I believe $1000.00 would go a long way toward completing this work.\n\nThe floors in the dormitories are actually in a very bad state of repair, and something should be done. The beds have no castors or other protective device on the bottom of the legs, and I believe this should be rectified before the floors are repaired. While this appears to be a very simple matter, it is actually rather difficult to keep anything on the legs of the beds, as the children will remove anything movable. Possibly someone in the Department may have some good suggestions in this respect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lockout Agency\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION          | PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------------------|-------|--------|\n| 4        | NO. 36-10 STUDY CHAIRS 16\" | $6.50 | $26.00 |\n| 3        | NO. 11 TABLES        | $16.00| $48.00 |\n\nTotal: $74.00\n\nJ.M.

We explained the necessity for this purchase in our letter of September 8. Mr. Evans, however, is unable to give us any specifications of the ironer required as he has no catalogue showing equipment of this nature. We have requested that he let us have further details in order that a requisition may be prepared but it has occurred to me that you or someone in the purchasing department might have knowledge of an ironer suitable for a school laundry.\n\nG. Swartman\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\nDuring a recent visit to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School the condition of the lighting system was brought to my attention. It appears that when the motor is not running the lights will only come on very dim and are of no value whatsoever unless the motor is operating.\n\nWith the winter months approaching I would recommend that arrangements be made to have a service man sent in as there is no one locally familiar with this type of lighting system. Those whom I have asked for an opinion state that it may be the batteries and to replace them would be very expensive.

J.N. Evans\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince receiving the Globelite battery questionnaire we have established that your type W13-56 cell, 110 volt - 270 Amp. Hour Globelite Battery was purchased in July 1942. Your present load is far in excess of the capacity of the battery, with the result it is necessary to run the plant every day. In view of these operating conditions, we would say the battery is ready for replacement; in fact, you are fortunate it has carried this load and has evidently given you reasonably good service since July 1942.\n\nYou will note, in referring to our current price list enclosed, glass jar farm light batteries are guaranteed seven years and the guarantee is based on 600 cycles, that is 600 complete charges and discharges. We would say that this battery, under existing operating conditions, has delivered 600 cycles in the first two years of operation.\n\nIn establishing the seven year guarantee, it is based on the average use of isolated lighting units, chiefly in farm homes. It is recommended to purchase a battery of sufficient capacity to carry the load for four or five days and under these operating conditions the batteries serve, in most instances, for considerably more than seven years.\n\nAs pointed out previously, the battery in use in the school is a type W13-270 Amp. Hour capacity and it would be our recommendation when replacing the battery to buy a much larger capacity battery and as the minimum size we would suggest our type W17-360 Amp. Hour capacity.\n\nIncidentally, the department purchase batteries at a substantial discount off the list prices shown and we would like you to know that an order for a replacement battery will be taken care of promptly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED\n(Signed) R.W.

J.N. Evans\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince receiving the Globelite battery questionnaire we have established that your type W13-56 cell, 110 volt - 270 Amp. Hour Globelite Battery was purchased in July 1942. Your present load is far in excess of the capacity of the battery, with the result it is necessary to run the plant every day. In view of these operating conditions, we would say the battery is ready for replacement; in fact, you are fortunate it has carried this load and has evidently given you reasonably good service since July 1942.\n\nYou will note, in referring to our current price list enclosed, glass jar farm light batteries are guaranteed seven years and the guarantee is based on 600 cycles, that is 600 complete charges and discharges. We would say that this battery, under existing operating conditions, has delivered 600 cycles in the first two years of operation.\n\nIn establishing the seven year guarantee, it is based on the average use of isolated lighting units, chiefly in farm homes. It is recommended to purchase a battery of sufficient capacity to carry the load for four or five days and under these operating conditions the batteries serve, in most instances, for considerably more than seven years.\n\nAs pointed out previously, the battery in use in the school is a type W13-270 Amp. Hour capacity and it would be our recommendation when replacing the battery to buy a much larger capacity battery and as the minimum size we would suggest our type W17-360 Amp. Hour capacity.\n\nIncidently, the department purchase batteries at a substantial discount off the list prices shown and we would like you to know that an order for a replacement battery will be taken care of promptly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED\n(Signed) R.W.

Mr. Davis informed me that one of the schools in Manitoba was in the process of being connected to the Hydro system and that he understood there was a fairly new set of batteries. I would suggest that this be investigated and, if there were not sufficient cells in the bank or set, new ones could be added which should not involve a great deal of expense.\n\nThere is a Hydro line to the radio range station which is within approximately 1/2 miles from the school and, if arrangements could be made to have a line extended to the school, our difficulties regarding light and power would be ended.\n\nDr. Wood informed me that he gained the impression during a recent visit to this school that it was unnecessarily dirty. I assured him that I would request the Principal to correct this situation and it would be appreciated if you asked the Superintendent of the School Commission to do likewise.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I asked Mr. Head to figure on each job very closely and he assures me that he has done so.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to know just what is the most important job but to the writer all of them are important and necessary.\n\nRegarding the painting Mr. Head informs me that he has taken on painting contracts for various Government Departments and the requirements sometimes vary, however, two or three coats would be required and the preparation of the walls for painting is somewhat difficult to figure out. The contractor seems to be of our opinion that plus cost basis would be the most satisfactory solution for the paint job and he states that if a quotation is required he will be willing to spend a day going through the school again and preparing an estimate.\n\nG.

Joint on hall wall at kitchen to pile wood against\u2014the sum of Eleven hundred and Sixty-nine Dollars and Eighty-six cents ($1,169.86)\n\nStripping V.

It was only on Tuesday that I learned of the accident but in the meantime the Principal had arranged with Head Construction for the necessary repairs and replacement parts. Mr. Head informs me that the main bearings, the connecting rods and valves were burned out and had to be replaced. His theory is that the damage was caused to start with by lack of water in the cooling system. This allowed the motor to heat and burn up the oil. I am also informed that on a previous occasion the rings seized up possibly due to overheating. The school was, of course, without lights and sufficient water for four or five days which is quite a serious situation particularly at this time of the year. With proper attention a motor of this type should run for two years or more with only minor adjustments.\n\nThis school insofar as maintenance which includes cleanliness of the buildings and pupils is making very little progress. It is all very well for the Department to take all the necessary steps to affect repairs and spend money on equipment and maintenance but this is practically wasted when there is not sufficient staff or staff of the proper calibre to do their part.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Head states that the rooms originally intended for showers would easily accommodate six units and that he would install same at an approximate overall cost of $30.00 per unit. This would mean building a cement floor, tiling the walls, partitioning the showers, furnishing the shower units, and attending to the necessary pipe fitting. If funds are available, I would recommend that arrangements be made to have at least four shower units installed in both the boys' and girls' side.\n\nI have also asked Mr. Head to let us have a figure on the cost of painting and plastering the different sections of the building. A certain amount of work should be done immediately in the boys' washroom where the plaster and wallboard particularly on one end of the room are in an exceptionally bad state of repair. It seems to me that two or three men could be employed on maintenance at this school for the remainder of the winter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\n\nIndian Affairs.

Swartman Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nI wish to explain some of the reasons for employing Mr. Peter Seymour in a temporary capacity at the Sioux Lookout I. R. S. from December 28 to January 9 inclusive.\n\nMr. Seymour was formerly engaged as manual training instructor at McIntosh and has been employed as handyman, carpenter, etc., at the Lac Seul and Osnaburgh nursing stations during the past several months. He reported here the morning of December 28, enroute to Lac Seul, but owing to the conditions at the Sioux Lookout School, I persuaded him to go there for a few days and to remain if possible until his services were urgently required elsewhere, or at least until the Principal and Night Watchman returned. No person at the school seemed to know exactly how long they would be away.\n\nI was particularly concerned regarding the total lack of supervision of the boys. During the holiday season they came to town en masse and had been seen at different times crossing the thin ice just below the stretch of open water, west of the C. N. Railway bridge.\n\nThe Night Watchman's duties at this time had been delegated to Joe Aschin, a very unreliable boy for this type of work. I believe that he was the only adult male staff member living in the main building at the time as Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Barker were living in the cottages. During this period I visited the school every day as I was very worried about the whole situation. Mr. MacDonald, the Vice-Principal, did not know, according to his own admission, the exact location of all the fire hose outlets. I discussed this with him, also with Seymour.\n\nMr. Seymour was instructed to be on the alert during the night and to keep the boys occupied during the day and prevent them from coming to town if possible. He did all this and more, consequently it is recommended that he be paid at the rate of $5.00 per day for his services during the time he was at the school. This has been covered by our Voucher No. 16.\n\nIt is also recommended that Mr. Seymour be engaged as manual training instructor at both the McIntosh and Sioux Lookout Schools. He could spend three days a week at both schools. I fully realize that there is a full time job for such a man at either school but three days a week would be much better than the present arrangement. I also feel that there is an urgent need for a man of Seymour's ability and character at both schools. Mr. Doucett will be discussing this matter in Ottawa but I thought it advisable to place my views on record also.\n\nSuperintendent, Sioux Lookout Agency\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 14 Jan   | To allowance toward Manual Training          |        |\n|          | Instructor at Sioux Lookout Day School       |        |\n|          | for the month of December, 1948              | 65.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Above all, the battery room and the battery bank and connections must be kept CLEAN at all times. Nothing causes such equipment to deteriorate quicker than dirt, dust, grease, etc. Further, the supplier's instructions regarding charging, testing, maintenance of electrolyte, etc., etc., must be strictly followed.\n\nIn order that this new battery can be looked after properly and intelligently, please write the Company direct for instructions and information on the care and maintenance of this equipment. If they fail to supply this promptly, please let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The installation is already underway although the workmen are being held up for a few days on account of lack of materials.\n\nA copy of our letter dated December 9 is enclosed herewith.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\n\n[Stamp]\nJAN 25 1949\nA.M.\nREGISTERED\n\nGS/RF\nEnc.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario  \nDecember 9, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nReferring to Colonel Neary's letter of October 22, File 470-5 (E.1), with respect to the possibility of installing showers for the boys and girls at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I wish to advise that we have recently received a quotation from the Head Construction Company on this work. Mr. Head states that the rooms originally intended for showers would easily accommodate six units and that he would install same at an approximate overall cost of $30.00 per unit. This would mean building a cement floor, tiling the walls, partitioning the showers, furnishing the shower units, and attending to the necessary pipe fitting. If funds are available, I would recommend that arrangements be made to have at least four shower units installed in both the boys' and girls' side.\n\nI have also asked Mr. Head to let us have a figure on the cost of painting and plastering the different sections of the building. A certain amount of work should be done immediately in the boys' washroom where the plaster and wallboard particularly on one end of the room are in an exceptionally bad state of repair. It seems to me that two or three men could be employed on maintenance at this school for the remainder of the winter.\n\nG.

This is in very bad condition and needs a thorough overhaul.\"\n\n2. \"Heating. This is by low pressure steam system of gravity type. It is found difficult to heat the classrooms and sewing rooms and principal's house. A vacuum pump should be installed without delay. The boilers are two Pascol locomotive type No. 610, manufactured by the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company.\"\n\nCanon Cook advised that the situation with regard to the plumbing and heating at this school has been becoming worse and that he is concerned with the possible effects on the health of the staff and the pupils. Therefore, it would be appreciated if you could have one of your engineers visit this school and prepare the plans and specifications for the repairs and replacements necessary to restore these systems to the proper state of efficiency.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb 1 | Supplies for Lighting Plant at Sioux Lookout | 7.45 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFebruary 11, 1949.\n\nRe: Cottage\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nDuring my recent visit to Sioux Lookout School I had the opportunity of inspecting the recently constructed cottage, for the use of the engineer or farmer on the premises. It is a very fine building, well constructed and most suitable for the purpose for which it was constructed. However, it was noticed that the interior was unpainted, without water and bathroom facilities, without floor coverings and furniture. In discussing this with Indian Superintendent Swartman I was informed that no further funds were available from this year's appropriations. This I can well believe considering what has been done in the way of supplying new electrical equipment and work on the roadway.\n\nI am wondering if sufficient funds have been asked for in the next fiscal year to do the work necessary, properly to establish the cottage and build and establish a second such building as was considered in 1948.\n\nAt the moment furniture is urgently needed for use of the farmer at present occupying the cottage. Would the Indian Affairs Branch be willing to reimburse the Administration out of the next fiscal year's funds if the necessary furniture were purchased now by the Administration and the \"paid\" accounts tendered after the first of April?\n\nYour consideration of this point and others above would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will communicate with Superintendent Swartman with regard to the additional work which you consider is required at the cottage recently erected for use of the engineer or farmer at the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nWith reference to the latter part of your letter, we supplied furniture at a cost of $165.13 in July, 1948. This was intended for one of the buildings occupied by a married member of the staff. We have no funds at the present time to purchase additional furniture. Present regulations regarding purchasing do not permit us to authorize you to purchase furniture on the understanding that you will be paid for it from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

This building would be erected adjacent to the rink and be used for the pupils to put on their skates as well as store their skates and equipment when not in use.\n\nMy idea is to have the older boys erect the structure as a project under the supervision of Mr. Seymour.

The amount is $1,275.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMEDLAND, MACHINERY, LIMITED.\n\nE. A.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n14th March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI wish to acknowledge Colonel Neary's letter of February 23, File 470-5 (E.1), with respect to furnishings for the new bungalow at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. We submitted a requisition covered by our letter of December 1, 1948. The requisition listed every item asked for by the Principal. We were informed by communication from the Superintendent of Education, dated December 20, File 470-5 (E.1), that owing to lack of funds the furniture would not be secured at the present time and we advised the Principal accordingly.\n\nI agree with Canon Cook that the interior should be painted and that water and bathroom facilities should be installed. However, I do not feel that it would be practical to undertake any of the plumbing work required until the frost is out of the ground. I also suggest that the items listed on our requisition dated December 1 be revised and that someone more competent than either Messrs.

The engineer, Mr. Burley, appears to be a first-rate man and at present is occupying the apartment at the east end of the building which is usually occupied by the Principal. This means that when a new Principal is appointed, providing he is a married man, Burley will have to seek quarters elsewhere and there is not any other suitable place for him. He appears to be fairly content with the present arrangement but I am certain that he will not stay unless he has satisfactory living accommodation.\n\nWhile on the subject of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I would suggest that arrangements be made to explore the possibilities of extending hydro power from the radio range into the school, a distance of approximately two miles, as I am afraid the new power plant will not stand up to the load it now has to carry.\n\nG.

The appropriation for the new fiscal year will then be available, and we will be in a better position to decide if we can provide the funds.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your marginal notation of February 7th on Major MacKay's memorandum of February 4th in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur heating engineer carried out an inspection of the mechanical services at the above, on the 6th and 7th of March, and the results of his survey are summarized below together with recommendations; for your information and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nGenerally the condition of the building and its mechanical services may be described as having had hard usage and there is little evidence to show that reasonable care and maintenance have been provided in the past. In spite of this, the building appears to be sound and could be put in better than average condition, if immediate steps were taken to carry out repairs and revisions hereinafter outlined.\n\nThe Donald Inspection Company's survey indicates serious plumbing and drainage discrepancies. While it was impossible to check the condition of the sewage disposal field owing to the presence of several feet of snow, it can be safely assumed, that the arrangement of gang closets would contribute to unsatisfactory operation of the sewage disposal field as well as the septic tank. The two groups of gang closets are under continuous flushing by overhead automatic water tanks. This keeps the septic and disposal field flooded and prevents proper bacterial action from taking place in the tank. It is also likely that the disposal field will be sour and sodden.\n\nThe drainage lines appear to be properly sized and careful enquiry showed that most of the trouble due to blockages, result from bottles, tins, and other sundry items being forced into the system. It was suggested to the Acting Principal by our officer, that stricter discipline be maintained in the recreation rooms to prevent the pupils from wilfully throwing such items into the drainage system.\n\nThe domestic hot water system is served by a generously sized jacket heater which is connected to a 300 gallon domestic hot water storage tank. No complaints were received about the inefficiency of this system, but it was noted that the distribution piping to the fixtures, was undersized. Many of the faucets on basins and bathtubs were in need of overhaul and in some instances, replacement.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nSince no complaints with regard to this system were brought to the attention of our officer, it is felt that for the time being this layout should remain undisturbed. It is also felt that satisfactory repairs to the existing faucets can be made by the new caretaker as required.\n\nMost of the complaints centered on the heating system. While the original plan was followed closely, a careful study indicates that the design is not suitable for a building of this character. No traps were installed on the mains and as a result, they are not well drained. Instead of traps, bleeder connections between the ends of the main and the wet return were installed. These connections were hooked up in such a manner as to cause many short circuits, and as a result, distribution of steam to various parts of the building is very unequal. Some rooms are cold while others are greatly overheated. The branch mains to the Principal's quarters, are too small, improperly installed, not dripped, and not graded in accordance with required standards. These branch mains will have to be removed and replaced by piping of proper size.\n\nAbout 65 to 70% of the radiator traps were found to be passing steam and will have to be replaced. Repairs to traps as old as these, is not practical and could be more costly than replacing them with new traps. Most of the radiator traps are damaged or worn out and quite beyond repair. For your information under good conditions, radiator traps can not be expected to perform their functions longer than 15 years. This system has been in use over 20 years.\n\nThere are two Pascol steel low pressure steam heating boilers, each rated at 4000 sq.ft. E.D.R. Either one should be able to handle the entire load under normal conditions, except in the most severe weather when both must be used. They are hand fired and a fair grade of bituminous coal is provided. These boilers were found to be in relatively good condition. They should be provided with new grates and they should be thoroughly cleaned. It is felt that they can be expected to give service for an additional period of 10 years, provided that the school is fortunate enough to retain the services of the present caretaker, who started in January of this year. This man appears to be much more competent that the general run of boiler room staff encountered in residential schools. If the following recommendations are carried out, it is felt that the heating difficulty will be overcome.\n\n1. Install new radiator valves and traps on all radiators.\n2. Install float and thermostatic traps on the ends of all steam mains.\n3. Re-grade spring pieces and lateral connections to radiators and risers.\n4. Remove and re-route some sections of the wet return piping.\n5. Provide and install a condensation return pump and replace the cut-moded and damaged boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly.\n6. Execute minor piping changes in the boiler room.\n7. Remove gang closets and replace with individual tank units.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nOn verbal request of the Indian Affairs Branch, the above revisions are now being planned. It is our understanding that they are strongly desirous of having this work carried out as soon as possible. At this time, it is not possible to provide a close estimate of the cost of the above operations, but it is felt that the sum of $6,000.00 will be required.\n\nCommenting generally, it can be stated that the interior decorations are not in a good condition. The roof leaks in several places, and some water comes in to the basement through the walls. The kitchen stove is practically burned out; and in our opinion, is a serious fire hazard. It should be replaced at the earliest possible moment.\n\nWhen authority is received to get this work underway, we will take the necessary steps to have Mr. Gow call for tenders.\n\nChief Engineer\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Major Mackay's memorandum of March 17th bearing your notation of the 19th instant, you are advised that in our opinion, it will not be necessary to close the above school earlier than usual on account of the proposed heating repairs.\n\nIt is felt that the time occasioned by the preparation of plans and specifications and the letting of a contract, will mean that the actual work can not be started until the middle or the end of June. It is anticipated that this work can be carried out in approximately two months time.\n\nAs stated in our previous memorandum, plans and specifications are now being prepared and upon completion, Mr. Gow will be requested to obtain prices from reliable firms in the area.\n\nWhen the tenders are received and analyzed, you will be further advised.\n\nR.A.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWalk-in Refrigerator\nAnglican Indian School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your 129-6-5 (E.1) of 2nd July, 1948, following is an extract from a letter of 23rd July, 1948, written by our Principal at Sioux Lookout to your Superintendent there:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt to the Department of the following articles requisitioned for use at the school:\n\nWalk-in Refrigerator, in sections, delivered by Mr. P. Cosco of Sioux Lookout, including compressor and blower and necessary piping.\n\nD.C. Motors, one for the compressor and one for the blower have not yet been delivered, but Mr. Cosco has ordered them from Winnipeg. The original motors, A.C., were not suited for operation here.\n\nA great amount of trouble has been experienced with the mechanical apparatus of this refrigerator. On General Turner's visit to the school on 19th October, 1948, the unit was out of action because the motor was not working and he arranged with Mr. Swartman that the latter would get after the local electricians in Sioux Lookout to expedite repairs. By the time that Canon Cook visited the school on 7th November, 1948, the unit was operating but the motor was still giving trouble. Subsequently the unit failed again and in his report following his visit to the School on 28th January, 1949, Canon Cook noted that the \"refrigerator will be in operation shortly\".\n\nOn 22nd February, 1949, the Principal reported that \"the compressor motor is now operating but the motor for the blower had to be removed once again for further repairs. The unit is, therefore, still insufficient\". Our latest report from the Principal is dated 26th March, 1949, and states that \"the School walk-in refrigerator is not working; it never has been satisfactory\".\nIn the light of the foregoing I am certain you will agree that the situation is far from satisfactory from the standpoint of laying in supplies of perishable or semi-perishable foodstuffs because the Principal never knows when the unit is going to fail. It will be appreciated therefore if steps are taken at an early date to replace the present unsatisfactory mechanism by a unit that can be relied on so that the refrigerator may be 100% serviceable by the time the warm weather arrives. As you know, it is both expensive and inconvenient to transport perishable and semi-perishable foodstuffs daily from the town of Sioux Lookout to the School having regard to its location and the only satisfactory solution is a walk-in refrigerator that can be depended upon to function properly.\n\nWill you please let us know what you can do in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n7th April, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM. S. C. C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo\nwith reference to the refrigerator at the Sioux\nLookout School.\n\nA copy of your letter is being forwarded\nto Indian Superintendent Swartman, and as soon as\nhe replies, we will write to you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n7th April, 1949.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Canon Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C. His letter explains itself, and we would like to have your opinion regarding the refrigerator.

Neary\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of May 9th file 470-8 (E.1) with reference to repairs required for the Lister Diesel Engine at the Sioux Lookout Indian School. This is the new engine purchased last year from Medland Machinery Ltd. The crankshaft broke across the webb halfway between number one connecting rod bearing and centre main bearing. I understand from Mr. Wickenden that this may have been due to a flaw in the metal, my personal opinion is that the motor has been overloaded and overworked. The cylinders were badly scored last year and it may be necessary to replace the sleeves on two of them. The engine was sent into Winnipeg on Monday and as yet we have no report from Medland Machinery as to the full extent of the damages after they tore it down for complete inspection.\n\nAt present the school is without lights, and the water is supplied by the auxiliary engine which is also in a rather bad state of repair. We have asked the local Fairbanks Morse representative to check over this installation and let us have a report. As soon as this is received we will reply to your inquiry of April 23rd, file 470 - 5(E).\n\nG. Swartman,\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\nColonel B.F.

I am writing Principal Wilson the information given in Mr. Phelan's letter and am asking him to explain the whole situation to Burley. It might well be that a new engineer will have to be found for Sioux Lookout. At the moment the Administration cannot afford the additional expenses as suggested in your last paragraph.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nMay 26th, 1949.\n\nMr. G.

I suggest that you obtain from the firm a definite opinion regarding what caused the machine to break down so soon.\n\nThe Medland Machinery Limited is a big firm, and I am certain that they will tell you if the breakdown is due to a defect in the machine or if it was caused by improper operation of the machine.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

It had a sort of funny knock so I immediately reported it to the Indian Agent so the Department will not think our Engineer is careless. He looks after the machinery like a hen looks after her brood.\n\nWhile we were without the Diesel we had the wood engine brought in from outside and ran it for lights and laundry. It helped greatly but the emergency water supply pump and engine needs some going over. Through time we may be able to get at it and see what can be done. I believe when Mr. Hargreaves was here he recommended a new set-up altogether.\n\nRe: Kitchen Stove\n\nMr. Hargreaves apparently recommended that the Kitchen Stove be replaced with a new one as the present one is a fire-hazard. Nothing has come forward in connection with any of the reports from Mr. Hargreaves.\n\nIt will be greatly appreciated if favourable and early consideration can be given to the implementation of Mr. Hargreaves' recommendations, and this office notified as soon as possible of the action that you decide to take in regard to them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRes: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of June 21st, which bears your marginal notation of the 23rd instant in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOn April 27th, we forwarded plans and specifications covering heating revisions at the above to Mr. Gow, and requested him to obtain competitive tenders from reliable firms in the area.\n\nOwing to the more or less isolated location of this school and due to the fact that contractors in that area are very busy, only one price was obtained. This tender was submitted by the John Plaxton Co., Ltd., of Winnipeg, who are presently engaged in work at the Sioux Lookout hospital and for that reason are in a particularly favourable position to take on the work at the school.\n\nTheir firm tender of $4,919.00 accompanied by a security deposit of $450.00, is within our estimate of $6,000.00. This matter was discussed with Indian Affairs Branch officials and it was indicated that authority should be given to have the work carried out by the above firm. It was pointed out that a contingency of 10% should be added to the contractors price to cover supervision, etc., and with that in mind, authority should be requested through an Order-in-Council to provide the sum of $5,400.00.\n\nWhen written approval is received from the Indian Affairs Branch, we will request Mr. Gow to instruct the contractor to begin work at once. In the meantime, an Order-in-Council will be prepared for signature, requesting authority to have the sum of $5,400.00 set aside for this work; together with contract forms for signature by the Department of the contractor, so that work may be carried out with a minimum of delay.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nColonel B. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWalk-in Refrigerator\nAnglican Indian School, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your conversation this morning with General Turner, hereunder, as requested, is a copy of a report just received from our Principal at Sioux Lookout. The arrangements with Ryan Bros. were made, of course, through your Mr. Davis' Office.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will do something at an early date to ensure that this walk-in refrigerator is put in proper working order so that we may store foodstuffs in it without the risk of them being lost through failure of the refrigerating system. As you know it is both costly and inconvenient to buy foodstuffs on a basis of day-to-day requirements for even the numbers at this School during the holiday period.\n\nLast Monday General Turner made arrangements for the Ryan Bros. to send a man to examine and if possible to repair the compressor unit so as to get the WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR working. The man came on Thursday from Winnipeg and after working at the motor from 10.30 a.m. till 5.30 p.m., he left after having no success. I saw him before he boarded the train back to Winnipeg and he said we would either have to ship the whole Unit to Winnipeg or have a completely new one. In the meantime, I have had meat and butter go bad in the Ice House. I am afraid I will have to purchase meat, butter and eggs, in fact all food that is perishable from the local stores until the Refrigerator is fixed. It has been out of working order since the 13th of June. Until last Tuesday we have been able to keep some meat and butter in the Ice House but this last four days it has been hopeless to try.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, July 7, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\nRes. Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nYour file I.A. 1356-31\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of June 27th regarding the revision of the heating plant at the above school.\n\nIt is noted that an amount of $5,400 is required for the purpose and funds are available in our appropriation. We are prepared to transfer this amount to you when requested.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would have the work carried out at the earliest possible date as we would like to have it completed before September 1st on which date the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/IM\nJuly 7, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Res. School\n\nI desire to refer you to our letter of June 16th addressed to Mr. Swartman, a copy of which was forwarded to your office.\n\nThis referred to the walk-in refrigerator at the above school. I appreciate your prompt action in having a representative of Ryan Brothers visit the school. In a letter received today from the M.S.C.C., they quoted as follows from a letter they received from the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School:\n\n\"Last Monday General Turner made arrangements for the Ryan Bros. to send a man to examine and if possible to repair the compressor unit so as to get the walk-in refrigerator working.

Until last Tuesday we have been able to keep some meat and butter in the Ice House but this last four days it has been hopeless to try.\"\nIt is presumed that the man from Ryan Brothers will now be in a position to advise you exactly what should be done. We are inclined to feel that a new unit is required.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would obtain specific information from Ryan Brothers regarding the repairs necessary to this refrigerator and if they recommend a new unit you should obtain specific information from them regarding what should be supplied and also a quotation and forward these to us as soon as possible. We would like to have the refrigerator in proper working order at an early date.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJuly 11, 1949.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nInspector R.S. McBurney on his last inspection of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School reported on Miss Martin's room as follows:\n\n\"More cupboard space is needed. At the present time, orange crates are used for the sets of readers and workbooks. More blackboard space in this classroom would be of advantage.\"\n\nWould you please ascertain the size of cupboard and blackboards that are required for this room.\n\nBernard F.

You stated that you had already instructed Mr. Swartman to furnish particulars of the type and catalogue number required but, if General Turner should find on his visit to this School on 27th June, that no action had been taken you would like General Turner to obtain the necessary particulars from the Principal and let you have them direct.\n\nGeneral Turner found, on inquiry at Sioux Lookout, that no details had been sent in to you by Mr. Swartman's office and the following information on the equipment required is therefore passed to you herewith as arranged. The Principal has already given this information to Mr. Swartman's office:\n\nFirst Choice\nAshdowns Catalogue, Feb. 1946, Page H-143\nTWO Ranges, #10-30, Square with high shelf, wood-burning grates.\nThe reason for asking for two medium-sized ranges is for economical operation when numbers are small during holiday periods.\n\nSecond Choice\nAshdowns Catalogue, May, 1946, Page H-142-7\nONE Range, #224, with double high shelf, provided that wood burning grates can be substituted for coal burning and that the firebox is\n\n(P.T.O.)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nlarge enough to heat the two ovens (one on each side of the firebox) properly with the use of wood fuel.\n\nIt is emphasized that the range or ranges supplied MUST be equipped with WOOD-BURNING grates as wood is the fuel used at this School for cooking purposes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nReferring to your 470-5(2.1) of 25th March, 1949,\nI was informed during my recent visit to Sioux Lookout that\nyour Mr. Swartman wrote you on 27th May, 1949, recommending\nthe provision of a new Fairbanks-Morse engine for this system.\nMay we be informed, please, if provision of this\nengine has been authorized.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 7, 1949\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nGlobelite Battery - Anglican Indian School, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter 470-5(E.l) of 22nd January, 1949, you requested that definite instructions be issued to the School that the new battery receive every possible care and attention. Such instructions were issued to our Principal on 24th January as per copy sent you on that date.\n\nFollowing my recent visit to Sioux Lookout I had occasion to write Globelite Batteries, Ltd., Winnipeg regarding instructions to the Engineer in the matter of charging the battery and the following is an extract from the reply received from them today:\n\n\"We have for acknowledgment your letter of July 4th and in reply wish to advise that our Mr. Thurston recently paid a visit to the Residential School near Sioux Lookout.\n\nThe principal points that should be carefully watched are temperature and vibration. Never permit the temperature to rise over 120\u00b0 F. This can be easily checked with an ordinary dry bulb thermometer by inserting same through the vent hole in the cover of one of the battery cells. Also, the battery should be cushioned in some manner to reduce excessive vibration. Our Mr. Thurston advises that when he called at the School, he noticed that the vibration from the engine caused the battery to excessively vibrate. We might suggest that cork approximately 1/8\" thick be placed under the battery stand to eliminate this excessive vibration.\"\n\nThis matter is brought to your attention because, as both the engine (the Lister for driving the electric generator) and the battery referred to were installed recently by your Branch, it is presumed that you will want to give favourable and early consideration to the provision of the cork cushioning suggested by Globelite Batteries, Limited, so that the life...\nof the battery may be prolonged by the elimination of the excessive vibration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

The company replied to them in part as follows:\n\n\"The principal points that should be carefully watched are temperature and vibration. Never permit the temperature to rise over 120\u00b0 F. This can be easily checked with an ordinary dairy thermometer by inserting same through the vent hole in the cover of one of the battery cells. Also, the battery should be cushioned in some manner to reduce excessive vibration. Our Mr. Thurston advises that when he called at the school he noticed that the vibration from the engine caused the battery to excessively vibrate.

This firm stated that they could not obtain qualified steamfitters and did not wish to tender on the heating work.\n\nOne tender only was obtained, that from the John Plaxton Company Limited, Winnipeg, and this has already been accepted from our side, pending its acceptance. As I have mentioned, the work will be carried out in accordance with designs prepared by this Branch and will be supervised by an engineer from our Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Winnipeg.\n\nWhile the plumbing system is antiquated, it was decided by Indian Affairs to defer action for the time being on the overhaul of the plumbing installations, but I can assure you that when these operations are undertaken, the Amos Company will be given an opportunity to tender.\n\nIf there is any further information you desire in connection with this project, do not hesitate to write to me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

The report referred to in Mr. Davis' letter is attached hereto. It is regretted that this was not previously forwarded to Ottawa but from the letter we had from Mr. Davis' office I was under the impression that the report had been forwarded direct to you and we merely received a copy of same.\n\nThe school is urgently in need of this equipment and the need will be even greater after the school re-opens in September.\n\nG. Swartman\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\nRYAN BROTHERS WESTERN LTD.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJuly 8, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nAttention Mr. Rayson,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to advise that our engineer having just returned from a service trip to Sioux Lookout, has reported to us that he was unable to complete satisfactory repairs, due to the condition this equipment was found to be in. The valve plate on the compressor must be replaced, also the rings and wrist pins, bearings, etc., are bad, and he felt it better that the compressor be returned to us for a complete over-haul, or that in view of the location, it be replaced with a new machine.\n\nThe price of a new Condensing Unit, with controls, but less D.C. Motor - the present D.C. motor to be used - on the new machine, would be $235.00. Add Winnipeg, over and above the cost of this new unit as above specified you would have the cost of labour, installing, travelling time and travelling expenses.\n\nWe attach herewith our invoice for expenses already incurred, and will hold the matter in abeyance pending your further instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRYAN BROTHERS WESTERN LTD.,\n(sgd.)

Storsater from the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, 532 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Manitoba pay us a visit to inspect the work done on the steam-heating by the Plaxton Co. recently.\n\nWhile here he mentioned that his last visit two years ago was to inspect the boys' Playroom and Kitchen walls to see what could be done to stop the water flooding the said P.r and K. floors on rainy days. He was astounded when I informed him that the water still came in much to the inconvenience of all concerned.\n\nMr. Swartman brought him out but had to get back to a pressing engagement so I was a bit disappointed as I would have liked to have taken Mr. Swartman on a tour of inspection around the building to show him the deplorable state of the plumbing etc. However, while they were driving here, Mr. Swartman asked the inspector to examine the Plumbing in the Boys side of the building and send in his recommendations to the proper authorities.\n\nI would like to recommend that all the toilets in the building be repaired as not one of them is in good working condition and at times one wishes it were fashionable to parade around the inside of the building with an umbrella as it has been a common occurrence to have an unwanted shower from the top floors not only from the Dorms but the staff B.Rs and the infirmary bath room.\n\nMr. Storsater said he was not here to inspect the plumbing but would send in his recommendations if they were worth anything.\n\nI trust the plumbing can be overhauled at this school in the near future and anything that you can do to bring this to pass will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) J.S.

Swartman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School - Your File 146/6-1-470\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 11th and your telegram of August 30th, we have discussed with the Lands & Development Services Branch, the condition of the toilets, etc., at the above school.\n\nFrom the information we have received, we are inclined to feel that the condition of the toilets is due in part at least to lack of supervision on the part of the school management.\n\nHowever, we are prepared to allow an amount of $250.00 for reconditioning the toilets and the mechanism of the tanks. It is not considered necessary to replace all the toilets at the present time. You can arrange for the expenditure of the amount stated to carry out the repairs suggested in this letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMr. Phelan:\n\nIroner for Sioux Lookout.\n\nI have flagged two letters which indicate that about a year ago there was a conversation in which the possibility of getting an electric iron was discussed. There is no written record of its being promised.\n\nThe addition of an electric iron might overload the electric plant which has given a lot of trouble.\n\nThere has been nothing about seeing whether the \"ancient steam iron\" could be restored to working order.\n\nC.E.A.C.\nSeptember 10th, 1949.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nWe have received a request from the head office of the M.S.C.C. to supply an electric ironer at the above school.\n\nIt is our understanding that the operation of an electric ironer is extremely hard on the batteries, and under these circumstances, we doubt if it would be advisable to supply an electric ironer.\n\nFrom information on our file, we believe that there is a steam ironer at the school. This may not be in running order, but we would like to know if repairs could be made to it. If not, we would like to have your comments on the necessity for supplying a steam ironer, and if you think a new one is necessary, please give us an estimate of the size and cost of the ironer which you think should be supplied.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\n112 Fifth Ave., South,\nKenora, Ontario.\n6th September, 1949.\n\nHon.

It would appear that the amount of $250, authorized for reconditioning toilets, etc., would not go very far toward a general overhaul and installation of new toilets. There are two of the upstairs toilets which will have to be replaced as they are cracked thus causing a certain amount of seepage. The others all require overhauling. The installations in the basement are actually in the worst shape. The toilets in both boy's and girl's washrooms are in very very bad condition. The cement toilets tank on the boy's side is possibly cracked. At any rate there is seepage causing a very offensive odor throughout the lower part of the building. The plumber could not suggest any means to repair the tank, therefore the only alternative would be to remove the cement tank and install six individual toilets. Urinal should also be installed in this washroom. The wash basins are also in a very bad state of repair - several of the taps do not work and others have handles broken off; most of them should have new washers as they are leaking all the time. The wash basins should be discarded and the new modern sink type installed. This type consists of a large sink with three taps on each side which would enable six persons to wash at the same time. Two of these units would be sufficient.\n\nThe plumber estimates that it would cost approximately $1000, to do the above work, however we would appreciate your remarks in this matter.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 22, 1949\n\n17561\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nAttention - Director of Indian Affairs\nCopy for Director of Lands and Development\n\nAttached hereto is copy of a letter dated September 21st addressed to the Minister by Mr. W.M. Benidickson, M.P., regarding the condition of the plumbing in the Indian School at Sioux Lookout, Ontario. I understand that Colonel Neary is in the Port Arthur area at the present time. I do not know whether the situation would warrant his proceeding to Sioux Lookout. The Minister would like a report on this matter dealing particularly with the situation from a health standpoint.\n\nCould the condition complained of be remedied by more careful supervision than has been given by the staff of the School? Has an estimate been prepared of the cost of replacing the fixtures? Could money be made available this year, and is the situation at Sioux Lookout more serious than that existing in other schools?\n\nA copy of the interim acknowledgment made to Mr. Benidickson by the Minister is attached for your information.\n\nMr. MacKay\nMr. Gibson\nFor attention and necessary action.\n\nW.C.

Many of the rooms showed evidence of Summer painting and there is still a considerable amount of this type of work as it can be appreciated that old buildings, under\nthe best of management, are hard to keep looking right.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD) W.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nOttawa, September 26, 1949.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Bethune's memorandum of September 23rd addressed to the Deputy Minister, bearing your marginal note of the 23rd instant together with copies of correspondence between the Minister and Mr. Benidickson in connection with the above, you are advised as follows.\n\nA perusal of our files with reference to the above, discloses that the only complaint received was in connection with the heating system. This was registered in Mr. Hoey's memorandum of November 28th, 1947.\n\nEarly in March 1948, an officer from this Division was assigned to inspect the heating system and assess the requirements for its correction. At that time his attention was drawn to the plumbing system. From his observations it was deduced that the majority if not all the blockages reported were due to the carelessness and mischief of the pupils. This observation was not confirmed by the school staff during our officer's visit. Our officer found instances of excessive amounts of foreign matter having been wadded into various fixtures. There was also sufficient evidence to safely assume that indifferent attention had been given in the past to keep the plumbing fixtures up to a reasonable standard of cleanliness.\n\nWhile we do not consider that the gang closet arrangement is as satisfactory as individual closets and tanks, it is a fact that on several similar installations in other institutions throughout the country similar conditions have been made to keep them clean. It is questionable if automatic flushing is sufficient to keep this type of water closet clean without daily attention being given by some responsible member of the school staff.\n\nBy the same token, it can be stated that the condition of individual water closets in several other schools which have been inspected in recent years, leaves much to be desired as far as hygienic conditions are concerned.\n\nIt is our considered opinion that any type of urinal or water closet in an institution such as the above should be cleaned several times weekly by a staff member and that flushing alone is not sufficient to maintain a satisfactory standard. It is also our opinion that if this duty were carried out, the installation of gang or range closets would not present a hazard to health.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 9)\nIn a memorandum dated March 16th outlining our recommendations following our officer's inspection, the removal of the gang closets in this school was advocated.\n\nIt was our understanding that the Indian Affairs Branch were doubtful that funds could be made available for this part of the work and after raising the point, we were verbally advised by Indian Affairs officials to take no action in this connection.\n\nWithout having full details as to the method of the ultimate disposal of the sewage, but assuming that this system is adequate since no complaint has been received to the contrary, it was safely estimated that the sum of at least $5,000.00 would be required to replace the existing gang closets with individual units.\n\nIf instructed, we will prepare the necessary specification and arrange to call for tenders covering this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

Mr. Fuller, the local dealer was also of the opinion that an underground pipe should be installed from the pump to the boiler room in order that the pump would completely serve as an auxiliary. After some delay in preparing an estimate for the whole job, which amounted to approximately $1,000., I instructed that the pump only should be installed with the proper connection to the well, and for the time being a hose line would be used from the pump in case of an emergency. I called the dealer's attention to the matter again yesterday and he assured me that the installation would be made this week.\n\nJ. Swanson\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cook  \nSuperintendent\nDr. W. J. Wood,\nMedical Supt.,\nIndian Health Services,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nOn September 28th I visited the Sioux Lookout Indian residential school and made a thorough inspection.\n\nIn general there has been a vast improvement under the present principal Rev. Wilson and I was very pleased indeed with the many changes he has made and with the present attitude of both staff and children. A great deal of painting has been done with brighter colors and the building is clean, which condition has not prevailed for several years. The children's body and clothes were clean and good discipline is maintained. I had the privilege of having dinner with them and there has been a great improvement in the way the food is prepared and served. I presume the Department dentist will visit the school this Fall as there is considerable work required. I feel that the Department should make an extra effort to alter a few discrepancies in their Department now that the school is being run competently and I would like to recommend the following:\n\n1. The road to the school should be widened so that the snow plough could pass through and keep it open in the winter. At present the road is too narrow for a snow plough.\n\n2. There is in wet weather a continuous seepage into the basement through the foundation. Often water is 1\" or 2\" deep and this constitutes a real hazard to the children's health not to mention the inconvenience of working in such a condition. I think most of this water comes from the roof and I would suggest that an eaves-trough be placed around the entire building and the water from same be conducted away from the building.\n3. The boys' lavatory requires considerable work. The room itself needs plastering. The present 3 tubs should be removed as the shower room is adequate. All of the boys' toilet bowls should be removed and replaced by new ones. The present scheme is very bad and cannot be rectified. There is leakage from the present concrete toilet block which creates an odor through the building and the situation in general is unsanitary and a danger to the health of the children. This is inside work and can be done even after \"freeze-up\". I feel that the Department should undertake this work immediately.\n\n4. There should be mechanical refrigeration supplied for the kitchen as the present one does not function and cannot be repaired. The large refrigerator is working well but the kitchen staff cannot go to the large refrigerator for small items as this would mean opening and closing the door of same incessantly and a low temperature could not be maintained. I would suggest that this new refrigerator be a kerosene type although the present electrical plant might possibly carry the extra work of an electric refrigerator which is fairly heavily loaded at present. All of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. L. Bell, M.B.\n\nGLB:CK\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Oct. 23| To - Repairing plumbing at Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School | $168.87 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is due and owing charge against the Government of Canada.

Road maintenance,\n2. Seepage in basement,\n3. Faulty plumbing, toilets, etc.\n4. Refrigeration unit for kitchen.\n\nAll the foregoing points have been dealt with previously. Therefore at this time we will not go into further detail. With respect to (4) Dr. Bell's report reads as follows:\n\n\"There should be mechanical refrigeration supplied for the kitchen as the present one does not function and cannot be repaired.

Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nPrincipal Wilson has enclosed in a letter the following information about equipment at the Sioux Lookout school which I think you ought to have.\n\n(a) Typhoon Pump - The pump has been installed on a concrete base in the pump house but that is as far as it has gone. We will still have to thaw out pipes and hose in the winter before we can use it etc. There is no permanency about it at all such as having a pipe from the well connected so as the water will flow through the lead in to the school tanks.\n\n(b) Electric Wiring - Mr. Swartman told me some time ago that the Indian Department supplied the money etc. and it was up to me to get men to do the work of all equipment around the school. The job that was done last Fall in connection with the electricity is still incomplete in so far that the wire leading from the school basement to the Cottage is still above ground. The man that Mr. Swartman employs for all his electrical work etc. for the Dept. is Mr. Lawler and I have gotten after him Mr. Lawler four times since last fall or last. Each time it is going to be done the next day or so. The wire that is on the ground at present is I believe to be used at Lac Seul Hospital and the man is waiting for a different kind of wire before he can make a permanent job. We have had heavy frosts and two falls of snow this last week and if he does not get here soon the wire will still be on the ground another winter.\n\n(c) Fire Equipment - To date this equipment has not been sent.\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In order that this auxiliary unit will operate to the best advantage I would suggest that at some future date a trench be dug from the pump house on the lake shore to the basement and a permanent pipe line installed below the frost line. The pipe would be connected to the boilers and pressure tank in order to supply water in case of a breakdown in the present pumping system. It is estimated that the installation charges for this arrangement would amount to $300, and it is recommended that this be included in next year's estimates.\n\n(b) The electrical wiring to the cottage has been changed as yet; it is still connected with the temporary job that was done several months ago. We have urged the only local electrician to take care of the matter promptly and he promises to look after it during the next week.\n\nRegarding Mr. Wilson's reference to me informing him that it was his responsibility to get men to do the work, this is partly true. I explained to the Principal that we would arrange to have workmen go out to do certain jobs but it was up to him to see that the work was done satisfactorily, and if the tradesmen did not show up at the arranged time that he should inform this office or deal directly with the party concerned.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is suggested, therefore, that investigation be made as to the possibility of extending the power line (Hydro) from the radio range station to the school. The radio range station is approximately two miles south east of the school. Permission to cut into this line would, no doubt, have to be obtained from the Department of Transport and it would also be necessary to ascertain if there would be any difficulty or opposition from the Canadian National Railway to have wires cross the railway tracks.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-5, part 10)\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 2 | Tractor and Blade supplied to Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School complete with Lamps & Tire Fluid | $1,633.85 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is chargeable against the Government of Canada.

Regarding the engine, I had it brought in for inspection and the qualified mechanic who examined it reported that the Kermath motor is obsolete and parts not available. This coincides with the Kermath manufacturers observations. The rings are seized and useless. The cylinder walls are worn 15/1000 which is well over the tolerance permitted. The valve springs installed are the wrong type and it is now impossible to obtain the correct springs for this type of motor. The crankshaft is worn about 2/1000 which is also over-tolerance. Generator and electrical system requires re-building or replacing.\n\nThe Principal of this school informed me sometime in the Fall that he had an offer of $500. for the motor from some party in Hudson, Ontario, but I was of the opinion that the prospective buyer could not be serious. Since the boat and motor is the property of the Department I would appreciate your advice with respect to the disposal of same. My suggestion would be to either write it off or sell it to the highest bidder with the understanding that the buyer be acquainted with the exact condition of the boat and motor.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\n22 December, 1949.\n\nReverend Canon H.

He makes various other comments concerning the valve springs, cylinder walls, crank shaft, generator and electrical system indicating that the motor is practically useless. He feels that the party offering the principal $500.00 for the motor had not examined it.\n\nMr. Swartzen has recommended that this boat and motor be declared surplus and disposed of through War Assets Corporation.\n\nThe replacement of this boat would be a major expenditure and it is felt that we could not recommend such a purchase unless we were convinced that it was absolutely essential.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard J.

This item I note was covered by our Purchase Order No. 51298 dated November 30, 1949 placed with the Gutta Percha & Rubber Ltd., Ottawa.\n\nThere is a note on file stating that Mr. Phelan was asked shortly after receipt of his memo dated October 28, 1949 by Mr. H.C.

It being pointed out that there was no such description as linen lined hose and Mr. Phelan stated he required rubber lined hose.\n\nI am now in receipt of the attached letter dated March 24, 1950 from the firm stating that the hose and couplings have been returned to them and requesting more information so that the proper hose and couplings might be supplied.\n\nWill you please look into the matter and endeavour to have the correct information as to couplings and hose supplied, for the guidance of the firm.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

This letter referred to the subject order and in as much as we had supplied couplings as ordered we could not quite understand what the difficulty was. Ultimately, this hose was returned to us with a letter dated March 2nd, signed by Reverence J.S.

Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCamp Chippewa,\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 4 with respect to battleship linoleum and tables for the dining room at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. We enclose a quotation received from John Mascotte, Sioux Lookout, for the building of tables and benches, amounting to $615.60. This figure may appear somewhat high but Mr. Mascotte has the reputation of turning out first-class work and his charges are usually reasonable. As you know, the tables and benches at the school should be discarded; the tables are unsanitary and unstable, and the benches are beyond repair. Mascotte informs us that he has not quoted on material to cover the tables but that if we supply the material, such as arborite or linoleum, and aluminum edgings for the tables, he would do the work on an hourly basis. The best covering to put on the tables would be arborite which sells locally at .35\u00a2 per square foot.\n\nRegarding linoleum for the boys' dormitories we have been unable to have anyone interested in the work proceed to the school in order to size up the floors. The road to the school is impassible at present for car traffic, consequently it may be a week or more before this work can be attended to.\n\nWe are enclosing in quadruplicate a requisition for 225 yards linoleum which we estimate will be sufficient to cover the boys' dormitories. No local price has been shown as it is understood that purchase will be made in Ottawa through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\n\nEncls.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing a recommendation from Mr. Swartman regarding the necessary repairs to dining room of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, also a requisition for battleship linoleum to cover the floor of the boys' dormitory. Mr. Swartman's letter is self explanatory and I would recommend that the linoleum be supplied and authority given to proceed with the building of the dining room tables plus some means of covering the ply wood tops.\n\nF.

These tables are left long, 29 in. wide, and 30 in. high. These tables and benches are easily portable and can be conveniently and compactly stacked so as to clear the floor area of the dining room available for other activities between meals. It has been our thought for some time that we would request some schools to make greater use of the space that is often unused exclusively for meals.\n\nEarly delivery of the suggested furniture can be made. Although it is used, it is in good condition.\n\nYour comments are invited.\n\nOttawa Store Equipment Co., 240 Bank St.\n\nPrice:\nTable $8 x 12 = $96\nBenches $3 x 24 = $72\n\n$168 plus freight\n\nAs compared with $453\n\nAnd if they don't like it, we can use it in Mr. Swartman's seasonal school.\n\nC.A.P.C.\nApril 12/50\nApril 14th, 1950.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSieux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nRe: Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last ultimo, the Departmental Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure 225 yds. of linoleum. The cost of this will be charged to the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements, and purchase of new equipment at this school.\n\nWe note the quotation which you have received from John Mascotto for supplying 16 tables and 32 benches. It has been suggested that instead of building new tables at this time, we supply folding furniture of the type used in army mess halls. The tables are 6 ft. long, 29 inches wide and 30 inches high. The tables and benches are easily portable and can be conveniently and compactly stacked, so as to leave the floor area of the dining room available for other activities between meals. It has been our opinion for some time that we would suggest to certain schools to make greater use of the space that is often exclusively reserved for meals.\n\nWe can secure these folding tables and benches immediately. Please let me have your comments.\n\nBernard F.

We have recently learned that the Department of Transport could supply up to 25 h.p., providing a voltage regulator was installed. This would be ample for the present needs of the school although before going into the matter further it is suggested that a qualified engineer review and report on the situation.\n\nThe distance from the radio range station to the school in a straight line is about 1/2 mile but a pole line of 2 miles would probably be required. The cost would depend also on how much clearing would be required and the site of the pole line would have to be determined before an estimate could be prepared. Regarding crossing the Canadian National Railway tracks, permission would have to be obtained from the Board of Railway Commissioners.\n\nWith reference to a boat for the school, this would be an extremely useful piece of equipment as Canon Cook has pointed out. There is a small boat, approximately 20' x 6', beam built by the Purvis Brothers in Selkirk, Manitoba, that would be ideal for the school. This craft has a shelter cabin and powered by an inboard Kermath or Gray motor. One of these was recently supplied to the Trout Lake Nursing Station. It sells for approximately $2,000.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. Swartman\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Indian Agency\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nReference your letter of April 3, file 470-5 (E), with respect to fire hose supplied to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School and subsequently returned to the Gutta Percha & Rubber Company as it was not suitable. The hose in question was apparently intake or steam hose and not the rubber lined as required. It also was not the proper size although the size was in accordance with the requisition submitted by the Principal. When I inspected the hose at the school, I observed that it was not the proper size as well as the right type and remarked that it would have to be returned. We were not immediately aware that Mr. Wilson had returned the hose to this firm.\n\nIn order that the correct size of linen lined hose may be supplied, we are forwarding under separate cover a used coupling which has been brought in by the Principal of the school. In this connection we wrote to the Gutta Percha & Rubber Company on January 31 advising them that the couplings were not the proper size as this information had been passed along to me from Mr. Wilson. I was under the impression at the time that the hose was the proper type but that the company had neglected to supply the correct size of coupling. I could not conceive that the wrong size of hose had been ordered and did not learn of this until a short time later.\n\n[Signature]\nG.

Hakala & Son for $400.00 to repair the floors in the two large boys' dormitories and lay linoleum. Mr. Hakala states that 500 feet of flooring will be required to carry out the necessary repairs and it is presumed that the linoleum and cement will be supplied by the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Mr. Hakala estimates that 15 gallons of linoleum cement will be required.\n\nIt is recommended that, if the work is approved, we be authorized to purchase the flooring locally as this would give the carpenter an opportunity to select the most suitable material for this job.

If this can be arranged I would recommend that Mr. Swartman be given the authority to arrange with the local contractor, that is, provided the contract is satisfactory to you when received.\n\nIt is noted that about 500 feet of flooring will be required to effect the repairs and I would further recommend that Mr. Swartman be given authority for local purchase of materials up to an amount of $50.00 for this purpose.\n\nF.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the selection of a site for the proposed boarding school on the Lac Seul Reserve, and referring to the last sentence of your letter I beg to say that the Department desires to locate this building on the reserve. As you are aware the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway line runs along the south shore of Lost Lake and the southern portion of the Indian reserve borders on the north shore of that body of water. In order that the situation may be as convenient as possible for transport the school should be located at a point on the reserve as near as possible to the line of railway, having in view the matters referred to by you, such as drainage, water supply, wharfage facilities, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nridge of the site and the escape must be over the divide to the north and the slope is nearly a quarter of a mile in length but when water is reached it cannot by any possible means contaminate the intake from the south side. The soil is very porous and much will evaporate through the course of its flow and much will sink into the sand. I felt that while stating the advantages fully and in detail I ought not to pass over this because I wish the Department to have all the facts.\n\nThe Market Town where purchases can be made is 12 miles distant by rail and is a Divisional Point on the S.T.P. known as Graham. By Canoe the distance is fifteen miles and the time usually taken is three hours and a half. At the present time there is only a passenger Train every other day from Hudson to Graham but a daily train is expected soon.\n\nLooking over the situation as I have most carefully I recommend Spruce Portage most heartily and hope to see a Boarding School there in the near future.\n\nThe Department does not wish information from me as to the capacity of the School to be erected. There are enough children in Lac Seul Band and Frenchmans Head Band under the same Chief to furnish 75 children and Greasy Harrows and White Dog Bands will contribute the balance of 100 if the amount to be expended in this direction is sufficient for such a proposition.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Agencies\nOttawa\nCanada\n(5) Sand for Mason work and plastering on the premises in great abundance and of very fine quality.\n\n(6) Rock for basement within half a mile both round granite boulders and square cornered broken rock in great abundance.\n\n(7) Pine Timber in great plenty within a radius of two miles and a considerable amount within one mile.\n\n(8) Hay in abundance within one mile to the north enough for 50 head of cattle or more.\n\n(9) Water supply abundant and of good quality in the lake immediately south of the site and no contaminating influences near.\n\n(10) Drainage may be obtained by cutting through the ridge and sending it downhill to the back lake.\n\n(11) The soil is strong and good and the growth of trees at present on the site is sufficient proof of its value. It is a sandy loam and there are high spots and lower ones making drainage of garden plots an easy matter. The general appearance is level with one slope to north and one to south. Wood is birch, pine, spruce, ash & poplar.\n\n(12) At Hudson is a saw mill where all dimension timber and lumber may be obtained. This as before stated is two miles south of the site under consideration. They do not manufacture shingles at this point nor laths but these can be obtained a few miles west where a larger mill is found. Hudson Mill also does planing.\n\n(13) The site has protection from the winds west North and East making it an admirable location in this respect.\n\n(14) The Scenery of the locality is beautiful.\n\n(15) There is no claim to the land that is to say no Indian is known to have cut a stick or to have built a house a stage or put up a mark on the spot.\n\n(16) There is wood enough on the site for all time.\n\nNow I ought to say that the only detracting feature is the question of drainage. The building must be placed near the...\nR.S.McKenzie was very much in favor of this site as the soil was good, drainage good and power might be developed and it was within about four miles of the town of Graham on the line of the G.T.P. The Hudson's Bay Company have an abandoned establishment on the premises. It is not in sight of the railway line, and it would involve purchase from the Ontario Government and settlement with the claim of the H.B.C.\n\nAs I read your last two letters I understand you to desire that the School should be placed on the Reserve and after a close inspection of the locality and after due consideration of all the circumstances likely to be involved I was disposed to decide against Ilelean Falls though I frankly admit that it has many advantages to offer not the least of which is the distance from the Indians.\n\nThe third site visited was found at Spruce Portage a point on the Lac Seul Reserve and in full site of the G.T.P. line of railway and only two miles from Hudson Station.\n\nThis point I think is ideal and both Mr. McKenzie the Agent and Mr. Wilson the Principal of Alkorn Industrial School and Mr. Valentine the Constable of our Party all agreed with me that it could not well be beaten by any known site in the country. I noted the following advantages viz:\n\n1. Location at Spruce Portage 2 miles north of Hudson Station on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and in full sight of about half a mile of the track.\n2. Bank looking south about twenty feet above water level sloping gradually up to thirty feet and then a divide sloping gradually northward to a laklet across which to the north still is Frenchman's Head Indian Settlement.\n3. Situated on a sand beach about half mile in length so well protected by the opposite shore that no very large waves can disturb the landing.\n4. Good harbour can be obtained by a short dock or wharf at the west end of the sand bay, protecting a little cove where a boat might lie in all weathers in perfect safety.\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nLAKE WINNIPEG INSPECTORATE\nWINNIPEG, MAN., July 15th 1911\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No 301246 of May 30th directing me to select a site for a Boarding School on the Lac Seul Reserve as near as possible to the G.T.R. line of railway I beg to say that I have been fortunate enough to find a situation which I think is in every way suited to the requirements of the case.\n\nI first explored the site upon which the School House recently used as a Day School is situated. It is a narrow neck of land sheltered on the west side by a heavy growth of trees with good land and plenty of chance for drainage on one side and good water on the other and is in the centre of the Reserve settlement being three miles and a half from the Hudson's Bay Store and the same distance from the Mission establishment of the Church of England. I found that this site was in many respects admirable having good water for steamers and a southern exposure but on closer examination I found that we would have to interfere with some existing claims in order to get a sufficient area for school purposes; and it would be too close to the crowd, and freighting would be heavy as by steamer route it would involve a distance of over 50 miles and in winter or by canoe a distance of about 70 miles to reach a railway. In nearly every respect it would be suitable but it is out of observation of the travelling public and freighting would be very costly, and we would have too many coming every day to see the children and incidentally to consume our supplies of provisions. After carefully counting the pros and cons I decided against this location.\n\nThe next site visited was Pelican Falls. The Agent Mr\nOttawa, August 2, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo in reference to the site for the proposed Lac Seul Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the contents have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On this land we have located the bands of Indians who need the school, and you will notice how central it is for the whole area.\n\nI visited the property and gave it a general look over. The land is broken into two sections by the Wabigoon River, one part being about 56 acres, the other about 13 acres. The land is good clay with some rock especially along the river. The larger portion is level with small timber most of it new growth poplar and willow. Five or six acres have been cleared on the smaller portion and cultivated for vegetables. A small log house is erected here. On the larger portion a small flat has been cultivated and abandoned a few years ago, but it has been allowed to grow. There is a good road in the smaller portion and another good road running north is connected to the edge of the N.W. corner by a road running east. This road is cut out and a creek crosses it near the bridge, but no grading has been done on it is quite in the rough for half mile. Both portions are just one mile distance from the Railway station. The river is a good size and there are two rapids, one just outside the property under the railway track, the other at the narrows as seen in the map.\n\nThe land has come on the market through the death of the owner, an old man who for some time did very little with it. Mr. H.P. Cooke, K.C., Kenora, has been appointed administrator of the estate. I have reason to think that the 12\u00bd acres could be purchased for about $600. The land in the vicinity at Quibell is excellent. The whole township is taken up. It is splendid land for oats, clover, and alfalfa, and produces the finest vegetables.\n\nThe following figures will be useful, I got them from the Indian Agent:\n\n| Band       | Age | Pres. | R. C.

The Roman Catholics have a residential school at Kenora, and the Presbyterians have one at Shoal Lake, quite out of this district. The R. C. School at MacIntosh is, I believe, very badly located, but they are putting up a fine building. You will notice that they have only 195 Indians to our 866.\n\nI was sorry that the snow came so early this year, and that I was not able to see for myself the land, but I tramped over a good deal of it with the man located on the north half of the same lot and I think that it is unlikely that a better site for the purpose could be secured anywhere in the district.\n\nI hope the matter will be taken up by the Commission and the school pushed for.\n\nWishing you and yours all the season's compliments, I am\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nA.

Canon Gould,\n684 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\nSir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter from Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, with reference to the proposed construction of an Indian mission school at Quibell, Ontario.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Westgate called on me this morning and stated that Mr. Orr, architect of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, had suggested to the General Secretary of the Missionary Society, with a view to securing information regarding the possibility of utilizing water power in the operation of the water and lighting systems in the school. I would infer from Mr. Westgate's remarks that they desire similar lighting, water and sewerage systems to those being installed at the McIntosh Indian School.\n\nYou will note from the last paragraph of Mr. Westgate's letter he states that the Department would like to know whether the water power provided by the Wabigoon River could be utilized in the way mentioned above, and I should be glad if I could furnish them with information on this particular point. The Wabigoon river is too large for a development of this nature but there is, however, a small creek flowing immediately north of the track at Quibell, which might provide the necessary power.\n\nHas the Department of Indian Affairs made any request to you for this investigation and our co-operation in this matter?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSigned ......

H. Atwood, Esq.,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\n231 Chambers of Commerce,\nPrincess Street, Winnipeg.\n\nDear Mr. Atwood,\n\nWith further reference to our phone conversation today, relative to the proposed school to be built in the Lac Seul area, I now beg to state that the description of the property and the site for this institution as forwarded by Bishop Dewdney is as follows:\n\n\"Parcel 8025.\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land situate in the Township of Wabigoon, in the district of Kenora, and Province of Ontario, namely:\n\nPart of the south part of Broken Lot Number Seven in the Sixth Concession of the said Township of Wabigoon, described as follows: First that portion of the said broken lot lying North of the Wabigoon River and South of line running across the lot parallel with the north limit thereof and at the distance of thirty-two chains south therefrom; Secondly: That triangular piece of the lot bounded on the East by the east limit of the lot and on the south and the westerly or north westerly sides by the Wabigoon River, excepting from the said two portions a road allowance one chain in perpendicular width along the bank of the said River.\"\n\nThe above property comprises in all about 12\u00bd acres and is situated in the Township of Wabigoon, not far from the C.N. Railway Station at Quibell.\n\nThis property, it is understood has recently gone on the market, through the death of the owner, an old man, who for some time did very little with it. Mr. H.F. Cooke, W.O., Kenora, has been appointed administrator pro tem.\n\nThe river is reported by the Bishop to have two rapids at that part of its course, one just outside the property under the Railway Bridge, and the other in a place which he described as the Narrows, but does not give the distance.\n\nAs Mr. Orr the Architect at Ottawa has informed our General Secretary that water power should be utilized to the fullest extent possible in the operating of this school, our General Secretary was requested to ask me to furnish you with what information I possessed with regard to the proposed site.\n\nI myself, have not yet visited it, but would be able I think, to do so sometime in April.\n\nAs building operations should begin early in the summer, the department would like to know as soon as possible, whether the water power provided by the Wabigoon river could be utilised in the way mentioned above, and would be glad if you would furnish them with information on this particular point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would also be more central for other reserves, and at the same time would obviate any clashes of interests which might arise if the two schools were too close together.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note from the file that the Dominion Water Power Branch has been asked to report on the water power available at Quibell. This town, which is on the main line of the C.N.R., is less than ten miles from the site of the McIntosh Residential School, and I believe it would be an error to place the new Anglican school at this point.\n\nThe M.S.C.C. are securing most of their pupils on the Lac Seul and Frenchman's Head Reserves, and there is no reason that I am aware of why the Anglican school should not be placed somewhere in the vicinity of Hudson, which is approximately sixty-five miles east of McIntosh and is the nearest town on the railway to the Reserves in question.

These are the only lands which have been subdivided in that vicinity.\n\nThe letters \"H.B.Co.\" at Hudson Station are merely for information to the general public that the Company has a trading post at that point.\n\nI have also forwarded you a copy of map 24 A as requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector of Surveys.\n\nSend maps.\nThe Field Secretary begs to report that in accordance with instructions received from the General Secretary (letter dated April 27th) and in response to the request of the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs (letter dated May 2nd) he left Winnipeg on Thursday morning May 14th (1925) in company with Mr. Orr, the Indian Department's Architect at Ottawa, and Captain Edwards, the Indian Agent in charge of the Kenora Agency, to visit the Lac Seul area for the purpose of selecting a site for the new Indian Residential School to be established there during the coming summer.\n\nAs the Department of Indian Affairs had expressed the opinion that the site chosen should be considerably further east than the station of Quibell on the Canadian National Railway, the first site recommended by Bishop O'Meara and supported by the Commission, the delegation took tickets as far as Sioux Lookout. On the way they were joined at Quibell Station by the Rev. M. Sanderson, Missionary to the Indians in the Diocese of Kenora, and who was officially deputed by the Bishop to represent his Diocese on this occasion.\n\nAs both the Indian Agent and the Indian Missionary were familiar with practically all parts of the area in question the delegation were greatly assisted by having them among their number.\n\nOn the way to Sioux Lookout which was reached at 6 o'clock in the evening, careful notes were made of the country in the vicinity of the town of Freda, and the Hudson Stations, with a view to closer observation on the return journey should necessity demand such action.\n\nDuring the course of the evening some conversation was held at the Rectory with some of the leading men of the town who had been invited by the Rector for the purpose of furnishing information as to where the most suitable land for farming purposes was to be found in the surrounding country. Several places were suggested and it was decided that the most promising of these should be visited on the following day.\n\nAt 8 o'clock on Friday morning a start was made from the town dock in a motor-boat which was very kindly placed at the service of the delegation by the local Board of Trade.\n\nThis boat, however, began to leak so badly about a mile from the dock that another and larger one had to be secured. Then this boat arrived after a delay of about three-quarters of an hour. The party which consisted of Mr. Orr, Captain Edwards, Rev. M. Sanderson, Mr. O'Meara, Mr. Meddler (President of the Board of Trade), the Field Secretary, again embarked and made their way in a north-western direction along Pelican Lake to the spot where it narrows down to a channel of about one hundred yards in width and flows out with a good current through what are known as the Pelican Rapids.\nOn the south bank and just at the entrance to the narrows they found an area of about four acres of gently sloping land all of which had been cleared, and occupied for some years by a retired Canadian who kept a few farm. The buildings which he had erected were still standing, though in a greatly weather-worn condition. The party landed at this point, and after spending about one and one-half hours in examining the cleared and surrounding wooded area, came to the conclusion that it provided, in a remarkable degree, the most suitable site for an institution such as it was contemplated to establish.\n\nAs other sites, however, had been recommended to the south, south-west, and south-east of the town, it was agreed that these should first be examined before fixing on any decision. The party accordingly returned to the town, and, after lunch, proceeded to a speedy motor-boat owned and driven by Dr. Mitchell, to examine some of the other sites, which had been recommended. The first part of the course lay in a south-westerly direction across Pelican Lake via the outlet, then along the rapids which connect the water from Abram Lake at the farther end. After ascending the rapids the course lay across the Abram Lake in a northerly direction to a spot not more than a mile distant from the south side of the town.\n\nThe party went ashore at this point, and after making their way up an incline to a height of approximately 150 feet through a thick forest of Spruce, Poplar and Jack Pine, with some Birch and small Cedar trees were found growing as well, examined the area along the top. As the party did this examination they came to the conclusion that although the land when cleared would be suitable for farming purposes, and the fuel and water supplies would prevent no difficulty, a school established in that vicinity would stand in too close proximity to the town. They further concluded that as the land along the shore of Abram Lake had been surveyed and marked out into inside plots for summer residences, a school if established there stood in danger of being unable to secure sufficient space for all its activities, in addition to the danger of complications with the White communities which might in time surround it on the greater part of three sides.\n\nAs the other sites on the south and south-west sides of the town were found to be so remotely situated as to prevent insuperable transportation difficulties, and as those on the north side presented difficulties and possibly long delays arising out of negotiations which would have to be conducted with the Railway Company and the Dominion Government both of whom claimed ownership, in addition to its general unsuitability, and the price which would have to be paid for it, the delegation decided that the site at the Pelican Rapids which had been visited in the morning was undoubtedly the most suitable for their purpose in that district, and agreed to re-visit it again on the following day.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Superintendent of the Sioux Lookout division of the Canadian National Railway a car was placed at the disposal of the delegation on Saturday morning, and by this means of conveyance the Architect, the Indian Agent, and the Field Secretary travelled westward on the railway line as far as Pelican Station a distance of about 6\u00bd miles. Leaving the railway line at a\npoint about half a mile to the east of the station they followed a trail through the bush which brought them out into the cleared area which they had visited on the previous morning. Their examination of the land, timber, water and other conditions which this area provided confirmed the opinion they had formed on their first visit, and they unanimously agreed to recommend its adoption as the site for the proposed new School.\n\nAmong the favourable and completely satisfactory conditions which it possesses for the purpose in question, mention may be made of the following:\n\n1. Accessibility. As it is situated by overland route not more than 16 miles from Pelican Station on the Canadian National Railway, and not more than 7 miles from Sioux Lookout by water route, it is readily accessible to all who are responsible for its operations, its maintenance, and its administration.\n\nUnder this heading may be included the facilities for transportation of agents and supplies. This is a very important item and one which involves heavy expenditure at a number of our Society's Schools. The facilities which this site affords will reduce expenditure under this heading to a minimum.\n\n2. Centrality. From the following table, when studied in connexion with a map of the district of the area in question it is clear that this site is centrally located in its relationship to the majority of the Anglican Indians in the Indian communities which it is intended to serve:\n\n| Name of Band          | Total No. | Anglicans |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Islington             | 229       | 157       |\n| The Dalles            | 65        | 23        |\n| Wabushkang            | 40        | 14        |\n| Orono Narrows         | 182       | 62        |\n| Eagle River/Wabigoon  | 170       | 15        |\n| Ignace                | 67        | 3         |\n| Les Seul              | 409       | 449       |\n| Frenchman's Head      | 138       | 135       |\n| **Total**             | **1360**  | **856**   |\n\n3. Farming Land. It is estimated that not less than 100 acres of as good farming land as can be found anywhere in that part of Ontario will be available for farming purposes when the forest has been cleared away.\n\nPart of the area of about four acres already cleared can be made available for gardening purposes with but very little labour.\n\nAs the Ontario Government has surveyed this part of the country the minimum amount of land which the School should have set apart for its use is as follows:\nThe west half (and if possible the east half also) of Portion 26 all of Portion 27 all of Portion 28\n\nThese portions comprise approximately half a section or 320 acres.\n\n4. Lighting. Although the Ontario Government held all the land in the vicinity of this site in reserve on account of the possibility of developing water power from the neighbouring rapids, this reservation has now been cancelled. As the construction of a dam about 100 miles away at an inflow to Lac Seul is expected to raise the water level throughout all this part of the distance of about 5 feet sufficient power is not likely to be left in the rapids to justify the installation of a hydro-electric system. For this reason the installation of an ordinary electric lighting system becomes a necessity.\n\n5. Building Area. There is ample accommodation for the main school building on the highest part of the cleared area.\n\nSuitable sites are also available for the stock barns and other buildings, but some forest will have to be cleared before these can be erected.\n\n6. Outlook. As the main building will face the east an unobstructed view of not less than three miles over the north-west arm of Pelican Lake may be had from the front entrance. A view of the upper Pelican Rapids may also be had from the north end and the rear part of this building.\n\n7. Drainage. The drainage facilities leave nothing to be desired.\n\n8. Boundaries. All of the north side and the greater part of the east and west sides are bounded by water. The Canadian National Railway forms the boundary on the south.\n\nIn addition to the above considerations the Field Secretary begs to state that as this site is heartily approved by the representatives of the Indian Department, the Architect will give his opinion that his Department would furnish the School, not only with all the necessary articles of equipment including live stock, implements, etc., in addition to the usual School furnishings but would undertake also to provide (1) a motor-boat for communication with Sioux Lookout, (2) telephone communication with Sioux Lookout, (3) to survey and build a road through the forest to Pelican Station, and (4) to clear a considerable part of the land for farming and gardening purposes.\n\nIn view of these considerations, when taken side by side with the extremely satisfactory conditions which the area described above provides for an Indian Residential School site, the Field Secretary begs to recommend that the site thus selected and described be recommended for adoption by the Executive Committee as the site for the new School for the Lac Seul area should be located.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHe further begs to recommend that immediate action be taken with regard to the selection and nomination of an Acting Principal, in order that he may be present should this site be approved, when the building operations begin, to give his advice in any way it may be found necessary or desirable, to direct and supervise the clearing of the land, to see that a supply of fuel is provided for the coming winter, to help in the enrollment of pupils, the engagement of an adequate and suitable staff, and in every other way within his power to have the School completed and operating without any avoidable delay.\n\nThe delegation having completed their labours returned to Sioux Lookout where they entrained on the west bound train at 12 o'clock noon. Rev. N. Sanderson accompanied the party as far as Hudson on his way to Lac Seul for Sunday, May 17th. Mr. Orr and Captain Evans left the train at Macintosh to visit the school. Ch. Suckok was established a short distance south of that station, and the Field Secretary returned to Winnipeg where he arrived at 8.15 p.m.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI enclose herewith for your information a copy of my report to our Indian and Eskimo Commission on the site for the proposed school for the Lac Seul area. This report has been adopted by the Commission, and in due course our General Secretary will forward to your Department the action taken by the Executive Committee of our Society on the same.\n\n(Sgd.) T. B. R. Westgate,\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nI beg to submit my report with reference to the choosing of a suitable site for the proposed new Church of England Indian Residential School to be erected on the main line of the Grand Trunk Pacific in Northern Ontario.\n\nOn Saturday, May 9th, I called at the office of the Crown Lands Department in Toronto, and obtained all the information possible with regard to the nature of the country in the vicinity of Sioux-Lookout, and also land available in the township of Drayton, which is the only township surveyed in the vicinity of Sioux-Lookout. This Department furnished me with a blue print of the township, on which they noted in red all of the lots sold or patented. I also examined the surveyor's field notes of this township and noted the nature of the land in the different parts of the township, more especially the portions most suitable for farming operations.\n\nOn May 14th in company with Indian Agent, Mr. Edwards, Rev. Doctor Westgate, and Rev. Mr. Sanderson, an Indian Missionary and also an Indian, I left for Sioux-Lookout. On our arrival there we were met at the station by the President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Hodder, and other prominent citizens including Mayor G. Greer and Mr. G. E. Farlinger. The citizens of Sioux-Lookout were extremely anxious to have the school located as near their town as possible, and we discussed with them several sites which they suggested. Most of the sites suggested by them, however, were in my opinion too close to the town. We visited the locations suggested and of all the different localities visited we all agreed that the land situated at the Pelican Falls, lying between the falls and Pelican station on the Grand Trunk Pacific, was the most suitable from every point of view for the establishing of a residential school. The water approach to this site is located approximately six miles by boat on the Pelican Lake from Sioux-Lookout. We visited this location on the afternoon of the 15th and thoroughly examined the property from the lakeside.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOn the morning of the 16th we obtained the use of the Railway Superintendent's gas car and drove to Pelican station, from where there is a good trail leading through the property. This gave an opportunity of examining the conditions from the railway side of the property. The site of the proposed school will be approximately 1\u00bd miles from Pelican Station and a good road can be built at very little cost to the station. The Pelican Falls site is advantageously situated as it is on the main water route where launches can go to Magogual Mills Station east about 30 miles, south within a few miles of the C. F. R., at Dinorwic where is situated the Wabigoon reserve, and east to Webster Station and north to the west end of Lac Seul. All of these places can be reached without a portage.\n\nSioux-Lookout is an historical Indian site as it is supposed to be one of the last places where the Sioux fought the Ojibways before being actually driven from this part of the country. There is a very high hill near the station on which the Ontario Government have placed an observation tower, and it was at this place where the final battle was fought, all of the Sioux being killed with the exception of a young boy, who was adopted by the Ojibways. His family were the Ackwedance family and previous to the last election, when Paul Thomas was elected Chief, this family retained the Chieftainship for many years.\n\nAs all parties interested in the site for this school were agreed that the land above referred to at Pelican Falls is the most suitable from every point of view, I beg to recommend that application be made to the Ontario Government for the following lands: All parts of lots 27 and 28 north of the Canadian National Railway concession, part of lot 26 north of the Canadian...\nNational Railway, concession B; and the southern part of lots 26 and 27, concession C, the southern part of lot A, Lots 527, concession C, all south of the English river.\n\nThis property will contain approximately 350 acres. Of this acreage there is approximately 150 acres covered with light poplar which when cleared will make excellent farming land. There is also a small clearance near the falls of approximately five acres which will provide an excellent site for the building, with good facilities for drainage and water supply.\n\nAttached hereto is a blue print of the township of Drayton, on which I have indicated in orange ink the above mentioned land. I am also attaching photographs taken at the different points on the property selected.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, 28th May 1925\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department intends to establish in the vicinity of Sioux Lookout an Anglican Indian residential school and an officer of the Department who examined possible sites in this district reports that the one which would best suit the requirements of the Department would be those parts of Lots Nos. 27 and 28, Con. B., and that part of the N.W. of Lot 26, Con. B., Township of Drayton, lying to the North of the Canadian National Railway right of way; also those parts of Lots 26 and 27, Con. C., lying South of Pelican Lake and also that small portion of land lying between the North boundary of Lot No. 28, Con. B., and the English River.\n\nAs it is the desire of the Department to proceed with the erection of this school at an early date, I have to ask if you will kindly inform me as soon as possible whether these lands may be acquired by this Department for the above mentioned purpose. As a residential school of this nature is intended for the instruction of Indian pupils recruited from a quite considerable distance and as these pupils are taught farming, gardening and care of stock and the Department endeavours as far as possible to produce from the school property supplies for the institution, considerable arable land is necessary, and you will readily see that the area requested is not in excess of the requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.V.

Scott Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just received your letter of July 7th with blue prints enclosed relative to the site for the proposed new Indian School at Sioux Lookout. In reply I should like first to point out that in my opinion the Department of Lands at Toronto have slightly misunderstood the location which it was desired we should have for the School. They state that they understood from Mr. Orr that the most suitable location for the School Buildings should be on the point of land on lot 26 east of the small bay. The spot which we chose however, was on the point of land on lot 26 west of the small bay and just at the entrance to the narrowest part. According to your letter and the portion of the blue print which you have shaded in red, I find that the Department of Lands Toronto do not wish at present to release that part of lot 26 on which this site is situated. However, if the School is to be built there, it will be necessary not only to have that part of 26 west of the small bay, but also a strip not less than 200 yards wide of the eastern part of lot 27, and I beg to recommend that the Department of Lands Toronto, be requested to release as soon as possible this area in addition to the other part which you have shaded in black, and at a later date, that part of lots 27 and 28 which you have shaded in red. As the most important section of the Pelican Waterfalls is a considerable distance below the site which we have chosen for the School, (being nearer to the junction of lots 27 and 28 than to that of 26 and 27) I do not...\nMr. Scott,\n\nsee any strong reason why that portion of 26 west of the small bay and a strip at least 200 yards in width along the east side of lot 27 should not be set apart immediately for the purpose requested.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTHRW/JF.\nOttawa, 16th July 1925\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref. Nos. 25161 and 25095\n\nFrom your letter of the 3rd instant it is thought that there is a slight misunderstanding as to the location where it is desired to actually locate the school buildings, as the actual site selected was on the point of land on Lot 26, West of the small bay and not East, as stated in your letter, and this is considered the most suitable site that can be found in that locality.\n\nYou will realize, therefore, that the Department is most anxious to secure those portions of Lot 26, Con. B., and the small adjoining portion of Lot 26, Con. C which were tinted red on the plan accompanying your letter and also, as it would be necessary to supply a certain amount of fire protection for the school buildings by clearing the wooded area to the West of the buildings for a distance of 200 yards into Lot 27, Cons. B and C. As the most important section of the Pelican Waterfalls is a considerable distance below the East boundary of Sec. 27, it is thought that you would possibly be in a position to meet the wishes of the Department and add to the area which is tinted black on the plan accompanying your letter of the 3rd instant, the portions above mentioned of Lots 26, Cons. B and C and a strip on the easterly side of Lots 27, Cons. B and C of eight or ten chains in width.\n\nShould your reply be unfavourable, it will in all probability be necessary for the Department to search for another location for the school and I would, therefore, appreciate being informed at an early date of your decision.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Lands & Forests,\nToronto, Ont.\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\nYour letter was received respecting the desire of your Department to acquire a portion of Lots 26, 27 and 28, Con. \"B\" and \"C\", Township of Drayton. You will notice that the correspondence in this Department is under two separate files, as they refer to a group of lots. You were written in the other file today.\n\nThis Department is prepared to consider any proposition or suggestion you have to make regarding the selection of a site suitable for your purpose and will offer every assistance in doing so. The fact remains, however, that there is a considerable water fall at Pelican Falls and until it has been finally decided by the parties interested and by the Crown, which decision cannot be made at the present time as to how the water power of this water shall be developed, it can be properly and systematically developed in the public interest. The question of the level of Pelican Lake and the interests of the Town in the immediate vicinity, as well as the whole water levels in that district, require to be carefully considered. The immediate development at Pelican Falls for power purposes has been stayed, as there is a proposal, as you are doubtless aware, to develop storage and power at the outlet of Lac Seul, which may render Pelican Falls unsuitable for power development, but power for Sioux Lookout should be secured from whatever development is made, no matter what falls are used for the purpose. That being the case, the Department cannot waive its objections to disposing of the portion in the immediate vicinity of Pelican Falls as indicated in Departmental letter to you of the 3rd inst.\n\nSD-EO\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C.

As Mr. Orr is familiar with the sites which we examined together on the 15th and 16th of May I suggested in my telegram that either Mr. Inspector Bunn or Captain Edwards should meet me in order to save Mr. Orr the expense and trouble of making a long trip from Ottawa at a time when I felt he might find it difficult to get away. Your representative whoever he may be, and I will make a careful examination of lot 26 on Monday next and inform you of the results immediately.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nSir,\n\nAs instructed by your telegram of 29th ult and No. 129-6-9 of the same date.\n\nI proceeded to Sioux Lookout and met Dr Westgate. We visited the proposed site of the Sioux Lookout School as instructed.\n\nDr Westgate is of the opinion that the property which will be granted to us by the Ontario Government will be quite suitable for our needs at the present time providing the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests will let us have Lot #25 in addition to the parts of lots 26, 27 and 28 coloured black on the plan returned herewith.\n\nThe site for the building as originally agreed on between Mr Orr, Dr Westgate and myself was on the N.W. part of Lot 26, but as we are unable to get this the point on the N.E. corner of lot 26, will be quite suitable.\n\nDr Westgate would like to get lot 26 as there is some wood on it that would be suitable for cordwood. Perhaps later on if there is no development at Pelican Falls they would be willing for us to get a portion of the lots 26, 27, and 28 colored red on the plan as well as that portion coloured black they are willing to give us now.\n\nThe new location for the school is suitable in every way for the erection of the buildings as shown in pencil on the blue print.\n\nThe point is not very rocky, and the land is a clay loam, which would be suitable for growing garden produce and also there would be no trouble in the excavation for the buildings.\n\nThe location of the building would be about 15 or 20 feet above present water level.\n\nThe water supply could be got from the lake just above the rapids by means of a sump of the water which appears to contain a few animals but a filter could be put in as the water is the same all over these lakes.\n\nAs regards sewage disposal, this could go through a septic tank and empty into the lake in the \"ay below the buildings where it would run away down stream under the building itself face E.N.E. on the new location.\n\nRev Claude Secret of Sioux Lookout would be of assistance in keeping an eye on things should the Department decide to have someone on the spot, he would be willing to act for a small salary in his capacity asatherman teacher at Macintosh School, but he would have to have very full instructions as to his duties.\n\nAlso a small gasoline launch would be required, this could be used by the Indians for transportation.\n\nA telephone telegraph could be installed at very little cost to join the telephone at the tract there would be no difficulty in having this arranged with the Railway Company.\n\nAn unloading platform would have to be made at...\nthe East end of Pelican siding, as the road along side the\ntrack to the station would not be feasible in the summer without\na large expense, owing to the swampy nature of the land. This\nwould cost very little and would most probably be put in by the\ncontractors for their own convenience.\n\nShould any work such as clearing be necessary by\nthe Department I would suggest that Indians be employed where\npossible as there are some very good workmen in the District.\n\nI consider the site mentioned above every way\nsuitable for our purpose, and would suggest that tenders be\ncalled for at as early a date as possible so that the work\ncan be far enough advanced to enable the Contractors to roof in\nthe buildings and so complete the buildings during the winter\nmonths.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGeneral Secretary\nRev.

L. C. Secrett, Rector of Sioux Lookout, and Dr. H. K. Mitchell who kindly conveyed us in his Motorboat, proceeded to the mouth of the Vermillion River. After going a short distance up this river, we returned to the bay into which it empties and landed on lot 26, in order to estimate the altitude of the highest point, and to make a close-up examination of the timber and the soil.\n\nAfter completing this examination, we returned to the boat and followed a course close in to shore all the way round the headland to the N.E. of lot 26 until we reached the N.E. end of the small peninsula on lot 26.\n\n(3) As this peninsula stands but a short distance from the point on the South side of the entrance to the narrows chosen in May last for the School site, but subsequently found not to be available, we decided to subject the same to a careful examination in order to ascertain if it possessed all the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nrequirements necessary for our purpose. Having landed on a large boulder which projected from the apex of the peninsula after which Dr. Mitchell returned to Sioux Lookout, the remainder of our party proceeded to examine the shore line of the peninsula and all the interior with the following results:\n\n(a) The length and width of the peninsula appeared to be accurately set forth on the blue print enclosed herewith.\n\n(b) The whole of the peninsula close down to the shore on all sides was covered with timber, chiefly spruce and poplar of varying sizes.\n\n(c) As our party were without instruments, the exact altitude of the highest point on the peninsula could not be fixed, but from as careful an observation as we were able to make under the circumstances, we concluded this averaged not less than 20 ft above the water level.\n\n(d) For a distance averaging about 100 ft. from the shore line along the N.E. and Eastern sides of the peninsula, land which did not rise more than a few feet above the water level appeared to be well adapted for gardening purposes, while the higher ground reaching practically all the way across the peninsula with a more uniform surface than was expected, appeared to us to provide the requirements necessary for the establishment of the proposed institution.\n\n(e) Although some rocks and boulders appeared at the apex of the peninsula, none of these were found projecting above the surface anywhere throughout the interior of the peninsula itself. From up-turned trees as well as by other means we learned that the soil was chiefly clay. This was covered to a depth of some inches with leaf mould through which male fern and other wild plants were growing in great profusion.\n\n(f) Towards the base of the peninsula on the West side a small area of water-logged soil was encountered, but as this was at a considerable distance from the higher ground on which the school and other buildings would be likely to be erected, it did not appear to present a formidable objection to the peninsula as a whole being utilized for the purpose under contemplation.\n\nI am prepared to submit therefore, for your favourable consideration the following recommendations, all of which, will receive, I believe, the approval of your representative:\n\n(1) That as the site selected in May last for the establishment of the new Indian Residential School for the Lac Seul area is not available, the peninsula projecting from the northern part of lot 26 be secured and utilized for this purpose.\n(2) That as the northern parts of lots 27 and 28, and the N.W. corner of lot 26 are not now available for Indian Residential School purposes, the whole of lot 25 and those portions of lots 26, 27 and 28 shaded in black on the enclosed blue print, be secured at the earliest convenience, and a priority claim lodged for those portions of lots 26, 27 and 28 shaded in red, to be added to and included in the School's property as soon as they become available.\n\n(3) That the Rev. L. G. Scottett, Rector of Sioux Lookout, be appointed Inspector of Construction, at a salary of not less than $75.00 a month, and authorized to engage labour, and proceed with the clearing of all that part of the peninsula required for building purposes.\n\n(4) That the Inspector of Construction be likewise authorized to proceed with the clearing of not less than 50 acres the most suitable land for gardening and farming purposes.\n\n(5) That a motor-boat, not less than 25 ft. in length and 6 ft. beam be provided (a) for the use of the Inspector of Construction, and (b) subsequently for the use of the School. (Sioux Lookout is about 7 miles distant by water).\n\n(6) That the main school building be erected about 100 yards back from the shore-line at the N.E. end of the peninsula, with the front looking out across Pelican Lake in that direction.\n\n(7) That the stock-barn and other buildings be erected to the south of the main school building, their exact location to be fixed after the land has been cleared.\n\n(8) That a roadway be surveyed, cut, levelled and graded (where necessary) from the school site to the Pelican Station.\n\n(9) That telephone communication with Sioux Lookout be provided. As this could possibly be done via Pelican Station the cost should not be prohibitive.\n\n(10) That provision be made for fencing the south and west sides of the area to be set apart as School property.\n\n(11) That the School's supply of water be drawn from the N.E. end of the peninsula and the sewage disposed of on the N.W. side, so as to be carried away by the current through the narrows on the N. sides of lots 26 and 27.\n\n(12) That special care be taken in the construction of the reservoir which will receive the school's supply of water from the lake, in order that the larger animals may not be admitted.\nThe Secretary.\n\nIn addition to the above your representative and I were of the opinion that the erection of a small shed or warehouse at near Pelican Station as possible would in all probability be found necessary in order to receive goods direct from the train, but I have not included this in my list of recommendations as it has since occurred to me that the C.M.Railway might be persuaded to provide this for us.\n\nI commend the recommendations which this letter contains to your favourable consideration and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.

Up to date I have not received any reply to my letter and consequently am not certain as to what action your Department may contemplate taking in this connection. I may state, however, that the Rev. J.F.J. Marshall, the Principal, during his recent visit to the School learned that you had called for tenders for this work and that one of the tenders was as high as $400.00 an acre. This amount appeared to me to be a somewhat exorbitant one, and greatly in excess of what was paid by your Department for clearing land at Alert Bay where the work was decidedly more difficult. After talking the matter over with the Principal it seemed to him and to me that if your Department were to supply the school management with a Tractor, blocks, cables, etc., the engineer who is now at the School, along with the assistance of the Farm Instructor whose appointment could be made on short notice, could undertake the removal of the stumps, and the preparation for seeding of the fourteen acres on which the trees have already been cut down. The assistance of one extra man who could be engaged by the day might be necessary to help in piling the stumps ready for burning, and in collecting and cutting the logs into cordwood. On making inquiry as to the cost of a tractor f.o.b. Winnipeg the Cocksburn Flow Co., informed me that they have a thoroughly good second hand tractor (Huber) 12-20 h.p. which they will release for $550.00.\n\nIf your Department purchased this, and I would recommend this action, and agreed to pay the salaries plus board of the three men referred to above, namely, Engineer $50.00 a month plus board, Farmer $50.00 a month plus board, and Day Labour $50.00.\na month plus board, the cost, apart from the initial cost of the tractor, cables, etc., delivered at the school, and that of the gasoline, would not exceed $250.00 a month.\n\nIn this way the whole of the 14 acres apart from that occupied by the buildings, could probably be cleared for a total expenditure of less than $2000.00 including the cost of the tractor, etc., whereas a contract at $400.00 an acre would amount to somewhere around $5600.00.\n\nI commend this matter to your careful consideration and if you agree to this arrangement which I have suggested I shall be obliged if you will authorize Mr. Inspector Bunn to purchase the tractor, cables, blocks, etc., and ship the same to the school.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nJuly 12, 1886.\n\nDear Captain Bimura,\n\nThe Department has received a letter today from Doctor Carleton, with reference to the clearing of the land at the new Sioux Lookout school.

He has already submitted prices, but they are considered both by him and the Department too high, and he states that he is leaving the matter until the Principal arrives, and will consult with him. I would, therefore, ask you to please communicate with Captain Bimardeau, and he will make his report and recommendation to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

FRANK EDWARDS,\nINDIAN AGENT, KENORA, DATED JULY 26th, 1926.\n\nDr. Westgate gave me a copy of his letter to you of July 5th about clearing the land, and his proposal for Mr. Marshall to do this seems cheapest and best.\n\nRev. Mr. Secret had seen the Divisional Engineer of the Canadian National Railways and says that company would let us put in a one car siding at the East switch at Pelican, and would lend us ties and steel at a cost of $200.00, with a rental of about $25.00 per annum, and we would have to erect a small shed for perishable freight. This seems the best course. Shall I ask the company's confirmation? The principal says that practically all freight will come by train to Pelican, saving handling and cartage at Sioux Lookout.\nAugust 3rd, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 5th ultimo, relative to clearing the land at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I am pleased to state that Mr. Inspector Bunn is being authorised to secure the Huber 12 - 20 H.P. tractor from the Cockshutt Plow Company if he considers it a good purchase at $550. Favourable consideration will be given also to the purchase of any cables, block and tackle necessary for stumping. The Reverend Principal might write to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards concerning what is required.

The Reverend Principal may requisition to you for cables, block and tackle, etc.\n\nI am not prepared at the present time to decide on the advisability of arranging for a one car siding for the school at the east switch at Pelican.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing for your information and guidance copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of today's date to Dr. Westgate. Please arrange to look into the advisability of purchasing the second-hand tractor which is mentioned in the letter. The Winnipeg office of the Cockshutt Plow Company made an offer to Dr. Westgate. If you are satisfied this is a good purchase, you may arrange shipment to the school. The freight address is Sioux Lookout.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bann, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, 17th August, 1926.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter as marginally noted above, also the enclosure therewith, the same being the copy of a letter addressed to Dr. Westgate by Duncan C. Scott, with reference to the purchase Huber 12 - 20 H.P. Tractor, second hand, from the Cookshutt Plow Co., for the sum of $550.00.\n\nI awaited the return of the Principal, the Rev'd F.J. Marshall of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. He came in on Monday the 16th. He and I went over together to look over this machine, we also arranged to have it in action this morning.\n\nThis is a second hand machine.\n\nIt is claimed that the machine is in A-1 condition, with this I hardly agree.\n\nWhen in action the machine did not indicate an A-1 condition, and I think the salesman figured that way too, as he suggested that the Carburetor should be replaced by a new one at a cost of $50.00, and that he would do this and not increase the cost figured at $550.\n\nWhen the machine was in action, and only for a few minutes, the Principal and I noted that there were several leaks, and to my mind this indicated faults, and the Principal agreed with me.\n\nAfter careful examination I came to the conclusion that the machine is absolutely unsuitable for the service it would put to at Sioux Lookout School, and I therefore cannot recommend the purchase as a good buy. I feel that it would be a risky investment that would be a source of trouble. The Principal is quite practical, and he feels the same as I do.\n\nExtended action would I think have shown more weak spots.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 17th instant, reporting on the second hand tractor which was suggested for clearing at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. I am asking Dr. Westgate for a recommendation as to what should now be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St., Winnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 25, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 3rd instant, I regret to report that Mr. Inspector Bunn was not satisfied with the second hand tractor, which was proposed for clearing land at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. I understand that the Rev. Mr. Marshall agreed with our Winnipeg representative. I should be pleased if you would let me have a recommendation as to what should now be done. If you and the Rev. Principal are satisfied that a tractor is necessary for this purpose, the Department might favourably consider the purchase. It might be advisable for you to ascertain what machines on the market are suitable and make a definite recommendation in your first letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\n**THE FLORIDA TIMES-UNION, JACKSONVILLE, FLA., SATURDAY, JAN. 8, 1921.**\n\n**ACTOR AS A STUMP PULLER BIG SUCCESS**\n\nInteresting Demonstration Staged Here Past Two Days on Duval County Farms.\n\nThe ease and facility with which land can be cleared of stumps roots and brush was demonstrated recently on the farm of John J. Logan, cut Kings Road, and the day preceding on the farm of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Clifton near South Jacksonville, both in Duval county. The demonstration, which took place in the presence of a number of interested people, farmers and land owners, showed that the stump puller is more than a little satisfaction on noting how readily the heavy steel cables, to a stump of the largest dimensions, removed the root system of the ground, leaving only a hole in the ground to indicate where previously had been giant trees. Thousands of people who witnessed the demonstration saw that no farmer or land owner need be dismayed at the sight of stumps, that it is possible to remove them in a few minutes after the cables have been attached to the stump puller, anchored also to a tractor, and that the operation could be accomplished in a short time.\n\nThere were 247 permits issued, 51 of which were for homes. The building total in August was the highest ever recorded.\n\n---\n\n**THE MOUNT DORA TOPICS, MOUNT DORA, FLA., JANUARY 18, 1921.**\n\n**EN AS CAREFULLY**\n\nMachine Pulls A Stump A Minute\n\nStumps will no longer bring compensation to the minds of those who have tracts of land to clear before they have been filled with trees. The stump puller, attached to a Fordson has been tested on the Ingereoll Development. The puller is attached to a Fordson tractor, and that combination pulled up an average of fifty stumps per minute, which we were on the grounds with the puller attached. One hour later it actually did pull a stump a minute for an hour. A cable was run around a stump and drawn, a signal given to the man at the machine, and in one minute, out comes the stump, often a tree ten feet long, with the greatest ease. The cable is unhitched, and the pulling continues, for in the meantime another stump has been attached. One stump proved a bit stubborn, but what of that \u2014 power pulley was used, and our cable is great. We are drawing along the tall old monarchs, being dragged from its winter sleep. The puller has its own anchor stump loop at the end of the fifty minutes, but was soon moved away by the tractor. The work continued. With the cable which was attached to the stump, the same acres could be cleared without moving the puller. And the able little machine, after clearing the stump, will pull the stump, but the same machine will also pull the stump into one place, where it may be disposed of.\n\nOne has a great respect for that small piece of machinery when it does such a thing. The saving of time and of human labor is something to be considered in these days of decreased efficiency, and that little power stump puller is doing a most efficient and useful pieces of machinery that could have been invented for the clearing of a formerly wooded country.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The results were as follows:\n\nThree acres of ground were stumped.\n\nOn the three acres there was a total of 67 stumps.\n\nAverage height of the stumps was about 24 inches.\n\nThe average diameter at the top about 14 inches.\n\nAverage cost of dynamite and labor per stump 32\u00a2.\n\nThe above figures reveal at a glance the high cost of removing stumps by the blasting method.\n\nUnder average conditions stumps can be pulled with a Tom Huston Stump Fuller and a Fordson Tractor at one-third the cost of dynamiting. In other words, the same money that you will spend to blast out one stump with dynamite will pull three stumps with this Power Driven Stump Fuller.\n\nHere's another reason why every farmer should pull his stumps instead of blasting them. A Stump Fuller not only removes the stumps, but also removes big lateral roots running out in every direction just under the surface of the ground. The blasting method often only removes the body of the stump, leaving many hidden snags and roots just deep enough under the surface of the ground to cause plow breakage.\n\nTOM HUSTON MANUFACTURING CO.,\nCOLUMBUS, GEORGIA.\nCOPY\n\nG.O.

This is due to the\nfact that we get the tap roots and all of the lateral roots. It not only\nmeans that we get more from each stump, but it also means that we leave\nthe ground in good shape for cultivation.\n\nWe pull on an average of 175 to 200 stumps per day. We have\npulled as high as 381 stumps in one day. These are pine stumps, and\nrange in size from 6 inches to 36 inches in diameter.\n\nWe are pulling stumps every day in the year that weather will\npermit. We clear on an average of eight to ten acres per day.\n\nWe have one foreman with each machine, and in addition seven\nlaborers, and we figure that it costs us about $4 to $10 per stump,\non an average.\n\nWe are more than pleased with your machines, and if later on\nwe see that we need more equipment, unless we change our minds, we\ncertainly will place our order with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEaton Hinkston.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the time of my last visit to the School which was on May 26th, the water was then within two inches of the highest level it had been known to reach. A bridge of logs which the School Management had made in the early part of the season over a spongy depression I found floating in the water. Bales of hay required at the School are still lying near the railway siding as transportation is still impossible. If you provide the team and harness referred to in a separate letter, and the services of two extra men during the summer months, it seems to me that this road could be made at a lower cost than in any other way.

I have had this measured up and if it is possible to grant us permission to expend $109.50 for fencing I think the question could safely wait until next summer. At present it is not possible for us to let the cows out to get the surrounding pasture as we have no fences, but if we could purchase 200 rds we could use it to protect the cattle at present and next spring it could be used as a line fence meeting the Canadian National at the end of the property.\n\nIf the above proposal meets with your approval we will purchase the wire immediately and have same erected as we really should be utilize the little pasture we have.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 20, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the fencing of the school property at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $110 in the purchase of the fencing material required to erect fencing for pasturage of the cows, which, it is noted, can be used next Spring in the erection of a line fence, meeting the Canadian National at the end of the property. You should arrange to purchase the wire and other fencing materials as cheaply as possible, obtaining accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost. These you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment. It is expected that the school staff will be responsible for the greater part of the labour in the erection of the fence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to your letter #129/6/9, July 10, 1930, taking up the matter again of the right of way on the north side of the railroad on Lots 25, 27 and 28, Con. B., Township of Drayton, for protection of the livestock at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThe railway, owing to financial conditions, were unable to undertake fencing that year. I judge that the Department were in the same plight and so was the school in question, so we carried on as best we could with fencing in our small pasture lot with the money allotted by you the same year, namely $115.22. Each year this was a proposition which always faced us and this last quarter I was able to save on vegetables an amount to purchase sufficient wire to fence in our east and west lines.\n\nWe have now received from the James H. Ashdown Hardware Co. eleven rolls of wire and we are starting in to erect our fences as soon as the frost goes out of the ground. We would be very glad if you would take this matter up again with the General Superintendent of the Canadian National Railways, Winnipeg as their part of the work depended on us having our side fences erected down to the right of way on the railway property.\n\nI have several times, both in spring and fall, tried my utmost to locate the east line. I have even measured with 100 foot steel tape line, following the plan of the lot #2113, made out Feb. 1, 1921, under 129/6/9, Feb. 21, 1926. But each time have failed to locate any semblance of a line, stake or other survey marks. This spring I was talking to Mr. Dynes, the Dominion Land Surveyor in Sioux Lookout, and he said he would be glad to come out with his instruments and help us to locate the same, so we will make no mistake whatever in putting our fence on our own property.\n\nWe also anticipate continuing the fence on the west line from our north west corner down to the little bay, thereby saving considerable amount in fencing, as you will note by looking at the map, our north line would take about the same amount of fence as there is on the railway, and we are anticipating at some future time to be able to purchase the property to the north as stated by the Ontario Dominion Land Department in other letters to you regarding this matter.\n\nHoping that this meets with your approval and that you will be able to persuade the railway authorities to erect their fence early this summer, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\nOttawa, June 2, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the fencing of the right of way at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Canadian National Railways, in a letter dated the 29th ultimo, wrote as follows:-\n\n\"I am giving attention to this matter now, and will advise you again shortly as to what can be done in regard to getting this fence erected.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. [Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. P. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to your letter #129/6/9 June 2nd, 1934, re. fencing this school property. We have worked hard at getting up our west line fence and I also had Mr. Dynes, Government Land Surveyor stationed at Sioux Lookout, in here and we searched for our east line, but it was impossible to find any trace of it. He wrote to the Ontario Land Office and received word back that this line had only been run on paper.\n\nIt is not for me to say whose duty it is to run that line as I do not know under what agreement the property was purchased, but it will be necessary for this line to be run by an authorized Dominion Land Surveyor before we can erect our east line fence, and before the railway authorities will consider the matter of fencing along the railway right of way.\n\nI would deem it a great favour if you would have this matter looked into and given your careful consideration. We can render what assistance is possible as far as chopping ahead of the surveyor but it is impossible for us to run out the line without one.\n\nWould you kindly have this matter taken up with the Ontario Lands Branch, and have the necessary instructions forwarded to the right parties as soon as possible, so that we may proceed with our part of the fencing, and possibly a letter to the railway company might help in having their fence erected some time before fall.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Rev.) J. F. J. MARSHALL\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Would you be kind enough to give me an estimate of the cost of running the East and West limits and, separately, the North Limit. The cost of finding your starting points from the Concession line should be included with your estimate for the East and West lines. You should allow the surveyor's time at $15.50 per day, as that is the rate paid by this Department.\n\nYou are also requested to state whether you can undertake this work, if instructions are issued to you by the Department. You should not, however, take this letter as any authority to commence the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nR.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 3rd July, I may say that I am prepared to run the Western and Eastern limit and Northern limit of parcel at Pelican School when I come in from present work. My estimate, with labor costs at usual wages for expenses, is as follows:\n\n- Western limit: $27.00\n- Eastern limit: $35.00\n- Northern limit: $42.00\n\nTraverse if desired: $30.00 (i.e., of water bound area)\n\nPlan if desired: $15.00\n\nR.

The South boundary of this property is the right of way of the Canadian National Railway but the railway company objected to fencing their right of way at this point until we had erected our fence on the East and West boundaries. The Principal of the school reported that he had purchased sufficient wire for fencing from savings he had made and was in a position to go ahead with the fencing.\n\nThe East and North boundaries of these parcels have never been surveyed and it is likely that the West boundary would require to be re-opened. The necessary survey could be made, if a surveyor at Sioux Lookout is employed, at a cost of from $100.00 to $150.00.\n\nMay I be authorized to issue instructions to Mr. R.F.

He is the only land surveyor whom I know is located at that point and he has performed surveys in the immediate vicinity of the school property and would have knowledge of the location of the corner monuments in that vicinity.

The shore line portion of Lot 26, Cons. B and C, should be traversed and the location of the school buildings definitely shown in the notes with respect to the shore line. This information is sought in case the waters are artificially raised in the future.\n\nYou should engage Indian labour insofar as possible without impairing the efficiency of your working party. Your helpers should be paid at current rates, but it will be necessary for you to certify that the wages paid are ten per cent less than those paid for similar work in 1931. The work should be performed as economically as possible, consistent with efficiency and permanency.\n\nYou should plant durable iron posts to mark all corners and if it is expected that fence posts will be erected at the true corner, the iron post may be placed to witness the true corner and noted in your notes and on the post. All boundary lines should be well cut out and blazed.\n\nYour returns will consist of pay sheets in duplicate; accounts in triplicate, accompanied by receipts in duplicate and field notes including diary.

If any workman is unable to sign the paysheet, his mark should be witnessed by a third party.\n\nYou will be paid at the rate of $25.50 per day, being $15.00 less ten per cent, for the time actually required for the survey, together with all necessary expenses when supported by receipts.\n\nYou are requested to consult John F. Marshall, Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, before commencing the survey and request him to furnish any labour he may be able to supply from his staff and pupils. He has intimated that he has men who are able to chop out the lines.\n\nWhen you are ready to commence the work, you should make application for an advance of $100.00 on account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McKinnon, M.P., enclosing a letter he received from Rev. T.H.R. Westgate, of Winnipeg. Will you please let the Minister have some information in reference to this matter, in order that he may reply to Mr. McKinnon's letter.\n\nKindly return the attached correspondence to this office when you are through with it.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosures\nMarch 5th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 3rd, enclosing letter received from Mr. H. B. McKinnon, M. P., also copy of the letter received from Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., regarding construction of a road from the highway near Sioux Lookout to the C. N. R. track.\n\nThis is the first request that the Department has received for such a road. It appears from Rev. Dr. Westgate's letter that a side road, approximately two miles long, is required to connect the Sioux Lookout School with the main highway to the Village of Sioux Lookout. If other residents would be served by this road as well as the school, it is felt that the Provincial Government should provide at least a portion of the cost. However, if the Sioux Lookout School would be the only one to be benefitted, this Department would probably have to bear the full cost.\n\nA letter is being written to the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School in order to obtain more definite information, also an estimate of the cost of the proposed side road. When his reply is received, you will be further advised.\n\nI enclose the correspondence which you forwarded.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 6, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., with reference to the construction of a side road from the highway to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. It is stated that this side road would be approximately two miles in length. Please let me know the exact distance from the school to the highway.\n\nYou should also state if there are other residents who would make use of this side road besides the Sioux Lookout School. Could you let me have an estimate of the cost of building a suitable side road as mentioned above? In the event of the Department favourably considering the construction of this road, what period of the year would be the most suitable to do the work? Any other information you may have available regarding this proposal should also be forwarded for the Department's consideration. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hesk,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. F. J. Marshall,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nMarch 11, 1937\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 6th, No. I29-6-9, re constructing of a side road.\n\nThis road would be purely for the School business. As Dr. Westgate stated there are times when it is very difficult to get the doctor here or get a patient from here to Sioux Lookout in case of sickness. That I think would be the first object of the road.\n\nWith the exception of the Railroad men at Pelican I do not think there is any one else who would be using the road.\n\nThe exact distance is hard to estimate this time of the year. According to the map it would not be more than one to two miles.\n\nThe exact route would have to be decided when the snow goes down. It would be pretty hard for me to make an estimate for the cost of building same.\n\nWe have our own road from the school to the track, a distance of a mile and three quarters, which we keep in condition for hauling freight.\n\nMight I suggest the best plan would be to send a man in to survey the land or route as soon as the snow melts, preferably before the frost left and I would also suggest that the early spring would be the most logical time for cutting out such a road.\n\nIn the event of you being able to send in some one to survey it I would be very pleased to do all I can to assist them from this end.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred A.

The only daily train goes through here about two o'clock in the morning. We have to have a special stop put on as there is no regular stop at Pelican, which we can't use any way as we can't get out to the track there. A Local passes here twice a week.\n\nIn cases of sickness it is very hard to get the doctor out or children into the hospital. We resort to a plane at times but as we are near running water that is not very satisfactory as frequently there is water on the ice. Last winter, for instance, the doctor was called and used a plane and it got stalled and they sent out another plane to pull it out and it also got stalled and it took them a day and a half before they got away again.\n\nWe have a water route for summer but that cannot always be used.\n\nThe only other people who might use the road would be the C.N.R. section men at Pelican.\n\nI might add that as far as see bridging the river would not be very difficult. There are lots of standing pines that might be used.\nP.S. Please note possible pencil route marked \"C\".\nI would be pleased to have the map returned.\nM.

Moran, Box 106, Sioux Lookout, Ont., and sketch showing the location of the proposed road.\n\nIn reply I would advise you that the need for a road leading to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School from the Highway has been brought to our attention on a number of occasions. Recently Agent Swartman advised that the Department of Transport was surveying a road location from a point on the Highway to their Radio Range, which he stated was within 1\u00bd miles of the school. He recommended that we have the surveyors of the Department of Transport survey the road required from the Department of Transport's road to the school. Accordingly, on Sept. 16, 1943, we wrote to the Department of Transport asking that this be done and requesting that they furnish an estimate of the cost.\n\nOn May 1, 1944 we received from Agent Swartman an estimate of the cost of the building of the road from the School to connect with the Transport Department's road from the Hudson Highway to the Radio Range. This estimate showed that the construction of the road to the school would cost $8,675.00, and included the construction of a bridge over the Vermillion River estimated by the Department of Highways to cost $8,200.00. We advised Agent Swartman that no funds had been provided, and consequently favourable consideration could not be given to the construction of the road.\n\nThe location of the road shown on the sketch furnished by Mr. Moran appears to be the same location as that shown on the plan furnished by the Department of Transport. No funds are available for the construction of this road and the Provincial Government do not appear to be interested as the proposed road would not serve any part of the community except the Indian Residential School.\n\nM.W.\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department would appreciate your comments on this suggestion and at the same time you should forward detailed information showing the acreage and location of the property which might be secured for a woodlot. Possibly you could discuss the matter with the Provincial Lands and Forests Agent, with a view to having him send in a recommendation to his department.

However, he states that he is unable to make any recommendations regarding the suitability of any of these lots for fuel-wood purposes, as they have not been cruised. It is my intention to look these over some time this fall and ascertain which lot or lots would best suit our purpose.\n\nIn the meantime it might be advisable, if possible, to have Inspector Arneil make arrangements with the Department of Lands and Forests, Toronto, to have all the lots set aside until such time as we know exactly which ones are most desirable.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nG.S.K\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that your estimate was made by the Department of Highways.

R. A. HOEY\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhen visiting Sioux Lookout recently I found that an opportunity appeared to have occurred at last to construct a road which would link the school with Sioux Lookout and other towns. I am sure that the desirability of this has often been raised in the past, and that the circumstances must be well known to the Department. May I just give my personal impression that the provision of a road would transform the situation of this school. It is a very costly and difficult process to maintain contact with Sioux Lookout by boat, and in the winter the only way our staff or students get to town is by walking 5\u00bd miles on the railroad track. This is a cold and dangerous trip by reason of a number of open bridges. You will recall that two members of the staff have lost their lives on this trip in recent years and several have had narrow escapes. There is also the sense of isolation which creates discontent both among pupils and staff members.\n\nI have realized that cutting a road through the dense bush represented a very costly undertaking, and have regarded it as something outside the bounds to present possibility. However, I now find that the Department of Transport has been compelled to take action by reason of an accident to one of its employees, whose speeder was struck by a train. I beg to enclose a copy of a map which has been prepared by the Civil Aviation Division of that Department and which suggests that something may now be possible in the near future. The provincial highway between Sioux Lookout and Hudson has been in existence for some time, and now a road is being carried through to the Radio Range, which is less than two miles from the school. At the time of my visit I walked to the Range and also along the trail already blazed through the bush. The bulldozer was then at work not very far away and I am advised that the preliminary work has now been done between the highway and the Radio Range. The coming of snow prevented the gang from going on with the work of grading and possibly graveling, but I was able to see the foreman who told me that if they could not finish now they would return as early as possible in the spring.\n\nYou will observe on the map that the link to our school has been surveyed and is shown in red. I understand that your agent, Mr. Swartman received a contractor's estimate for carrying this link through to the school, but I am confident that a passable road could be made for\nvery much less than this. I was advised by the foreman that Government machinery from Kenora was being used and would be available next spring from that point. On this basis the cost is very much reduced from that which occurs when a contractor is carrying out the work for profit. Mr. Cheales and I went through the bush as far as we could and came to the conclusion that only about a mile and a half would require to be bulldozed and cleared. The first link from the school to the railway is in use now and for nearly one-half a mile it could be carried on along the railway track, for the trees have already been cleared away. There is then a short stretch of bush until the Vermilion River is reached. Mr. Cheales believes that it would be possible for the school staff to build a bridge with poles so that this river could be crossed. Wood is being continually cut for fuel and if this road were in prospect the trees could be cleared during the winter as far as the river. Our hope would then be that the Department might be able to make some arrangement with the Department of Transport so that their machinery when on the ground might go through the remaining mile and a half to connect with their road.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will kindly give consideration to this important matter and shall be glad to have the opportunity of discussing it further with you when in Ottawa on the 23rd or 24th. I am confident that the cost in these favourable circumstances would be reasonable, and that the gain in the happiness and efficiency of this school would be very considerable. If some arrangement could be made with the Department of Transport in the near future our school staff would be able to work at our end of the road through the winter. When I speak of staff I am happy to say that at the present time we are in a very favourable position, with four white men working for the school also two strong young Indians and an expert Finnish woodcutter.\n\nCommending this matter to your usual kind attention, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAA/MC\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Phelan's letter of February 19th File 129-6-9, with respect to the Bridge on the proposed road from the Radio Range to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nA few days ago I had occasion to visit Mr. Kelly of the Department of Highways at Kenora, and discussed the matter quite thoroughly with him. He is of the opinion that there is only one contractor in this area who might make a satisfactory job of the bridge. This is Mr. Peterson of Dryden. Mr. Kelly believes it would pay us in the long run to use crossbeams today and longer spans. He gave a plan of this type of bridge which is being submitted herewith, and stated that it could be varied for different types of bridges although this was their standard plan for bridges in use on secondary roads. You will note it furnishes a clear width of 18' and a loading of 20 tons. Actually the load would not be more than 15 tons, as I inquired as to the feasibility of having a three-pile bridge constructed, but Mr. Kelly was of the opinion that the difference in cost would hardly justify it and that his experience was that usually when small bridges were constructed, it was only a matter of a few years before they were used extensively for larger ones. However, there is the road itself to be considered. Possibly Mr. Hill, the Department of Transport engineer, would be in a better position to advise you as to the type of bridge which would be most practical to fit in with the size, type, and construction of the road.\n\nUnder the Provincial Municipal Roads Act, the Department of Highways will construct roads on a fifty-fifty basis, which will assist another farmer etc. It might be well to mention herein that assistance could be obtained on this project, as I am of the opinion that within a few years the road will be used quite generally by the public, as a slight extension of the road would give access to the Lac Seul waters beyond Pelican Falls. I believe this will be a very important factor in years to come.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He makes further suggestions regarding the construction of a new road from the school.\n\nActing Director.\nSioux Lookout, April 24th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference is made to previous correspondence in connection with the proposed road to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. In conversation with Mr. Cheales today, he informed me he could place a few men cutting right-of-way almost immediately if he knew the exact location of the road. It is suggested that arrangements be made if possible with the Department of Transport to have one of their Engineers visit the School and go over the situation with Mr. Cheales and instruct him as to the method of cutting. If a bulldozer is to be used, I understand the stumps are sometimes left high, otherwise left at ground level.\n\nMr. Cheales is of the opinion that a bridge could be built across the stream (Vermillion River) on cribwork or piers instead of piling. He states that the river bottom is very rocky and the driving of piles would be very difficult. He has a man employed at the School at present who has had considerable experience in small bridge construction and believes this man could undertake the job at a considerable saving over the cost of a bridge built on piling. This could be discussed with the Engineer also and it would depend on his recommendations what course should be followed.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH-\n\nWith reference to my memoranda of April 19 and April 26, in connection with the construction of the new road from the Sioux Lookout School, I enclose copy of another letter which has just reached us. \"Mr. Chasles\", mentioned in the letter, is the Principal of the Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEncl.\nDear Sir,\n\nYou are aware, I presume, that last fall a line was surveyed for a road in to the Indian School. This line extends from a point on the already nearly completed Range Station Road, in a westerly direction crossing the Vermilion River, then parallel with the railway track to where the trail from the school joins the track. This point is three telegraph poles west of Mile Post Five.\n\nA few days ago in company with Mr. William Ferriss, I followed this line through, and we both feel that, though it is perhaps the shortest way, it has several disadvantages. In the first place, it extends for half a mile or so along a moss-covered rocky slope, then across at least one half mile of swamp, in which a Bulldozer or Grader would not likely work. Again, there is indeed very little wood of any value along the whole line.\n\nHaving in mind the fact that we wish to follow the shortest route possible, and, at the same time keep to the best stand of timber, we decided to strike out another line. After tramping about the bush for two days, we finally found what we believe to be the best possible route for the road to the school. Crossing the Vermilion River, we struck out in a south easterly direction and followed a ridge which sloped gradually away to swamp on either side. Keeping to this ridge for approximately three quarters of a mile, we came to the narrowest place in the swamp at our left. Then, making a sharp left turn we crossed this slight depression\u2014(about 300 feet in width), and were indeed pleased to find another similar ridge, running almost parallel with the former. Following this ridge for about one half mile, perhaps a little more, we came out on the Range Station Road at a point about one half mile further away from the Range Station than the point at which the original survey joins it.\n\nMr. Ferriss, who, aided me considerably in this work, is one of the best Indians I have met in my twelve years experience among them. For several winters now he has cut wood for us at the school. In the summer he works for District Away Engineer, Mr. Hill, Port Arthur, in clearing for Range Stations. He has also worked on road construction.\n\nThe new line as described above, and which we submit for your approval, has several advantages. In the first place it follows a ridge (high land, practically all the way) with sand and gravel near at hand to make it an all-weather road. It would require little upkeep. Secondly, there is a good stand of timber which could be reserved for the use of the school. Again, it does not approach as near to the site of the Range Station as does the original survey.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, File 470-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere are two matters which need be taken into consideration at the earliest possible opportunity. A bridge across the Vermilion River is an essential first step. This would enable us to get back and forth to work on the road, and also to haul wood from the vicinity of the new road to the school. It is no longer possible to get wood suitable for our steam boilers any nearer to the school. The second matter is to obtain sanction from the Railway Company for a crossing just west of mile post 5.\n\nWe have heard that District Airway Engineer Hill of Port Arthur will be in Sioux Lookout early in May. I believe he is in charge of the construction of the Range Station road. We hope that soon after his visit, work on the Range Road, (which has been at a stand still since last Fall), will be resumed, and carried to completion.\n\nWe trust too, that some definite arrangement may soon be made to enable us to start clearing the right of way, and also prepare material for construction of the bridge. Then when the Range Road is completed, our line will be ready for the Bulldozer, Grader and other machinery to make the road.\n\nMay I again stress the urgent need of this road in to our school. Even as I write a staff member is walking six mile to town to have a fractured arm set. You are aware too I believe, that during the last three years two staff members have lost their lives when walking back from town at night.\n\nWith a matter of but two miles, (at the most) of road construction between our school and the graded Range Road, material for bridge and other construction so near at hand; I feel we would miss a great opportunity for a thorough job if we do not make use of the machinery when available.\n\nThanking you,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(The Rev.) Principal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nActing Director\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Can.\n\nCopy sent Mr. Swartman and Dr. Alderwood\nMay 12th, 1945,\n\nMr. Rossy\n\nI am returning herewith your file 129-8-8 covering the Sioux Lookout School and to which has been attached the letter to you from the Reverend A.B. Charles, Principal.\n\nMr. W.A. Campbell of our engineering staff left on Tuesday night to look over the proposed road location and to secure first-hand information on matters relating to right-of-way and construction operations.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMr. Campbell of the Engineering Branch called at this office today to discuss the proposed road to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School. Since the school department was also present, it was decided that a recommendation should be forwarded to have the clearing work on the right of way commenced immediately. There are three competent men (Indians) who are employed by the surveyor at present and could be hired for the clearing work. Possibly five or six other experienced Indian bush workers could also be hired locally. The clearing would allow the ground to thaw out. This is necessary before machines could work on the road. The prevailing rates for this type of labour are 45\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 per hour for Indians and non-Indians respectively. The clearing rate is $80.00 per acre, and $125.00 per acre for grubbing. It might be more satisfactory to let this job on a contract basis. There are 14 acres to be cleared, and 5 acres to be grubbed.\n\nMr. Campbell proposes a 66' right of way with a 20' centre strip grubbed or close-cut, leaving the roots in place. He recommends commercial timber fuel logs, except be cut in 16' lengths, be laid along the right of way. The willow falls, rotten logs, and tops to be piled along the right of way where they could be burned if necessary, or otherwise disposed of.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Hill's estimate of April 37, 1944 lists a 60' right of way with grade 16' wide, while Mr. Campbell's estimate calls for a 66' right of way with grade 20' wide.\n\nThere is, of course, the matter of acquiring the property traversed by the road from the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. I understand the procedure in this respect is to present a plan or sketch of the proposed right of way to this Department in Toronto, showing the length and width of the road, and also stating whether it is public or private. For the present, it is recommended that it should be treated as a private road. This would prevent other interests from securing the fuel wood which might be reached from the road.\n\nReferring to Mr. Phelan's letter of February 19th, file 129:6:9, wherein he discussed the possibility of the school staff cutting part of the right of way, I have to advise that the Reverend Principal arranged to have a line cut through to the Radio Range road, which required considerable effort and many hours. This is not a little assistance to the school. However, from now on, it will be a case of having experienced men on the work as the right of way passes through fairly heavy timber.\n\nThe new location is 1\u00bd miles in length, and appears to cross more favorable terrain than that covered by the\n\n(Over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 2)\noriginal survey. Although it is approximately 2,000' longer, Mr. Campbell is of the opinion that the cost would not be greater. He seems to think that Mr. Hill's estimate was low, especially when a bridge built on piling was contemplated. Mr. Campbell is of the opinion that a bridge built of native timber on piles across the Vermilion River, capable of a 20-ton load, would be quite feasible.\n\nI understand Mr. Campbell will return to Ottawa early next week, and it is hoped that arrangements will be made to have the men who are now already on the job employed for the clearing without delay, because I know they will not wait around many days before seeking other work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nS/G\nDear Sir,\n\nRe. Proposed Road\n\nA short time ago I wrote you in connection with the proposed road in to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Swartman, Indian Agent, has since been in Ottawa, and I understood from him on his return, that a certain amount of money has been set aside for the construction of this road.\n\nSoon after Mr. Swartman's return, Mr. W.A. Campbell, Construction Engineer, arrived here from Ottawa with instructions from his chief to survey a definite line, and to collect other information necessary before work could be commenced.\n\nMr. Campbell has ruled out the original survey made last fall as impossible. He has spent several days with Transit and Level instruments on the line which Mr. William Ferries and I blazed out previous to his arrival. Mr. Campbell thinks this a very good line with no rock work. Mr. Peterson, Construction Engineer of Fort Arthur and Dryden, walked over the line with us. He too considers it a very good line for this part of the country, along which a road could be made to the school in six weeks to two months time.\n\nThere appears to be a few little things delaying the commencement of this most important work. We would be obliged indeed if you would assist us in clearing them up, and send us the word to carry on at once.\n\nFirst of all, the impression has been given, that the older boys at the school could do much of the clearing for the road. Perhaps I am somewhat at fault here, as I did mention to Dr. Alderwood this might be possible. We could have done some clearing weeks ago, had we any definite line to go by, but it is only this past week that a definite survey has been completed. One very good Indian, William Ferries, with two younger men, have been assisting Mr. Campbell, and they seem anxious to begin the clearing immediately the survey work is complete. Mr. Ferries will call in four or so more Indians to help in the clearing, which, with a crew of six men will require perhaps three weeks. If we do not give Ferries the word to commence clearing Monday the 14th inst., however, he will in all probability go back to his former work at the Airports, and it will be impossible to obtain any man of similar stamina and ability locally to foreman the job of clearing.\n\nIn his estimates Mr. Campbell is allowing so much for clearing. William Ferries who will probably be Foreman of the clearing crew will receive a certain amount per hour, the other men somewhat less. In addition we will allow them so much per cord for the wood to be cut.\nWe have been of the opinion too, that the equipment used in the completing of the road to the T.C.A. Range Station could perhaps be used for the construction of our road. On investigation we note that they stopped work on the Range Station road last fall at a place where the going is rather slow, with over a mile of rock and swampy land ahead of them... We wish to make it clear, however, that the line along which the school road will come, joins the Range Road at a point where it is graded; there appears to be a good sand road from this point to the Highway.\n\nMr. Campbell has been in telephone conversation with Mr. Hill District Airway Engineer, Port Arthur who is in charge of the Range Road construction. Nothing definite could be learned from Mr. Hill. He did not know when he could obtain machinery to complete the road to the Range Station; consequently he did not know for certain if this road would be completed this year. Furthermore, Hill could not say if the equipment used on the Range Stn. Road would be available for the work on the road to the school.\n\nMr. Campbell recently contacted Mr. Peterson who has all the equipment required, and is willing to commence work on our road in two or three weeks time; as soon as we get some clearing done.\n\nMuch credit is due Mr. Campbell for the way he has endeavoured to make a success of this venture, and may I strongly urge that his recommendations be adopted immediately that all unnecessary delay may be avoided.\n\nFinally, your Department is aware that during the past three years two of the school staff have lost their lives on the Railway Track while walking home from town. Recently a young lady on staff fractured her arm and had to walk the Railway Track six miles to have the arm set. Hardly a month passes but some need arises for a quick trip to town. All of which emphasizes the great need for action on this road construction.\n\nEven now, though the lake has been clear of ice for weeks, we have no engine in our launch, no smaller boat on which we could use an outboard engine, and the second hand outboard engine has been on the shelf for months awaiting repairs.\n\nWe are anxiously awaiting word from you authorizing commencement of clearing the right of way, that we may pass the word to the men who are here to do the work.\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery truly yours,\n(The Rev.)

The line finally adopted by Mr. Campbell was marked in the usual way with stakes on which was also indicated cuts and fills for construction purposes.\n\nMr. Campbell inspected the line located last season, and referred to in correspondence received from the Indian Affairs Branch. He found that while this line would be shorter than the one finally located, the topography is very rough consisting of low swampy ground broken with sharp rises of rock outcroppings. This was merely a cut line with no stakes to be found. It is estimated that it would have been necessary to move some 5,000 cubic yards of rock on this line, although no allowance was made for solid rock in the estimate. See the attached Indian Affairs File. Lengthy overhauling of material would also probably have been necessary. With these facts available it is estimated that it would have cost possibly $15,000.00 to construct on this line, that is, over $6,000.00 more than now provided.\n\nMr. Campbell estimates that $12,000.00 will be required for construction operations on the line selected, and while the transfer has not yet come through, it is understood from Mr. Keey's memorandum of the last instant, that $8,675.00 is being transferred. It will thus be noted that in order to complete this project, there will be required an additional $300.00.\n\nIt would thus appear that before any further progress can be made in arrangements for actual construction work, there are two major matters for attention:\n\n1. Advice from the Indian Affairs Branch as to whether the required additional funds can be made available for completion of the work, and if not, whether they wish the project undertaken and carried as far as funds available will permit.\n\n2. The obtaining of an understanding with the Province of Ontario with reference to permission for carrying on construction operations over what is understood to be land unallocated Provincial land.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWhile in the Sioux Lookout area, Mr. Campbell looked into the question of obtaining construction equipment and was successful in getting a line on major requirements from one source only. This equipment however, was then in use and would not be available until the 15th of June. In the meantime, the owner, Mr. R.J. Peterson of Prince Albert, will be looking for other equipment for his equipment. It is therefore essential that there be an early decision with regard to the undertaking of this project, or the equipment now in view may not be available. If this should happen, we have no idea where equipment could be obtained other than by shipping in from more remote districts. In addition, the equipment now in view is based on the rental terms offered him by Mr. Peterson. Therefore, if it should develop that the obtaining of this equipment might be more expensive, then this estimate would have to be increased accordingly.\n\nI am attaching one blueprint copy of plan, and one blueprint copy of profile for the proposed line. Necessary plans are also being prepared for submission to the Railway Board in connection with obtaining required approval for the crossing of the Canadian National Railway, South of the school, and at the beginning of the recently located line.\n\nThe $12,000.00 estimate is based on clearing 50 ft. for right-of-way and construction of a road with a finished gravelled surface of 16 ft. in width. The construction cost of the 50 ft. span bridge and fill over the Vermilion River, South of the railway is also included in the estimated total cost. In addition to having available equipment located by Mr. Campbell, his estimate is based on labour now available and available during the undertaking of the work during the summer season which is limited in this area.\n\nT.S.

This school is operated for us by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, and for some time past they have been urging upon us the necessity of providing a road from the school to the town of Sioux Lookout, which, as you know, is located on the Canadian National Railway.\n\nThe Provincial Highway between Sioux Lookout and Hudson has been in existence for some time and I am now informed that a road is being carried through to the Radio Range, which is less than 2 miles from the school.\n\nRecently, one of our engineers visited Sioux Lookout and I enclose one blueprint copy of plan and one blueprint copy of profile for the proposed line.\n\nThe school management has already done a small amount of clearing, but before proceeding further we are placing the matter before you, in the hope that you can grant us permission to complete the road in a manner that would meet the requirements of the Sioux Lookout School, where 135 Indian children and a staff of approximately 20 are in residence throughout each year.\n\nF. A. MacDougall, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Lands & Forests,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nWhen our engineer was at Sioux Lookout he ascertained that there is a man in that vicinity who has the equipment that is necessary for constructing the road and that we could rent this, but as the person in question has other offers for the use of his equipment, it would be necessary for us to complete arrangements immediately. I might also add that the Principal of the School informs us that additional labour is available at the present time but that, if the matter is delayed, it will be practically impossible to proceed with the road during the present summer.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would give this matter your immediate consideration and, if possible, have your engineer phone me Saturday or Monday morning, intimating if you could permit our proceeding with the road, and then we could complete the other details later.\n\nMy reasons in requesting this procedure are the availability of equipment and labour, as outlined above.\n\nMy phone number at Ottawa is 9-4465 and of course we would expect that you would reverse the charges.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa June 15 1945\n\nReverend A B Cheales\nPrincipal Indian Residential School\nSioux Lookout Ontario\n\nWIRE RECEIVED -stop- FUNDS SHOULD ARRIVE SHORTLY -stop-\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO OBTAIN\nPERMIT FOR ROAD FROM PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT -stop- AM TRYING TO RUSH\nTHIS AND WILL ADVISE WHEN DEFINITE INFORMATION AVAILABLE -stop-\nREALIZE NECESSITY FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION BUT MUST BE CERTAIN OF OUR\nPOSITION\n\nPhilip Phelan\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\nOttawa, June 19, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Road - Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of June 14, with reference to the construction of a road from the Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nSubsequent to receiving your memorandum, I arranged to have Mr. Phelan interview Mr. T. S. Mills. On June 15 we applied to the Lands and Forests Branch of the Provincial Government for permission to complete the road in the manner suggested by your engineer.\n\nYesterday the Lands and Forests Branch phoned to the effect that they had no objection and that we could proceed at once. They stated that the mining claim mentioned by your engineer has not been abandoned but is held by a man residing in New York. However, the Lands and Forests officials expressed the opinion that he would not object to the road, as it will probably increase the value of his claim. We will take up the matter with him.\n\nIn the meantime, it is felt that you can go ahead with your arrangements in order to take advantage of equipment and labour that is now stated to be available. The extra funds, amounting to $3,225.00, will be forwarded to you in the near future.\n\nActing Director.\n| Name               | Hours | Rate | Pay |\n|--------------------|-------|------|-----|\n| William Ferries    | 100   | $0.75| $75.00 |\n| Gilbert Ferries    | 90    | $0.50| $45.00 |\n| Levi Barkman       | 100   | $0.50| $50.00 |\n| Paul Southwind     | 90    | $0.50| $45.00 |\n| Frank Turtle       | 61    | $0.50| $30.50 |\n| Peter Littledeer   | 72    | $0.50| $36.00 |\n| Gerald Wesley      | 25    | $0.50| $12.50 |\n| Dick Bunting       | 18    | $0.50| $9.00  |\n| Charlie Papasay    | 18    | $0.50| $9.00  |\n| Lewis Wesley       | 18    | $0.50| $9.00  |\n| Charlie Carpenter  | 18    | $0.50| $9.00  |\n| Charlie Bull       | 9     | $0.50| $4.50  |\n\nTotal: $354.50\n\nFor time put in up to May 31/45\nMr. Philip Phelan\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find Time Sheets No.1 and No.2, as kept by William Ferries, Foreman, who handed them to me for checking, and forwarding to you.\n\nThese men have not received any pay whatsoever for this work of clearing the right of way, (which, as you have been informed by wire) is almost completed. Most of the men will then be leaving for their homes, and I would indeed like to have their cheques for them before they go. Otherwise there will most certainly be some adverse criticism of both the school and the Department. The men have done a good job, and thus it is unfortunate that they should have to wait for their cheques. In connection with making out the cheques may I once again stress (as I did by wire) that it will be practically impossible for me to look after this. I have already sent a copy of the #1 Time Sheet to Mr. W.A. Campbell, which list also shows what men on the payroll are married, or have other dependents. May I urge that Campbell, or some other person be sent up as clerk to see to this, and also carry on with the next important phase of the work\u2014constructing a bridge and culverts.\n\nJust received wire from Mr. Mills today, to hold labour if possible; I have now been holding them for two weeks, and still cannot give them any satisfactory reply to such questions as: When are our cheques coming? When is the builder coming? When is the construction of the bridge to begin? May I urge that immediate steps be taken for construction of the bridge. We have our next winter's fuel piled along at sides of the clearing; and it will be impossible for us to get it to the school without a bridge.\n\nMr. William Ferries has just informed me that all the men, and he himself will be leaving this week unless some definite word comes through.\n\nI see no reason for holding up this work in order to get some permit from the Provincial Government. I have been informed by representatives of the Department of Lands and Forests, and also others here, that they are not going to interfere with us in any way whatsoever.\n\nI am endeavouring to the best of my ability to co-operate both with the labourers and the Department. I shall continue to do so, but urge that construction be underway as soon as ever possible in order to complete same by this fall.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 25, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Cheales:\n\nI received your letter of June 18 enclosing pay list in connection with work done on the road. I immediately phoned the Surveys and Engineering Branch and found that they had received a similar letter.\n\nI realize that there has been some delay in the matter of payment, but I presume by the time this letter reaches you, that you will have received the cheque for the expenditure already incurred. The delay in forwarding the payment was due to administrative difficulties over which we have no direct control.\n\nI have no doubt that local Provincial Government officials told you to go ahead with the road, but at the same time it was only courtesy, if nothing else, that prompted us to communicate with the head office of the Lands and Forests Branch in Toronto before proceeding further. When all is said and done, the land over which the road is being built is owned by the Ontario Government and not by the Dominion Government. However, this matter has now been adjusted and it was on account of this result that Mr. Mills wired you that you were to hold the labour and equipment so that the work could proceed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

There is consequently no object in expending $600 to make the road passable in the short time there may be before the freeze-up.\n\nMr. Campbell is being advised accordingly.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 16th November, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Road to Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant with reference to the above.\n\nIt is noted that you do not consider it advisable to take the action suggested by Mr. Campbell.\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWe have been requested by the Reverend Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School to do everything in our power to obtain a permit or the necessary authorization for a Railway crossing in connection with the new road into the School. All the wood which the School planned to use this year is on the other side of the Railroad. This was cut at the time the right of way was cleared during the summer months, and it was anticipated that the road would be completed, or at least they would have permission to cross the Railway before the real cold weather set in.\n\nWithin a few days if the present cold spell continues, the School will be in urgent need of wood, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could obtain some action regarding the necessary crossing permit.\n\nG.

The grade of the track is 0.525 degrees ascending westward.\n\nTelegraph wires are located 45 feet north of centre line of main track, the lowest wire being 16 feet above the ground. These wires will have to be raised approximately three feet.\n\nThe light growth of trees shown on the plan should be removed; and if this is done a good view, in all directions, will be obtained as there are no cuts which would interfere with sight lines within 1,000 feet of the crossing.\n\nWe have no objection to the Board issuing an order authorizing this crossing provided the cost of construction and maintenance as well as the expense of raising the telegraph wires is borne by the applicant.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant General Solicitor.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAs you are aware, the road to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School has now been completed, and like all new roads, it will require considerable maintenance for some time to come. There is also the matter of keeping the road ploughed during the winter months, unless advised from the local office of the Ontario Department of Highways that they are not in a position to attend to the ploughing due to lack of staff and equipment, particularly the latter.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department endeavour to obtain a 2 or 3 ton dump truck from the War Assets Corporation, as well as a snow-plough attachment for same. This would pretty well ensure the road being kept open throughout the winter and the truck could be used to haul gravel and fuelwood which are in themselves quite a problem at the School.\n\nThe road will be a great asset to the School particularly if it can be properly maintained. One of our difficulties insofar as recruiting pupils for this particular school is concerned, in the past, has been to overcome the argument advanced by the Indian parents that their children, when sick, are unable to reach the hospital without medical attention or hospitalisation. This argument was overcome to a large extent during the past summer as results will show, when it was pointed out that we would soon have a road to the School which would mean very little, if any, delay in providing medical attention.\n\nEarly this month there were two young girls sick at the school. At 4 in the afternoon it was decided they had pneumonia, and it was necessary to arrange for a stop on the main line, for the east bound passenger train, the following morning at 6.30. The girls were taken when the fire from the School to the Railway by team when the temperature was hovering around zero and placing them aboard the baggage car of the train. This is hardly fair to the children, and I see no reason, now that the road is completed, why the School should not have a good vehicle such as a station wagon, which could be used particularly in emergency cases of this nature.\n\nYesterday (Sunday) we had to arrange for a wood truck to proceed to the School in order to bring in another pneumonia case. And this creates a bad impression on the public as well as with the Indian parents, and with this in view together with the importance of safe-guarding the health of the pupils, the foregoing recommendations are made.\n\nG.

A through truss bridge supported on rock filled cribs was constructed over the Vermilion River. Side and offtake ditches were excavated together with six heavily built culverts.\n\nWhile the material at the north and south end of the project was sandy, the middle section of clay offered every obstruction. Heavy rains over a period of two months made construction very difficult. The finished grade however, is well consolidated and will give every wearing satisfaction.\n\nTimber used on the bridge construction (with the exception of the decking) was white pine. Eight stringers were used, each length being 60 feet giving a mean river span of 50 feet. These stringers were exceptionally straight and the minimum diameter was 12 inches. These timbers were cut a mile from the bridge site, milled-to-size at water edge and towed to the bridge location. Cribs are rock filled with rock placed above water level on the river side of south crib, the north side crib being above water level. Cost of decking was higher than anticipated being $70.00 per M.F.B.M. During the latter stages of the road construction, material was hauled over the bridge for several days by tractor and six yard scraper, having a total weight loaded, of 31 tons. All logs used for the bridge were hand hewn.\n\nA gravel pit of good stone calibre was located on the south end of the school road, and 1800 cubic yards were placed on the road. Gravel was placed in three lifts of two and three lifts of gravel. Due to heavy snow, a road width of twelve feet was cleared ahead of the graving but this initial spread of gravel can be widened as snow conditions permit.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRegarding the maintenance of this $12,395.00 investment. At the present time there is a half ton truck at the school, the use of which is forbidden on highway work. It is very necessary to take care of this investment. Any new road requires active attention and the school road is certainly no exception. While hauling gravel, some size of stock of gravel of limited yardage can be loaded at reasonable locations. Not only would this stock also be augmented but while the road is in its present state (offering good hauling) additional gravel could be spread. This could be done with the existing equipment at the school, sleighs only using the bigger bays at school for loading. Undoubtedly the acquisition of a three ton dump truck is more than necessary and would fit in well at school hauling together with maintenance work. The work to be done on each mile or any section of gravelled road must not be underestimated. I would like to suggest that Mr. R.A. Kelly, Provincial Highway District Engineer, Kenora, should be approached with the possibility of turning the patrol grader over the highway two or three times during the coming year. Since the Department of Transport will require a grader over their two mile section of Range Road, the divided cost of such grader would be very small.\n\nIt will be noted the construction cost of the road over each mile was $654.00; the preliminary estimate. An explanation of this might I point out the following contributing factors:\n\nDue to heavy rains a washout occurred at Root Portage where the equipment rented for the school road was located. The contractor had to rebuild this work. This non arrival of the equipment during the month of July was both detrimental and unavoidable, July being the best construction month of the year. Consequently, therefore, was caused delay in the work other machines were working many days at a minimum of efficiency.\n\nThe final section of 2800 feet to be constructed was clay and the general effect of any machinery in clay can be readily visualized.\n\nAgain in order to get equipment on to the school road, it was necessary to fill in three swamps which accounted for sixty machine hours at $6.00 - $360.00. Finally, the mile section of the Range road which was made up of mud, waterlogged and not having any gravelled surface, was deeply rutted by heavily loaded timber trucks and was impassable. The only way to make this road passable was to have been defeated unless additional work was done on this section of the Range road. Two days were spent with the bulldozer and additional gravel placed to make the road passable, as a winter road. Tenders will be called by the Department of Transport for completion of the Range road in the early spring.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to mention every assistance was given me by the Principal of the school and the Indian Agent at Sioux Lookout, Mr. Smartman.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: School & Radio Range Road,\n\nI understand that Mr. E. F. Cooke, District Airway Engineer Winnipeg, recommends that the Department of Indian Affairs share in cost of completing the above mentioned road.\n\nFrom one who is here to observe conditions, I would urge that no time be lost in getting some action on this project. Due to an unusually early spring thaw the road, (part of which was hurriedly constructed last fall, in a battle with the elements) is in rather poor condition already, quite impassable. Water is washing the road away in a few places. We are endeavouring to do what we can with what little help and equipment we have at the school, building a few more small culverts etc.\n\nTwo undertakings are immediately essential if this $12500 investment is to be of use to us at the school. In the first place, the school section of the road\u2014approximately two and one half miles in length requires widening, gravelling, plus the construction of a few culverts. If we at the school had the two ten dump truck which we have endeavoured to procure we could do much of the gravelling ourselves, in fact such equipment is indispensable to the proper maintenance of such a road. Could your department possibly provide us with such?\n\nSecondly, the first mile and one half of this Radio Range and school road, (from the Hudson road in almost to where the school road branches off.) is very low. Much of it will be under water in spring. It must be built up considerably, and gravelled. This is the section which Mr. Cooke plans to complete,\u2014we hope, this year. With this section completed, and a little additional work on our school section of the road, we would be enabled to have the use of the road the year round.\n\nI trust the Indian Department will be able to give Mr. Cooke the assistance required; also provide our school with equipment necessary for maintenance of the road when completed.\n\nThanking you,\nVery truly yours,\n\n(The Rev.)\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Am I to understand from the enclosed letter that a new road is being constructed to the Radio Range? You will note that we are now being requested to contribute to the cost of this particular road.\n\nI realize that we may have to do some graveling and possibly a little additional work on the road we constructed last year, but in view of Mr. Cheales' letter, as quoted above, I am disappointed that the Range Road is not in the condition that Mr. Cheales' letter implied.

The estimated cost of this job is $20,000 for which this Department has, in the current year's estimates, only the sum of $8,000. We believe that the better class road which could be provided with the estimated $20,000 would be a better investment than any road which could be built for $8,000 but we will be unable to construct it without financial assistance.\n\nWould you kindly advise if your Department is prepared to make a contribution to the cost of this work in view of the fact that you are very much interested in it as far as the intersection with the school road.

This contingency was anticipated in Engineer Campbell's report of November 22nd. The acquisition of a two ton dump truck was strongly suggested in the report. The approximate cost of a two ton dump truck, hydraulic lift, would be $2500.00. Sufficient labour could be provided from the school to keep the school section in good shape, only if the two ton truck was available. Mr. E.A. Kelly, District Engineer, Provincial Highways, Kenora, could be contacted with a view to putting the provincial power grader over the road when it is in the vicinity.\n\nIt is thought that when the provincial power grader was in the vicinity it could go over the new road without any great expense to your Branch.\n\nThe uncompleted Range road is the poor section of the connecting roads and a letter has been sent to the Deputy Minister of Transport asking if that Department will complete this particular road this season.\n\nDirector\nOttawa, May 9, 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith further reference to the new road at\nthe Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, the Surveys\nand Engineering Branch suggests that you get in touch\nwith Mr. E.

I am advised that when the Provincial\npower grader is in the vicinity of the school, arrange-\nments can be made with Mr. Kelly to have it go over our\nsection of the road. There may be some charge for this\nservice, but I do not expect that it will be a heavy\none.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 2nd May, 1946.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Road Connection with Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nLast year our Surveys and Engineering Branch constructed for the Indian Affairs Branch a two-mile section of road leading from the above School to the road leading to your Range Station, and which, in turn, connects with the Hudson-Sioux Lookout Highway.

The fact that the school road joining the Radio Range road should have been included in the amount of money the Department of Transport would spend on their road. From our standpoint it would be much more satisfactory if our Department used available funds to improve the school road.\n\nLast year Mr. Cheales implied that the Radio Range road was in fair condition for traffic at the time of writing and I can personally vouch for this statement. There were about two spots in the road which required some filling and grading. This was attended to by Mr. Campbell, the Engineer in charge of the construction of the school road; however, due to heavy truck traffic during the early winter and this spring, the road became almost impassable for light vehicles.\n\nAs I see it the only one who has derived such benefit from the road is Mr. Stogryn who has wood lots adjacent to the road and he claims to have full consent from the Department of Transport to use the Radio Range Road at all times irrespective of the condition of the road bed, for hauling out wood.\n\ncc - Rev.

Of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nSince early this year I have had some correspondence with Mr. Cooke District Airway Engineer, Winnipeg, also with the School Commission and the Indian Agent as regards resumption of work on the school and range road.\n\nThe matter of completion of the Range Road, and perhaps, the widening of the school road now awaits the decision of the Department of Indian Affairs and the Department of Transport, as regards Mr. Cooke's suggestion that the cost of construction of the first 1\u00bd miles of the Range Road be shared. At present this portion of the road (which is of course used by us in going to, and from the school) is quite low, and deeply rutted, with stagnant water of the swamp on both sides. This is the only portion of the road which has not been gravelled, and should rain occur, it would indeed be impassable.\n\nMight I urge that the matter of completion of this 1\u00bd miles of road be expedited, that work may be underway soon as ever possible. June and July are the best months by far for such work. If work not begun until Autumn it would be a battle with the elements.\n\nAs to the School Road proper, it has some gravel throughout, and is passable, but quite narrow in many places. With what help we have at the school, (only three boys over thirteen years of age, and one man) we have recently constructed three culverts on the School Road, did some ditching, and placed rocks around cribbing at the bridge. There is indeed a limit to what we can do with the lack of necessary equipment, and manpower.\n\nWe trust that when equipment is at work on Range Road we will be able to get same to widen the school portion of the road, and perhaps put some more gravel on same. This would be all that is required on that portion of road which is used by us at the school. Again this work could be accomplished and maintained if we had the hydraulic lift dump truck at the school as recommended by Campbell.\n\nTrusting we may have word from you in near future, and that we may soon as possible, have an all-weather road to the school.\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(The Rev.) Principal.\nOttawa, June 14, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in connection with the road to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department of Transport estimated the cost of improving the Range Road at $12,000.00. After giving the matter full consideration and consulting Indian Agent Scottman, we have advised the Department of Transport that we have no funds available in the current year's appropriation to assist in improving this road.\n\nWhen this road was built last year it cost considerably more than we had anticipated and, consequently, it was not possible for us to obtain a further amount in the current year's appropriation for this particular purpose. However, we will endeavour to assist you in keeping the school section of the road in as good a condition as limited funds will permit. Please let me know what amount would be of assistance to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Bhalan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend A. B. Cheales,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your note of the 14th inst., in connection with the school road.\n\nAs to our keeping the school portion of the road in fair condition, might I refer you to the following note in Engineer-Campbell's report: \"The acquisition of a three ton dump truck is more than necessary, and would fit in with school hauling together with maintenance work.\" The purchase of such a truck is the first prerequisite to maintaining the school section of the road. This portion of road requires more gravel throughout, also a protecting embankment of rock is required for three hundred yards on both sides of the clay dump across the swamp in approach to the bridge. If this dump is not thus protected soon, there is every indication that it may be washed out by the unusual height of water in the Vermilion river since Spring.\n\nIn reply to your question, \"What amount would be of assistance to us in keeping the school section of the road passable?\" I would say an amount sufficient for purchase of a two or three ton hydraulic lift dump truck. In addition to this there would be salaries of at least four labourers, eight hours per day for a period of two weeks. The obtaining of outside labor is necessary as the pupils will be home on holiday, the school staff is depleted, and the months of July and August are the only season for this work.\n\nI might add that three senior boys ages 12, 13 and 14 years, and myself, have done emergency repairs, such as culverts and small washouts.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of a reply at your convenience,\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(The Rev.) A. B. Cheales\nPrincipal.\nJune 28, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with further reference to the school road.\n\nAlready, this road has cost over $12,000.00, but we appreciate the necessity of maintaining this investment. We have carefully noted the comments of both Mr. Campbell and yourself as to the necessity for a two-ton dump truck. We intend investigating the possibility of purchasing such a vehicle through the War Assets Corporation. Failing this, we will consider including this item in next year's estimates. I presume you would prefer a 4 wheel drive vehicle for such a road.\n\nAt present the Department is prepared to allow you an amount of $300.00 which can be used for renting a truck and employing labour in repairing the road.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend A. B. Charles,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INDIAN AGENT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Swartman,\nIndian Agent\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Swartman,\n\nThis past week I had occasion to visit the Sioux Lookout Residential School, and I experienced great difficulty in getting through the road. This road which was built by your department to service the school is in a very poor condition, due to heavy hauling being done over that particular section by a timber operator; if this road were only used for school purposes I am sure it would be in good condition, imperceptible, but heavy hauling has rutted it very badly, and the party using it for this purpose has not made any attempt at repairs.\n\nI bring this to your attention because one of the considerations in your department constructing this road, was that it would furnish a quick means of transportation in emergencies.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.L.B./V.M.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nOctober 11th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa,\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of letter recently received from Doctor Bell with respect to the Road to the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is a Mr. N. Stogryn cutting and hauling wood and ties over part of the School Road, as well as on the Radio Range Road. This has resulted in the Road being badly rutted and at times impassable except for trucks. Mr. Stogryn claims he was given the right to use the Radio Range Road by the Department of Transport.\n\nWill you kindly inquire as to this arrangement and if there is such an agreement, I would recommend that it be cancelled at least until there is an understanding that if the road is used by Mr. Stogryn for commercial purposes that it should be properly maintained, and vehicles going to or coming from the School, to have the right of way.\n\nOCT 17 1946\n\nG.

Bell.\n\nAs the road was constructed under the supervision of a member of your staff, we are submitting these letters to you with a view to ascertaining if you are aware of any arrangement made by the Department of Transport to allow Mr. N.

At that time you were advised that it was impossible to proceed with this work owing to lack of funds. It is now proposed to request funds in the forthcoming appropriation and to proceed with the work next spring. The estimated cost of the 1-1/2 mile portion between the Hudson - Sioux Lookout Highway and the Indian School road junction is $10,000. Since this portion of the road will be used by both the Indian pupils and our personnel it is suggested that your Department might participate to the extent of $5,000.\n\nMay we be advised, please, if you are prepared to request this amount in your appropriation for next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.J.

The estimated cost of this job is $20,000, for which this Dept. has in the current year's estimates only the sum of $8000. We believe that the better class road which could be provided with the estimated $20,000 would be a better investment than any road which could be built for $8000, but we will be unable to construct it without financial assistance.\n\nWould you kindly advise if your Department is prepared to make a contribution to the cost of this work in view of the fact that you are very much interested in it as far as the intersection with the school road. When we are advised what portion of the $12,000 you are able to provide, we will then see what we can do to make up the balance, if possible.\n\nWe shall be glad to hear from you on this subject at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) G.G.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6216, file 470-9, part 2)\nMr. T. S. Mills, Chief Engineer, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference is made to your letter of the 12th instant concerning Indian Residential School-Radio Range Road, Sioux Lookout.\n\nWe regret very much to have to admit that our position in regard to the road is somewhat ambiguous since, although some money has been spent by this Department, the work was abandoned through lack of labour and equipment, before access to the Radio Range was completed, so, whereas our Radio Branch is concerned, the road serves no purpose.\n\nIn March last we addressed a letter to our Headquarters, recommending the construction of an all-weather road from which we quote as follows:\n\n\"The School road intersects the Range Road at approximately the mid-point, one and a half miles from Hudson Road.\n\nTo provide adequate service to all concerned we are of the opinion that an all-weather road of higher standard than originally contemplated is desirable, and to this end a survey has been made and plans, profiles, cross-sections, specifications and estimates prepared, providing for a 66 feet cleared right-of-way with a 50 feet gravelled roadway at the intersection with the school road and a 16 foot road beyond to the radio range. The estimated cost is $20,000.00.\n\nThe cost of construction is almost equally divided between the two one and one half mile sections or, say $10,000.00 for the 20 feet road width portion in which the Indian School people are interested. We would not consider it unreasonable to approach the Department of Indian Affairs with the suggestion that they participate in the costs.\"\n\nWe are enclosing copy of a letter addressed to Dr. P.E. Moore, Department of National Health, by the Controller of Radio, indicating the action taken.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, we feel that we have very little authority so far as Mr. Stogryn is concerned, but we are addressing a letter to him that we trust will be helpful.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) E. F. Cooke\nDistrict Airway Engineer.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ROAD\nSIOUX LOOKOUT\n\nDr. G.L.Bell of Sioux Lookout, who is Medical Officer for the Indian School, had occasion recently to visit the School and experienced great difficulty in getting through with his car, particularly over the outlet end of the Range Road. The existing heavy rutting of this portion of the road is due to one Mr. Stegryn, who is hauling heavy loads from wood limits adjoining both the Range and School roads. Last year the Dept.of Indian Affairs spent $500 in hauling fill material and gravel on the Range Road in order to make that particular section passable. Stegryn immediately brought in a portable mill and soon the road was impassable. Engineer Campbell, who was in charge of the construction of the school road, had Stegryn (who recognized his responsibility) bring in trucks for two days and repair the damage.\n\nWith immediate possibility of an urgent call from the School of one hundred and fifty pupils, for a Doctor, we would ask if you could put sufficient pressure on Stegryn to keep heavy loads off the road and to keep that portion of the road in such condition that a car can get over the ground at any time. Stegryn is the only man using trucks on the road. He is also in the habit of leaving his truck on the road in such a position that cars cannot pass.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) T. S.

Stogryn,\n98A Front Street,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith the opening of spring road traffic, I would like to call your attention to the fact that the road to this school from its junction with the Range Road near your camp is a private road built by the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources, for the sole use of those having business with the school. It is not a public road.\n\nFor this reason, I feel I must deny you the use of the road, unless, under certain conditions, permission is granted to me writing, either by Indian Agent Swartman, or myself.\n\nWhile one regrets to have to take this action, it is felt that due regard must be given to keep the road in such a condition that it may be of service to the school, and that its use by heavily laden trucks, such as you use, is not at all helpful to the road.\n\nIt is possible that at some future date, you might be allowed the use of the road, if you would be willing to enter into a written agreement to share in the cost of maintenance.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nMay 13, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA,\n\nWe are enclosing herewith copy of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School to Mr. Stogryn with respect to the use of a portion of the Indian School road.\n\nIn further explanation I wish to advise that Mr. Stogryn has been using the radio range road also a portion of the Indian School road which branches off the radio range thoroughfare. This has resulted in the school road being somewhat cut up over the portion where the heavy trucks were used. I heartily concur in Mr. Fisher's action and trust it will be approved by the Department.\n\nWe understand that the Department of Transport proposes to do a certain amount of work on the radio range road this year and that it is their intention to keep it in first class shape. It is recommended that steps be taken to have the Contractors working on the range road do some work on the school road in order to make it an all-weather road and wide enough throughout its entire length to use a snow plow in the winter months. I would suggest an engineer be sent from the engineering branch to report, submitting detailed recommendations.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 17th, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated February 8th, 1947, your file 6864-S2, Mr. G.C.W.

This could be done with much less expense while the necessary equipment is available on the spot, than if it had to be moved in at a later date. At present the School road is so narrow in many places that the Department of Highways will not put any of their snow-plough equipment over it.

Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI am enclosing herewith a Form No. 414 with respect to the death of Amos Jacob, Pupil No. 358 at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, also a copy of letter from Dr. Bell, dealing with this case.\n\nThe Principal called this office around 9:30 in the morning of March 1 and informed me that Amos Jacob was very ill and should be brought to hospital. In view of his condition it was not practical to bring him in by sleigh consequently we arranged for an aircraft to go to the school but before the plane could be prepared for flight, Mr. Wickenden called stating that the child was dying. A few minutes later he again called advising that the boy had passed away.\n\nFuneral arrangements were made with Moffat Funeral Home and the services were held on March 4. The parents who live at Lansdowne House were immediately notified but since we have had no word from them, it is presumed that they are out on the trapline.\n\nRecently there has been an epidemic of the flu or colds and approximately forty children were confined to bed at one time during the past two weeks.\n\nWith the small staff at this school it can be readily seen that such a situation would present a problem. It is suggested that arrangements be made immediately to have a qualified nurse spend some time at the school as there is always the possibility that there may be other T.B. cases present. There are also convalescents who require special care and attention.\n\nSuperintendent, Sioux Lookout Agency\nMarch 8, 1949\n\nG.

The school principal consulted me by phone about February 13th concerning this boy. At that time he did not appear to have any acute symptoms but I had him brought in to my office on February 21 and his chest was x-rayed. He was then returned to the school and put to bed as his chest plates in my opinion showed evidence of disease. This film was thereafter Dr. Marlatt of the Fort William sanatorium who gave a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. The boy was kept in bed and isolated from the rest of the pupils pending a sanatorium vacancy. On the forenoon of March 1st he developed a pulmonary hemorrhage and died.\n\nIt is my opinion that the principal and staff did everything possible for this boy and they exercised reasonable care and judgment and they followed my instructions in every detail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? 13th Feb. 1949 - fell unwell.\n\n2. At what time of day? In the morning after breakfast.\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? To the matron.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? His temperature was taken (100\u00b0) and he was put to bed and kept there.\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? None. He was given occasional doses of cough mixture (1/8).\n\n6. When was the doctor called? Doctor arrived at this school about Feb. 19th.\n\n7. If the pupil was removed to hospital, at what time was this done and by what means of transport?\n\n8. If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school? He was kept in bed continuously except for his meals.\n\n9. Add any other useful information here.\n\nThere was an epidemic of common cold in the school in the latter half of February. At first the boy seemed to have the common complaint, but the matron suspected TB because of his condition resembling slight fever. Dr. Bell visited the school about Feb. 28th and was taken to see this boy in the morning. He found evidence of the patient's treatment. Later that day (Feb. 28th) the doctor visited me at the school. He had obtained a report on the boy's X-ray on the 21st. The plate showed nothing. Dr. Bell was asked to the next day. The First William J. Macdonald. Next day he visited the school and examined the boy and the boy had been sleeping. He said the sleeping was from the heart. I assured the matron who had already taken his temperature, coughing, etc., and she allowed me to attend to him. In the afternoon the head teacher came several times (for the boy's comfort). This was a chance to pull him out. He was under observation. He was pale and grew weaker.\n\nNorm: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\n\nThe author is aware that this report is not complete. The father was busy at the hospital, but arrangements were made by him to the Superintendent for a place to come to the school. But the boy declined so rapidly that he was dead before he could finish writing.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Allom (signature)\nThe right Honorable\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to a series of Suggestions concerning our Industrial Schools, I, in compliance with your kind invitation, beg to offer the following remarks:\n\n1st Suggestion. Condition for admission: Commencing 1st Reader and Compound rules of Arithmetic.\n\nIn places where children have only the day school class and no other opportunity to practice, they would be placed under great disadvantage. Experience shows that attendance at day school, when children have not a word of English out of the class-room, would hardly qualify them for the matriculation examination. Once admitted in the Boarding School, pupils of ordinary talent could easily attain the standard.\n\nBesides, some might not even attain the standard and nevertheless have great aptitude for the trades.\n\n2nd Suggestion. 3 years for girls, 4 years for boys.\n\nSo much depends on the age and natural talent of the pupils that I would rather leave the question of time to the Directors of the Institutions.\nAdditional suggestions: To admit in the house school as Boarders only such as might have no opportunity of attending day school.\n\nWell, but no restriction in admitting such as would avail themselves of the far greater advantages in the Boarding school. (Refer to the remark on the 1st suggestion.)\n\nFurther suggestions: Appoint an Inspector, enforce attention. Our Indians live principally by farming, fishing, trading. Besides for the market they take their families with them. Any regulation that might interfere with these various engagements would affect materially the resources the Indians have to provide for the necessities of life.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. de Banquet.\nus to give our institution proper expansive and suitable grounds.\n\n3\u00b0 The fact that the school is an Indian Reserve is objectionable; the Indians interfere too much with the management, are very jealous of the land we occupy with our farm and of the profits they think we realize from the Industrial School; hence the troubles they have caused us occasionally. Besides the surrounding Indians population exert over the pupils an influence somewhat antagonistic to the aims of our Industrial School.\n\n4\u00b0 The destruction by fire of one half of the Institution, and the desire of rebuilding it in a more substantial and desirable manner, offers an opportunity of changing the site of the school with a smaller loss.\n\nWe have in view several sites on the North Shore of the Lake Huron, in the vicinity of the Spanish River, out of any Indian Reserve, within a few miles of Clinton on the E.P. & P. Branch, of easy access by water, and quite central for the various Bands of Indians depending on the school. Negotiations for the purchase of property are not advanced enough to decide at present definitely on the site to be chosen. Referring only further, we wish to hear your advice.\nthe questions mentioned above; and as the holiday season is far advanced, we would be obliged for a prompt reply, even by way of possible ordinance.\n\nLater I shall have the pleasure of conferring with you on various matters in connection with this house.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAddress Reply\n\nTo Mr. J.

Father Paquin in his letter of the 28th ultimo goes fully into his reasons for wishing to change the location of the school from Manitoulin Island to the mainland, and his explanations show that the removal would be decidedly advantageous to the school. The Church is prepared to secure a large tract of land on the shore of the Georgian Bay in the immediate vicinity of the Soo Line of the C.P.R., and to erect up to date buildings which will meet the requirements of the Department. The proposed new location would be accessible at all seasons of the year while Wikwemikong is practically cut off from the outside world during the winter season. Father Paquin is anxious to have as early a reply as possible as he contemplates commencing building operations this Fall if the Department sanctions the transfer of the School.\n\nThe advantages in favor of Father Paquin's request for permission to remove the school to the mainland are manifold and there are no apparent objections to the proposed change if the interest of the Indians in the property at present set apart for school purposes at\nWikwemikong is guarded. Land was originally set apart for school and mission purposes, and all the Church wishes to retain is enough land around the mission; the quantity would have to be settled between the Church and the Department. If the Church agrees to this and submits plans for the proposed new building, as well as a plan of the location selected, for the Department's approval, there would be no objection to continuing the grant to the school on another site. The existing contract is only for five years and is subject to renewal but the Department should not be bound to renew it for an indefinite period.\n\nA day school will have to be maintained at Wikwemikong and the Church should state on what terms the present school building could be secured for that purpose.\nSpanish, Sept. 27, 1911\n\nJ. D. McLeod\nActing Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nActing in behalf of the Witowenitong Industrial School, I wrote about a month ago, asking your Department for formal approval of the removal of the school to another site, stating the reasons therefore. The site, definitely chosen since, is East Portion of Section 39 of the Township of Shedden, on the North Shore, right on the shore, and one mile from the Station of C.P.R. railway.\n\nIt is a most desirable location with good land and plenty of spring water, right at the mouth of Spanish River. I am told by definite answers they will be heard of the absence of formal offices from the Department.\n\nLater, on the 10th of September of November last, I called on Mr. Frank Bailey who gave no objection to the removal, but did not give us a definite answer because of the absence of Mr. Duncan Scott who was to return shortly; he would then give me an official answer.\n\nI have received no communication from the Department since.\n\nI write again today to ask you for a reply.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am already at work on the new site preparing the way for the new building, but I dare not begin the work on earnest until I am assured by your Department, that the buildings on the new site will be acknowledged instead of those at Whitecap Bay, for the purpose of the Contract signed in favor of the Whitecap Bay School. The new buildings will be superior to the old ones, altogether modern, and answering all the requirements of the Department.\n\nIf you knew the cramped condition in which are the pupils of the Whitecap Bay school since the opening of the Girls' Department, you will realize that it is most important to hurry the building of the new schools, to have them ready for the opening in September 1912. But to attain this end, we have to get the building well under way this fall.\n\nI am anxiously waiting for a final answer which, I hope, you will be able to send me at once.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. Maclean, Sec.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI send you by same mail, under separate cover, sketches of the two buildings to be erected this season, at Spanish, in lieu of the buildings at Wikwemikong, I trust they will suffice to enable your Department to judge of the nature and character as far as required. Detailed plans will be furnished the builder as required.\n\nThe Boys' Building is a frame building erected on a concrete foundation, with provisions for brick covering when funds permit. Ventilation system is shown herein; suggestion will be welcome to that effect.\n\nThe Girls' Building is of a more substantial nature: Course walls faced outside with cement blocks and inside with fire bricks; hardwood floors and metal ceilings with hard finish on walls. Ventilating shafts in walls.\n\nWater closet system, water supply by cisterns and tanks, and hot water heating in both buildings.\n\nIn regard to suggestions will be welcome to those plans. There is an iron frame of beams and columns incorporated into the Girls' Building.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please let me have a report as to the nature and extent of the accommodation provided for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nI have carefully examined the blue print plans submitted for boys' and girls' buildings by the Rev. Jos. Seguin, the girls' building being a very substantial one, semi fire-proof 150 x 50 (average) four stories in height including basement which is mostly above ground steel frame concrete constructed with terracotta lining.\n\nThe basement contains a gymnasium 37 x 59 x 12 feet high. Girls' dining-room 37 x 42 x 12 feet high training kitchen, bakery and provision room, the balance of the basement being taken up with heating, fuel and laundry room.\n\nThere is also a room for W. Closets, but no lavatory indicated, probably it is their intention to install lavatory basins there and in gymnasium. These are not, however, indicated.\n\nThe ground floor contains the Staff dining-room, kitchen, parlor, nine rooms, private lavatory (containing one sink 3 water-closets and 1 bath) and two large class-rooms, each 24 x 36 x 13 feet high which equals floor and air space for 45 or combined for 90 pupils.\n\nOn the first floor there is Chapel, infirmary 24 x 26 with bath and attendant's room adjoining, two sewing-rooms 24 x 24 x 12, girls' cloak-room 12 x 26, lavatory 9 x 19, library 10 x 26 and 10 bed-rooms.\n\nFlat dormitory is 12 feet high and dormitory is 60 x 38 and 60 X 45 and contains 61920 cu. ft. and air and floor space. 123 pupils, lavatory 12 x 12 containing W.closet, bath and sink, shower bath-room 9 x 19, two W.C. in dormitory, girls' wardrobe 24 x 24, teachers' wardrobe 9 x 19 and four bed-rooms. No lavatory basins are indicated and it is presumed that they will be placed in the dormitory without enclosure.\nThere are two separate staircases from dormitory to ground floor as well as fire escapes.\n\nThere is no ventilation system indicated or provided for. It is said that the building will be heated by hot water.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe class-rooms provide accommodation for 90 pupils and the dormitory for 123-1/5, and all other accommodations is based on the class-room and dormitory dimensions, excepting lavatories and these will probably be placed open in dormitory and gymnasium.\n\nAs the training is industrial as well as scholastic and a portion of the children engaged in the industrial work while others are in class-room, the accommodation in dormitory will probably define the number the school will accommodate, viz., 123 pupils.\n\nBoys' building is a three story frame on concrete foundation with a set off providing for brick veneering at a later date. The foundation is used for heating apparatus, bake-shop, meat-room, storage and vegetables, and is mostly below ground and apparently with very little lighting.\n\nThe ground floor contains gymnasium, boys' dining-room, kitchen and pantry, etc., two private lavatories, parlor, two rooms for Principal, private dining-room and infirmary 17 x 23, with bath W.C. and basin, and attendant's room adjoining.\n\nIn the gymnasium there are 9 W.C., but no lavatory basins indicated. On the first floor there is the staff-domestic chapel, library and staff-room dining-room, large common or recreation room, and two class-rooms, each accommodating 50 pupils and a private bathroom containing two W. closets, one bath, two sanitary basins.\n\nThe second or dormitory floor containing the boy's dormitory\ndormitory with accommodation for 100 pupils, two large store room wardrobes, 12 bed-rooms, library and private lavatory, containing one bath, two W. closets and two lavatory basins. There is also two W. closets, one tub-bath and shower baths in the dormitory with a thin partition separating them from the room and 100 feet of trough type lavatory shown.\n\nThere are two separate staircases and two fire escapes allowing exit in case of fire. No system of ventilation has yet been determined.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe dormitory and class rooms provide for 100 pupils and the other accommodation throughout the building is equal and in some instances greatly in excess of actual school requirements.\n\nThe only deficiency with regard to room is the infirmary which is not of sufficient size, unless it is intended to provide outside of the two buildings a separate isolation hospital. There are, however, a great many bed-rooms and it may be their intention to utilize some of them for sick rooms.\n\nThe number and kind of fixtures to be used should be shown on the plan also the system of ventilation.\n\nA specification completely covering the sanitary portion of the installations should be submitted to the Department for approval.\n\nR.M. Quilico\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 11, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and also copies of the plans of the proposed Indian industrial school building to be erected at Spanish River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has examined these plans.\n\nWith reference to these buildings I beg to remark as follows:\n\nGIRLS' BUILDING.\n\nThe girls' building appears to be a very substantial one and provides accommodation in the class-room for 90 and in the dormitories for 125 pupils. All the other necessary accommodations based on the class-room and dormitory dimensions are ample, with the exception of the lavatories. No lavatory basins are indicated and it is presumed that they will be placed in the dormitory without enclosure and also in the gymnasium. There is no ventilation system indicated or provided for.\n\nBOYS' BUILDING.\n\nThe boys' building provides accommodation for 100 pupils and the other accommodation throughout the building is equal, and in some instances is greatly in excess of the actual school requirements. The only deficiency in this building is the infirmary, which is not of sufficient size; it is intended to provide outside the two buildings a\n\nRev. J. Faquin, S.J.,\nSt. Mary's Rectory,\nMassey, Ont.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nseparate isolation hospital. It may be, however, that it is your intention to use some of the bedrooms shown on the plan, if necessary, as sick rooms.\n\nNo lavatory basins are indicated in the gymnasium. The number and kind of the sanitary fixtures should be shown on the plan, and, as in the case in the girls' building, the system of ventilation is not shown. The specifications completely covering the sanitary installation should be submitted to the Department for approval.\n\nWith the above mentioned exceptions the buildings are satisfactory, but I wish to draw your attention to the fact that buildings are being erected which will provide accommodation for many more pupils than are at present provided for by Parliamentary appropriation. You will understand that the provision of the necessary funds by Parliament must regulate the number to be accommodated in the school at the expense of the Department and it would hardly feel disposed to increase the pupilage immediately from the number now authorized to the number which the school will accommodate.\n\nThe drawings are returned herewith in order that you may make the changes above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nSpanish, Ont. April 14, 1912\n\nJ. W. Wilson, Sec.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe time has come to settle, partly at least, the question of the ownership of the movable property, which the Society owns at Wikwemikong, holds in connection with the Industrial School. We have at Wikwemikong a certain amount of lumber, a few thousand feet, which we wish to use in the construction of the school at Spanish; have we a right to remove?\n\n2nd We also intend to move to Spanish, at the opening of navigation, all the machinery which constitute our woodworking shop and sawmill, to utilize them in connection with the new buildings. Can we do so? 3rd Would we be allowed to take down certain buildings, which will become useless when the school is moved, such as the woodworking and shop and saw mill, one of the two barns, and move the timber of them to Spanish, to rebuild there there? Please send us clear and positive answers to these questions, to avoid all misunderstanding with the Indians.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent for the Wikwemikong Industrial School.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Paquin, Agent of the Wikwemikong Industrial school wrote the Department asking authority to remove certain lumber and machinery in the work shop, saw mill and one of the barns which they wish to utilize in the new school they are going to put up at Spanish River to replace the present school at Wikwemikong. These buildings were put up by and used in connection with the school and the framework will still be made use of by the school.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionaries have always had charge of the spiritual and educational needs of the Wikwemikong Indians and have devoted time and money to christianize and educate them. The Wikwemikong Industrial school is the result of their practically unaided efforts. Their reasons for now wishing to remove the Institution to the mainland were submitted to the Department, and received its approval. They intend constructing an up-to-date residential school building without asking grant from the Department, and it seems only fair that they should be allowed to\nutilize the material in the buildings mentioned.\n\nThe Indians have contributed nothing to the building or up-keep of the present school, and the Roman Catholics will still maintain their mission at Wikwemikong and will be within their rights in doing so, as some 200 acres was set apart years ago for school and mission purposes.\n\nThe Wikwemikong Indians will still share the benefits of the new school and I consider that the Department would be justified in authorizing the removal of the material and machinery above referred to.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Blyth\nActing Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 358664, of the 1st inst., I have to say that I am submitting your plans of the Indian School at Spanish, with references according to your request. The ventilation of the ventilation system must have been overlooked; a cross section of each ventilating shaft marked V is shown in the walls on the East and West Plan, and outside of the walls on the plan of the Boys' school. These various shafts are to be raised up into a few larger ones large enough through the roof in the operation.\n\nAs to the infirmary, it is intended for ordinary cases of illness; there is a dorm house on the premises to be used as an isolation hospital in case some contagious disease would break out in the school.\n\nThe sanitary installation will be according to modern rules of sanitation, put up by plumbers and pipe fitters with usual gas traps and vents for soil pipes, flush bowls for water closets, etc. The plan of this system will follow later on a separate sheet. Heating by hot water.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6217, file 471-1, part 1)\nNote your remarks about the superabundant capacity of the buildings, with regard to the present contract. We thought it wise to provide for a larger number of pupils than the present one, to be prepared for a possible increase in the number of pupils contracted for, as the Department may find advisable. We expect that the location of that school will bring it within easy reach of a greater number of pupils, and that the demand for admission will be much in excess of the present one. If therefore the provision of funds by Parliament would permit, and if the Department would favor an increase, we would prepare.
