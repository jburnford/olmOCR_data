It will take over $2000. to rebuild and equip the School, and we shall feel very grateful to the Superintendent General for a substantial grant toward this work. The necessary preparations are now being made for building operations to go on during the summer; and I have directed the Rev. C. R. Weaver to have separate buildings this time for the school and mission-house. Before they were together and the inmates are now obliged to live- Mr. & Mrs. Weaver in a small detached room, and the Misses Hill & Parrott with the pupils of the School in the Church.\n\nThe personal losses of the staff, who lost everything, have been quite heavy. We cannot expect any help from the Department for them, but I would earnestly beg for generous treatment of the Mission.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYrs. respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) W. A. Burman\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to the fire which destroyed the Church of England Boarding School at Lake Wapuskow in Treaty No.8, and to enclose a letter from Rev. W. A. Burman applying for help towards rebuilding. The fire took place on the 12th of November last, and the first news was received in the first days of December. It occurred at night, and everything was lost except night clothes.\n\nIt may be remembered that all buildings in connection with schools in Treaty No.8 have been put up by the two denominations who are at present attending to the educational wants of the Indians of the district, at no cost whatever to the Government, the latter providing only per capita grants for maintenance, as also school material.\n\nI therefore submit Rev. Mr. Burman's request with strong hope that it may be granted, as it is an exceptional claim.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nboarding school at this place.\n\nMartin Barker\nOTTAWA, 4th February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner forwards a letter from Rev. Mr Burman, who asks for assistance in rebuilding the Ch. of England boarding school at Lake Wapuskaw in Treaty 8, which was totally destroyed by fire in November last. The Department never contributed anything towards the erection of this school, which was put up by the Church, and it has only been recognized as a boarding school since September 1902, when a grant of $72.00 for each of 15 pupils was allowed. Mr Inspector Conroy who visited the school last year, says that he found about 23 pupils in attendance then. The last return shows that there were 16 on the roll.\n\nThis school was conducted for some years by the Church independently of the Department and the Commissioner expresses the hope that Mr Burman's request for assistance may be granted as it is an exceptional claim. Mr Burman states that it will take over $2000.00 to rebuild and equip the school, and if the Department makes any contribution I suppose it would be expected to give at least $1000.00.\n\nThe Roman Catholics also have a boarding school at Wapuskaw, which receives the same grant as is paid the Ch. of England school and it seems unfortunate that both these churches should each have a\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 24th February, 1904.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reference to the burning of the Wabiscow School buildings, Mr. Burman is asking for assistance to rebuild. I think that the Department ought to give some substantial aid in rebuilding this School, as it was fairly well equipped and, I think, had accommodation for about twenty-five pupils. It is the only boarding-school, excepting the R.C., that is in that country. When I was there they were accommodating their pupils in the Church building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector, Treaty No. 8.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nThe application which has been received from Rev'd. W.A. Burman for assistance to re-build the Wabiscow Boarding School buildings is the first of this nature which has been received from Treaty No. 8. It therefore behooves us to consider the matter very carefully before agreeing to any such expenditure.\n\nIf we are to adopt the same principle for the provision and maintenance of boarding schools and industrial schools in this treaty as obtains to the others, we shall add greatly to the expenditure for education. We are under no obligation to provide any special form of education under the treaty. The clause which deals with this matter is as follows:\n\n\"Her Majesty agrees to pay the salaries of such teachers who instruct the children of said Indians as to her Majesty's Government in Council may seem advisable.\"\n\nThe Department, in committing itself to a maintenance grant for boarding schools within the district, at once assumed a large expenditure, and it is my view that we should not add to our responsibilities further than by continuing to pay such grants, leaving the Church authorities to erect, furnish and equip the buildings. As Mr. Benson points out, we have not given any contribution towards the erection of the school, nor, as a matter of fact, any other school in Treaty 8, and I think the policy of the Department for education in this Treaty should not at present be allowed to expand.\n\nOTTAWA, March 17th\u20141904,\n\nDept. of I.A.\n\nAccountant.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Mar 19 1904\n\nAct. I agree with the view that in matters of expenditure for schools in Treaty &c. we should move carefully. A little more be sent stating in moderate language the reasons that operate against allowing to grant asked for.\nOTTAWA, March 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th January last, enclosing a copy of a letter from Rev. W.A. Burman, applying for help towards rebuilding the Church of England boarding school on Lake Nipigon in Treaty 8 which was totally destroyed by fire last November, I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot at present make any provision for this object.\n\nAlthough the Department has provided grants for boarding schools within Treaty 8, which has entailed large expenditure, it does not consider that it would at present be justified in further expanding educational work in this Treaty and it has decided not to add to its responsibilities by paying any more than the grants already provided, leaving the Church authorities to erect, furnish and equip the buildings.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHon.

I have noted that the total amount required for these two schools will be under $1000.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S.

Apparently the chimney of the kitchen stove caught fire, that is the Tar that gathers on the Tin, (although we make a point of cleaning this particular chimney about once a month). This must have ignited the roof, from which the flames caught the Beaver Board on the Ceiling. Some of this Beaver Board dropped on a bed which caught in flames; only at this stage was it discovered. It fortunately happened in the daytime about Three in the afternoon. Mr. Lovegrove was on the spot and applied water extinguishing the bed. The Flames shooting through the roof attracted those around, and they got it under control only just in time. Fortunately there was no wind. The roof is burned about 15 feet along the ridge, and three feet down on either side, about Six slabs of Beaver Board are destroyed and Five Quilts valued at Five Dollars each. They took down the Chimney and covered the burned part again with boards and some tin Shingles. It would be a good thing if we could have enough Shingles to re-shingle the whole of the Kitchen roof. On Sunday we publicly thanked Almighty God for preserving the Mission from destruction. We need very badly another Chimney to put on the roof at the other end into which the pipes of the other stove may run. The two stoves which are constantly in use are too much for our Chimney, the soot and tar gathers too quickly.\"\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose an extract from a report presented by the Ven. Archdeacon A. S. White, Principal of St. John's School, Wabasca, Alta., in which he sets forth the extent of injuries recently sustained by that school through fire. It can readily be seen from the report that the consequences of the fire might have been very serious.\n\nWhile it may be possible to receive some compensation in the way of insurance, it is not likely that this will be sufficient to purchase the shingles required to re-shingle the whole of the kitchen roof, or to build the chimney referred to in the Archdeacon's report. I shall be glad, therefore, to know if you will authorize our Society to undertake any expenditure which may be necessary in this connection, and any other repairs or improvements which may be required to make the school habitable during the coming winter. It is not the intention of our Society to spend any large sum of money on any of their three Indian Residential Schools in the Diocese of Athabasca, but as this school is so difficult of access, and I was unable to visit it during my visit to that part last February, I shall be glad to know the exact amount of money which you will sanction for any urgent repairs, such as those mentioned above, which may be necessary. It seems to me, so far as I am able to make an estimate at this distance, that somewhere about $1,000.00 will be required.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\nMay 11, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nHereunder is a request from the Rev. T.H.R. Westgate, Field Secretary, H.S.C.C., for a grant of approximately $1000 to carry out repairs to the school building in connection with the Wabasca C. of E. Boarding School.\n\nA fire occurred at this school in March, which did damage to the roof and dormitory. Dr. Westgate states that it will be necessary to re-roof the roof of the kitchen and undertake any other work required to make the school comfortable during the next winter. He further states that it may be possible for the Church to secure some compensation from the insurance on the building, but this will not be sufficient to make the repairs and improvements needed.\n\nWe have no funds specially provided for repairs or alterations to any of the Church of England schools in the Diocese of Athabasca. In a letter hereunder to Rev. Canon Gould, dated September 27th, last, you state that, if funds are available, assistance towards the carrying out of the most urgent repairs needed at this school and the Whitefish Lake Boarding School will be granted.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive your decision as to whether or not a grant will be allowed, as requested by Dr. Westgate.\n\nI may add that requests have been received from the two other C. of E. Boarding Schools located in this Diocese viz: Whitefish Lake and Lesser Slave Lake, for the purchase of paint, glass, etc. These requests were made by the principals upon instructions from Dr. Westgate, who stated that the Department would be responsible, in future, for the making of repairs to the existing buildings until such time as modern buildings would be provided. Dr. Westgate has evidently written to the Standing Committee of all the Anglican Church owned buildings to this effect.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sutherland, officer in charge of the Schools Branch in the absence of the Superintendent of Indian Education, and to say that I recommend that the request of Rev. T.M.R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, for a grant of $1,000 for repairs to the Wabasca Church of England Boarding School building be acceded to, and would ask for your approval of this expenditure.\n\nDuncan Dewitt,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 21, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing an extract from the Rev. Principal, relative to the present needs at the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Boarding School. I have noted that it is necessary to reshingle the whole of the kitchen roof and to build a chimney, and that certain other repairs and improvements are required before the institution is habitable for the coming winter.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department will meet the expense for the materials necessary in this connection up to the amount of $800. You may authorize the Rev. Principal to purchase these materials required by securing competitive prices for any item over $15. When competitive prices have been received, an abstract of tender form, in duplicate, should be made out and submitted to the Department with the accounts, which should also be in duplicate and properly certified by Mr. Indian Agent Laird of Grovend, Alta. If the price of any item among the materials needed is above $15, the purchase should not be made without further reference to the Department. The requirement should be drawn to our attention and we will ask the Purchasing Commission of Canada for a list of the firms from whom quotations should be received. This list will be offered to you or to the Rev. Principal, and the purchase can be made in the regular way.\n\nI would refer you to circular letter No. 1-1-5 dated October 20th, last, which should guide you in the matter of the purchases for the repairs at the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Boarding School. I am directing, under separate cover, a book of Abstract of Tender forms, some of which should be given to the Rev. Principal to be used in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary M. S. C.

The Farm Instructor at that school, who is a very practical man, recommends that the engine should be of the \"Z\" type, and with not less than eight horse power, such as you supplied to our Society's School at Onion Lake, and I am prepared to support his recommendation in this matter.\n\nAs the cost would not be very heavy, and the need undoubtedly very great, I shall be obliged if you will give this request favourable consideration.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\nOttawa, Sept. 13, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, requesting the Department to supply a pole saw and gas engine for the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret to inform you that the funds available for this institution have been exhausted. You will recall that the Deputy Superintendent General promised favourable consideration in the case of the Whitefish Lake and above named schools: the sum of $1000 was mentioned in this connection. I have examined the files and I find that $800 has been authorized for the Wabasca institution, already.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B.

C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith further reference to my letter of Sept. 7., and your reply (No. 131-8-5) of Sept. 13, concerning the grant of $800.00 for our Society's School at Wabaseg. I beg to state that as I had no knowledge of this money being expended on the School I wrote to Archdeacon A. S. White, the Principal, for information as to whether it had been expended locally, and if so in what way and on what authority. In his reply dated Nov. 19, and which I have just received, he states that this money has not been expended. It appears to have been intended for repairs to the kitchen roof which was damaged by fire, but as it was impossible to get in the lumber before this winter they had to fix up the building as best they could with local material. As the Principal states that the permanent repairs cannot be effected before next spring, and that the whole of the $800.00 will not be required for this purpose, I shall be grateful if you will reconsider my request for the engine and pole-saw, as set forth in the above letter. If $300.00 were spent on these this year the balance of $500.00 could be carried over to next year for the repairs to the main building, and would prove, I believe, sufficient for that purpose.\n\nI commend this request to your sympathetic consideration and have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/FEC.\nOttawa, Dec. 7, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with further reference to the supplying of a pole saw and engine for the Wabasca C. of E.

In view of your explanation, I am pleased to inform you that the Department will purchase and deliver to the Rev. Principal one 8 horse power engine.

Archdeacon White, the Principal.\n\nAs the log foundations of the main school building have rotted allowing the superstructure to settle in many places, the ground floors can only be described as being in a deplorably dangerous condition, while the boards in the floors of the girls' dormitory have become so shrunken and worn as to be unsafe for even another year.\n\nIn addition to the items given on the enclosed list I beg also to call your attention to the great difficulty which the Principal and the farm instructor have from year to year in securing an adequate supply of hay and fodder for the horses and cattle and to suggest that, as only a comparatively small part of the land attached to the school has been cleared and made available for farming and gardening purposes, an authorisation be given to have a further ten acres cleared. As this could be accomplished at the rate of about $40 an acre I earnestly hope that this request may receive your sanction.\n\nOn page 4 of the List of Requirements for our Society's schools for the ensuing fiscal year as forwarded to the Deputy Supt. General with my letter of Oct. 30th last, you will observe that the sum requested for general repairs at this institution was $750. This estimate was made out before I had visited the school and observed for myself the existing condition of affairs and although that sum will be insufficient to clear the land and to furnish repairs, etc., mentioned on the enclosed list, I fail to see how it would be possible for our Society to continue to operate this school for another year without exposing both the staff and the children to very great danger and without\nOttawa, April 2, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School. I note that repairs and replacements will have to be made in the near future and that more land should be cleared. It is true that you requested that an item of $750 be placed in the Estimates, for general repairs at this school; but I regret to inform you that it was not allowed. For many years, it has been the practice of the Department to provide a per capita grant and to supply classroom materials and drugs at church-owned Indian residential schools. For the past three years, when funds could be found for the purpose the Department gave favourable consideration to capital expense. However, the responsibility for keeping the church-owned schools in good repair is with the church authorities. If funds can be found the Department will gladly assist; but there are so many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, that the northern church-owned schools will have to be kept in good condition by the management, unless funds are specifically provided.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available at the present time for repairing the buildings or clearing land at the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

It is agreed that the foregoing statement of the Assistant Deputy and Secretary is made under a misapprehension and is not in accordance with the agreement reached with the Honourable the Superintendent General as acknowledged in his letter dated April 21st, 1922.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 26, 1926.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to repairs to church owned Indian residential schools. At an interview with church representatives in April, 1922, the Honourable the Superintendent General stated that the Department would endeavour to keep the church owned buildings in a state of good repair until such time as new buildings could be provided. Mr. Stewart's letter to you of the 21st of the same month reads in part as follows: \"As an interim arrangement, the Department of Indian Affairs will endeavour to have voted the funds necessary to enable the church authorities concerned to carry out the urgent repairs on the residential school buildings owned by them.\"\n\nThe intention behind the words quoted seems to me to be perfectly clear, and I am pleased to carry it out. If there was any ambiguity in the wording of the letter of February 19th to Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald, your understanding is not affected thereby. You will understand that requisitioning for urgent repairs must of necessity precede the granting of funds by Parliament. There are so many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, that many items are crowded out of the Estimates. Certain repairs, particularly minor ones, will have to be financed by the respective school management. I wish to assure you that, when funds are available, the Department will gladly assist with the necessary building activity at both state and church owned Indian residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

They should make a reduction in their quotation because of the cheaper lumber that they can secure locally. The Department considers the local lumber is quite suitable for this purpose.

He further advises me that the new grant cancels the other contract for repairs, and he also says that he will not have any lumber from the R.C. Mission, as it is not of uniform thickness, which will mean that any lumber used will have to be brought from outside and will cost more than the lumber from the local mill.\n\nHe has asked me to go over to the Mission and see what work he requires done, which I have agreed to do, but I will not do anything further in the matter until I hear from you.\n\nI will be favoured if you will let me know at your earliest convenience if Mr. Longmore's statements are correct.\n\nRegarding the R.C. Mission lumber, I have used some myself, and have found it as good as any other lumber that I have had from the outside, but must admit that the first lot that was cut here was poor stuff, and was as Mr. Longmore says not of uniform thickness. It is immaterial to me where the lumber comes from, but I think the local stuff is just as good as any other, besides being considerably cheaper.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H.

I have, therefore, to state that the authority granted you in our letter of the 1st instant will stand, and you can arrange with the Hudson's Bay Co. to carry out the work as instructed in our letter above referred to early in the summer of 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I note the total cost of the new buildings, reflooring, repairs and fencing will be $780. If any of the lumber is supplied in 1927, please see that the company make a reduction in their quotation.\n\nWhen the work has been satisfactorily completed and has been inspected by yourself, you should prepare a voucher in favour of the Hudson's Bay Company and attach the original letter from the company of the 17th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Indian Agent Laird, at the request of the Principal, wrote in concerning the buildings and certain fencing, and he was asked to get an estimate of the cost. The Hudson Bay Company at Wabasca quote on the erection of a warehouse and toilet, the laying of new flooring in the main building, repairing the roof and one-half mile of fencing. Their price is $780.00, including materials, freight and labour.\n\nThere is no doubt about the urgency of these repairs, and I wish to recommend that the Hudson Bay Company's offer be accepted.

SCHOOL.\n\nOn page 4 of the list of requirements submitted by our Society to your Department to be provided next year, the sum of $3,000.00 was included for repairs to the buildings at our Wabasca School. The Principal of this school was instructed to prepare an itemized list of the repairs necessary, and I enclose herewith a copy of the one he has submitted. In his covering letter, dated Dec. 8th, he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I have gone into the whole matter very carefully with the assistance of Mr. Arnold and Mr. Gallagher of the Hudson Bay and, as far as I can see, it will take in the neighbourhood of $2,400.00 to put place into a condition fit to live in, all these repairs etc., are badly needed and each year adds to the burden.\"\n\nFrom your letter of Nov. 20th, (No.131-8-5) addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Laird, and a copy of which has reached me through the Principal, I gather that you have authorized an expenditure for repairs and some fencing, amounting to $780.00 less reduction in cost of lumber if secured locally.\n\nAs it is apparent from the enclosed list of repairs that they cannot be effected for the amount you have specified, I beg to request that the expenditure of an additional $2,220.00 be sanctioned, and that our Society be authorized to secure the material and proceed with the work. Any of the rough lumber made locally will be utilized so far as possible, but the finished lumber, shingles, tarpaper, etc., will have to be freighted in, and this can only be done in the freighting season.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nwhich ends in March.\n\nThese repairs when effected will make it possible for the work of the school to be carried on for another year or two, by which time, it is hoped a new institution, amalgamating our three schools in that part of Alberta, may be provided.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/ER.\n\n| Item          | Square Feet | Liner Feet |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|\n| Wall Board    | 1800 sq ft  |            |\n| Finished 1\"x6\"| 740 lin ft  |            |\n| Shiplap       |             |            |\n| Rough 1\"x6\"   | 100 lin ft  |            |\n| Rough 2\"x4\"   | 100 lin ft  |            |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to repairs required at the Wabasso C. E. Indian Residential School. I have carefully examined the list attached to your letter, and I find that the flooring mentioned on Page 1; that the repairs to the roof (Page 2); the flooring (Page 3); the new store house; the fencing and closets (Page 4), are all included in the authority which we have already directed to Mr. Indian Agent Laird.\n\nAs the supplying at an early date of materials necessary for the other repairs is desirable, I am authorizing Mr. Indian Agent Laird to purchase the following:\n\n- 4,750 Sq. Ft. Wall Board,\n- 1,910 Lin. Ft. Finished Lumber, 1\"x6\",\n- 300 Bd. Ft. Shiplap,\n- 1,100 Lin. Ft. Rough Lumber, 1\"x6\",\n- 300 Lin. Ft. Rough, 2\"x4\".\n\nThis material is what is required for the repairs listed. Mr. Indian Agent Laird is being authorized to purchase this lumber and to have it delivered to the school. He is also being instructed to arrange for the services of one carpenter when timely. The other labour will have to be supplied by the school management.\n\nThe school management will have to be responsible for the moving of the foundation logs of the school house and for a new window frame for that building, as well as for the 8 logs for the foundation of the Principal's home. At a later date, you may initiate correspondence concerning the plastering of the outside walls of the main building and the Principal's residence. If an item for repairs to this school is allowed in our Estimates 1927-28, it is possible that the Department can grant some assistance.\n\nI regret that I cannot agree to a new barn at this school, as its future is undetermined at the present time. If the present barn requires a new roof, the materials necessary should be made known to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. B. R.

E. Indian Residential School. Included in this list were found the items concerning which authority was directed to you on April 1st last, and repeated in my letter of the 20th ultimo.\n\nIn addition to this work, the Department has decided to allow materials for other purposes, and you should purchase and arrange for delivery at the school of the following:\n\n- 4,750 Sq.

When it is timely, you may engage the services of a competent carpenter who will proceed to the school and undertake the repairs with the assistance that can be given him by the staff and older pupils at the institution. The rough lumber, at least, should be secured from the R. C. Mission if possible.\n\nThis lumber is to be used for lining the inside walls of the main building and the Principal's residence; for ceiling the big girls' dormitory and for lining the walls of the cellar. The Reverend Principal, with Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Arnold of the Hudson Bay Company, has prepared a list of what is required, and the Principal will be able to give instructions to the carpenter as to the work.\n\nI have informed the Church authorities that they will have to be responsible for moving the foundation logs of the school house and for the new log foundation for the Principal's home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am sending a copy of your letter to Mr. Arnold, the Acting Principal of this school, and am requesting him to furnish me with a statement in connection with these two matters. This school, like the one at Whitefish Lake, is built of logs, and is low-set. In another communication which I am forwarding by concurrent post, I have stated that the most suitable type of fire escape for buildings of this sort is peeled poplar poles placed side by side and sloping from the lower part of the upstairs dormitory window outwards to the ground. I am instructing Mr. Arnold to have fire escapes of this type installed at once, and to see that fire drill is carried out not less frequently than once a week.\n\nIn view of the specific instructions which were issued by our Commission to all Principals with regard to safeguarding the lives, and property, at the Schools from fire, I am not a little perplexed at the reports which you have received from Mr. Indian Agent Laird. I am, however, acting promptly after receiving your letters of July 17th, with regard to the situation at the Whitefish and the Wabasca Schools, and may have another communication to address to you in connection with these matters when I have received statements which I am asking the managements of these schools to furnish me.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He also states that fire drill has been given, and directs my attention to the need of a fire alarm. Some time ago I suggested the use of a plow mould board for this purpose, in order to keep down expenses, but Mr. Arnold states that he had tried this, and has not found it satisfactory. He also states that the ringing of the hand bell does not waken the children, and requests that he be furnished with an electric alarm and 70 ft. of wire to install the same. Mr. Arnold has the batteries for supplying the current to operate the alarm, and it seems to me that he should be provided with the electric alarm he suggests and the wire, or else a good size bell which would produce sound enough when rung, to waken the children. I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with your authorization to provide either of the above, in order that the safeguards at this institution may be made as safe as possible.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The arrangements at present consist of peeled Poplar poles placed against the upper windows but taking into consideration the tender age of many of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\nChildren's their consequent inability to climb out of the windows & slide down the poles in any degree of safety. I beg to suggest that permission be granted to erect two wooden chutes reaching up to the windows at each end of the building, down which the children could slide without any danger of sustaining injury. The chutes could be built of local lumber so would not be at all expensive. 20 ft would be sufficient for what is required.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nbelieve me,\n\nJames faithfully,\n\nS.

It is understood that the labour in erecting these chutes will be performed by the school management without cost to the Department.

In my letter to you I am afraid I did not make myself sufficiently clear as to my needs, which are for Stationery & Envelopes. I do not know whether you do supply such to your Indian Schools, but if you do I should be glad of a supply.\n\nI am going over the question of Fire Escapes for these buildings. In place of a wooden Chute, would it be possible to obtain a Canvas Chute, such as used in the Cities. Two would be required, one for each end of the building.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTo be fixed on the inside of the window of each staff bedroom when it would be instantly available in case of fire & would be under the supervision of the staff & would not be affected by climatic changes. Also there would be less danger of the children receiving injury as they would be placed in the chute from the inside of the room.\n\nMay I mention that the floors of this school are in a very poor condition. In some parts of the Class Room it seems as if there were no supports, this being due to the sagging of the foundation logs. The Refectory ceiling requires Beam Board as also does the Staff bedroom, & the floor of the Refectory requires repair in places & painting. 10 Gallons of Floor Paint would help considerably to brighten the school & is really needed.\n\nI shall be so glad if you would favorably consider these requests.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nW.H. Smith, Indian Agent.\n\n(P.S.) S. Richardson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 23, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Wabasca C. E. Indian Residential School, with reference to improvements. I may say that, as soon as funds can be provided, it is the intention to discontinue the use of this building, and only temporary repairs, sufficient for two or three years, can be undertaken. Further expensive equipment must not be supplied. The canvas chutes come under this last named category, and the Department believes that the wooden chutes first proposed should be utilized as supplementary fire escapes. When you have an estimate of the cost of strengthening the floor in the classroom, you might forward it to the Department. I doubt if favourable consideration can be given to beaver-boarding the dining room and the staff bedroom.\n\nInform the Rev. Principal that he should repair the floor of the dining room without cost to the Department and that you will supply whatever paint is really required. You are hereby authorized to purchase up to 10 gallons of paint for this purpose. Please see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

As you are aware, the Department hopes to replace these three institutions in the not distant future and, as the Appropriation is extremely limited, no items were included for replacements or repairs at these schools. I have to suggest, therefore, that the managements get along as well as they can with the equipment now on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man., April 15th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast month I visited our Society's 3 Indian Residential Schools at Wabasca, White Fish Lake and Lesser Slave Lake respectively, chiefly for the purpose of ascertaining the repairs and improvements which must be provided to make it possible for the work to be continued for another year or two, until the proposed amalgamation of these 3 Schools has been completed, and a fully modern building constructed for each of the institutions visited. I went very carefully into this question with the Principal and the male agent on his staff, and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of the list which was drawn up on the spot, and a further copy of which was handed to Mr. Indian Agent Laird at Grouard. The estimated cost in each case, is only approximate, but they will serve as a guide to the total amount required. When I discussed this matter with Mr. Indian Agent Laird he expressed the wish that he had been advised of these requirements last Autumn. I explained to him that it was quite impossible for us to know at that time that precedence in the matter of new Schools to be built by your Department for our Society, was not to be given to the one we had requested on page 2 of our list of requirements for this year, namely, the one to supersede the Wabasca, White Fish Lake and Lesser Slave Lake Schools in Northern Alberta. When that list was compiled it was felt that the nominal sum of $800.00 in each case requested for repairs at these institutions (see page 4 continued of our list) would be sufficient to enable the respective School managements to carry on until the new consolidated School was ready to be occupied. The decision, however, which has been reached by mutual agreement, between your Department and our Society that precedence in the matter of Schools to be built on our behalf, should be given to Shingwauk Home, has altered the situation, and made it absolutely necessary for the\nRepairs and improvements set forth on the enclosed list to be provided in order that the work at the institutions mentioned may be continued until they have been superseded by the central School which we have under contemplation.\n\nWith regard to the work involved the Principals in each case informed me that most of it could be done by local Indian labour, and they felt that it would be a very great help to the Indians who have passed through an exceedingly trying winter on account of the shortage of fur, if they were authorized to undertake the repairs and improvements at once. The situation deserves prompt and careful consideration, and I earnestly trust that you may be able to advise me in the near future that your Department will furnish an authorization for our Society to proceed with the same.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nTBRW/JF\nNEEDS OF WABASCA C.

Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the extra beds, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase from either Simmons Limited or the Parkhill Bedding Company, of Winnipeg, of four beds for staff members and six beds for the pupils. You should obtain prices from the above firms, and make the purchase from the one quoting the lowest price. The beds, while serviceable, should be of an inexpensive type. You can, no doubt, arrange with the Company from whom the beds are purchased to prepay the freight charges in shipping them to the school. Please obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the beds and also a receipt for the freight charges. This account you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment, with the receipt for the freight charges attached.\n\nI regret the Department cannot provide the funds required in arranging for another staff room or in supplying 25 new desks for the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

As circumstances at present appear to indicate that we will be obliged to continue our work in the existing building for another year, I sincerely trust that your Department may be able to sanction this expenditure also, in addition to 25 new desks for the class-room.\n\nAs I am asking our Commission to add two more cows to the school herd, to provide two more heaters for staff rooms, 500 feet of beaver board for the walls, a garden seeder, etc., I hope it may be possible for your Department to help our Society by providing the items I have mentioned. As all freight for this school should be delivered at Slave Lake, Alberta, on the N.A.R. not later than the beginning of February, a prompt reply will oblige. If the expenditure is authorized our Commission can take care of the purchasing and shipments should your Department desire them to do so.\n\nIn another letter which will be addressed to you, you will be informed of the retirement of the Rev.

E. Indian Residential School for lumber to make alterations at the school, to provide accommodation for five extra pupils.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the per capita grant is allowed for 25 pupils only and it is noted that accommodation is now available for that number. Our funds this year are extremely limited and the Department will be unable to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of the lumber, as mentioned in the Principal's requisition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nOttawa, August 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 5th instant, regarding a requisition from the Principal of the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School for lumber to make alterations to provide accommodation for five extra pupils, I have to inform you that a communication has been received from Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, in which he informs the Department that it is the intention of the Church authorities to close the Lesser Slave Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School as from June 30th, last. He requests that the grant be increased to provide for a pupilage of thirty children at each of the Wabasca C. of E. and Whitefish Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe Department is approving of the closing of the Lesser Slave Lake School, and the increase in pupilage asked for at each of the other two schools. In view of this arrangement, consideration has been given to allowing the expenditure required in supplying the lumber asked for by the Principal of the Wabasca C. E. School in his requisition forwarded herewith, over of your letter of the 30th ultimo. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $250 in the purchase of lumber and material to make the alterations required in fitting up extra classroom accommodation. This amount is not inside the cost of freighting. You should make the purchase and forward receipt therefor to receive consideration, and you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the building material. These accounts you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment. You should also forward vouchers, in triplicate, with receipt attached, covering the cost of the freighting. It is to be understood that all labour is to be carried out by the school authorities without expense to this Department, and I would request that you arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the lumber, nails, etc., as mentioned in the Principal's letter, which is enclosed herewith for your information. This letter should be returned to the Department along with the account for the lumber, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nN. P.

K. L. Sandercock, Principal of our St. John's School at Wabasca, Alta., has directed the attention of our Commission to the very urgent need of an engine for sawing the school's supply of wood, and I am writing for the specific purpose of ascertaining if your Department can supply this item of equipment at once. The main school building itself is so old, and in need of so many repairs, some of which we are undertaking to provide, that we cannot possibly meet the cost of the engine. The old engine has rendered very good service, but the Rev. Principal reports the cylinder, carburettor, magneto, valves, etc., all so badly worn that it has no power to operate the saw. As winter is coming on he expresses his anxiety with regard to the large supply of wood fuel which will be required to meet the school's needs.\n\nIn Eaton's catalogue I find a 4-5 h.p. engine listed at a cost of $160.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg. As the weight is given at 460 lbs. the cost f.o.b. at the Wabasca School would be approximately $200.00, and I very earnestly hope your Department may be able to authorize this expenditure. If we can secure the engine for less we will assuredly do so, but in no case would we ask your Department to provide more than the $200.00 mentioned. A prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 2)\nOttawa, October 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReverend Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., The Bible House, 184 Alexander Avenue East, Winnipeg, has requested, on behalf of the Principal of the Wabasca C. E. (St. John's) Indian Residential School, that an engine be furnished for sawing the school's supply of wood. He stated that the need for this is very urgent and recommends a 4-5 H. P. engine, listed at $160.00 f. o. b. Winnipeg in the T. Eaton Company catalogue, be supplied. The cost, f. o. b. Wabasca, would be approximately $200.00.\n\nThe Department will provide the amount to cover the cost of the engine, and I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and forwarding of same to the school. You should obtain prices from firms on the list and make purchase at the lowest possible cost. I enclose an encumbrance certificate authorizing the expenditure, not exceeding $200, to cover the purchase of this equipment and freight charges to the school. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost and receipt for the freight charges prepaid. It might be possible for you to arrange with the firm from whom you make the purchase to pay the freight charges and include the amount in their account, attaching the freight receipt. Please attach the account, in triplicate, to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of R. R. No. 1061.\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate is being informed that you have been instructed to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the engine. It might be advisable for you to get in touch with him before placing the order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

The Department also state that the cost F.O.B. Wabasca should be approximately $200.00. Two of the other quotations are considerably in excess of the amount authorized.

L. Sanderson, Principal.\n\nFollowing estimate was prepared by a friend of the Indian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., who has had much experience in erecting log-buildings such as those at Jasper on the C. N. R. and Lake Louise on the C. P. R.\n\n\"I have looked over the rough sketch of proposed mission school which conveys to me an idea of what is intended to be built, and the method of construction which is of the cheapest kind. I am not familiar with the conditions under which labour can be secured or the cost of same, but I would advise you that the dimensions given provide for a fairly pretentious building consisting of three floors, Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor - and should be so constructed as to warrant a factor of safety and give reasonable satisfaction to those responsible for the building. Assuming the cheapest form of labour and material to be used in this construction I do not believe it possible to finish this school according to these sketches at a less cost than $2700.00\n\nIf you have anything to do with this I would not advise you to be a party to be in any way responsible for heating such a building with stoves without any chimney, there is too much fire hazard, nor would I advise such a thing as having the underpart of Basement Walls being formed by shutting up the earth with boards. In fact to construct log building of the type indicated by these sketches, in a satisfactory manner commensurate with safety and convenience would cost approx. $4000, and this does not include any fixtures.\n\nFixtures, heating, lighting, water systems, etc., plus transportation would probably cost another $3000, and thus bring the total up to approximately $7000.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION M. S. C. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 2)\nincrease could not be sanctioned.\n\nSince that date our Commission had some hope of having the pupilage increased through an addition to the main school building, but the school was visited by Colonel Mermagen, their Asst. Secretary-Treasurer last December, and he reports that as the foundation logs have decayed and must be replaced next Spring, and that as the floors are so worn, and the whole building so old and comfortless as to be incapable of repair except at an expenditure amounting to the cost of a new building, it would be better not to attempt to enlarge the present building, but to concentrate our efforts on the erection of a new building instead. As the school is heated by stoves of which so many are required, and as all the material around them is so combustible, that there is an ever-present danger from fire, the Commission instructed me to inform you that they could no longer accept responsibility for any consequences which might result from an outbreak of fire. They further instructed me to secure an estimate of the cost of erecting a new and temporary log building to take the place of the school building occupied, until such time as funds are available by your Department to provide and equip one which will be fully modern, and capable of accommodating the children now in residence, and the still larger number who are awaiting admission. I have done my best to secure the estimate requested, and you will find it enclosed herewith. This estimate appears to me to be so fair and reasonable, and the whole project so feasible, even under the prevailing stringent financial conditions which it is intended to meet, that I most sincerely hope your Department may accept it and authorize our Society to proceed with the collection of logs and other building material, so that the work of erecting the building may begin as soon as the frost is out of the ground in the Spring.\n\nWhen it is remembered that in the year 1931, the operating cost of this school was $6,918.99 and the per capita grants received from your Department were only $3,358.65, the balance of $3,550.42 being provided by our Society, and that in 1932 the operating cost was $7,903.62, when the per capita grants from your Department were $3,869.27, and our Society had to provide the balance of $4,034.46, it must be clear that we are being asked to carry too great a share of the burden, and that we are entitled to receive the relief which would be afforded by the provision of a better and larger building, and with a much larger enrolment of pupils.\n\nYour immediate and fully sympathetic consideration of this extremely important matter will be duly appreciated by our Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary and Acting General Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

An examination of their records shows that as long ago as Nov. 22nd, 1923 they included in their list of requirements to be provided by your Department a \"new school at Wabasca with increased capacity of enrolment\". Your Department recognized the need, even at that early date, but as the result of conferences between the Deputy Superintendent General, and the late Superintendent of Indian Education (Mr. Ferrier), and our General Secretary, it was later agreed to have one large and fully modern building erected on or near a Reserve at the west end of Lesser Slave Lake, which would amalgamate and supersede the three existing schools built and administered by our Church in that part, namely, St. Peter's at Grouard, St. Andrew's at White Fish Lake, and St. John's at Wabasca. For some reason or another, the central building was never provided, and we continued to carry on as before, until the expense for repairs and maintenance became unbearable in June 1932, when St. Peter's School was closed, and the pupils then in residence were transferred to St. Andrew's School at White Fish Lake.\n\nBy authority of your Department (see your letter Aug. 8th, 1932, No. 131-2-1) the pupilage of the White Fish Lake and Wabasca schools was increased to 30 in each case.\n\nOn April 5th, 1932, our Commission furnished you with what they considered were sufficient reasons why the pupilage of the Wabasca school should be increased from 30 to 40, but you replied on April 12th, 1933, No. 131-8-1, stating that on account of reduction in your appropriation for that year, the\nOttawa, January 25, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the present condition of the main building at the Wabaseca C. of E. Indian Residential School, requesting that the Department give favourable consideration to the providing of funds to erect a new temporary building and enclosing a rough sketch of the proposed structure.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year have been completed and submitted to the Treasury Board. Therefore, it will not be possible to provide therein the funds required which, it is noted, you estimate would be approximately $7,000. It might be possible to give this matter consideration when the Supplementary Estimates are being prepared. There are, however, many demands which will have to be considered at that time, and I can hold out little hope that the Department will be able to provide the funds required in carrying out the building scheme as outlined in your letter. Your request will be placed before the Honourable the Minister for his consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England, has drawn attention to the condition of the main building at the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School. The foundation logs have decayed, the floors are worn through and the building is practically beyond repair, except at an expenditure which would amount to the cost of a new building. The Church Authorities state definitely that they can no longer accept responsibility for any consequences which might result from an outbreak of fire in this old building. They have submitted a rough sketch, with an estimate of the cost of erecting a temporary log building, consisting of three floors - basement, ground floor and first floor - to be so constructed as to give reasonable satisfaction. It is estimated that the cost of constructing a building of the type indicated, including fixtures, heating, lighting and water system, and freight on materials, would be approximately $7,000.\n\nNo funds are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year for repairs or building costs at this school. Mr. Inspector Christiansen, who visited the school last summer, reported the poor condition and unsuitability of the building. As requested by the Church Authorities, I am referring the matter for your consideration when the Supplementary Estimates are being dealt with. I may add that grant is provided this school for 30 pupils at $180 per capita, less 15%. The school is located at Wabasca Lake, in the Lesser Slave Lake agency, in the federal district of Athabasca.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA, December 6th 1933.\n\nTo Massey-Harris Co.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nShip To St. John's Residential School,\nWabasca, Alta.\n\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\n\nImportant.\u2014Do not fail to record by entering hereon quantities received, same day as goods are delivered.\n\n| SIZE | DESCRIPTION |\n|------|-------------|\n|      | Massey-Harris No. 2 gasoline engine, 6 h.p. with 12 x 6 plain pulley |\n\nRecorded but not tested\n\nJanuary 13th 1934\n\nV.

D'Heureux Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Commission in Winnipeg have recently advised me of the fire at the mission, Lac la Ronge. They further advise that if our \"fire fighting equipment is inadequate or obsolete\" I should notify you at once.\n\nOur present equipment is undoubtedly inadequate. It consists of three 5 gallon hand pumps, four Pyrene pumps and five Thermox extinguishers. One of them is useless, one of the hand pumps is not much better. The equipment has to serve for the whole of the mission including the house and the outhouses. We estimate that we need three Thermox extinguishers, two five gallon pumps and three Pyrene extinguishers. In addition we should have five cans of dry Karbaloy, five cans of refill charge for the hand pump, seven refills of Pyrene liquid.\n\nI trust that you will be able favorably to recommend that these articles be supplied.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nK. L. Sandercock\nActing Principal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In a letter just received from the Principal and dated Wabasca July 2nd, he refers to the urgent need of this equipment. His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\nDesks. Of these we have but seventeen for thirty-three children. Most of them are in a very bad state, and are only worth about $1.00 each. Miss Bloomer, the teacher, requests twenty-four.\n\nPencils. We do not always receive sufficient.\n\nClock face. This has been requisitioned many times by the teacher, but has not been supplied.\n\nAs the per capita earnings of this school for last year amounted to $4,485.09, and as our Society had to provide $3,097.62, you will understand that it is quite impossible for us to provide this equipment, and as there can be no doubt whatever about the urgency of the need, it will be duly appreciated if your Department will provide the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\nOttawa, July 20, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the Wabasca C.

I might add that, at the request of the Principal, an order has recently been placed for two additional fire extinguishers and the refills required for the fire extinguishers at present in the school.\n\nWith regard to your statement, that an insufficient number of pencils has been supplied, I may say that an ample quantity of these will be forwarded to the school in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sec.-Treasurer, Indian Residential School Commission.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing accounts to the amount of $499.77 covering the cost of repairs carried out during the past summer at the Wabaseca O. E. Indian Residential School, and requesting that cheque drawn to the order of your Commission be forwarded in payment.\n\nIn connection with the account of the Ashdown Hardware Company Limited, I would say that if this account has been paid by your Commission it should have been receipted by the Company. If not, cheque could be issued in their favour.\n\nThe account in favour of St. Martin's Mission for lumber supplied is not receipted as paid. Further details should be given as to the price charged for each item on the account. If your Commission has paid this account it should be receipted. The same applies to the account of B. Watkins' General Store. This account should also be receipted as paid.\n\nIn the account of the Hudson's Bay Company for orders issued by them in payment of labour it is noted that the amounts paid the individual labourers appear to be in error. For example, Order No. 1 to A. Peters for 7\u00bd hours @ 25 cents per hour is given as $1.69. Should this not be $1.87? The same applies in the case of other men employed.\n\nIt is also noted that Orders Nos. 14 and 21 for 10 sacks lime @ $2.00 are charged in the account at only $15.00. Further details should be given, and the unit prices charged for material supplied, especially as regards lumber - $42.65 - nails, storm sashes, rubberoid, etc.\n\nI am returning the accounts which you submitted, and would request that you have them receipted, or state if the cheques should go to the individual firms. Please give this matter your prompt attention, in order that the accounts can be returned before the end of the present month and payment made before our books close for the present fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n35-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have, however, now been forwarded to the various firms concerned to be receipted, and will reach your department prior to the 31st inst.\n\nIn connection with the Hudson's Bay Company account, the apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that the Company allow the Commission a special discount of 10%, so that where 10 sacks of lime are shown as costing $2.00 each, the discount brings the net amount to $18.00, and a similar explanation covers the amount paid for labour.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.\n\nEMM:BGS\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo Rev.

Principal Sandercock of our St. John's School at Wabasca, Alberta, he informs me of a survey which has just been completed, by Government Surveyors, under the direction of the Indian Agent, in the Wabasca District, the object of the survey, so far as he understood the same, being part of a plan which your Department has under contemplation of moving all the Indians, on all of the four Wabasca Reserves, to one central location.\n\nAs this plan, if carried out may affect the location of the new and larger school building which we sincerely hope may soon be provided by your Department for the benefit of the Indian adherents of our Church in the Wabasca District, our Commission would like to have confirmation of the information received from Principal Sandercock, and further information as to when the proposed plan is to come into effect.\n\nShould the centralisation scheme be carried out, it seemed to the members of our Commission at a meeting held yesterday, under the Chairmanship of His Grace, Archbishop Matheson, that our new school should be located on the new reserve, and I was instructed to file the request immediately with your Department that Section 16, which is included in the land recently surveyed, be held for this specific purpose. This letter is being written in keeping with that instruction, and it is earnestly hoped that the request it embodies, may be sympathetically considered and granted.\n\nYour immediate servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMr. Phelan\nPlease find file 27131-174 Wabasca Res.\nOriginal file with Mr White.\n\nA.S.\nOttawa, September 15, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you refer to the survey undertaken and completed in the Wabasca district.\n\nThe records here indicate that a survey of the new Wabasca reserve has now been completed, but the Surveyor General, in a letter to the Department dated September 10th, indicates that the plan and detailed description of the land selected is not yet available. In view of this fact, no steps have been taken to move the Indians of the four Wabasca reserves to one central location.\n\nI note, with interest, the recommendation of your Commission, that Section 16, which is included in the land recently surveyed, be set apart as a school site. The officials of the Department inform me that it has not been the practice in the past to set apart any particular area for this purpose until the erection of the school itself is actually under discussion. I am convinced, however, that the representatives of your Church will experience no difficulty whatever in coming to a satisfactory agreement with respect to a suitable site.\n\nThe Department at the present time is experiencing a great deal of difficulty in securing an adequate\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nadequate water supply at a number of residential schools in western Canada. The suggestion has been made that at least one residential school should be moved eight miles to a new location. I am personally convinced that the utmost possible care will have to be exercised in the selection of school sites in the future. We have certainly not at our disposal at the moment sufficient evidence to justify us in making a definite commitment with respect to the suitability or section 16 for the purpose you have in mind. Your letter will be kept on file for reference and your request given consideration when the plans and description of the land selected reach the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSeptember 20th, 1937.\n\nESTIMATE OF MATERIAL REQUIRED FOR REPAIRS AT ST JOHN'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, WABASCA, Alta.\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Unit   | Price |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------|\n| Ideal Wall Board 4x10                     | 4000 sq. ft. |        | $134.00 |\n| Fir stripping                             | 500 lin. ft. |        | $7.50  |\n| Wallboard tape                            | 4 rolls  |        | $2.12  |\n| Exterior doors 2'10\"x 6'2\"                | 3 only   |        | $16.05 |\n| Storm Door                                | 1 only   |        | $5.00  |\n| Alabastine, White, bulk                  | 50 pounds |        | $5.00  |\n| Fresco Colors                            | 6 pkts (3 Moss Green 3 orange) |        | $2.10  |\n| Paint White Interior Gloss                | 3 Galls \"Diamond A\" |        | $10.65 |\n| Color in Oil, Moss Green                  | 1 lb     |        | $.31   |\n| Turpentine Spirits                       | 1 Gall   |        | $1.00  |\n| Putty                                     | 25 pounds bulk |        | $2.00  |\n| Glass (Dimensions to follow)              |          | value up to | $15.00 |\n| Plastic Wood                              | 3 pounds |        | $2.00  |\n| Rubberoid                                 | 2 rolls  |        | $6.00  |\n| Tar Paper                                 | 5 rolls @ $1.20 |        | $6.00  |\n| Window Screening                          | 20 yards @ 25\u00a2 per yd |        | $5.00  |\n| Canadian Weather Strapping                | 1-roll 500 feet |        | $10.65 |\n| Galvanized Iron Gauge 28                  | 4 sheets 48\" x 96\" |        | $10.80 |\n| Nails: 350 pounds assorted sizes, common finish & box |        | $21.83 |\n| Stove pipes, Heavy Galvanized (24 or 26 Ga.) |        |        |        |\n| 40 lengths 7/8\" - 7in. dia., @ 50\u00a2       |          |        | $20.00 |\n| 6 elbows                                  |          |        | $3.00  |\n| 6 tapers 6in. stove to 7in. pipe         |          |        | $3.00  |\n| 20 lengths 6\" - 6 in. dia., @ 40\u00a2        |          |        | $8.00  |\n| 3 elbows                                  |          |        | $1.20  |\n| 2 tapers 7\" to 6\"                        |          |        | $1.20  |\n\nLUMBER:\nDimensions D4S - Spruce 2x6 in 2x8;

P. L'Heursux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Repairs: File #5-87\nI am delighted to know of the possibility of a $500.00 grant for repairs to these buildings and sincerely hope that the possibility may become a reality.\n\nI am enclosing a list of materials I estimate will be required to carry out the most needed repairs. Twelve months ago we were able to do a great deal of external work which has proved most beneficial. Labour was then the chief item. I now propose to do as much as possible to the interiors, especially upstairs. What is most needed is wall board on all four walls and in some parts on ceilings. Much of this has never been done with a consequent large loss of heat. Stove pipes also need replacing, some roofing and window repairs, also flooring and many other general repairs.\n\nI am quoting from Ashdown's for most of the material. Doors possibly from the Clark Lumber Co. Lumber I presume from some local mill along the line. Needed Lime can be purchased locally.\n\nI am in urgent need of stove pipes and if the grant is made shall be much obliged if they can be shipped immediately. Other items can all wait for the winter freight. The freight on stove pipes will not be excessive @ 4\u00bd per pound.\n\nMr. Watkins (At Slave Lake) is our forwarding agent and I think that arrangements can be made for any necessary freighting with the people attached to this school.\n\nThanking you again for your kind co-operation,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) K. L. SANDERCOCK\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nSeptember 28, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 9, your file No. 131-3-5 in connection with a grant of $500.00 to the Wabasca C.E.

He also states that the classroom should have a clock, which it hasn't at present. With regard to the need of a wagon and wagon box he states that those now in use have been patched and repaired until there is little of the originals left.\nAny help your Department may be able to give us in meeting these urgent needs will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, October 22, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I am communicating with Moyer's School Supplies with reference to supplying the twelve desks for the Wabasca C.E.

We would appreciate very much, Mr. Bailey, anything you can do for us at this time in this regard.\n\nThanking you, and wishing you every happiness throughout the Yuletide Season,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGENERAL MANAGER\n\nGEN/C\nOttawa,\nDecember 30, 1940.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour letters of the 19th ultimo and 21st instant have been referred to this Branch by our Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe purchase order issued to you directed that your account should be forwarded to Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, October 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou are probably aware that during the last fiscal year the building program of the Government, with the exception of buildings necessary for the prosecution of the war, was completely suspended. The appropriations usually set apart for the repair of buildings at Indian day and residential schools, post offices and government buildings generally was also reduced to the lowest possible figure.\n\nThere are indications at this date that the appropriations set apart annually for the services provided by this Branch will be still further reduced in the 1942-43 estimates. If such is the case, this reduction will mean that only repairs to buildings that are urgently needed can be considered by the Department.\n\nRequests for the construction of Indian residential schools at Wabasca and Whitefish Lake, in your agency, have been received by the Department during the last two or three years from the Anglican Church authorities and a request for the construction of a residential school at Sturgeon Lake, from Bishop Langlois, representing the Catholic Church in that district. These requests have on more than one occasion been submitted to the Minister and discussed with him. At the last conference the Minister issued instructions to have a complete educational survey of these reserves undertaken, with the object of determining whether or not local conditions on these reserves lent themselves to the construction and operation of Indian day schools. The Minister considers that it would be very inadvisable to construct additional\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile,\nvia Kinuso, Alberta.\nresidential schools while the funds at our disposal now are insufficient to keep the residential schools already in operation in a proper state of repair. He believes it unwise also that we should build additional residential schools, or larger residential schools, with no assurance whatever that money will be available during the years immediately ahead of us to pay the per capita grants necessary for the operation of these schools.\n\nIt is our hope that you will be able to undertake this survey at an early date and that the survey itself, when undertaken, will be thorough and complete in every sense. You should submit figures indicating the number of children of school age on these reserves and the number of children under school age. You should submit a sketch map that will indicate the location of the Indian homes and the distance of these homes from a centre that might be selected for the establishment of a day school. You might report on the roads and the suitability of these roads, should it be decided to provide transportation for the Indian pupils from their homes to the school. Please report also on the suitability of the buildings now used as residential schools, should it be decided to purchase these and utilize them as Indian day schools. It is my understanding that the three schools referred to are all church-owned. An estimate of the cost necessary to reconstruct these buildings and equip them as day schools would be valuable to the Departmental officials.\n\nIt is just possible that, should it be decided to establish Indian day schools on these reserves, it will be necessary to provide some form of transportation and also a noonday meal. You should feel free to send forward additional information that may occur to you at the time the survey is undertaken. Information such as the general habits of the Indians and the work in which they are engaged, whether it be farming, hunting, trapping, fishing, or a combination of all of these, will be of interest to the officials and helpful to them in reaching a final decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime, I am submitting informations gathered on the survey of Sturgeon Lake and Whitefish Lake reserves. I am enclosing herewith a blue print of Sturgeon Lake showing the location of the Mission and the P.C. Mission which is and would also be the most central point should it be decided to establish a day school on this reserve. Attached to the blue print is a list of the homes, in visiting order, including the number of children of school age and under in each family.\n\nIn visiting the homes I have started by the north-east, on reserve 154A. There are only two families living there, Isidore Sunshine and Francis Red Head. They are approximately five miles from the centre when one follows the trail. I then followed the east shore of the lake to Reserve 154 and then went due east to George Goodtimers (house No. 7) which is approximately five miles from the Mission. There are four families there, grouped close to one another. The majority of the Indians, however, is grouped west and south-west of the Mission, within a circuit ranging in distance from one quarter to about four miles. Six or seven families are living at the extreme west end of the reserve, near the lake, Piech Panfantasis, is a little more than four miles from the school. There is only one old Indian residing on Reserve 154B and she has no children. There is a number of large families who have no home on the reserve but only cabins on their trap-lines.\n\nAll the Sturgeon Lake Indians are trappers and hunters. There is but very little farming and cattle raising done on the reserve. A few have ventured to cultivate from half to two or three acres of grain, but they have absolutely no knowledge of it neither of how to care for horses and machinery. They do not put in gardens and very few grow potatoes. They depend solely on hunting and trapping for their living. In summer time, when they get short of food, they move into the bush, families and all, and remain there some time making provisions of meat, which they smoke and dry for future use, and then they come out and spend -\nspend the summer roaming around. During the harvesting season they go out of the reserve, fifteen miles and more, seeking employment and again they take their families along as they have provisions laid aside for themself left on the reserve. There is no earning for the Indians at Sturgeon Lake and, in case of sickness and scarcity of fur and game, they are entirely dependant on the Indian Department.\n\nEarly in the fall the Indians get ready to leave for the bush, only a few old rationers remain on the reserve. They generally go away, with their families, at the beginning of October in order to prepare their lines for the trapping season which begins by the squirrel at the beginning of December. They repair their canoes, haul feed for their dogs and horses and a few provisions for themselves. They even put up hay in some of the sloughs in the bush during the summer. Some of them come out for Christmas to sell a few pelts to replenish their provisions and then they go back again and come out only in May after the rat season is over.\n\nThe same mode of living applies to the Whitefish Lake Indians as well and I imagine it would be quite a problem to operate Indian day schools on these reserves, as it would mean supporting most of the families while their children attend school.\n\nThere is one building at the R.C. Mission, at Sturgeon Lake which would be quite suitable for a day school. It is 60'x15' with a wing 26'x25' - 2\u00bd story high. The wing is the present boys' living quarters and the other part contains three small classrooms well equipped. It is an llyr. old construction, but it appears to be in good condition. New foundations were built under it last year and Rev. Father Lajoie who is in charge of the administration of those reserves estimated it at $25,000. This building would need very little alteration for a day school.\n\nWith regard to transportation, all the trails leading to the Indian homes are fair and there is a good highway following the lakeshore.\n\nHaving no blue print of Whitefish Lake Reserve I have made a rough sketch of it and have attached a list of the Indian families as done for Sturgeon Lake. You will note that there are only eighteen houses built on Reserve 155. One family lives on Reserve 155A. It is Harvey Nahachick and he has seven children of which four are of school age. Two families, Helen Kenocono and Albert Wamsley are living on Reserve 155B at Mink Lake. This is northeast of Little Whitefish Lake, about 15 miles from Reserve #155. They both have children of school age. There are also seven families who have built their shacks outside of the Reserve, on lots. Two of these have children of school age. It is seems that the Whitefish Lake Indians do not attach any importance to where they build, they simply put up their shacks wherever it is the most convenient for them to make their living.\nThe present Residential School at Whitefish Lake is entirely out of place and it is not built on the reserve. It stands north of Reserve #156 and there is no Indian living there. The centre would be about half a mile southeast of the Hudson's Bay Post. There is a small flat on the east side of the creek and this is where most of the Indians are grouped. The farthest would have perhaps a little more than one mile to walk.\n\nThere are two buildings at the C.E. Mission which could be used to good advantage for a day school. One of them is the present school house, a plastered log building 18'x24' with shingle roof and spruce flooring, but it would probably need some repairs and new equipment as the present desks are very poor and insufficient for the number of pupils attending school. The second, also a log building 20'x24' -1/2 story high, shingle roof and good spruce flooring, is practically new and was built with the Department's grant as an addition to the pupils and their old living quarters. This part is unfinished, but I believe it would answer the purpose when completed. Both buildings have no foundation.\n\nI regret to be unable to give you an estimate of the cost necessary to reconstruct and equip any of these buildings for Indian day schools. I consider that this part could be done more satisfactorily by an architect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.F. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\nDriftpile, Alta. February 17, 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nReference your letter dated October 3rd, 1941, re educational survey of Sturgeon Lake, Whitefish Lake and Wabasca, and further to my report submitted January 22nd, 1942.\n\nDuring the last week of January, I visited Wabasca Reserve, but as usual during the winter season, I found only a few families at home, the others being away on their traplines where they will remain till late in May, after the rat season is over.\n\nI am enclosing a rough sketch of the two reserves visited, showing the location of the Indian houses, together with a list of the families including the number of children of school age and under school age.\n\nThe first reserve visited was 166C, but there was not a single Indian on it. The Indians of this reserve are all grouped at the mouth of Wabasca River, on the west shore of it. Eight families have built there, and the farthest, Pierre Neznaumoo, is approximately thirteen miles from the C.E. School across the lake. In summer time, there Indians travel by canoe but there is also a trail, following the east shore, which can be used when the Wabasca River is not too high to ford, but it is slightly further by land. At the extreme south-west corner of the Reserve is another family - Harry Alook- he is about six miles from the C.E. Mission.\n\nOn Reserve 156B I found a few families at home. There again the Indians are grouped on the lakeshore and close to the Sawridge (Slave Lake) trail. They are approximately two or three miles from the School across the lake. In summer time they cannot possibly travel any other way.\n\nFive families have made their home outside the Reserve, about one mile from the C.E. Mission. They make their living out of odd jobs they can get from the Mission and the Hudson's Bay Post. They have poor shacks and are destitute, but it seems useless to try and persuade them to stay on their Reserve.\n\nWith regard to a suitable centre for a Day School, there does not seem to be any possible solution for this question, owing to the distance between the two Reserves.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Transportation as well would be a difficult problem, especially in the spring and in the fall when the ice is not safe for crossing over.\n\nThe Wabasca Indians are following the same mode of living as those of Whitefish Lake and Sturgeon Lake Reserves. There is no gainful employment for them at Wabasca as this is too far away from farming centres and lumbering camps. These Indians are genuine trappers and hunters and this occupation is their only source for a living.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.F.

Residential School. Please let me have detailed information regarding what is required. As you are aware, all purchases must be made through our Purchasing Branch and consequently quantities, sizes, etc. of any material or equipment should be distinctly stated.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C.

Residential School. I note that you refer to my letter of March 30 last. If you review that letter you will find that no authority was given for the purchase of the farm implements covered by the account which you have recently sent. As a matter of fact, the Department has not been purchasing farm implements for residential schools during the past few years and, under these circumstances, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to payment of the account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 17th inst. (#131-8-5) informing me that there is an appropriation of $600.00 in the current year's approved estimates for improvements at our Wabasca School, and requesting me to furnish you with detailed information regarding what is required. I am requesting the Acting Principal of this School (Mr. C.H. Barnes) to let me have at once the information requested and as soon as I receive this I will write to you again.\n\nI have pointed out to Mr. Barnes (and also to Mr. Cathcart at Whitefish Lake) your Department's ruling with regard to purchases being made through your Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nThe Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your letter of June 22nd, Saturday night, so we have not wasted any time making out this order, and I hope that everything is the way you want them.\n\nI have listed the paint for the ceilings, and the battleship grey paint for the fire escapes and window frames; they are badly in need of paint.\n\nThe moire inlaid linoleum is for the staff room floor, and the wall board is for the staff room walls.\n\nThe rocking chairs; one for the school, and one for the main building.\n\nThe nails and flooring are for the floor in the boys' play room. The floor is in very bad shape, and so are the walls, so I have listed v joint to put around the walls; wallboard is no good in the playrooms.\n\nThe chimneys are for the school roof; some of them are burnt and rusted out and are very dangerous. The heaters are also for the school. Some of the old ones are falling to pieces and they are too dangerous.\n\nThe things that are on this list are needed and needed in the worst way, and I do hope we can get them.\n\nI never used up all the money. I thought maybe the freight would come out of the $600, and also the drugs for our school.\n\nIf all this money was to be spent on repairs, we would like the balance in 1 x 6 x 12 foot shiplap lumber.

School is a Church-owned building, erected many years ago, and reports received from time to time indicated that it was in a bad state of repair. There was accommodation for thirty-five pupils and the staff.\n\nActing Director.\nCopy sent to Dr. Alderwood\n\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1945.\n\nMr. P.J. Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nI am in receipt of your telegram of the 2nd instant, advising that the main building at the Wabasca C.E. Residential School was destroyed by fire on the 1st instant. The Department was sorry to receive this information, but we were pleased to note that there was no loss of life.\n\nYour telegram mentions only the main building and I, therefore, presume that the building used for classroom purposes, which was situated at a considerable distance from the main building, is still intact. If so, would it be possible to conduct a day school in this building? Are there sufficient children living close to the school to secure a regular attendance? Please give this matter your immediate consideration and let me have an early reply, giving me full information, especially with regard to the number of children that you consider might attend.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI was extremely sorry to learn of the destruction of the main building at the Wabasca C.E. School. I infer that the classroom building is still intact, as I am informed that it was situated at a considerable distance from the main building. If this is correct, it might be possible to conduct a day school and, for your information, I enclose a copy of a letter which is being forwarded to the Indian Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nRev.

Hoey  \nActing Director-Indian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: St. Johns School, Wabasca, Alta.\n\nI beg to confirm my telegram sent yesterday, announcing the destruction by fire of the main school building. We have no further information, and our dominant feeling is one of profound thankfulness that no lives were lost in this tragic occurrence.\n\nI visited this school last February, and was deeply disappointed with the building. It was easily the poorest thing of its kind I had seen, and I felt that the fire hazard was considerable, and that it must have been because of great care on the part of the staff that it had escaped loss in the past. The position of this school was greatly improved when Revellon Freres went out of business and their buildings were purchased. I found that the largest building was being used as a class room with dormitory accommodation above for the older boys, and with living quarters for the teacher also. The principal's residence is a splendid building, and there is also a smaller house for the farm instructor, a laundry building and store room, and two other Revellon buildings used for storage and manual training. I have no word yet as to the disposition of the pupils, but imagine that some will be sent home and that a number will be accommodated in the remaining buildings.\n\nIt is fortunate that the Rev. A.L. Davies, our Principal, was still at the school at the time of the fire. Mr. E. Calrow, who has been appointed acting Principal, should have been arriving at about the very time the tragedy occurred.\n\nI shall advise you further as soon as information is received and meanwhile remain, with best wishes for the New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHAA/ma\n\nSecretary\nJanuary 10 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. R.A. Hoey, Acting Director\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Wabasca School\n\nI have to thank you for your 131-8-5 of the 4th, and for copy of letter addressed to Indian Agent Demers, at Driftpile. I note with satisfaction the suggestion that a Day School might be conducted, but am personally doubtful that there would be enough children who could attend with any regularity. I visited this school last February, and my impression is that most of the pupils come from a distance.\n\nThere is only a fortnightly mail to Wabasca, but the Principal was able to get a letter out to us on the day of the fire as follows;\n\n\"As you have already heard by wire the Main Building burned to the ground on the morning of January 1st.\n\nAt 11 a.m. Miss Bell, the Acting Matron, sent two girls down to the Mission House to report that the School building was on fire. I hurried to the school and discovered that the flames were already coming through the roof over the Junior Girls' Dormitory. It had gotten too far ahead to save the building so we rescued as much bedding, etc., as we possibly could. The fire raced through the whole building and was burnt to the ground in a few hours.\n\nFortunately all the children, except five, had gone home for the day and the others were awaiting the arrival of their parents. So staff and children were all safe. Miss Marcus and Miss Bell were the only staff members who were living in the building. Miss Marcus managed to retrieve all her personal belongings. Miss Bell lost about fifteen dollars ($15.00) in cash and clothing to the value of fifty dollars ($50.00). However, we are thankful that the fire occurred in the daytime and that there was no loss of life.\"\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nJanuary 10 1945.\n\nI have asked as many parents as possible to allow their children to remain at home until we hear from you and until some accommodation is arranged. It will take a little time to get forty-one children and staff housed, as we have only the Day school building, Mission House, and the cottage that was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Spooner when you were here.\n\nIf we had lumber we might line the store warehouse and fit it up for a Dining Room and Kitchen. But lumber is scarce around here.\n\nWe also lost our Kitchen Range, and all the Bedsteads, Dressing Tables, Washstands, all tables and benches, etc. But we were fortunate to get out all we did.\n\nP.S. We do not know how the fire started, but it was discovered between the ceiling and the roof over the Junior Girls' Dormitory.\n\nI beg to enclose a rough plan of the buildings, which will explain the Principal's reference. It would seem that a good deal of the bedding and possibly mattresses were rescued from the burning building, and that it should be a straightforward proposition to place one or two of the Revillon buildings in a habitable state. The old store building is well constructed, and if properly lined, would make a suitable dining-room and kitchen. The former warehouse in like manner could become a girls' dormitory, and the upstairs of the former residence could accommodate all the boys. It now has the older ones only. Our Commission met yesterday, and instructed me to visit the school as soon as possible, if I should feel it advisable, and to take in a skilled builder to advise about these changes so that we may have the necessary materials freighted in without delay. As this is the time of year for freighting, there should be no difficulty in attending to this in a very short time, so that the children may be called back to the school.\n\nOur Commission gave full consideration to the future, and will approach the Department with our suggestions after we have had the opportunity of conference with the Bishop of Athabasca.\n\nThanking you for your expression of sympathy, I remain,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nH.A.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Wabasca School\n\nThe future of this school has now been discussed by our Commission and we have also been in frequent communication with the Bishop of Athabasca. The matter will come before the Executive Committee M.S.C.C. on February 20th, and I am desired to seek the mind of the Indian Affairs Branch before that date.\n\nI find that in October 1927 my predecessor advised the Commission that the Indian Department desired to amalgamate the three Church schools in the area, namely, Wabasca, Whitefish Lake and St. Peter's, Lesser Slave Lake. The Commission concurred in this conclusion and in 1928 urged that the Department allocate an amount to allow for the construction of a large new school. Early in 1929 it was urged that action should be taken without loss of time as \"the existing buildings are no longer safe for habitation\". Apparently the Bishop of Athabasca and his missionaries were strongly opposed to the suggestion and this led to action being deferred. The proposal seemed to be that the new school should be built on the site of St. Peter's, Lesser Slave Lake, near Grouard. After this school closed down on June 30th, 1932, and the few remaining pupils were transferred to Whitefish Lake, the suggestion then seemed to be that the school should be built at the last-named place.\n\nOur correspondence shows that the proposal was again discussed in 1935 and 1936 but no agreement was reached. At the present time the Commission and Bishop Sovereign are in full agreement that it is not advisable to suggest any amalgamation, and therefore urge the construction of a new building at Wabasca. Conditions have greatly changed in our judgment in the past eighteen years and the attitude to institutional life is not what it was. Two distinct communities are found at Whitefish Lake and Wabasca, separated by 150 miles of an almost impassable wilderness, and it seems clear to us that they can best be served by two smaller schools rather than one which would be at either point. Indian sentiment appears to be more strongly than ever in favour of having children nearer home and there is much to be said for having a school as the centre of community life. In each case new buildings have been constructed or acquired since the proposal to amalgamate was dropped and our\nChurch has made a heavy investment along this line.\n\nIn thinking of a possible new building, our suggestion is that we should use logs which are very easily obtained in the district. We believe that we should aim at having three main school units instead of one large building. These would provide a more natural environment for the children and the school would have more of a family character. There are now 41 pupils in attendance and we suggest a building adequate for 50. The plan of having several log buildings commends itself to us in such a location as a means of reducing the danger of fire. In the present case we have lost one building but have still a number of others, and most of the food, clothing and other equipment untouched. I beg to enclose some sketches of a rough plan which we have worked out and for which an estimate of cost is being secured. This plan may be summarized as follows:\n\nRectangular building consisting of cement and stone basement, main floor of log and frame construction with attic above.\n\nBasement 10' high would allow for furnace room, kitchen, dining rooms, washrooms and playrooms.\n\nMain floor would have dormitories, offices, staff quarters and other facilities.\n\nThe attic would be used for clothing storage, sewing rooms, and similar purposes.\n\nLocal logs are abundant and their cutting and hauling would provide employment for the Indians. Rough lumber could be secured locally and other supplies obtained from Edmonton.\n\nFire risk would be reduced to a minimum through a central hot air furnace enclosed in cement walls, and the building of a complete chimney with glazed tiling. The solid log walls could be insulated and covered within with fireproof wall-board, and the roof covered with asbestos and other material.\n\nThis plan assumes that the present excellent classroom and teacherage and boys' dormitory shall remain in the present building, and looks forward to the eventual construction of another log building to house laundry, workshop and powerhouse. This would give satisfactory arrangements to accommodate fifty pupils and necessary staff in three buildings.\n\nWe shall be grateful if this matter can be given early consideration and that we may know what assistance we may expect from the Department in constructing such a modest building. Certainly the large school formerly contemplated would have entailed an infinitely greater cost.\n\nOur reasons for haste in this matter arise from the peculiar difficulties of the location. The children are now housed in temporary quarters but we do not desire that they should continue in them any longer than is necessary.\nChurch has made a heavy investment along this line.\n\nIn thinking of a possible new building, our suggestion is that we should use logs which are very easily obtained in the district.

Then it will be necessary to have all other supplies freighted in while the frost is on the ground. The trail from Slave Lake runs through bush and swamp for nearly 100 miles and cannot be used for heavy loads once the thaw occurs.\n\nCommending this matter to your usual consideration, and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN.A.

School, instructing me to visit this school and make a careful survey regarding the provision that has been made for the children, and I now wish to make the following report.\n\nOn the evening of February 13th, I left the Agency by train for Slave Lake, en route for Wabaseg, leaving Slave Lake on the morning of the 15th by team, arriving at Wabaseg on Saturday 17th.\n\nBoys living quarters consists of a log building 26 ft. X 25 ft. 14 ft. high. The ground floor is used for inside recreation and living quarters, and the upstairs is used for the boys dormitory. There is 16 beds in this dormitory, also one cupboard 5 ft. high by 8 ft. wide, and another cupboard 4 ft. wide and 6 ft. high. The building is heated with a cast iron heater, and a 7 inch pipe. This pipe passes through the attic, and is protected with a metal chimney, making it quite safe. The only fire escape for the dormitory, is an inside stairway, which is in fair shape, but would be rather dangerous in a case of fire. There is also an addition to this building 12 ft. X 25 ft. which is used as living quarters for the boys. This is also a log building. Both these buildings are roofed with shingles.\n\nThe building occupied by the girls, is a log building 34 ft. X 34 ft. 16 ft high. The ground floor of this building is used for a kitchen, 20 ft. X 12 ft. staff's dining room 12 ft. X 12 ft. and dining room for the children 24 ft. X 34 ft. Everything is very much crowded on this floor, and it is rather difficult to have things in order.\nThere is a sag in the middle of this floor of approximately 10 inches. The stove in use for cooking, is an ordinary six hole range, far too small for this purpose.\n\nThe second floor of this building is used for the girls dormitory. There are 13 beds for the girls, and one bed for the guardian. There is also a stand for wash basins, and a small closet for the girls' clothing. The building is heated by a large cast iron heater with a seven inch pipe leading right to the peak of the roof. There is no attic in this building. The pipe is securely fastened, and also protected at the roof with a metal chimney. The only fire escape is an inside stairway, which is not the best, however I believe that the fire hazard is not so great in this building.\n\nThe building used for the school, is a log building 20ft. X 25ft. one storey, with 3 double windows, and heated with a cast iron stove. This building is in fair shape, but in my opinion is too small, to accommodate 41 children. This was the number of children attending at the time of this visit. I was told by the acting Principal that he did not expect any more.\n\nAll the other buildings are old log buildings, and none of them in very good shape. I do not think that any of them are worth spending any money for repairing them.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 1, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nWith reference to the Wabasca C.E.

Hoey: Re: St. John's School, Wabasca.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAfter discussing the problem of replacing this school and the difficulties in securing any Government action at the present time I proceeded to Toronto and laid the matter before the Executive Committee, M.S.C.C. It was not possible to expend Church funds at the present time and I was therefore instructed to make the best possible arrangements to carry on the work in the meantime. It seemed necessary to visit the school, and I accordingly arranged to charter a plane from Fort McMurray and travelled to that point after a very short stay in Winnipeg. I have already received from the Department a copy of the report made by Indian Agent Demers on February 23rd, which admirably described the situation. Some of the buildings are in good order and conditions not at all unfavorable. However, I felt keenly that another building should be secured as soon as possible, so as to relieve the over-crowding in the building now used for a Girls' dormitory above and the Dining-room and Kitchen below. Plans were made with the Acting Principal to have logs cut immediately so that a building 24' x 40' could be constructed during the summer. It was my thought that this would eventually become a smaller unit of the school and would be used for Laundry, Workshop and Storage purposes. Its use during the next school year would greatly relieve the situation and provide passable accommodation until the new school can be built.\n\nOn returning to Edmonton I made enquiries about the necessary materials to be shipped to the school to enable this building to be constructed during the summer. Pressure of time was, of course, evident by reason of the uncertain condition of the trail from Slave Lake. While in Edmonton, however, I was advised that army buildings at Dawson Lake were now available, and this seemed to offer the possibility of getting a pre-fabricated building to the school during the present month. I was able to get in touch with Mr. R. Matheson of War Assets Corporation, who gave sympathetic hearing to our case and promised his personal attention in securing and shipping a building immediately. I was able to inspect one of these huts, 20' x 40' in size, strongly and warmly constructed and in every way suitable for our purpose. I was assured that the cost of such a building would be low, and also was promised a camp cook stove which was urgently needed at the school. I am now anxiously awaiting word that these...\nMr. [illegible]\n\nMaterials have been shipped, as the West has been experiencing a period of mild weather and I am wondering about the state of the trail.\n\nIf this building can soon be erected I shall have no fear about the well-being of the children. We have an excellent staff at the present time and I found them cheerful and confident, and the children in good health and spirits.\n\nI am enclosing a plan of the present arrangements which will amplify the report of your Agent. In view of the urgency of the need, I trust that the Government will be able to take over this building from the War Assets Corporation as our Commission will be under heavy expense in paying the cost of transportation on the railway and in freighting to the school. We have also shipped in to the school a considerable quantity of wall-board and lumber so that the present buildings may be made warm and more attractive. Our Commission are certainly prepared to do everything possible to maintain the work efficiently during this difficult period, and trust that the Department may be able to plan for the building of a new school without too much delay.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:MP.\nEncls.\nOttawa, March 20, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the Wabasca C.E. Residential School. I have reviewed your letter very carefully and note the arrangements that you are making.\n\nAs the Wabasca C.E. School is classed as church-owned, we can only expend at that school the amount specifically provided for it in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46. Our estimates were prepared last fall and have already been submitted to Parliament and, consequently, cannot be changed. I find that an amount of $700.00 is included in our 1945-46 appropriation for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Wabasca C.E. School. In order to co-operate with you as far as we can, we are willing to expend that amount of money in whatever manner you consider in the best interests of the school. We can either apply it to the cost of the building which you state you are securing from the War Assets Corporation or we can use it for any material or equipment that might be necessary. I realize the financial strain under which your Society is working in regard to this particular school, but under present circumstances I am unable to promise more financial assistance during the coming fiscal year than the amount mentioned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nRev.

Of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter file 160-2 dated August 30th and now beg to enclose receipted accounts in quadruplicate from the W. H. Clark Lumber Co., Edmonton, totalling $734.48. As you advised us that $700 had been allocated for this school, I shall be glad if it can be paid in settlement of these accounts.\n\nYou will recall that after the fire on Jan. 1st, 1945, destroyed our main school building we were able to fix up some buildings which were formerly in the possession of the Revillon Co. This was only a temporary arrangement and we urged the Department to build a new school at this point. When it was found impossible to do this under war conditions, we decided that it was necessary in the interests of the children to go ahead with a large log building which might later become a unit of the school which we have reason to hope the government will build when conditions allow. The logs were gradually cut and hauled to the site while the snow was on the ground and the lumber and other items were ordered in Edmonton and from local mills in the Slave Lake area. The total cost to date has been over $1500 and we shall therefore welcome the contribution of the Department as suggested above.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nOttawa, January 24th, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential School\n\nThe Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada has submitted the receipted accounts attached amounting to $734.48 covering the cost of material purchased by them to erect a large log building at the above mentioned school. This large building was required to replace one that was destroyed by fire on January 1st, 1945. The Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada states that the total amount they have expended on this building is over $1,500.00.\n\nThis is a church-owned school and in the Current Year's Appropriation we provided an amount of $700.00 for repairs and improvements. The Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada request that this amount be allowed in part payment of the attached account.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have deferred writing you about this School, hoping that I would have had a report before this from the Principal in reply to my telegraphic inquiry of some time ago but, presumably, the infrequent mail service from Wabasca is the reason for the delay.\n\nI presume that you will soon be completing the preparation of your 1948-49 Estimates and so I would be glad if you would include in them your normal provision for miscellaneous services at this Church-owned School. I understand that you provided $500.00 in this year's Estimates for this purpose and I would like to know what you do include for 1948-49 so that we may know what we shall have to consider providing from our own resources when the Principal's report is received.\n\nDuring the current year you provided $1,683.33 from your funds for an Electric Lighting Plant. It appears that this plant was switched (I hope with your knowledge) to the Fort George School because the proposed new building at Wabasca had not been erected. I am writing your branch under separate cover about this new building and if it is decided to proceed with its construction next year, perhaps you could consider providing in the 1948-49 Estimates something in the order of $2,000.00 towards the cost of an Electric Lighting Plant. The cost of a similar plant delivered to Whitefish this year was around $2,000.00, of which you provided $1,983.72.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nOctober 27th, 1947\n\nMajor Gen. G. R. Turner\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWabasca - New Log Building - Anglican Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to my letter of 29th September, 1947, we have been hoping to have had before this information on cost of logs, sand, gravel, etc., at Wabasca to enable us to discuss with you the question of expenditure of the $10,000 provided in your 1947-48 Estimates. However, our Principal there has so far been unable to obtain any actual figures.\n\nWe have had a quotation from W. H. Clark Lumber Co., Ltd., Edmonton, on the finished lumber necessary for roof, floors, etc., on the roofing material, on windows and doors, and on cement, etc. This amounts to $9,164.33 f.o.b. Edmonton, which, I might add as a matter of interest, is $2,612.00 more than the quotation of this firm on exactly the same bill of material in February 1945.\n\nBased on the above quotation and on adjusted 1945 estimates for other services, the approximate cost will be as follows:\n\n(a) Building materials f.o.b. Edmonton $9,164.00\n(b) Freight on (a) Edmonton to Slave Lake 600.00\n(c) Hardware f.o.b. Slave Lake 500.00\n(d) Paint f.o.b. Slave Lake 350.00\n(e) Furnaces f.o.b. Slave Lake 2,500.00\n(f) Hauling from Slave Lake to Wabasca 500.00\n(g) Carpenters and other labour 3,000.00\n\n$16,614.00\n\nTo this must be added the cost of procuring locally and delivering to the site the logs for the walls and the gravel and sand for the concrete basement floor and walls.\nAllowing, say, $1,000 for this and something for incidentals and unforeseen, the cost of the completed building would probably run to $18,000, which would mean that provision of $8,000 in the 1948-49 Estimates would be necessary.\n\nIt is regretted that we cannot give any closer figures at the moment but we felt that, in view of the fact that you are now preparing your 1948-49 Estimates, you would like to have these approximate figures.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGR/5F\nOttawa, November 4, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letters of October 27th with reference to the Wabasca Church of England Residential School.\n\nThe contents of both letters will receive careful consideration when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor Gen. G.R. Turner,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/MGD\nNovember 20, 1947\n\nMajor General G. R. Turner\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWabasca - New Log Building - Anglican Indian Residential School\n\nFurther to my letter of 27th October, I am now in receipt of a communication from the Principal of the above school giving some information regarding the cost of procuring stone, sand, gravel and logs locally. It would appear from this report that the stone, sand, and gravel can be delivered on the site for about $250 to $300 and that the necessary logs for the log walls and gable ends can be delivered on the site for $300 to $350 - a total of $550 to $650.\n\nI would be glad if you would let me know, as early as you possibly can, whether you propose to expend the $10,000 provided in your Departmental Estimates for the present year on the supply of materials for the construction of this building. You will note that an estimate of cost of the materials to be purchased in Edmonton is given in my letter of 27th October. In this connection, the Principal at Wabasca School in his recent communication suggested that the cost of lumber from the sawmill near Slave Lake or High Prairie be looked into, but I imagine that it might be difficult to obtain properly seasoned lumber from such mills. However, I am passing this suggestion along in case your Purchasing Branch is interested, should you decide to purchase the necessary materials for delivery during the coming winter haying season.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\n\nGRT/BP\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, November 26, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 27th and November 20th with reference to the Wabaseca C.E. School.\n\nYou have previously been informed that an amount of $10,000. is provided in the current year's appropriation and we are prepared to spend this amount in obtaining as large a quantity of materials as can be obtained for the sum mentioned.\n\nPlease let me have a list of the building materials mentioned in your letter of October 27th at the earliest possible date so that we can have purchases made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMaj.-General G.R. Turner,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/MGD\nDecember 9th, 1947\n\nRev. Canon J. W. House\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nProposed New School\nWabasca, Alberta\n\nAs requested in your letter 131-8-5 (WT 1) of 26th November, 1947, I enclose three copies of a bill of material covering cement, lime, brick, flue tile, sawn lumber, millwork, hardware and paint required for the proposed school building at Wabasca.\n\nPlease note that a log building on stone masonry walls is contemplated and that the necessary logs, field stone, sand and gravel are not detailed on the enclosed bill of material because they can be obtained locally to best advantage.\n\nIt appears probable that the cost of the items listed on the enclosed bill of material delivered at Slave Lake Station will be around $10,000.00. If it is found that the quotations exceed that figure, the only items that can be deleted are those under the heading of paint because it would be impossible to proceed with the construction of the building next spring unless all the other items, including hardware, are delivered to Wabasca during the coming winter.\n\nAs indicated in this office letter of 20th November, the estimated cost of procuring the logs, field stone, sand and gravel in the vicinity of Wabasca is $550.00 to $650.00.\n\nYou will note from this office letter of 27th October, 1947, that the estimated cost of constructing this building, including the installation of furnaces, is in the\norder of $18,000.00. Unless, therefore, you can definitely provide an additional $8,000.00 for this building in your 1948-49 Estimates to supplement the $10,000.00 already authorized, it would be inadvisable to make any commitment whatsoever because this Administration is not in a position to provide any funds for the construction of this building. I shall be glad, therefore, to be advised at an early date of your decision and whether you would like this Administration to make arrangements on your behalf for local procurement of logs, field stone, sand and gravel and for the transportation from Slave Lake Station to Wabasca of the items contained in the enclosed bill of material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

They can give immediate delivery on these furnaces but not on hot air ducts and registers. However, the ducts and registers are not unduly heavy and can be shipped in during the summer. It would be advisable, though, to ship the furnaces proper in by winter haulage as they weigh around 1000 lbs. each.\n\nFor the information of your Purchasing Branch, the specifications of the Beach Foundry furnaces required to meet the heating requirements are as follows and if purchase is made from some other firm, the specifications should be approximately the same:\n\nTwo only All-Steel Furnaces No. 727\nWood burning grates\nHeating capacity - 30,000 to 35,000 cubic feet each on gravity supply.\n\nThe price f.o.b.

The cost of the above should be charged to the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 in which funds are provided for this new building.\n\nWith reference to the two furnaces, the M.S.C.C. advises that they have received a quotation of $235.00 each, f.o.b. Ottawa from Beach Foundry, Ottawa. The same company further advises the M.S.C.C. that they can give immediate delivery on the furnaces but not on the hot air ducts and registers. However, the ducts and registers are not actually heavy and can be shipped in the summer. As stated above the furnaces should be shipped in by winter haulage as they weigh about 1,000 lbs. each.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

He advised me that there is a possibility that Mr. Indian Agent Landry might have someone in mind. We are therefore writing to Mr. Landry and explaining the situation to him.

Landry, Indian Agent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWabasca C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is our intention to erect a classroom block at the above residential school. We have already purchased a large amount of material during the last part of this fiscal year. We will also have some funds available in our next year's appropriation for the erection of the classroom block.\n\nOriginally the M. S. C. C. had suggested the name of Mr. H. Gallagher, of the Hudson's Bay Company at Wabasca, as one who would undertake the erection of the classroom block on a day labour basis. We have now heard from Mr. Gallagher, advising that he is unable to undertake this work.\n\nI today discussed this problem with Mr. Gooderham and he suggested to me that you might have a man in mind who could undertake the erection of this building. If you want further details as to the type of building, specifications, etc., I suggest that you contact Reverend A. B. Christie, Principal of the Wabasca School, in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, March 20, 1948.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Superintendent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWe have the attached requisition from the Wabasca C.E. School. You will note that the principal asks for 36 desks and 12 kindergarten chairs. Are there no suitable desks in the school at the present time? The request apparently covers the seating accommodation of 48 children, while the authorized enrolment of this school is only 35.\n\nWe do not know what is meant by the term \"right chair desks\" and \"left chair desks.\" The chair desks are made in three sizes, large, medium and small. Please let me know the number of each size required, taking into consideration the desks at present in the school which are still suitable for use.\n\nWhen forwarding requisitions involving such heavy expenditure, you should forward a covering letter pointing out definitely if the equipment is absolutely necessary.\n\nBernard F.

This expenditure can be accounted for in the usual way on your accountable advance and the amounts paid should be shown on your Labour Return forms.

School.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of March 17th, requesting that I endeavour to locate a suitable man to act as foreman for the construction of the above noted school. All efforts were made in this vicinity to locate such a man but to date this has been to no avail. In a recent trip to Edmonton I interviewed a contractor who stated that he may be interested in the building of this school as well as the residence of the Assistant Agent at Wabasca.\n\nThe contractor, Mr. J.A. Boisvert of 8754-92A Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta; phoned me over the long distance telephone this morning and stated that he is willing to undertake the construction of the Church of England School and the residence of the Assistant Agent at Wabasca. His charge in this connection is 60% of the cost of all material F.O.B. Wabasca exclusive of excavation. He is willing however, to supervise the excavation at no additional cost. This work however will have to be done by Indian labour and horses.\n\nMeanwhile, it would therefore be greatly appreciated if a blue print and specifications for the Church of England Residential School were Air Mailed either to Mr. Boisvert or myself. Mr. Boisvert is naturally interested to find out the exact type of construction that will be required before giving his final bid.\n\nI have also on hand the blue print for the residence of the Assistant Agent but I have not yet received the specifications for same. It would therefore be appreciated if this\nalso could be received. I have personally seen various buildings built by Mr. Boisvert and I can recommend his work. He will bring his crew, which is made up of a considerable number of men, but also states that he will require Indian labour to a great extent.\n\nThe matter was discussed over with Mr. Gooderham who was here yesterday. Mr. Gooderham apparently intends to interview Mr. Boisvert and will likely report further on the matter.\n\nA. Landry,\nSuperintendent.\nMay 27, 1948.\n\nA. Landry, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 2nd in which you advise me that you have located a contractor in Edmonton who will undertake the construction of the school and the residence for the Assistant Agent at Wabasca on the basis of 60% of the cost of materials f.o.b. Edmonton, I would say that we cannot figure the cost of the materials as we have not received any accounts from you. If you have not the accounts in your possession, please secure them as quickly as possible, or, in the meantime, advise us what the total cost of all materials which you ordered amounts to. We placed the order from here for the cement, heating and wiring materials but all other materials were to be ordered by you. We will need to know the exact cost of the materials in order that we can secure an Order-in-Council based on the offer of 60% of the cost of materials.\n\nPlease let me have a reply as quickly as possible by Air Mail as it would appear that Mr. Belcourt's offer is one in which we might be interested. You do not mention whether the 60% of the cost of materials is all that will be charged. Does this cover transportation of men, board and lodging of men and will the contractor supply all his own tools and equipment? We understand, of course, that we will have to pay for the excavation. Please go into the matter quite thoroughly and in the meantime we are enclosing an extra copy of the plan of this house and a list of materials.\n\nNo specification has been prepared so it is not the usual practice when Bills of Material are supplied for the architect to prepare specifications. The materials to be used are listed on the Bill of Materials and the plan shows how the house is to be constructed.\nShould it be decided to accept this offer a Contract Agreement and a copy of the Minimum Wage Schedule will be forwarded for the contractor to sign. I trust that you will secure all information before writing to me again on this subject. I may say that this letter has reference only to the construction of the Assistant Agent's house but, no doubt, some of the information will also be required by the Education Branch to enable them to decide whether or not they should accept the offer.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These were mentioned to you in your recent visit to the School and you agreed as to the urgent need of the same. We have already had a number of fires from the old wooden shingles on the roof\u2014some of which have been on for some forty years. I am enclosing a snap of the last one\u2014the roof being only temporarily fixed for the present. I feel a constant weight of worry over the same and our vigilance has no peace or rest from one year to another and I feel that some day one of these roof fires will get too much of a start to save the School. The urgent request for these replacements is being made through you to the Indian Dept.\n\nIn reference to tin roofs, I am requesting asbestos as more durable and satisfactory in every respect. The winds from the Lake are terrific at times and metal roofs have proven to be no end of trouble in becoming loose apart from their noise and heat in summer. The Manager of the Gov.

Asbestos roofing if properly put on is also 90% good for use at any future date if removed.\n\nRe the ice house\u2014the present one has been in use for over 50 years and as it is built of logs, you will understand that its usefulness has long since passed. It is in danger of collapsing at any time.\n\nRe fire escape\u2014one can be built here that will serve the purpose adequately.\n\nRe your recommendation of a new roof on our School buildings as per your January Agent's Report to the Government; a copy of which was sent tome.\n\nArea of roofs on buildings to be covered by asbestos roofing shingles:\n\n- Hip and ridge shingle\u2014lin. feet = 200 ft.\n- Starter = 500 ft.\n- Model \"F\" No. 27 shingle cutter re the above = $39.50\n- Notching attachment\n- Face nail punching attachment\n\nApprox. 1945 price for the above asbestos No 507\u2014Johns-Manville\u2014shot form No. 25\u2014Na-7-44\u2014green roofing shingle = $418.75\n6000 sq. feet or 25 bundles\nApprox. 1945\u2014cost\u2014No 507 Hip and ridge shingle = $54.00\nCarried over $492.25\n\nApprox. cost green No. 536 Starter = $33.75\n\nApprox. labour costs to roof buildings $500.00\n\n\" freighting costs $200.00\n\n\" cost of 125 lbs. 2\" galv. nails $12.50\n\n$1238.50\n\n==================\n\nApprox. cost of ice house-insulated with shavings in order that ice can be kept within, without requiring any sawdust.\n\n6000 ft. shiplap @ 40.00 --- $240.00\nnails 50 lbs. @ $2.50 --- $4.00\n1000 Ft. 2x4 lumber --- $35.00\n2000 shingles @ 8.00 per 1000 --- $16.00\nLabour costs approx. --- $150.00\nFreighting costs Approx. --- $75.00\n\n==================\n\n$520.00\n\nApprox. cost of fire escape for Girl's dormitory --- $50.00\n\n==================\n\nYour attention to the above in having it placed before the Dept. for their approval in the 1946 estimates will be deeply appreciated so that the same can be freighted in at the earliest possible date and work can be done through the summer months while the children are at home.\n\nThe agent for the Johns-Manville building material at Ottawa is Mr. Glad Ghent - Government Representative, Ottawa, Ont.\n\n==================\n\nHaving assured me of the full realization of the needs of the above-I know that you will do your utmost to see that we no longer are deprived of what is vitally necessary for the safety of our children and the School buildings. Thanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nNote-May, 19th., 1948.\n\nMay I bring to your attention that it was in your visit to the above Mission on Jan. 3rd., last, that you promised an immediate search for the above estimates in your files and that I was to be notified as to the results. No letter was received from that time and only in my visit to High Prairie on April 14th., did I happen to meet you and the request was made for another copy as above due to the fact that no trace of the other could be found. I would certainly appreciate your immediate\nattention to the estimates as made in the letter of Feb. 25th., 1946. As I have no way at present of getting new quotations, I leave the increase in all the quoted prices to you for alteration as they have increased considerably in every Dept. of building material. You will be in much closer touch with costs as they are today at your Office. Again thanking you for your interest and forwarding of the above to the Dept. at Ottawa, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\nMay 26, 1948.\n\nColonel E. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI regret very much having to bring the following matter to your attention but feel that your office may be able to give us some help.\n\nConcerning the enclosed copy of the Rev. Mr. Cathcart's letter and requisition to the Acting Agent at Driftpile, Alberta, Mr. Cathcart writes me as follows:\n\n\"Enclosed please find a copy of estimates provided in Feb. 1946 to the Acting Indian Agent re roofing for the above School etc. No notice was taken of the letter despite several reminders and on no occasion did I receive an answer to my letters. The present Agent promised to search for the same as in the footnote and again I received no letter. Meeting him one day at High Prairie while out to see the Doctor re my bronchial and asthma trouble, he informed me that no trace of the letter could be found in the files and asked me to type another copy of the same so that he could take up the matter with Ottawa. I am therefore sending you a copy for fear that it will go the same way that former letters seem to disappear or receive no recognition.\"\n\nThe above quotation tells Mr. Cathcart's experience in just this one particular case. At other times he has had difficulty in dealing with the agent and any help you can give in having the roof in question seen to will be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent.\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nMay 26th, 1948.\n\nCol. B. W. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Church of England Residential School, Wabasca.\n\nThe erection of buildings at Wabasca, Lesser Slave Agency, is a real problem. It came up for discussion with the present Superintendent, Mr. Landry, when I visited that Agency last week.\n\nI learned that Mr. J. A. Loisvert of Edmonton was prepared to make an offer to do all the Government buildings at that point this summer, and then arranged an appointment with him in Edmonton on the 23rd, where I learned that he had been in phone communication with Mr. Landry on the 22nd. I have now received a copy of Mr. Landry's letter, file 5-4-5, dated the 22nd, and I also have a report from the Labor Department office at Edmonton on Mr. Loisvert's work. This is a confidential report.\n\nMr. Loisvert had given me Armitage Mc Bain Lumber Company as a reference. I therefore asked the Labor official to contact a responsible member of this firm. He did so and here is his report:\n\n\"Mr. Allan Mc Bain stated that he would not recommend Mr. Loisvert either financially or as a builder. As he owed the company a large amount of money he was given two company houses to build. Evidently he paid little attention to the architect's plans and went along in his own fashion until he got into such a muddle that the company took him off the job and had someone else finish the houses.\" It is regretted that I got such a report, because I was favorably impressed with Mr. Loisvert.\n\nSome other contacts must be made but nothing can be done until we have the plans and specifications and a bill of material already delivered at Wabasca. For your information, material for a staff house is also delivered at Wabasca.\n\nIf all the information with regard to these two buildings is available at this office, an honest endeavor will be made to get some contractor who will go into Wabasca and do all this work. I would therefore ask you to please send at least one set of plans, specifications, etc., here and preferably there, so that they can be sent out to any who might be interested.\n\nG.H.

H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWabasca C. E. Building Program\n\nBy now, you should have received a copy of the blue-prints dealing with the new building planned for the Wabasca Residential School. Originally the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C. intended to carry out this building project. However, due to the sudden deaths of the late Dr. Alderwood and Canon House, it has been necessary for the Department to assume this responsibility.\n\nThe plans and the bill of materials were prepared by the M.S.C.C. The Department has already purchased the materials listed by the M.S.C.C. as necessary and these have been forwarded to the school. Mr. Landry should have copies of these purchase orders. However, attached hereto is a copy of the original bill of materials which was sent to us by the M.S.C.C. With regard to the type of building I would like to quote from a letter of the late Canon House dated December 9:\n\n\"Please note that a log building on stone masonry walls is contemplated and that the necessary logs, field stone, sand and gravel are not detailed on the enclosed bill of material because they can be obtained to best advantage, locally.\n\n................. ..........\n\n\"As indicated in this office letter of 20th November, the estimated cost of procuring the logs...\"\nfield stone, sand and gravel in the vicinity of Wabasca is $550.00 to $650.00.\"\n\nInsofar as we have been able to ascertain here, no provision has been made for procuring the logs required. This is unfortunate but due to the sudden deaths of the two Superintendents of the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C., it was impossible to clean up all the loose ends in some of their projects.\n\nBernard F.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nNew Building, Wabasca.\n\nHerewith are the following which have just been received from the Principal of St. John's Anglican School, Wabasca.\n\nInvoice dated 12th Feb., 1948 - Sherwin Williams\nInvoice dated 1st March, 1948 Ashdowns\nInvoice dated 25th Feb., 1948 Ashdowns\nwith correspondence attached.\nList of lumber delivered up to early June, 1948.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook.\nSuperintendent.\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\nJune 25, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Wabasca Church of England School.\n\nI have on hand your letter of June 21st, file 131-4B-2, in which you ask that I obtain a bid from Mr. Ebraim Blouin of Jousard, Alberta, for the construction of the school block as well as the Agency residence at Wabasca.\n\nI have today interviewed Mr. Blouin in that respect but this man is in the neighborhood of 70 years of age. Although he is reputed to possess a very high standard of carpenter skill, he himself admits that he is somewhat advanced in age to undertake such a construction, especially in a remote area such as Wabasca. I have no specifications on hand here nor bill of material, or purchase orders of any kind for the Church of England School Block. The only thing that could give him was one set of the blue prints that was forwarded here by you. It is to be noted that while Mr. Blouin himself does not appear to be interested in giving a bid, his son Alfred who is well reputed, may possibly be interested. At the present time both Alfred and Ebraim are in Whitefish Lake about to start the construction of our Day School there. They do not expect to finish that construction before the 15th of August.\n\nAs previously stated the material for the agency residence at Wabasca has reached there and is conveniently stored there. This building therefore could be started on at anytime. I regret however that I cannot say the same for the school block. Of all material that was shipped to Slave Lake in care of Mr. R.F. V., it would appear that it has all reached Wabasca except two drums. It has also been reported to me that a great deal of the material shipped had been damaged in transit. It is also understood that this school is to be built with logs on stone masonry. Only a few of the logs have been delivered on the premises and I have been informed by the Reverend Brown Christie that he was unable to get more logs supplied as the Indians refused to work for him.\n\nWhile in Wabasca I made an effort to obtain from Reverend Christie as much information as I possibly could, but this was to little avail. He did not know whether he had received any purchase orders or not and also stated that as the invoices were coming in, they were sent to the M.S.C.C., after the material had been checked against it. He could not inform me whether he had received invoices or purchase orders covering all the material. The whole matter seemed to be somewhat obscure to him and from this point there is very little that I can do as I am totally unaware of what was shipped and so forth.\n\nA.

This building therefore could be started on at any time. I regret however that I cannot say the same for the school block. Of all material that was shipped to Slave Lake in care of Mr. E. F.

Landry,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 21, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant in connection with the building at the Wabasca C.E. Residential School.\n\nPurchase orders were issued several months ago for the materials that we were supplying and it was understood that delivery of them would be made by winter freight previous to March 31st.\n\nRecently we had a letter from J.C. Burger Lumber Co., Edmonton, regarding purchase order 2603. They stated that they had delivered the items on this purchase order in February but have not been paid due to the fact that they did not know how to handle the matter.\n\nWe have interviewed the officials of the M.S.C.C. this morning and are advised that Reverend Mr. Davies has assumed duties as principal of the Wabasca C.E. School and it is expected that he will secure the balance of the logs required. We would appreciate it if you would communicate with him with a view to having the accounts covering the material already supplied forwarded to us at the earliest possible date.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Erection of Church of England School Bldgs. - Wabasca.\n\nIt was our hope that this building could be erected by the same contractor who would erect the home for the Assistant Agent at Wabasca. It was our understanding that the material for both these buildings was already delivered to the sites, and, on this assumption, I made inquiries and got certain contractors interested in this work.\n\nWhen Mr. Landry returned from Treaty payments in June, he answered a letter I had written. Attached hereto is a copy of Mr. Landry's answer. This shows that a great deal of the materials for the school building is not yet on the spot, and this material, which is logs, is not likely to be supplied this year. This meant that the contractors, who had been asked to consider it, had to be advised that there would likely be only one building left to erect.\n\nMr. Landry will be replaced by another in the position of Superintendent, and until such time as this change is made, very little, if anything, can be done.\n\nG.

Some progress was made with Edmonton contractors and also with Mr. Blouim of Joussard. However, Mr. Landry reported after Treaty payment at Wabasca, that considerable of the material for the Church, in the form of logs, had never been secured, and that therefore the erection of this building could not be considered at this time, and possibly not this year.\n\nEverything is at a standstill at the moment. The contractors had to be advised and nothing further has been done. As Mr. Landry will be replaced by another in the position of Supt, and there will be a new Assistant Agent at Wabasca, I do not propose to proceed further until these changes have been made. You will be advised of any progress.\n\n(Sgd) G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\nJuly 28, 1948.\n\nG.H.

Residential School.\n\nI have on hand your letter of July 24th bearing instructions to contact the Reverend A.L. Davies who is now school principal at that point.\n\nI immediately sent a telegram to Mr. Davies asking him to submit all such unpaid invoices that he may have on hand and in particular the one from the J.C. Burger Lumber Company.\n\nIt is to be noted however that Mr. Davies, in all fairness, will have to be given a chance to untangle various irregularities that may have occurred prior to his arrival there. I have been informed that Reverend Davies has only arrived in Wabasca a few days ago. I feel confident however that under his administration the matter will be attended too without undue delay.\n\nA. Landry,\nSuperintendent.\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nJuly 29th, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Wabasca C.E. Residential School\n\nThis will acknowledge yours of the 21st instant, file 131-8-5 (B.1).\n\nI wrote Mr. Landry to contact Mr. Davies by the quickest method, and his answer is as per the attached copy of letter.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, there is a very great likelihood that Mr. Landry will be replaced by a new Superintendent and that his Assistant at Wabasca will also be a new man. Notice for this is expected daily. The new man must be introduced to the work. In the meantime, I fear there is bound to be some delay in getting information.\n\nG. H.

If the furnaces are not required immediately at the school, there is not much advantage in moving them at the present time if the winter freight rate is much less. We understand that the weight of these furnaces is approximately 2,000 pounds.\n\nWe would like to pay the Company and you should communicate with Mr. Davies and obtain a copy of purchase order 28761 and if all the items mentioned on that purchase order are at Slave Lake you might certify the account and return same so that payment can be made.\n\nBernard F.

We have been able to interest Mr. Taylor of the Bond Construction Company in the erection of this building.\n\nIt was also our intention to erect a new dormitory block for the Wabasca C.E. Residential School. Originally it was intended that this school would be erected by the M.S.C.C. with the Department providing the necessary materials. However, it would seem evident that this is not now possible and that we will have to plan the erection of this building in the usual manner.\n\nI understand that my Superintendent of Education and your Chief Architect have already discussed these two projects with Mr. Taylor. I believe that you have also arranged to have one of your engineers do a site survey at the proposed location of these two buildings. I anticipate that we will be making a request to you for the preparation of the drawings and specifications required for the erection of this classroom block when further information is received from our Regional Supervisor for Alberta.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, November 20, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PRATT,\nRes Wabasca C.E. Residential School.\n\nI would suggest that a memorandum be sent to the Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch with regard to the erection of the dormitory block and Assistant Agent's residence at Wabasca along the following lines:\n\n\"Further to our memorandum of October 25th, please be advised that Mr. Taylor of the Bond Construction Company is interested in the erection of both the dormitory block required at the Wabasca C.E. Residential School and also the Assistant Agent's House required at the same point.\n\nIncluded in our Main 1948-49 Estimates is a sum of $18,000. for the erection of this dormitory block. Some of this sum has been spent in the provision of materials required for the erection of this building. As previously discussed, it was originally intended that this dormitory block would be erected by the M.S.C.C., with the Department supplying the necessary materials. However, it is now evident that due to financial difficulties the M.S.C.C., will not be able to erect the building and that the Department will have to plan its construction in the usual manner.\n\nI understand that the necessary plans have been prepared and that Mr. Taylor is prepared to proceed with its construction. If we could be advised as to the funds which will be required for its erection, we can arrange for the necessary transfer. As it is unlikely that the building will be completed by the end of the fiscal year,\"\nI would suggest that we ask for a transfer only of the necessary funds for the work which can be done by the end of March 31, 1949. In view of the size of these two projects, I would suggest that this work be carried out under the Supervision of your Branch and that you obtain the necessary Order-in-Council etc\".\n\nActing Director.\n\nYou, of course, may want to add a paragraph with regard to your agency building, eg., the type of building required, etc.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 4)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nHigh Prairie, Alberta,\nOctober 25, 1948.\n\nMr. W.J.F. Pratt, General Executive Assistant,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Building Program - Wabasca,\nLesser Slave Lake Agency.\n\nSuperintendent Lapp and I have returned to the\nAgency after five days at Wabasca, part of which time was\noccupied with the Representative of the Bond Construction\nCompany, and Mr. Snape, Engineer of the Land and Development\nBranch, locating sites for the school block and the Assistant\nAgent's house, and preliminary arrangements for commencement\nof construction work.\n\nA new site on the Church of England property was\nchosen. Mr. Snape favoured this because water could be easily\npumped from the lake and sewage easily disposed. The site is\nless than one-half mile north of the present buildings. It is a\nbeautiful spot.\n\nThe principal of the school, Reverend Mr. A.L. Davies,\nagreed to the location and also agreed that the pupils living\nin the new building could attend their classes in the buildings\nnow used for that purpose.\n\nWe learned that no person has succeeded in obtaining\nwater from any but very shallow wells. The Hudson's Bay Company\nhave drilled without success. Shallow wells are uncertain and\nunsatisfactory. As a result the trading company, the Church of\nEngland Mission, the Roman Catholic Mission, and all other\nresidents have water in barrels from the lake on the south side.\nThe new site is on the north side and Mr. Snape's choice is only\na few hundred yards from the new school site and water should be\navailable at all times.\n\nThe Bond Construction Company will no doubt commence\nwork this week.\n\nIn regards to the site for the Assistant Agent's\nhouse, we encountered difficulties in making a choice. After\nsurveying the whole situation carefully, lots near the new Church\nof England school site was our choice because the location is\nwithin a short walk to the schools, churches and trading post, and\ncentrally located near all the Indian reserves.\n\nOn the 23rd we were fortunate in meeting a man by the\nname of Gladue who claims to have a title to the lot which would\nbe suitable. It contains 4.2 acres and on it are two log houses,\none of which was recently built and of very good construction.\nMr. Snape valued this between $150.00 and $200.00 and to this I\nagreed. The owner asked $300.00 for the land and buildings. I\nconsidered it to be a very fair price. The good house could make an office and the other an out-building. He was advised that his offer could be accepted if he could give a clear title.\n\nI contacted the Inspector of Municipal Affairs at High Prairie today where I learned that the property is owned by a Mr. Auger who may be the same man as Gladue because these two floods can have more than one name. Before leaving the Agency this information should be supplied by Mr. Foster, Assistant Agent. There are tax arrears but it is possible that the purchase can be made at the Department of Municipal Affairs, Edmonton. This I am sure will be accepted by the Branch. I will be in Edmonton on my return to Calgary.\n\nAs the Bond Construction Company hope to excavate basements of both buildings and erect foundations before freeze up, the purchase of the sub-agency site must be made as quickly as possible. If I do not hear from you to the contrary, in care of the Charles Campbell Hospital, I will contact the Supervisor of Tax Recovery, Edmonton, and try to affect a purchase so work can be started immediately pending completion of the sale.\n\nSgd. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nNovember 23rd, 1948.\n\nThe Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch.\n\nRe: Construction work (School Dormitory Block and Assistant Agent's Residence) Wabasca \u2014 Lesser Slave Lake \u2014 Alberta.\n\nReferring to my memorandum of October 25th, we understand that Mr. Taylor of the Bond Construction Company is interested in the erection of both the dormitory block required at the Wabasca C.E. Residential School and also the Assistant Agent's house.\n\nThe sum of $18000.00 was provided in this year's Estimates - Education Vote - for the erection of the dormitory block. Some of this money has been spent in the purchase of the materials required for the building. You will recall that it was the original intention to have this building constructed by the M.S.C.C. However, it is now evident that due to financial difficulties the M.S.C.C. will not be able to erect the building.\n\nFunds to the amount of $8,000.00 were provided in Indian Agencies Vote for the construction of the Assistant Agent's residence. The materials for this residence were shipped to Wabasca last winter. The materials shipped were those listed by your Architectural Service as being required to construct a residence in accordance with Plan No. NE5. I understand from Mr. Taylor that some of the materials were damaged in transit.\n\nI also understand that the necessary plans have been prepared for the construction of the dormitory block and that Mr. Taylor\nis prepared to proceed with its construction as well as with\nthe construction of the Assistant Agent's house. Will you,\ntherefore, please advise me at the earliest possible date the\nestimated cost of building both these buildings having in mind\nthat the materials for both buildings have been purchased and\ndelivered. It will probably be necessary for us to arrange a\ntransfer of funds to both these projects as it is hardly likely\nthat the sum of $15,000.00 provided in the Education Vote and\n$6,000.00 provided in the Indian Agencies Vote will be sufficient.\nI would ask you to kindly take up with Mr. Taylor the\npossibilities of completing these buildings by the 31st of March.\nIf this can be done, we will arrange to set up Encumbrance\nRequisitions for the full amount of money required. Should\nMr. Taylor inform you that it will not be possible to complete\nboth buildings, you should let me know approximately how much\nshould be provided for the work which he will be able to complete\nup to the end of March, 1949.\n\nI believe that it would be advisable that your Branch\nmake all the necessary arrangements with Mr. Taylor to undertake\nboth projects. May I suggest, therefore, that Officers of your\nBranch prepare all the necessary documents including Report to\nCouncil and Contract Agreements and that you arrange for the\nsupervision of the work. As mentioned above, we will furnish you\nwith Financial Encumbrances for the amount of money required for\nboth jobs as soon as you inform us what money will be needed.\nAs the projects are payable from two different votes, namely,\nIndian Education and Indian Agencies, you should furnish separate\nestimates for each project.\n\nFrom brief conversations which we have had with Mr. Taylor,\nit would appear that some additional materials will have to be\npurchased and, no doubt, Mr. Taylor can furnish you officers with\na list of these materials after he has visited the site and has\nexamined the materials which have been delivered. We will, therefore,\nneed to know also the estimated cost of the additional materials\nwhich it will be necessary to allow Mr. Taylor to purchase.\n\nActing Director.\nTRANSFER BETWEEN ALLOTMENTS\n\nApplication is hereby made to the Secretary, Treasury Board, for the following Transfers within:\n\n218 and Supplementary Vote 772.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nHudson's Bay Company Account\nWabasca Alta.\n\nReferring to your 767-5 (E) of 3rd January, 1949, it would seem that your Treasury Branch perhaps does not appreciate the method of paying workmen in the North for services rendered by giving them orders on the local Hudson's Bay Post.\n\nThe story of this account is that when the construction of a new school building at Wabasca was decided upon, the original intention was to have a log building on a concrete foundation. In order to have things ready for construction last spring, it was agreed between Colonel Murray and Canon Cook that the Principal should arrange locally for the getting out and hewing of logs for the wells and the collecting of the gravel for the concrete and that the bills for this should be passed to your Department for payment. The Principal did arrange for some of this work and, in accordance with normal local practice, gave the workmen concerned orders on the local Hudson's Bay Company Post for the amounts due them. The Hudson's Bay Company Post filled these orders and then submitted their bills for them in the usual way.\n\nAs the orders on the Hudson's Bay Post were obviously made out by the Principal somewhat on the following lines:\n\n\"Deliver to ____________ goods to the value of _______ for services performed in _______ (getting out gravel, hewing logs, etc., etc.)\"\n\nthere does not seem to be much use in approaching the Hudson's Bay Company for any more details than already appear on their account.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(gd) G.R. Turner\nJanuary 15, 1949\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT funds were provided in the 1948-49 Estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the construction of a Dormitory Block at the Wabasca Church of England Indian Residential School, and for a Residence for the Assistant, Indian Agency, Wabasca Indian Reserve, Lesser Slave Lake Agency in the Province of Alberta;\n\nTHAT it is essential that proper dormitory facilities be provided for the Indian children, who are now living in a group of old log buildings, some of which are over fifty years old, and all in a dilapidated and unsafe condition;\n\nTHAT it is also essential to provide living quarters for the Assistant, Indian Agency, who has been appointed to look after the affairs of these Indians and who has no place to live;\n\nTHAT owing to the isolated and inaccessible location it was necessary to have materials shipped to Wabasca during the winter of 1947-48 in order to have them on hand for construction during the summer of 1948. Materials were purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch, shipped to Slave Lake, and transported by Indian teams to Wabasca where they are stored pending the securing of a competent builder to construct the two buildings. The materials purchased for the Dormitory Block cost $10,023.07. The materials purchased for the Residence for the Assistant, Indian Agency cost $3,451.92;\n\nTHAT efforts were made to interest contractors and builders in Edmonton and the vicinity of Wabasca Indian Reserve in the construction of both the aforementioned buildings, but without success, as contractors had all the work they could do in their own districts;\n\nTHAT the Bond Construction Company, Limited, of Edmonton, Alberta, who have successfully carried out other work for the Department of Mines and Resources and who are known to be reliable and competent contractors, recently offered to construct the above-mentioned buildings by contract, on the basis of cost, plus ten per cent. (10%) of the finished cost of the work, using the materials supplied by the said Department and furnishing all other materials, labour and equipment required to satisfactorily complete the buildings;\nTHAT Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C., 1927, provides, in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any work is to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the Minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such work except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest.\"\n\nTHAT it is considered that the construction of the dormitory block at Wabamun Church of England Residential School and the residence for the Assistant Indian Agent, Wabamun Indian Reserve out of pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above rectified and further, it is considered that the work can be expeditiously and economically executed by the Bond Construction Company, who are familiar with building conditions in isolated and northern areas;\n\nTHAT including materials, furnished by the department, and after providing for the contractors' fees and unforeseen contingencies the cost of the buildings will be approximately as follows:\n\n(a) Dormitory Building - One Hundred and thirty-two thousand dollars ($132,000.00);\n\n(b) Residence - Eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000.00);\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the expenditure of the funds necessary for the construction of the above named buildings, and for the award of a contract to the Bond Construction Company Limited of Edmonton, Alberta, in the sum of proven cost, plus ten per cent. (10%) of the total cost of the completed buildings, the said total cost for the construction of the Dormitory Block and Residence for the Assistant, Indian Agency, to be met from funds provided in the 1948-49 Estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, under Votes 216 (Indian Education) and 214 (Indian Agencies), respectively.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ltd.\n\nThe funds provided for the construction of the above residence, which is to be built in accordance with Plan No. N.F.S., amount to $20,000.00. Of this sum approximately $6,500.00 is required to pay accounts for materials ordered for this residence by this branch and for the freighting of the materials to the site. There is, therefore, a balance of $3,500.00 immediately available which sum is encumbered under R.R. 2693, copy of which is enclosed. This sum may be used by our Branch to make any payments immediately to the Bond Construction Company, Limited.\n\nWe understand that the estimated cost of both the school and residence amounts to $150,000.00 and we have, therefore, prepared a Submission to Council in which we have included the following paragraphs:\n\n(a) Dormitory Building - One Hundred and thirty-two thousand dollars ($132,000.00);\n\n(b) Residence - Eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000.00).\n\nThese figures do not contain any estimates of the cost of providing water and sewerage as it is felt that these matters should be dealt with in a separate Submission to Council.\nIn providing for water and a sewage system, it is not thought that 50% of the cost should be borne by the Agencies Division, but that the proportion for the Agencies Division should be such less as the school will be using much more water than the small residence.\n\nAssuming that the cost of the Assistant Agent's residence will not exceed $18,000.00, we will ask for a transfer of $10,000.00 to make up the total of the $18,000.00 required and when this transfer is approved, a further Financial Encumbrance will be prepared, copy of which will be sent to your office.\n\nI may add, for your information, that the 1949-50 Estimates contain an item of only $6,000.00, and if it is possible to arrange to have the greater part of the work done before the end of the present fiscal year I should appreciate it if you would do so.\n\nAs mentioned above Bill 2693 is enclosed for the sum of $3,500.00, in case you are required to make any immediate payments to the Company.\n\nWhen the Order-in-Council is passed, two signed copies of the Order-in-Council will be sent to your office.\n\nDirector.\nJanuary 21st, 1949\n\nColonel B.

No doubt, this account will be passed for payment, chargeable to Vote 516.\n\nMr. Basler's suggestion that the logs be moved to the Agency site and used later in the construction of a warehouse seems to be a good one. Unless the principal of the school has some other good use for these logs, authority is requested to have them moved to the Agency, to be retained there for whatever future use can be made of them.\n\nG.

The total valuation placed on the buildings at Whitefish is shown as $19,927.65. A copy of the valuation for each building is enclosed. I would particularly draw to your attention that there is no well at Whitefish, the water being taken from the river.

I am to say that my Society accepts this valuation.\n\nI note also the suggestion that when the new building, now under construction, is completed, there may be some of the nine buildings mentioned above which may not be required. I would point out that at Wabasca, as in the case of the other northern schools which are under negotiation, my Society purchased or erected buildings at a time when Government was not prepared to do so, and thus made possible the continuance of schools that would otherwise have been closed. Furthermore, as was explained to the Minister last year, the proceeds of the sale of all these buildings will be applied on the very heavy debt incurred in carrying on our sixteen residential schools under war-time conditions. We naturally hope therefore, that all the buildings at Wabasca, as listed, will be purchased.\n\nIn the concluding paragraph of your letter you refer to another letter in which it is proposed that the officials of our Indian School Administration and those of your Branch might meet for further conference. The letter mentioned has not yet arrived; but I may say we should welcome the proposed conference.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was reassuring to see such care being given to detail and I am sure, when finished, the building will prove to be warm and serviceable.\n\nIf I have any criticism to make it is that the dormitory floor space is small for the number of children to be accommodated.

One of the present buildings can be used adequately for a classroom but my great concern is over the Residence. The present residence is nearly half a mile from the new school building and because of a hill in between neither building is visible from the other. While the contractors are on the spot would it be possible for a Principal's residence to be built near the site of the new building? Much material, logs, sashes, wall board etc., is on hand and is government owned having been acquired for the construction of a smaller school but of no use in the new building. Much of this material could be used for a residence. To my mind it is most unwise to expect the Principal to live over half a mile from his school especially as the school is not visible from the residence.\n\nVery few of the fixtures in the present set of buildings are usable in the new school.

Residential School\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter from Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C. concerning the above school.\n\nCould you please advise concerning his request for a new Principal's residence. This would not need to be a very large building presumably, but we wish to proceed cautiously in considering his request.\n\nHe has been asked to have the Reverend Principal of the school prepare a requisition for the furniture required for the new building, over and above the items in the old building.\n\nBernard F.

Goderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nPurchase of Wabasca Residential School.\n\nAs you know, the Department is negotiating with the M.S.C.C. for the purchase of the residential schools owned by that organization. We have received from the Department of Public Works the inspection and valuation reports made by their engineers. The valuation on the Wabasca School can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Shed - Back of Girls' Residence ........... $600.00\n2. Girls' Residence ......................... 1,800.00\n3. Boys' Residence ......................... 1,800.00\n4. Dining Room and Kitchen ................. 6,482.64\n5. Barn .................................. 1,200.00\n6. Laundry ................................ 392.00\n7. Clothing Warehouse ....................... 363.28\n8. Warehouse ................................ 350.00\n9. Workshop ................................ 750.00\n\nTotal ............ $ 13,737.92\n\nAs you are aware, the new dormitory block at Wabasca will be nearing completion by June or July. Therefore, we have indicated to the M.S.C.C. that we would be interested in purchasing only those buildings which are essential for use with the new dormitory block. In a reply just received from Canon\nDixon, he points out the following:\n\n\"I note that you give an evaluation of $13,737.92 for the nine buildings listed. I am to say that my Society accepts this valuation.\n\n\"I note also the suggestion that when the new building, now under construction, is completed, there may be some of the nine buildings mentioned above which may not be required. I would point out that at Wabasca, as in the case of the other northern schools which are under negotiation, my Society purchased or erected buildings at a time when Government was not prepared to do so, and thus made possible the continuance of schools that would otherwise have been closed. Furthermore, as was explained to the Minister last year, the proceeds of the sale of all these buildings will be applied on the very heavy debt incurred in carrying on our sixteen residential schools under war-time conditions. We naturally hope therefore, that all the buildings at Wabasca, as listed, will be purchased.\"\n\nWould you please arrange to inspect the situation at Wabasca on the occasion of your next tour of northern Alberta and report to the Department as to whether we should purchase all of the buildings or just those essential for the operation of the school in conjunction with the new dormitory block.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, April 29, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon L.A. Dixon, O.B.E., M.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nThe Church of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nPurchase of Wabasca Residential School.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 28 concerning the purchase of the above school. I cannot give you a decision at the present time with regard to your request that the Department purchase all the buildings at Wabasca.\n\nWe are arranging for an inspection of this school and a careful survey will be made as to our exact requirements there.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nProgress Payment - Construction -\n\nWabaseca C.E.

School for January, February and March for $180.00 was forwarded to the Department from this office. It is noted you state that you have issued a voucher covering the months of January, February and March for the same school. If payment has not already been made covering our Voucher 442 it will be necessary for you to have this Voucher cancelled, as it appears you have already vouchered for this expenditure.\n\nE.S. Lapp\nSuperintendent.\nCol. H. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Wabasca C.E. Residential School\n\nI have yours of the 25th, file 767-5 (E) and have read Archdeacon Cook's letter to the Director.\n\nIt is true that the principal's residence is a half a mile to the south of the new administration building and that a hill intervenes. It is also true that there is a large number of logs and possibly other building materials which might be used in the construction of a new house. I can only recommend this expenditure if you have lots of surplus funds. I certainly could not recommend that you take funds which should be used to build day schools throughout the province, because I don't think the need is so urgent.\n\nOver $15,000.00 has already been expended on the erection of a house for the Assistant Agency and it is not yet completed. This amount does not include most of the building material which was delivered to Wabasca last spring. This can be used as a guide as to what a new house for the principal might cost.\n\nI have never seen the plan of the new administration building, but I understand it does not include classrooms. Therefore, the children will still attend classes in the buildings which are situated near the principal's present residence.\n\nIt is a logical assumption that he will have an assistant principal or matron in charge of the administration building, and it is my experience that unless the principal lives in the school, he must delegate responsibility to the senior assistant in his absence.\n\nAs already stated, there is considerable material on the spot, but it is not altogether suitable for house construction. Extra material will be required and it will be costly. The freight rate from railhead is still 5\u00a2 per pound. The Archdeacon was confused between Wabasca and Whitefish.\n\nThe cost of replacement of the furnishings and fixtures in the administration building will amount to\nCol. B. F. Neary\n\nApril 29th, 1949\n\na great deal, and I think that is a more urgent need than the erection of a new house.\n\nWhen the administration building has been used for a year, the principal will know where his residence should be; he might find that the logical location is right where it stands today.\n\nI am returning Archdeacon Cook's letter.\n\nG.

It is appreciated that normally you do not provide \"walk-in\" refrigerators where the pupilage is under 100 but in view of the fact that at an isolated place like Tabaseca, stocks of meat, fish, fowl, etc., have to be laid in when they are procurable, it would be a great help if you could give favourable consideration to the provision of a walk-in refrigerator in the space suggested by the Principal and Contractor as a special case. Will you please let us know what you can do in this matter.\n\nThe Principal also reports that he has been informed that Government orders are to the effect that the playrooms in this new building are to be used as classrooms. Will you please advise us whether this is correct. It is certainly not a satisfactory arrangement because if rooms are fitted up with desks, etc., they are not suitable in any way as playrooms and, on the other hand, rooms that are used as playrooms cannot be kept very attractive from the classroom standpoint.

Indian Residential School, Wabasca.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nMr. G. S. Lepp:\n\nRe: Purchase of Wabasca Residential School Buildings.\n\n1. Reference is made to your letter in the above connection under date of May 6th, 1949; I have today interviewed The Reverend Mr. Davies and discussed the subject with him at considerable length. Mr. Davies and I are of the following unanimous opinions:\n\n2. Shed - Back of Girls' Residence - valued $600.00. This shed is a very old structure. The logs in it are very badly rotted. Mr. Davies informed that he had been thinking of having this building demolished as it cannot be put to any practical use. It is currently being used to store building material and it is suitable only for keeping rain and sun off the stores it now contains.\n\n3. With the exception of the Dining Room and kitchen all of the buildings are old log structures in extremely poor repair. Some of them could be used in connection with the operation of the new dormitory but not without renovation and alteration to suit the new requirements.\n\n4. For instance, Mr. Davies advised me that he hopes to get another teacher and to operate two classrooms. The present classroom could continue to be used as one of them. The present Dining Room and Kitchen, with some alteration, would be a fairly good second classroom providing 40 x 24 feet of space with a fairly good amount but not sufficient light. This building is of fairly recent construction and is in good condition. It is our understanding that the two playrooms now being built into the new dormitory are to be used temporarily as classrooms.\n\n5. The question of a Principal's Residence might be solved by converting the present Boys' dormitory into suitable quarters. This is the only building in this group which would lend itself to that purpose. Considerable and rather costly renovation and alteration would be required in this case.\n\n6. Mr. Davies also expressed his intention to continue the maintenance of some stock. The present stable would be suitable and adequate for this purpose. It also requires some repair.\n\n7. My statement that these buildings generally could not be put to good use without considerable expense may sound inconsistent with the fact that they are currently being made use of. In this connection I might state that, while the buildings have been used, they have not been properly maintained as it has apparently been the policy of the M.S.C.C. to get along as best they could and not to undertake any major maintenance work under wartime costs and conditions.\n\n8. In summarizing my opinion, shared by Mr. Davies, I would say that the only buildings in question we could use would be (1) Boys' Residence (if required as Principal's Residence) (2) Dining Room and Kitchen (as extra classroom) (3) Barn (continued use as barn and (4) Present classroom which is not listed in Mr. Gooderham's letter of May 4, 1949. (Could be kept in use, if required, as one classroom).\n\n9. To clarify the situation over the Principal's Residence, in case the reader is not aware of the circumstances, I should point out that Mr. Davies now occupies a Residence which is not owned by the M.S.C.C. but by the Athabasca Diocese. Mr. Davies points out that it is not unlikely that a Clergyman may be sent to Wabasca to relieve him of some of his present responsibilities. In that event the new Clergyman would be expected to occupy the Residence now used by Mr. Davies.\n\n10. With the exceptions noted in para. 8 of this report, I cannot see any good use to which we could put these buildings; they could only be used as unsightly stop gaps the maintenance of which would certainly become a continuous bill of expense.\n\nL. Basler\nAsst. Indian Agent\nWabasca, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nB. F. Neary, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Purchase of Wabasca Residential School.\n\nReferring to yours of April 29th, file 767-5 (E), I am enclosing copy of a report on the property of the M.S.C.C. at Wabasca. This has been made by Mr. Basler, the Assistant Agent. He is most competent not only because he is a resident but because he has had considerable building experience.\n\nYou will note that he recommends the purchase of the following:\n\n1. Boys' Residence.................. $1,800.00\n2. Dining room and kitchen........... 6,482.64\n3. Barn................................ 1,200.00\n4. Present classroom.................. 1,000.00\n\nTotal..... $10,482.64\n\nThe valuations placed on these buildings are in my opinion the very utmost that they are worth. As Mr. Basler has indicated, they are all in poor condition except the dining room and kitchen. The boys' residence was formerly the home of the fur trader, while the barn and present classroom were no doubt used as outbuildings for the trading post. The residence will require considerable repairs if it was used as the home of the principal; I doubt if this would be justified. The dining room and kitchen can be altered as suggested by Mr. Basler.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRe: Construction of Dormitory School -\nWabasca, Alberta.\n\nWe are forwarding you herewith the two files above numbered. On File 131/4-6-17, please note letter dated June 24th, 1949, by the Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch in connection with the financial standing of the contract with the Bond Construction Company Ltd., for the construction of the above-mentioned building.\n\nIt will be noted that the building is nearing completion and that the contractor's final claim will be presented for payment within the next three weeks. Under the circumstances, it may be wise to postpone transferring additional funds as requested until the final cost of the work is known.\n\nPlease return both files to this office as quickly as possible.\n\nJEB:AB\n\nEnclos.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, June 24, 1949.\n\nAttention Colonel Neary\n\nRe: Dormitory Building and Agent's Residence, Wabasca, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA contract agreement was signed between the Bond Construction Company Ltd. and the Crown on March 28, 1949 for the construction of a Dormitory and Indian Agent's Residence at Wabasca Alberta, Lesser Slave Lake Agency, on the basis of cost plus 10% fee.\n\nP.C.530 dated February 4, 1949, reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Including materials, furnished by the Department, and after providing for the Contractor's fee and unforeseen Contingencies the cost of the buildings will be approximately $150,000.00.\n\nThe last paragraph of P.C.530 reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The said total cost for the construction of the Dormitory Block and Residence for the Assistant, Indian Agency, to be met from funds provided in the 1948-49 Estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources under Vote 218 (Indian Education) and 214 (Indian Agencies) respectively.\"\n\nP.C. 530 will have to be amended for two reasons:\n\n1. The project was not completed in the 1948-49 fiscal year, and since the P.C. tied expenditures to 1948-49 estimates and Vote numbers, the new P.C. will have to...\ncorrect this detail.\n\n2. The original estimate of approximately $150,000.00 will be exceeded by more than $43,000.00\n\nEstimates and financial details follow:\n\n|                          | Agent's Residence | Dormitory Block |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 1948-49 Expenditures     | 9,500.00          | 98,283.34       |\n| Materials Purchased 1947-48 | 3,451.91         | 10,025.07       |\n| 1949-50 Estimated maximum expenditure | 4,500.00         | 68,000.00       |\n|                          | $17,451.91        | $176,308.41     |\n\nThe sum of $6,000.00 was provided by Indian Agencies to the Engineering and Construction Division to cover 1949-50 expenditures on the Assistant Indian Agent's Residence, and a surplus of at least $1,500.00 is expected.\n\nThe sum of $50,000.00 only was provided by Indian Education to the Engineering and Construction Division to cover 1949-50 expenditures on the Dormitory Block, and it will therefore be necessary to transfer an additional $18,000.00 to the Engineering and Construction Division to complete the project.\n\nMr. Taylor, Managing Director of the Bond Construction Company Ltd., gives a number of reasons for the increase in costs over the original $150,000.00 estimate, as follows:\n\n1. It was originally anticipated that only one power generating unit would be required on the basis of information available at the time. When the demands of the project were studied it was established that two units were required, which accounts for an additional cost of $4,900.00.\n\n2. The power plant was originally to have been housed in the Dormitory Block, whereas a separate powerhouse had to be built at a cost of approximately $2,500.00.\n\n3. The Contractor was not in possession of heating specifications at the time he made the original estimate. The specifications included boiler capacity for future additional buildings and two boilers had to be installed.\n4. Plumbing for the Assistant Indian Agent's Residence was not figured in the original estimate, but was later included at the request of Indian Affairs.\n\n5. Freight and transportation cost $3,500.00 more than was anticipated.\n\n6. The materials purchased in 1947-48 totalling $13,474.98 were figured in the $150,000.00 estimate in the belief that all the materials could be used. Changes in specifications, plus deterioration of 1947-48 materials in storage, made substitution by additional purchase necessary. There will be a surplus of 1947-48 materials which could not be used in the buildings, but which will be incorporated in future buildings.\n\nThe work is nearing completion, and the Contractor's Final Claim will be presented for payment within the next three weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMr. P.

The project was not completed in the 1948-49 fiscal year, and since the P.C. tied expenditures to 1948-49 estimates and Vote numbers, the new P.C. will have to correct this detail.\n\n2. The original estimate of approximately $150,000.00 will be exceeded by more than $43,000.00.\n\nEstimates and financial details follow:\n\n|                          | Agent's Residence | Dormitory Block |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| 1948-49 Expenditures     | 9,500.00          | 98,283.34      |\n| Materials Purchased 1947-48 | 3,451.91         | 10,023.07      |\n| 1949-50 Estimated maximum expenditure | 4,500.00        | 68,000.00      |\n|                          | $17,451.91        | $176,306.41    |\n\nThe sum of $6,000.00 was provided by Indian Agencies to the Engineering and Construction Division to cover 1949-50 expenditures on the Assistant Indian Agent's Residence, and a surplus of at least $1,500.00 is expected.\n\nThe sum of $50,000.00 only was provided by Indian Education to the Engineering and Construction Division to cover 1949-50 expenditures on the Dormitory Block, and it will therefore be necessary to transfer an additional $18,000.00 to the Engineering and Construction Division to complete the project.\n\nMr. Taylor, Managing Director of the Bond Construction Company Ltd., gives a number of reasons for the increase in costs over the original $150,000.00 estimate, as follows:\n\n1. It was originally anticipated that only one power generating unit would be required on the basis of information available at the time. When the demands of the project were studied it was established that two units were required, which accounts for an additional cost of $4,900.00.\n2. The power plant was originally to have been housed in the Dormitory Block, whereas a separate power house had to be built at a cost of approximately $2,500.00.\n\n3. The Contractor was not in possession of heating specifications at the time he made the original estimate. The specifications included boiler capacity for future additional buildings and two boilers had to be installed.\n\n4. Plumbing for the Assistant Indian Agent's Residence was not figured in the original estimate, but was later included at the request of Indian Affairs.\n\n5. Freight and transportation cost $3,500.00 more than was anticipated.\n\n6. The materials purchased in 1947-48 totalling $13,474.98 were figured in the $150,000.00 estimate in the belief that all the materials could be used. Changes in specifications, plus deterioration of 1947-48 materials in storage, made substitution by additional purchase necessary. There will be a surplus of 1947-48 materials which could not be used in the buildings, but which will be incorporated in future buildings.\n\nThe work is nearing completion, and the Contractor's Final Claim will be presented for payment within the next three weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nAN/HN\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nJune 13th 1949\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nWabasca C.E.

As the season is rapidly drawing in and school re-opening is just over the horizon an early reply to Mr. Davies questions would be appreciated.\n\n\"We are awaiting word re classrooms. Are old buildings going to be converted for that purpose? If the present classroom is not going to be used I would like permission to turn it into a henhouse. We certainly need some chickens but it is no use getting any until we have a place to put them into.\n\nBy looking at the plans of the present new Building you will see that no cupboards or shelves have been arranged for in any of the playrooms or dormitories nor in any of the storerooms. Staff bedrooms have clothes-closets, the kitchen is supplied with a goodly number of cupboards and drawers but nowhere else in the building. Now you will realize that there must be cupboards and shelves for children's clothes - they will not be able to simply throw them on to the floor. Who pays for this work? Where does the lumber come from? I asked Mr. Taylor of the Bond Const. Co. and he said they are not on the plans. This is urgent - as supervisors will be asking - where are the cupboards? There are no carpenters at Wabasca. Any work we had done was done...\"\nby Indians and this kind of work will not do in the New Building.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry & Cook\n\nHGC/PAL Superintendent.\n| Property          | Bosler Says | DPW       |\n|------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Boys' Residence  | $1,800.00   | $1,800.00 (No Value) |\n| Dining/Kitchen   | $6,482.64   | $6,482.64 |\n| Barn             | $1,200.00   | $1,200.00 |\n| \"Classroom\"      | $1,570.00   | Not identified |\n| Shed             | $10,482.64  | \"No Value\" $6,220.00 |\n| Girls' Residence |               | \"No Value\" $1,800.00 |\n| Laundry          |               | $392.00   |\n| Clothing Warehouse|              | $363.25   |\n| \"Warehouse\"      |               | \"No Value\" $360.00 |\n| Workshop         |               | \"No Value\" $250.00 |\n\nTotal: $13,737.92\n\nMr. Gooderham agrees with Basler but under date 28 March 47.

Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 10 AUGUST 1949\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report dated 7th July, 1949, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat under authority of an Order in Council P.C. 530, dated 4th February, 1949, an Agreement was entered into with the Bond Construction Company, Limited, of Edmonton, Alberta, for the construction of a dormitory block at the Wabasca Church of England Indian Residential School and residence for the Assiniboine Indian Agency, Wabasca Indian Reserve, Lesser Slave Lake Agency, in the Province of Alberta, on the basis of cost, plus a fee of ten percent (10%) of the finished cost of the work, which expenditures were estimated to total to approximately one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00);\n\nThat payment for the construction work embraced by the Agreement was restricted to funds provided for the purpose under Vote 218 (Indian Education) and Vote 214 (Indian Agencies) of the 1948-49 Estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources;\n\nThat the volume of work covered by the Agreement was more than could be completed by the aforementioned contractor before the termination of the 1948-49 fiscal year, and a portion of the funds provided for the work lapsed on the 31st day of March, 1949;\n\nThat the project, now nearing completion, was subject to changes in design, namely, the addition of a plumbing system in the residence, an increase in the electric power demand necessitating added accommodation, and the discovery that certain materials stored at the site were found to be unsuitable and had to be replaced, in addition to which freight, transportation and labour costs, due to the isolated location of the project, exceeded the contractor's estimate;\n\nThat to provide funds to cover the increase in costs over the contractor's estimate, as well as to replace the funds which lapsed on March 31st last, the approximate amount of forty-six thousand dollars ($46,000) will be required;\n\nThat in the opinion of the Minister it would not be in the public interest to permit operations by the contractor to be suspended due to the lapse of funds provided under the 1948-49 Estimates.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to arrange with the Bond Construction Company Limited, of Edmonton, Alberta, for continuous...\noperation to carry the work embraced by the Agreement to completion, and to make payment for such work in accordance with the terms of the existing Agreement with the said Bond Construction Company Limited, to the estimated total of forty-six thousand dollars ($46,000) from funds provided in the Estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department Of Mines and Resources, for Indian Education and Indian Agencies.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\n**TO:** Villa Furniture Co., Ltd., Cowansville, P.Q.\n\n**SHIP TO:** Rev.

I am under the impression that the light plant installed in the new building is fully automatic and requires only the pressing of a switch to start operation. If this is so, no inconvenience to the school engineer will be realized. However, if it is necessary for the school engineer to have to sit up nights so that the agency buildings may have lights, you can see that the I.S.A. will have a problem on its hands. It would be appreciated if you would have your man in the field give his findings as regards this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Residential School\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWe have requested a full report from Mr. Indian Superintendent Lapp concerning the Walk-in Refrigerator required at this school. The beds, mattresses, sheets, blankets, furniture, potato peeler, electric irons, vacuum cleaner, sewing machines, etc., have been ordered. We will advise you further concerning the refrigerator when we hear from Mr. Lapp.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nI have herewith to report that the Dormitory Building and Assistant Agent's residence was under construction by the Pond Construction Co., Ltd., at Wabasso, Alberta, were inspected on July 12th and 13th, 1949, and I have to report as follows:\n\nDormitory Building\n\n(1) This building is now practically completed, consequently, it was not possible to check the construction of the rooftops, as shown on Sheets 1 and 3 of Plan #2A. The basement walls were checked where possible and I am of the opinion that if there was any departure from the plan in this part of the building, the tendency was to build too well. The basement layout conforms to Sheet 5 of Plan #2A.\n\n(2) The first and second floors of the building have been constructed in accordance with Sheets 4 and 5 of Plan #2A. The workmanship throughout is excellent and here, as in the basement, the contractor appears to have made every effort to avoid, rather than incur, criticism. One small departure was made from the plans in the closets where a shoe shelf, not called for, was constructed above the floor level. The increase in the cost by this addition would be negligible.\n\n(3) Those features of the building shown on Sheets 6 and 7 of Plan #2A appear generally to conform with the plans.\n\n(4) The plumbing and heating as shown on Sheets P1, H1, H2 and H3 of Plan #2A had previously been inspected by Mr. Harpreeves and you have no doubt received his report in connection therewith. The departures from these plans, as noted by me, were as follows:\n\n(a) In the basement laundry room a drain was constructed for a future automatic washer and the floor drain is not located as shown on the plan. This floor drain is located much nearer to the corner of the laundry adjacent to the closet.\n\n(b) The domestic hot water tank and the pressure tank are not located in the fuel storage room as shown in the plan. These units are located in the boiler room between the stairway and the amp, the pressure tank being erected in a vertical, rather than a horizontal position.\n(c) The kitchen radiator has been placed adjacent to the wall between the kitchen and the staff dining room, rather than on the ceiling, as called for on the plan.\n\n(d) The radiator in the food storage room is 4 x 12 x 26\", not 3 x 10 x 26\" as called for on the plan.\n\n(5) The wiring of the building, and the installation of electrical fixtures appears to be in accordance with Work No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Plan No. 4A, the only apparent difference being the installation of fire alarm bells in each of the corridors near the panels. With the exception of a few light fixtures and switch box covers all electrical fixtures were installed at the time of my inspection.\n\n(6) The painting throughout the building was proceeding rapidly at the time of the inspection and is no doubt completed by this date.\n\n(7) Sewage Disposal\n\nThe construction of the 6\" pipe line from the dormitory building to the septic tank, the septic tank and the distribution piping through the disposal area had all been completed at the time of my inspection and the work appears to be in order.\n\nThe 4\" laundry line, which bypasses the septic tank, had not yet been laid however, with the change of the work I was not in agreement. The contractor, basing on the opinion that it was not advisable to carry the laundry waste directly to the disposal bed, proposed to get rid of it by carrying the 4\" laundry drain out to an excavation 10' x 10' located at the rear of the laundry drain entering the excavation hole at its bottom end at a distance of 37 feet from the foundation walls of the building. The proposal then was to fill the excavation with stone and gravel for some distance above the pipe and to carry the pipe no farther.\n\nWhile there may be some merit in endeavouring to have the conglomerate from the laundry keep away below the front line before it reaches the disposal bed, I was of the opinion that this operation could not be carried enough to prevent backing up of the laundry waste drainage through the main end into the laundry. The contractor was therefore instructed to deepen the excavation to a depth of 1 to 4 feet below the entering drain and to carry this drain on the rock and gravel bed to enter the line from the septic tank as shown on the plan.\n\n(8) Water Supply\n\nAccording to Sheet A3 of the Plan 28A, it was the intention to obtain the water supply by pumping directly from the lake. Due to the shallow depth and weedy nature...\nof the water for some considerable distance from the shore line it was felt that the source of supply might better be constructed at the pump house site, the depth of the well to be somewhat below lake level. Upon excavating for the well it was found that, due to the nature of the soil, there was no seepage from the lake into the well. A trench was therefore being excavated from the lake to the well, the trench to be back filled with rock and gravel through which the water could seep into the well. In addition the 12\" pipe, set upside, with the exception of the intake end, was to be placed in this trench at a depth below the frost line.\n\nThere appears to be no reason why this arrangement will not work and, as the work was well along, the contractor was allowed to proceed with same.\nExtract from letter from Rev. A.B. Davies, written on Aug. 17, 1949\n\nAlso in the laundry there are no electric sockets or outlet for water other than a grating on the floor. These things may seem trivial to some of these Government officials but not so to staff.\n\nRe Classrooms - Mr. Lapp informed me yesterday that the Playrooms were to be used for that purpose. That seems to be a command - so is settled. I only hope the teachers do not mind the children playing in them during the evenings - especially in winter!\n\nExtract from letter from Colin Gibson sent to Archbishop Kingston, July 4, 1949\n\nIt is not our intention to have the children use the playrooms as classrooms unless it is so recommended by your Principal.\nAugust 26, 1949.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Wabasca Residential School\n\nFurther to our conversation of 16/8/49 in reference to the above mentioned School. At that time you asked me to get information on shelving and locker needs for the new building so that you could instruct the contractor to have the necessary installations made.\n\nPrincipal Davies has now written as follows:\n\nYour letter of August 16 and 22 just received. The plane will be leaving in half an hour hence the hurried note re-shelves and cupboards. Mr. Basler and I were down to the new building to measure the rooms this morning and the following is what we would like to see built\u2014\n\nIn playrooms\u2014\nBoy's Playroom - 20 lockers (1 shelf and place to hang coats etc.) width about 1 ft.\nGirls' Playroom - 30 lockers (1 shelf and place to hang coats etc) width about 1 ft. each.\n\nBoys and Girls Dormitories\u2014\nCupboards (with shelves) 13' long x 9'2\" high x 2'\n\nIn storerooms on 2nd and 3rd floors\u2014 six shelves along one wall - 10'2\" shelf about 2' wide.\n\nStorerooms on ground floor\u2014\nSix shelves along wall which is 16' x 9'2\"\nThese should be of heavy lumber as they are to hold tin goods, etc.\nSix shelves along wall which is 8'3\" x 9'2\"\nSix shelves \" \" \" \" 11'6\" x 9'2\"\n\np.t.o.\nColonel Neary\n\nAugust 26, 1949.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this work is carried out as soon as possible so that some order may be experienced when the Principal starts to lay in his stocks of clothing and food.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nReference is made to your letter of July 29, 1949 to Mr. G. S. Lapp, Superintendent, Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency asking for further information regarding items on Mr. Lapp's requisition of June 13, 1949 for furnishings for the above building.\n\nPlease be advised as follows with respect to the points raised:\n\nTwo oven hotel range - intended for WOOD.\n\nWalk-in Refrigerator - The size of the room which is to hold this Refrigerator is 11' 9\" by 16' 0\". The ceiling is 9' 1\" high. A set of pipes runs through the room lengthwise 7' 2\" from the floor and 10' from one wall. Thus it will be seen that there is a clear space to the full height of the ceiling, i.e., 16' 0\" before interference from the pipes would be encountered. This space is completely clear of the door which is placed in one corner of the room. The door will allow pieces 2' 7\" by 6' 7\" to pass through. The electrical power unit in use is an International \"Ready Power\" diesel generator, 18 KW, 120/208 Volts, Phase, 60 cycle, 4 wire. Serial Nos. R-10544 and R-10545 (there are two identical units).\n\nIt is regretted that no catalogues are available here and that, for this reason, no catalogue numbers can be supplied.\n\nMedium Bread mixer - No catalogues available. Any firm dealing in electric appliances can supply this mixer which will be satisfactory if it operates on any 110 Volt alternating current.\n\nElectric mixer for powdered milk - No catalogues available. Any mixer suitable for use with 110 Volt alternating current will be satisfactory.\n\nHot water Urn - Capacity 4 to 6 gallons. No catalogue available - can be purchased from any firm dealing in electrical supplies (when available).\n\nIn order to reduce delays to a minimum I am sending you this information direct with copies to Mr. G. H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor at Calgary and to Mr. G. S. Lapp, Superintendent at High Prairie, Alta. for their information.\n\nL. Basler,\nAsst. Indian Agent,\nWabasca, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Dormitory Building, Power House,\nPump House, Agent's Residence,\nIndian Residential School,\nWabasso, Alberta.\n\nWe wish to advise that the final inspection of the above buildings has been made by Engineer Ferrie and that he has accepted them on behalf of the Department from the Bond Construction Company Limited. A copy of the Certificate of Completion is attached hereto.\n\nIn addition, we are attaching an inventory of the materials and supplies on hand at the building site on completion of the work. The items covered by the inventory have been placed in the charge of Mr. Basler, Assistant, Indian Agency, and he has signed for same. This material will be required from time to time at the Agency, and it is recommended that it be left there for Departmental use.\n\nCertain other items were removed from the site by the contractor, and Mr. J.L. Villeneuve, the Job Auditor, is compiling a list of these items and will arrange with the contractor for the payment to the Department for same.\n\nEach building is securely locked and the keys for all doors are in the possession of Mr. Basler.\n\nIt is recommended that arrangements for the occupancy of the dormitory and the residence should be made without delay in order that they may be maintained in the present excellent condition.

The items covered by the inventory have been placed in the charge of Mr. Basler, Assistant, Indian Agency, and he has signed for same. This material will be required from time to time at the Agency, and it is recommended that it be left there for Departmental use.\n\nCertain other items were removed from the site by the contractor, and Mr. J.L.

As Mr. Basler lives quite some distance away from the new buildings and the fact he has many other duties to perform it is just impossible for him to maintain a close watch on them.\n\nWe are today in receipt of the following telegram from Mr. Basler:\n\n\"PLEASE ADVISE AUTHORITY MAINTAINING WATCHMAN TO AGENCY PROPERTY AND DORMITORY TO OCCUPY AT $2.00 PER DAY HAS BEEN EMPLOYED SINCE AUGUST SIXTEENTH.\"\n\nThis office has replied as follows:\n\n\"AUTHORITY GRANTED TO EMPLOY WATCHMAN AT TWO DOLLARS PER DAY.\"\n\nIf this arrangement does not meet with the approval of the Department please advise with instructions as to what should be done to protect the buildings until such time as they are occupied.\n\nG.S. Lapp\nSuperintendent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Wabasca Indian Residential School,\nDormitory Building\n\nOttawa, September 10, 1949.\n\nOur letter of June 24th contained detailed explanations justifying increases in the cost of constructing the Dormitory Building at Wabasca. The Contractor's original estimate for the cost of constructing the Dormitory Building and the Assistant Indian Agent's Residence was $120,000.00 including materials purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch during the 1947-48 fiscal year in the amount of $13,474.98. Mr. Taylor of the Bond Construction Company gave us a revised estimate on June 17th which indicated that the cost of constructing the Dormitory Building alone, not including the materials purchased during 1947-48 by the Indian Affairs Branch, would total $166,000.00. Since construction was nearing completion we felt that the Contractor's estimate should be an accurate one, and a request was made in our letter of June 24th for an additional $18,000.00.\n\nFinal expenditure figures were received from Mr. Taylor August 31st by telephone, and we learned that the Contractor's June estimate of $166,000.00 for the Dormitory Building (exclusive of materials purchased by Indian Affairs Branch) was too low by $24,000.00. Financial requirements for 1949-50 will therefore total $92,000.00, as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Amount     |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 1949-50 voted allotment                   | $50,000.00 |\n| Additional requested June 24th            | $18,000.00 |\n| Additional requested this date            | $24,000.00 |\n| Total 1949-50 requirements                | $92,000.00 |\n| 1948-49 expenditures                      | $98,283.34 |\n| Total cost of Dormitory Building exclusive of materials purchased in 1947-48 | $190,283.34 |\n\nD.M.

It is now Government property and Mr. Basler and yourself, as our representatives of that district, are responsible for its proper protection. You should assure yourself that the watchman now employed is fully competent and will carry out all instructions given to him either by you or by Mr. Basler. If you consider it necessary to employ a different man, you should so advise us, stating the rate per day you consider he should be paid.\nI discussed the situation at Wabosco with the Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., this morning, and apparently they have no intention of taking over the building until all the furnishings arrive. No doubt you have received copies of Purchase Orders 48233, 48234, 48235 and 48236. We are writing to the firms concerned today and requesting them to make delivery at the earliest possible date. You should have the Station Agent at Slave Lake notify you as soon as the goods arrive, so that you may make arrangements for their delivery to the school.\n\nWe received yesterday Mr. Basler's letter of August 25th, a copy of which was forwarded to you. The items mentioned in this letter will be ordered through the Departmental Purchasing Agent, and he is being requested to obtain one 2-oven hotel range at the earliest possible date.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter dated August 26th received from the M.S.C.C., with reference to cupboards and shelving that we understand were not placed in the building. Please let us know by wire if any of the materials which were left at Wabosco by the Bond Construction Company, and which are in the charge of Mr. Basler, could be used for building these cupboards and lockers. If so, the material should be used for that purpose.\n\nIf none of the material is suitable, or if there is not a sufficient quantity of it, you should let us know by wire if you can obtain it locally, and if so, at what price and also the name and address of the firm from whom purchase can be made. You should also let us know the cost of labour to build and install the lockers, cupboards and shelves.\n\nWe will expect you to give the matters mentioned in this letter your immediate attention. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Basler, so that he may have our views on the matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential School\n\nReference is made to your telegram of September 23rd and\nto your letter of the same date, file 767-5 (E.1).\n\nIt is noted that the architect stated that neither heating\nplant nor lighting plant should be operated until the building is\ntaken over by the principal or the school. You will note paragraphs\nfour and six of Mr. Basler's letter, copy of which was attached to\nour letter of September 16th, state that the heating and power plants\nand water pump will soon be in danger of serious damage from frost.\nIt might be noted that the temperature in High Prairie at 7:30 a.m.\ntoday was 22 degrees F. and since Wabasca is further north the\ntemperature may well have been lower.

A. L. Davies, about the lighting plant and fuel oil supply there.\n\nIf the fuel consumption is as heavy as anticipated, the operation of this plant is going to be an expensive item when freighting charges from Slave Lake to Wabasca are considered. It seems unfortunate that a battery plant was not provided instead of the A.C. plant that was supplied because then the engine would only have to be run for charging the battery, operating pumping plant, laundry equipment, etc., all of which could be done during a comparatively short period each day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School,\nWabasca, Alberta.\n\n27/9/49\n\nThe Rev. Canon Cook, D.D.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nRe: Fuel Oil\n\nWe have just received nineteen barrels of oil from the Imperial Oil Ltd., Edmonton, there is one more barrel due. Freighter informed me that no more oil can be got unless we send out empty barrels. This is impossible as we have no storage tank and will require a large amount during the winter freighting season. What is to be done about the barrel situation? Can you get satisfaction from your end?\n\nThe twenty barrels of oil will not last more than one month if real-long - if the engine is to run 24 hours a day. It is not an automatic engine as the Government authorities thought it to be. To turn it on or off has to be done in the power engine room which is outside the main building. If Mr. Basler is to receive lights from us - then we cannot close off the engine any earlier than 1 a.m. If the engine is turned off then the fire alarm will be useless at night. I believe you said in an earlier letter that the Government would be making enquiries through their local agent about this.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is - more oil will be required before winter freight rates come into operation. Have I the authority to order what is needed to hold out until winter? Then place an order for our year supply with the Imperial Oil Co. What of the barrel situation - we shall need a large number - quite expensive I think - holding the barrels at $8.00 each,\n\nWould the Department not be interested in supplying a large storage tank then we could have an oil truck come out when the road was suitable in midwinter?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) A. L. Davies\nOttawa, September 30, 1949.\n\nMajor Mackay\n\nRe - Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential School\n\nReplying to your memorandum of yesterday's date, may I confirm the opinion which I telephoned to your secretary as follows:\n\n\"Heating system should be drained today and left so until competent man is available - Class IV Stationary Engineer required immediately to operate heating system.

Lap, Superintendent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nWabasca, Alta.,\nSept. 2, 1949.\n\nMr. G. S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nLesser Slave Lake Indian Agency,\nHIGH PRAIRIE, ALTA.\n\nRe: New Indian Residential Dormitory,\nWabasca, Alta.\n\nAs you are aware the new dormitory at Wabasca has now been completed and is awaiting the official turn-over to the Anglican Mission for their use.\n\nMr. Davies, Principal of the C. of E. School here has advised me that he does not intend to move into this building until it has been provided with shelves and cupboards and until all furnishings have been provided. He has also intimated that his Mission does not think it wise to send an engineer until the building is ready for operation in every respect. As you know furnishings and equipment for this building are on requisition and negotiations are also in progress with respect to having shelves and cupboards installed. However, due to unavoidable routine delays, these supplies are very slow in reaching here and the first load of freight for this building is only now enroute from Slave Lake to Wabasca by horse team.\n\nMr. Davies is currently having the old buildings put into condition for the opening of the Fall school term and for the housing of the children and by the time this report reaches you school will have commenced in the old buildings. It appears certain that the new building will not be taken into use until after the beginning of winter and I do not anticipate that it will be occupied before Christmas once school has opened in the old buildings.\n\nIt may not be fully realised in our headquarters that this situation requires very early attention as it is of the greatest importance that the building be operated, even if not occupied, before it begins to freeze. It should be pointed out that the water system throughout the building is now full of water. The boilers and tanks also contain water. The radiators in the power plant engine room are also filled with water and there is a serious danger of damage to the water pump on the lake front unless heat is provided before frosty weather sets in.\n\nAs it is certain that the building will not be fully equipped and ready for the C. of E. to assume responsibility of it before heavy frosts set in it becomes necessary for the Department to send in a man to fire it in order to protect it against possible serious damage from frost. Sufficiently heavy frosts to damage the system in the building may be expected next month.\n\nI have examined the water and heating systems in the building to see whether I could drain all the water out of it in the event of early frosts becoming dangerous but I can not see how they can be completely drained to avoid all danger of damage through freezing if no heat is provided.\n\nI should endeavour to make it very clear that Mr. Davies has emphasized the point that he will not assume responsibility until the building is completely ready for occupancy.\n\nL.

He also suggests that you interview Cannon Cook who apparently has an engineer by the name of Mr. Ede at Wabasca now.\n\nUpon receipt of your wire of September 30th, I wrote to Mr. Patterson, District Representative of the Civil Service Commission at Edmonton, asking if he could refer us to any unemployed Stationary Engineers Class 4.

Battle\n\nWe wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 30th concerning the employment of a Stationary Engineer or Fireman for the Wabasca Church Residential School.\n\nWe are being very much pressed for Stationary Engineers these days and already have five unfilled vacancies with the Department of National Defence in the North West Staging Route. We do not feel that it will be possible for us to give you much assistance at this time in this respect. However, should you wish to obtain the services of a man with a 50 H.P. Stationary Engineer's certificate or a Fireman's Certificate I would suggest that you contact Mr. Wm. Carnill, Manager of the Local Office of the Unemployment Insurance Commission at Edmonton, giving details of your requirements. The salary which we pay for Stationary Engineers Grade 1 which is the highest category which we would recommend for this position, is $1980 to $2280 per annum. The Department of National Defence pays its Fireman at the rate of $1620 per annum.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) C. R. Patterson\n\nCOPY\nOctober 5, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. W.J.F.

As you are aware, the lighting plant installed in the school was intended to provide light for Mr. Basler's office.\n\nWe are simply bringing this matter to your attention at the present time as no expenditure will be necessary now.\n\nThe M.S.C.C. has decided not to take over the building until all the equipment is received, and as a consequence, the Lands & Development Services Branch instructed us to have the heating system drained and left so until a competent man is available to operate it.\n\nBernard F.

Residential School.\n\nCanon Cook of the M.S.C.C. has had a discussion with the Superintendent of Education concerning the lighting plant installed in the dormitory building newly erected at the above school.\n\nCanon Cook has requested that the present A.C. plant be replaced with a D.C. plant for the following reasons:\n\n1. FUEL CONSUMPTION.\n\nThe following are the estimates outlining the cost of supplying fuel oil to the school based on two separate hours per diem rates of operation:\n\n(a) Based on 16 hours a day operation; annual requirement 8,000 gal.\n\nWinter rates of transport 2s pound\n# Bbls. to be transported 178\nCost of transport = 178 X 480 X 2s = 1,708.80\nHandling charge at Slave Lake 15c cwt. 128.00\nCost of fuel 20s gal. 8000 X 20s 1,600.00\nRental of drums 178 X $8.00 = 1,424.00\nReturn freight on drums $4.00 712.00\nLoss on drums annually 712.00\n\n$4,148.80\n\n(b) If plant has to operate 24 hours daily add 1/3\n\n1,382.70\n\n$5,531.50\nFrom the above figures it will be seen that an expenditure of at least $5,500.00 will be required annually to supply diesel fuel at this school. Yet, there is only a pupilage of 60 with the present per capita rate of $415.00 meaning a total income of $24,900.00. Therefore the cost of supplying fuel oil alone will take up approximately one third of the grant given to this school.\n\n2. LABOUR COSTS\n\nAn A.C. plant will require operation for a period of 24 hours per day in order to maintain the fire alarm and sprinkler systems. Therefore at least three men will be required in shifts to check on the machine.\n\nOn the other hand, a D.C. plant need only be operated for a period of eight hours per day and one man only will be required to operate it.\n\n3. Ease OF OPERATION\n\nIt is natural therefore that the strain on the machine will be much less with a D.C. plant than with an A.C. plant. Repair and maintenance costs will be lower.\n\n4. STEEL RENTALS\n\nWith the isolated location of the school a low estimate of the amount tied up in the rental of barrels will be at least $600.00 continually. This can naturally be reduced greatly by the substitution of a D.C. system.\n\nDirector.\nCosts of supplying diesel fuel, Wabasca\n\n(a) Based on 16 hours a day operation; annual requirement 8,000 gal.\n\nWinter rates of transport 2\u00a2 pound\n# Bible to be transported 178\nCost of transport = 178 X 480 X 2\u00a2 = 1,708.80\nHandling charge at Slave Lake 15\u00a2 cwt. 128.00\nCost of fuel 20\u00a2 gal 8000 X 20\u00a2 = 1,600.00\nRental of drums 178 X $2.00 = 1424.00\nReturn freight on drums $4.00 712.00\nLoss on drums annually 712.00\n$4,148.80\n\n(b) If plant has to operate 24 hours daily add 1/3\n\nplus cost of extra worker\nplus having at least $600 tied up in steel rentals.\n\nReplace DC plant instead of AC plant\n3 reasons:\na.

E. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Wabasca Church of England Residential School\nYour file 767-5 (E)\n\nWe recently received a letter from the Regional Superintendent of Indian Health Services in which he asked if his Department could use some surplus materials left over at the new dormitory at Wabasca to carry out some badly needed repairs to the nurses' residence there. We wrote to the Bond Construction Co. and Mr. Taylor very kindly supplied us with a list of the surplus materials.\n\nThe Department of National Health and Welfare specifically request asbestos roofing, wall board, insulation, common lumber and flooring. Since freight rate out of Wabasca is 5\u00a2 per lb., it would be most uneconomical to transfer any of these materials for use elsewhere. Health and Welfare would no doubt agree to pay for any materials they might use at the laid down cost at Wabasca.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that they be allowed to use whatever materials they require with Mr. Basler keeping a record so that the voucher can be issued to transfer the charge from Vote 516 to Vote 513.\n\nG.

Ltd., has completed the above noted projects, and the final Progress Claim is expected daily. We requested an additional $18,000.00 on June 24th for the Dormitory Building, and a further amount of $24,000.00 on September 10th. An encumbrance for $19,000.00 was received on Monday, leaving a balance of $23,000.00 to come. There is an unpaid balance of $3,722.79 on Progress Claim No.6, and Progress Claim No.7 for $16,399.86 is also unpaid, awaiting the receipt of additional funds.\n\nP.C.530 dated February 4th, 1949, states that materials were purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch in 1947-48 and delivered to site in the following amounts:\n\nDormitory Block $10,023.07\nAssistant Agent's Residence 3,451.91\n\nWe require separate inventories covering materials purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch for the two buildings to arrive at a final settlement with the Contractor.\n\nR A Gibson.\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\n\nAN/HN\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Wabaseca Indian Residential School,\nDormitory Building\n\nOur letter of June 24th contained detailed explanations justifying increases in the cost of constructing the Dormitory Building at Wabaseca. The Contractor's original estimate for the cost of constructing the Dormitory Building and the Assistant Indian Agent's Residence was $150,000.00 including materials purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch during the 1947-48 fiscal year in the amount of $13,474.98. Mr. Taylor of the Bond Construction Company gave us a revised estimate on June 26th which indicated that the cost of constructing the Dormitory Building alone, not including materials purchased during 1947-48 by the Indian Affairs Branch, would total $166,000.00. Since construction was nearing completion we felt that the Contractor's estimate should be an accurate one, and a request was made in our letter of June 24th for an additional $18,000.00.\n\nFinal expenditure figures were received from Mr. Taylor August 1st by telephone and we learned that the Contractor's June estimate of $166,000.00 for the Dormitory Building (exclusive of materials purchased by Indian Affairs Branch) was too low by $24,000.00. Financial requirements for 1949-50 will therefore total $92,000.00, as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Amount     |\n|-------------------------------|------------|\n| 1949-50 voted allotment      | $50,000.00 |\n| Additional requested June 24th| $18,000.00 |\n| Additional requested this date| $24,000.00 |\n| Total 1949-50 Requirements    | $92,000.00 |\n| 1948-49 expenditures          | $98,283.34 |\n| Total cost of Dormitory Building, exclusive of materials purchased in 1947-48 | $190,283.34 |\n\nOrder in Council P.C. 3956 dated August 10, 1949, will have to be amended for authority to spend the additional funds required to complete the Dormitory Building.\n\nDirector,\n\nD.M.

Buck, Chief Architect,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nWabasega C., of E. Residential School -\nDormitory Block.\n\nMr. Taylor, the contractor, was in my office yesterday and no doubt will be visiting you with regard to this project.\n\nAs you are aware, we are anxious to help the M. S. C. C. by arranging for as small a consumption of fuel oil as possible. Mr. Taylor made the suggestion that a stationary pump be installed at the school to replace the present system. He feels that the engine is running a great deal of the time just to provide power for the present pump.\n\nHe also feels that this will eliminate the need for an extra engineer.\n\nI appreciate the absence of Mr. Kosner from town but would ask you to discuss this matter with him when he returns.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Residential School - Your File 131-4B-2\n\nWith reference to the above, we have had an interview recently with Canon Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., and it is likely that the Church of England will take over this school within a short time.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter we would like to receive as soon as possible, Mr. Lapp's estimate of the quantity of diesel fuel that will be required yearly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nCOPY\n\nTHE INDIAN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION\n\nOttawa, Oct. 28, 1949.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Fuel Costs at Wabasca New Building\n\nIn reference to our telephone conversation of the morning of 27/10/49 the following night letter has been despatched to Principal Davies:\n\n\"Satisfactory arrangement now reached with Indian Affairs Branch regarding diesel fuel costs stop if all else satisfactory to you authority given to establish in new building stop letter following.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Henry G. Cook\nSuperintendent.\n\nfor File 767-5\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Dormitory Building, Webasca Indian Residential School, Alberta.\n\nReplying to your marginal notation of the 13th instant, on Major MacKay's memorandum to you dated October 11th last in connection with safety precautions to the mechanical services at the above, you are advised that the action taken by Supervisor Gooderham is satisfactory.\n\nYou have been previously advised that so far as construction is concerned, Supervising Engineer Perrie of our Regina office, has certified that the building has been completed in accordance with the design prepared by this office and has been accepted on behalf of the Department and turned over to the local Indian Superintendent.\n\nIn addition to the above however, we have received Major MacKay's memorandum of October 6th which carried your notation of the 13th instant, and in which is set out an analysis of cost by Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C. for operation of the installed lighting plant. Canon Cook is endeavouring to convince the Indian Affairs Branch that it would be advantageous to replace the existing alternating current plant which has now been placed in operation, with a direct current unit due to the cost of fuel oil required for operation.\n\nThe type of unit installed at the school was not decided on before the demands of the present building and future extensions had been studied and approval of the Indian Affairs Branch obtained. In view of the reported urgent need for the accommodation provided by the Dormitory Building, it is considered inadvisable to consider any immediate revisions to the lighting plant.\n\nWe are satisfied that the best interests of the institution will be served by the operation of the unit now in place. Nevertheless, when Mr. Kozmar returns from his western inspection trip, we will have him contact both Canon Cook and the Director of Indian Affairs and have a full report submitted to you on the matter.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Wabasca Church of England School.\n\nFurther to wires and correspondence regarding the water system in the new classroom block at the above school.\n\nIt is understood that the school will not be accepted for use until it is entirely completed. Mr. Lapp informed that he supplied prices for materials for cupboards but has had no answer to his wire of September 30th.\n\nI am told that there is some very expensive equipment in this block particularly the lighting plant.\n\nIt seems impossible to locate a qualified stationary engineer and unless someone has been found, I think we should employ Mr. Ede right away.\n\nUnfortunately the Assistant, Mr. Basler's house is connected to the new dormitory water and lighting system; he is, therefore, without water and light and will continue to be without these facilities until the school system is operating.\n\nMr. Lapp is obtaining prices for wood and diesel fuel and these will be submitted as soon as possible.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nDecember 17, 1949.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThe following extracts from a letter recently received from Principal Davies might be of interest.\n\n\"At long last I am able to report that we are in the new building. In spite of the cold weather outside we are very comfortable.\"\n\n\"We have had no further word re carpenter coming to put in shelves, lockers, etc.\"\n\n\"Our laundry is minus many things. No place to empty the water. No electric washing machines. No place to 'plug in' electric irons - just an empty room with four water taps. Washing machines were asked for - but all we got so far are - 3 electric irons and 1 ironer.\"\n\n\"Our first fuel check on Electric Motors reveals that we shall use about 2 barrel fuel oil per day. However we are giving it another week's trial before making a final report. I have ordered another fifty barrels of Fuel Oil and as soon as we are fairly certain as to quantity needed I shall order the remainder in order to get it in on winter rates.\"\n\nCould you please let me know if anything is to be done about the various shortages and pieces of equipment mentioned in Mr. Davies letter?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G.

This has now been corrected and authority to purchase having been received, the order was placed with the company on the 28th of September.\n\nThe provision of the necessary A.C. motors, has, however, suffered from misunderstandings. Correspondence in this connection appears as follows:\n\n1. General Turner's letter of March 31st, 1950.\n2. Col. Neary's reply of April 3rd, 1950.\n3. Mr. Lapp's letter of April 8th, in which he indicates that \"arrangements were made\", but they do not seem to have been finalized.\n4. Mr. Gooderham's letter of April 11th, which is merely a repetition of Mr. Lapp's letter.\n5. The School's requisition of August 15th, itemizing the motors required. The page on which these motors are described is not to be found in the Purchasing Agent's office.\nMy reading of the requisition satisfies me that no arrangements were made heretofore to have D.C. motors replaced with motors necessary to operate the machinery by the present electrical system.\n\nA requisition for the motors is, accordingly, required by the Purchasing Agent if it is intended that this equipment is to be supplied.\n\nC.A.F.

There was considerable correspondence at that time with Mr. W.W. Perrie, Supervising Engineer, Dept. of Resources and Development at Regina. When the pipe was laid it was impossible to get it below the frost level because the lake is shallow for a considerable distance from the water's edge.\n\nThere is no doubt that freezing will recur and some effort must be made to correct the situation. I am attaching copy of a letter received from the Assistant Agent at Wabasca, Mr. Basler, to which he attaches a sketch indicating quite clearly where the trouble is.\n\nIt is my suggestion that you authorize the expenditure of around $200.00 to deepen the present pipe level this Fall when the water in the lake is at its lowest level. If this work can be completed and if the line does not freeze this winter we shall have been successful. However, if the line freezes again I believe we should try to carry out the work suggested by Mr. Basler.\n\nThe only other alternative to either of these two plans is to send an Engineer in to Wabasca this summer.\n\nfor: G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRFE/lo\nAtts.\n\nc.c. Mr. Lapp\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nWabasca, Alta.,\nJuly 22, 1950.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapin,\nSuperintendent,\nLesser Slave Lake Indian Agency,\nHIGH PARK, Alta.\n\nRe: Water Supply-Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential School\n\n1. Reference your letter of June 30, 1950, dealing with the above.\n\n2. In order to make any reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of labour and materials required to ensure an uninterrupted flow of water to the dormitory on the C.E. Indian Residential School site it would be necessary to know what filter or system you have in mind. The principle of the system now in use is a filter bed near the well on the shore to which is attached an iron pipe carrying water into deep water. It was easy enough to make the filter bed deep enough but to get the pipe down to a depth of seven feet, which would be the minimum, its entire length presented the difficult problem. This was due to the fact that, for a considerable distance, the lake bottom had to be pitched under water. In order to achieve a depth of seven feet from bottom of the lake level it would have been necessary to work under water in a depth that rendered work impossible. To have the filter bed of sufficient depth and the lake end of the pipe in deep water is of little use when, for some distance in between, the pipe is elevated to a point where frost will reach it. The freezing of this pipe along its high point was anticipated by all concerned including the contractor's foreman. This difficulty remains and cannot be overcome unless a dragline is used on a breakwater built around the site of operation. None of these methods would involve prohibitive expense. For that reason I do not see how the present system can be made to work unless the Department is prepared to send in underwater equipment.\n\n3. Having measured the depth of the lake at various distances from shore and surveyed the nature of the lake bottom, I would suggest that a satisfactory ditch could be dug immediately prior to the break-up next Spring when the frost has reached its maximum depth. This would require the use of an electric jack hammer power for which can be brought to the site without difficulty. By digging a series of holes through the ice the point where the ice touches the lake bottom could readily be found. Between this point and the well on shore it should be possible to work to a depth of eight feet and to make a satisfactory filter bed. A sump pump could be used to take care of any drainage that might accumulate while the ditch is being dug. At the point where the lake ice had reached the lake bottom and continued into the ground a natural breakwater would be formed. When the ditch and filter bed are completed the barrier formed by the ice touching the lake bottom could be opened and the water allowed to rush into the ditch and, while doing so, create its own permanent channel. The ditch would be deep enough to allow for the accumulation of dirt carried into it by the flow of water on its way to the well.\n\n4. As a tentative date by which to be guided in making plans for this work I would say that everything should be ready to start work on March 15th.\n6. I would estimate that labour requirements for this job as follows:\n\nFour local helpers 8 days at $5.00 each - $160.00\nTwo operators equipped with jack hammer and sump pump 8 days at $10.00 - 160.00\nIncidental local expenses such as use of horses for hauling gravel to the site and hauling away diggings, etc. - 50.00\n\nTo the above would have to be added the cost of transporting two men from Edmonton with their equipment and returning them.\n\nAll materials required would be available from left-overs from the dormitory construction job.\n\n7. This work would make it necessary to interrupt the flow of water to the dormitory for only a few days, if at all, as the well could be filled up to the intake before work is commenced. It is probable, however, that the flow would by that time have already stopped due to natural causes.\n\n8. Please find attached a sketch intended to illustrate the working of this plan.\n\n9. I have given this problem very much thought and have discussed it with others and I am of the opinion that this plan is the only one that can be made to work.\n\n10. If it is intended to simply deepen the present pipe-level the work should be undertaken during the late Fall when the water level is somewhat lower. In this case the cost would probably only be around $200.00 but it should be noted that the original crew was unable to sink the pipe to the required depth because of the interference by water and that any other crew could probably do no better.\n\nL.

Residential School.\n\nWe have appointed a qualified engineer and he is anxious to have these plans for checking on the electrical and heating lines.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, 4 August, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Allan:\n\nWARASCA C.E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nReference is made to your letter of the 31st of July relative to the above.\n\nIt is on record that the Contractor did not follow our plan with reference to the waste line from the laundry. Instead of connecting the laundry drain to the field disposal bed, by-passing the septic tank enroute, he was permitted to construct a rock pit to which the laundry waste line was discharged. An effluent line from this rock pit was taken and connected into the disposal field by-passing the septic tank.\n\nWe understand from a report sent in by our field engineer that this rock pit was partially filled with gravel and stone. Under these circumstances undoubtedly some of this debris has blocked the incoming line, which has resulted in the backing up of waste products into the laundry.\n\nTo alleviate this condition the rock pit should be cleaned out and no gravel, rock or earth debris put back in. The incoming drain line to this rock pit will also have to be rodded and cleaned.\n\nThe specification states that the water lines must be laid below frost line. Since two pipe lines are reported to have frozen, it is evident that this precaution was not taken.\n\nD.J. Allan, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nBooth Building, 165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nUnder the terms of the specification, the Contractor was called upon to guarantee his work for a period of one year after the date of acceptance by the Department. He was required to make good or replace any defects arising in his work during that period at his own expense as soon as possible after having been notified in writing that such defect had occurred.\n\nSince the final inspection was made on the 15th and 16th of August, 1949, on which basis the work was accepted, it is felt that the Contractor should be advised of the discrepancies which have arisen and requested to correct the trouble immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

You will note that it provides for a combination living and dining room with three bedrooms. For a principal with a small family, the downstairs bedroom can be used as a dining room. I would appreciate your advice as to whether this would be a satisfactory building for erection at Wabasca.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nJuly 11, 1950.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWhen I saw you the other day I mentioned that I'd get in touch again regarding the new building at Wabasca. The following quotes from the report of my recent visit might form a basis for a discussion on the situation. Especially as it has been proposed that a similar building might do for the Yukon.\n\nNew Building - In very good condition inside and out and shows little evidence of having been used all winter. However there are many faults with the building most of which ought to be corrected as soon as possible:\n\n(a) Children's dining room overcrowded with 42 pupils.\n\n(b) Both dorms. dangerously crowded - solution might be 12 double deckers in each.\n\n(c) No pantry in kitchen.\n\n(d) Kitchen very hot - no air circulation possible because of window - fan ought to be installed.\n\n(e) Laundry room inadequate - only one small floor drain for water disposal - no laundry tubs though taps fitted for same - no wall outlets for hand irons, no place to dry clothes during cold weather in whole building.\n\n(f) No fire fighting equipment in building.\n\n(g) No locker space in dorms or playrooms -(Lapp held money earmarked for labor on shelves and lockers but sent it back to Ottawa end of March - materials thought to be at Slave Lake though Lapp done nothing, apparently, about getting delivery at Wabasca.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 5)\nColonel Neary  \nJuly 11, 1950.\n\n(h) Septic tank giving trouble - only 2 tubs of water can be drained before sewage backs up into laundry. School engineer figures that trouble due to septic tank being in heavy clay and therefore not sufficient drain-off. Septic tank at east end of school in clay soil - west end of school of gravel and sand - so much so that the contractor increased the width of the foundation footings. Septic tank would have been better placed at west end.\n\n(i) Pump - located in building roughly 30 feet from lake's edge in winter time intake between lake and pumphouse froze and school had to haul water. Basler's residence is supposed also to get water from same system and the line to his residence is still frozen.\n\nNote - Bond Construction man was supposed to be at Wabasca over a week ago to look into pump situation but at time of my visit had not arrived.)\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThe Beatty ironer is not set up as D.C. motors were supplied. Davies claimed A.C. were asked for and the error was made by Ottawa I.D. not he and Basler.\n\nLarge kitchen range received a few days before my visit - not installed as yet as a window - (sash and frame) has to be removed to get range in building.\n\nEngineer wants full set of blueprints of building specifically showing electrical, sewage and water plans - Ottawa I.D. ought to be able to supply these.\n\nDiesels require change of oil filters every hundred hours of operation - has enough on hand until February 1/51.\n\nClassroom - Last winter classes were held in a small, ill-lighted, cold log building. Davies claims that is why Miss Thompson would not go back and why Mrs. Dauphin left - the classroom facilities were so inadequate. He proposes to use the ground floor of Unit B - partitions removed and more windows added to E and S walls. This is a good plan but really the I.D.'s responsibility.\n\nRoothouse - No winter storage available for potatoes, turnips or carrots. Last winter much produce froze in the cellars of the unused houses even though fires were maintained. A good root cellar could be dug into the side of a hill 100 yards from school.\n\nPlayground - No level spot near the new building for a playground. Rish could be cleared and ground smoothed out if I.D. bear costs. Davies has put up some swings for the girls near the school.\n\np.t.o.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nJuly 11, 1950.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nFile: 768-5\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Wabasca C.E.

Both Mr. Basler and Principal Davies were sure it was for St. John's School. Upon arriving back in Ottawa I found information awaiting me from Principal Davies that the refrigerator was not for St. John's but for the Roman Catholic Residential School in the area.\n\nIt will readily be seen that the need for such refrigeration is just as urgent and necessary at the Anglican School as at the Roman School a few miles away and it would be appreciated if Indian Affairs would supply such refrigeration at an early date.\n\nA further letter on my visit to Wabasca will be forthcoming when I've had time to clear my desk a little.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office\n\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa\n\nRe: Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential School\n\nReference is made to your letter of March 16th, 1950, file 767-5 (E).\n\nThe classroom now in use at the Wabasca C.E. School is item No. 9, workshop. This is a small log building that is completely inadequate for use as a classroom. It is poorly lighted, has a low ceiling and the limited space prohibits activity. This building should never again be used as a classroom.\n\nUntil such time as a two-classroom block can be constructed, item No. 4, dining room and kitchen, could be used as a temporary classroom if alterations and repairs were made. It would require the installation of windows and moving of partitions. The necessary materials are on hand at Wabasca. The estimated cost of labor is $250.00, and in addition the carpenter would require transportation by air from Edmonton and return.\n\nWhen the carpenter is at Wabasca he could also construct the lockers and shelves for the dormitory, your file 767-5 (E) of February 12, at a cost of labor of $225.00.\n\nMay we please be provided with an accountable advance of $475.00 for labor and may authority be given to hire a carpenter and transport him by air to Wabasca.\n\nG.S.

However as the new building is equipped with a highly automatic A.C. electrical plant his qualifications do not suffice and we are searching now for an engineer qualified to look after the equipment.\n\nOur problem is cost. Two applications recently have been received from qualified men but one requires $225 monthly with keep and the other $60 weekly in the way of salary. You'll immediately see how impossible it is for the Administration to pay such salaries. I feel strongly that if the government places fully automatic equipment in these northern schools some adjustment ought to be made in per capita grants to allow us to pay qualified men or, failing that, the government assume the responsibility of supplying its own engineers to look after its intricate machinery.\n\nIf one may be permitted a pious hope it is that when Indian Affairs Branch has its own engineering branch it will install the simplest of equipment in its northern schools.\n\nIn the meantime we are continuing the search for a better qualified engineer for Wabasca.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G.

Indian Residential School\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of March 31st and my reply of April 3rd with reference to the electrical equipment at the above school. The following information has been received from our Indian Superintendent:\n\n\"Although an A.C. power plant was installed at the C.E. School, Wabasca, during the summer of 1949 the principal continued in September to forward requisitions to this office in which he asked for D.C. equipment in the school. Arrangements were made through this office to have the D.C. motors on the electric washing machines replaced by A.C. motors but a great deal of trouble continues to be experienced due to the fact that the person in charge of the power plant and electrical equipment is not a qualified engineer. The power plant is a very sensitive and complicated machine and its workings are beyond the comprehension of Mr. Ede who holds the position of engineer. If a competent engineer is not hired it seems inevitable that the expensive equipment will be damaged.\"\nIt is hoped that the M.S.C.C. will be able to arrange at an early date to have a competent engineer for the Wabasca C.E. School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nApril 19th, 1950.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM. S. C.

Until such time as the M.S.C.C. can obtain a competent engineer to supervise the handling of their equipment at Wabasca, I think they can expect to continue to experience difficulties.\n\nG.H.

Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Electrical Equipment - nabasca C.E.\nResidential School\n\nAttached please find copies of letters received here today from Col. Neary.\n\nAlthough an A.C. power plant was installed at the C.E. School, nabasca, during the summer of 1949 the principal continued in September to forward requisitions to this office in which he asked for D.C. equipment in the school. Arrangements were made through this office to have the D.C. motors on the electric washing machines replaced by A.C. motors but a great deal of trouble continues to be experienced due to the fact that the person in charge of the power plant and electrical equipment is not a qualified engineer. The power plant is a very sensitive and complicated machine and its workings are beyond the comprehension of Mr. Ede who holds the position of engineer. If a competent engineer is not hired it seems inevitable that the expensive equipment will be damaged.\n\nI believe that Canon Cook and Maj.-General Turner should be informed of conditions at the school and perhaps they will take action.\n\nG.S.

The following is a fairly complete list of the materials which probably could be used in the construction of a residence. The materials are scattered over a wide area and in some cases were completely covered with snow so it was not possible to make a completely accurate inventory.\n\n| Item                        | Quantity |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Premier bricks              | 1508 only|\n| Flue lining 6\" x 12\"        | 36 only  |\n| Maple flooring              | 1750 F.B.M.|\n| Oak Flooring                | 2000 F.B.M.|\n| Gyproc wool insulation      | 40 bales |\n| Gyproc joint filler         | 125 lbs. |\n| Asbestos shingles for walls | 40 bundles|\n| Gyproc wall boards 4' x 8'  | Many damaged|\n| Base board                  | 60 sheets |\n| Windows - large number - various sizes | 1000 linear ft.|\n| Doors - large number - various sizes | |\n\nThere is need for a principal's residence at the School. At present Mr. Davies is living in the congested dormitory building. His former residence is not owned by the M.S.C.O. and is several hundred yards from the dormitory and therefore is too far distant to be a satisfactory residence for the principal.\n\nG.S.

Assuming that rate is satisfactory this reduces the cost to the school by $18.00.\n\nCost to school for quarter = $521.77\n\nCost per pupil per quarter $521.77 \u00f7 42.5 roughly $12.25.\n\nQuarterly grant for each pupil is $103, which makes the cost for electrical current alone 11.8% of income per child which is abnormally high.\n\np.t.o.\nCredit Advice\n\nMarch 20th, 1950.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from Lesser Slave Lake Agency:\n\nIndian Agent G.

If there is no possibility of a new classroom block being constructed I believe that building should be purchased.\n\nAttached please find a copy of Mr. Basler's report.\n\nG.S.

Reference your letter of March 21, 1950 to which was attached a letter from the Superintendent of Education under date of March 16, 1950.\n\n2. The Boys' Residence (No. 3 on list) is being used at present to store vegetables. The barn (No. 5 on list) is being used to stable a team of horses. The warehouse (No. 8 on the list) is in use for storing equipment. The clothing warehouse (No. 7 on list) is being used for the storage of clothing. The workshop (No. 9 on the list) is now in use as a classroom.\n\n3. Necessary to efficient operation of the school are the following buildings: Warehouse (if repaired or enlarged), Barn, clothing warehouse and workshop. As you know the only classroom on the premises is the small building listed as a workshop. The dining room and kitchen could be converted to make a fair classroom.\n\n4. In order to get a clear picture of the value, condition and usefulness of these buildings as seen from this end it is suggested that this report be read in conjunction with my report \"Purchase of Wabasca Residential School Buildings\" dated May 30, 1949.\n\nL.

Charlton's letter of March 16th, to which were attached inventories and statements concerning the above project, please note the following:\n\n1 - Equipment Rentals -\nThe following rentals are approved:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   | Duration | Rate |\n|-------------------------------|--------|----------|------|\n| Cement mixer                  | $600.00| 2 mos    | 3% p.m. |\n| Portable Bunkhouses (Igloos)  | $350.00| 7 \"      | 3% or 20% |\n| Camp Range                    | $375.00| 7 mos    | 3% or 20% |\n| Cookhouse Equipment           | $225.00| 7 mos    | 3% or 20% |\n| Crowbars, Bunks, Mattresses, etc. | $125.00| 7 mos    | 3% or 20% |\n| Wooden & 3 Alum Wheelbarrows  | $162.00| 3 mos    | 3% or 10% |\n| 4 x 4 Truck (Army vehicle)    | $1250.00| 4 mos    | 3% or 20% |\n\nTotal amount of rentals: $517.20\n\n2 - Materials purchased by the Department -\nThe Auditor's suggestion to omit listing the value of Departmental purchases is approved. In return, it is agreed that the Contractor will forego his 10% fee on the value of Departmental purchases of materials incorporated in the buildings.\n\nThe list of materials left on site and certified to be by L. Basler in the amount of \u00a32,229.96 is accepted in settlement of the Contractor's responsibility to account for surplus materials. The final disposal of the materials is the responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n3 - Small Tools and Equipment -\nThe Auditor's suggested disposal of small tools and equipment is approved as follows:\n\n(a) Broken or fully depreciated and charged to cost of project - \u00a3200.96.\n(b) Articles amounting \u00a3485.87 taken by the Contractor may be credited to the Project at the valuation of \u00a3394.67.\n(c) The cost of articles left on the site amounting to \u00a3350.84 may be charged to the project, but a receipt must be secured from L. Basler.\n(d) Replacements to the value of $34.20 may be charged to the Project.\n\n4 - Camp and Mess Equipment -\nThe auditor's suggested disposal of Camp and Mess House equipment is approved as follows:\n\n(a) Broken or fully depreciated and charged to cost of the project - $25.44.\n(b) The cost of articles left on site amounting to $306.15 may be charged to Project, but a receipt must be secured from L. Walker.\n(c) Articles costing $109.69 taken by the Contractor may be credited to the Project at the valuation of $51.81.\n(d) Replacements to the Contractor's equipment to the value of $56.21 may be charged to the Project. The $43.16 credit to Department, representing half the value of replacements, is not understood. Does the Contractor propose to pay half the cost of replacements? The listing appears to be an error, but in any event it will not be necessary to hold up the final claim pending receipt of an explanation from the auditor.\n\n[Signature]\n\nc.c.: H.G.

Villeneuve, Treasury Auditor, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nRe: Nakoda Indian Agent, Band Office and Residence\nBand Construction Company Limited\n\nI am submitting herewith copies of inventories of\nsmall tools and equipment and of Camp and Mess equipment which\nhave been charged to the above contract. The method in which\nthe various items have disposed have been indicated as well as\nan evaluation of the items taken by the contractor which are\nto be credited back to the cost of the contract.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Agent, Mr. L. Parker has\ncertified to the items that are shown as having been left with\nthe Department. A copy of the present list will also be for-\nwarded to him for his further examination and certification.\n\nItems of small tools and equipment taken by the\ncontractor have been evaluated at one half to two-thirds of\nthe purchase price depending upon the degree the items would\nbe subject to depreciation. Items shown as replacements to\nthe Contractor's tools which were broken on the project have\nbeen evaluated at one half of their purchase price.\n\nItems of Camp and Mess equipment taken by the\nContractor as well as Items shown as replacements to equip-\nment brought in by the Contractor have been evaluated at 50%\nof the purchase price. It is considered that this ratio is\nreasonably fair since the majority of the items taken or re-\nplaced are kitchen utensils and are subject to a greater degree\nof breakage and depreciation.\n\nThe Contractor has been informed of the manner I\nhave evaluated these inventories and has given his approval.\n\nThe credits accruing to the Department in each\ninstance are shown at the foot of the inventories submitted.\n\nEquipment Rentals:\n\nThe Contractor has received no rental compensa-\ntion for equipment which was brought in to complete the project.\nA list of the items has been supplied to the Department by the\nContractor under date of October 11, 1952. Following verifica-\ntion of the fact that the equipment mentioned had been used on\nthe project, I have arrived at the following rentals which the\nContractor is prepared to accept.\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Rate   | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|--------|-------|\n| Cement mixer          | 1        | $60.00 | $60.00|\n| Portable Bathhouses   | 2        | $35.00 | $70.00|\n| Camp Range            | 1        | $75.00 | $75.00|\n| Cookhouse Equipment   | 1        | $45.00 | $45.00|\n| Crosbars, Bunks, Mattresses, etc. | 1 | $25.00 | $25.00|\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6378, file 767-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI consider that the above amounts are quite reasonable and I am prepared to recommend that these be approved by the Department.\n\nBuilding materials supplied by the Department\n\nA major difficulty has come up in attempting to determine the quantity and value of materials that were originally supplied by the Department which the Contractor may have incorporated into the building. While there is no doubt that a certain amount was used, there is evidence that large quantities were not used owing to unsuitability after having remained exposed to the weather during several months prior to the start of the project. The windows originally supplied could not be used as they did not meet with the specifications as fixed by the Architect and Engineer and I have established that unutilized quantities of materials purchased by the Department were remaining and were in the Agency's Warehouse at the conclusion of the project.\n\nIn order to bring about a settlement as early as possible, the Contractor (Mr. H. Taylor) is entitled to foreign the amount of fee on materials supplied by the Department to which he would be entitled under the terms of the contract. If this proposal meets with the approval of the Department, a serious difficulty will have been solved. For my part, I am prepared to endorse this solution otherwise, to compile a list of materials used would be an endless task which will require an air trip to Canada. From the information I have gathered in the course of my visit to the project last August, there are no indications that the Contractor has refrained from using Department materials when these could be used nor is there any reason to suspect that the Contractor has attempted to save out any of the remaining materials at the conclusion of the project.\n\nThe foregoing are the recommendations I am prepared to make concerning the various inventories, rentals and materials supplied by the Department. If you will forward these on to the Department with any other suggestions that may come to light, upon receiving approval, I shall be in a position to bring the final claim to completion.\n\nApproved,\n\nE.

Indian Residential School\n\nAs you are probably aware from your files, we intended at one time to purchase from the M. B. C. C. the above residential school. Instead, it was decided to erect the dormitory block which now stands. Recently we have written to you concerning a new principal's residence.\n\nIn order that this may pass from being a church-owned school to a government-owned school, it may be necessary to buy at a nominal price some of the other buildings which are being used at the school. We have a valuation on these various buildings from the Department of Public Works and the items can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Shed - Back of Girls' Residence ........ $600.00\n2. Girls' Residence ......................... 1,800.00\n3. Boys' Residence ......................... 1,800.00\n4. Dining room and Kitchen ............... 6,482.64\n5. Barn .................................. 1,200.00\n6. Laundry ................................ 392.00\n7. Clothing Warehouse ..................... 363.28\n8. Warehouse ................................ 350.00\n9. Workshop ................................ 750.00\n\nTotal ........ $ 13,737.92\n\nCould you please advise which of these buildings are in use by the school management and are considered by you as necessary for the efficient functioning of the school. I am sending this letter to you in duplicate so that you can send a copy to Mr. Basler.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n9th March, 1950.\n\nMajor D. M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal B. Rainville\n\nDated March 31st, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind.ReS. School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated March 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasso R.C.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

(RG. 10, Volume 6378, file 768-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter.\u201d\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasoa R.C. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1934.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 19, 1934.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 1934.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 408\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant during quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca H.O.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: B. Rainbird\n\nDated: April 2, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Slave Lake Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasega R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind.Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the WABASCA H.S. Ind. Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wahsasa H.S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Mr. F. H. E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.S., Ind.Res., School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 7th, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Driftwood\n\nthis 30th October 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 7th, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 30th October, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return which is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wahsasa R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 10th, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasso R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 10th, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftville this 15 January 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasso R.C.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasso R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Mr. F. H. L. O. M.\n\nDated June 30th 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nP.J. D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30th, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftfiled Alta., July 4th, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wahsaca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasso R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wahkosa R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca H.S. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftville Alta.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabson R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabamun R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasego R.C. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 2nd January 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftville Delta this 19th Jan. 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C. Ind.Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance WABASCA R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return (notwithstanding) by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Wabasca R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, calculated by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jougare Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal Joseph Hickey\n\nDated April 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Slave Lake this APR 5 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA 403 E 3698\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY |

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

(RG10, Volume 6379, file 768-3, part 1)\nOttawa, December 20, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the September quarter report of the Wabasca R.C. Residential School. In the case of pupils who were discharged during the quarter, it is noted that the Principal only requests grant for 45 days. It is also noted that, in a great number of cases, the Principal only requests grant for 73 days.\n\nThe new regulations in force this year allow 62 days holidays with grant; consequently, in the case of a pupil who is discharged, the school is entitled to receive grant for 62 days.\n\nIt is presumed that the holidays began on July 1st and that the school re-opened on September 1st, consequently, for any pupil who was in school on July 1st and returned to the school after the summer holidays grant should be requested for the actual number of days such pupil was in residence during the quarter, plus 62 days. For instance, if a pupil was allowed out on holidays on July 1st and returned on September 1st, grant should be requested for 92 days. If, however, a pupil allowed out on holidays on July 1st did not return to the school until September 10th, grant should be requested for 83 days (62 days holiday grant, plus 21 days present during the September quarter.\n\nI enclose extra copy of this letter, in order that you may forward it to the Principal and assist him in preparing his return.\n\nIn the case of........\nIn the case of pupils who entered the school for the first time during the September quarter, grant should only be requested from the date of entrance to the end of the quarter. Return shows that pupils #130 and #0153 entered Wabasca R.C. Residential School for the first time on September 1st. In each instance the Principal requests grant for 30 days which is correct.\n\nI would appreciate if you would arrange to send this return to the Principal of the Wabasca School immediately, in order that he may make the necessary corrections.\n\nI would also point out that when quarterly returns of residential schools are received in your office, they should have immediate attention and be forwarded to the Department at once. You realize that most of the residential schools have a difficult time to finance and delay in submitting the return to the Department means that the school is not paid its quarterly grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.A.

L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith official letter of December 20, 1937, I forwarded you the September quarter return of the Wabasca Roman Catholic Residential School in order that you could have certain alterations made.\n\nI would appreciate your arranging to send the revised return to the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nN.

It would be highly appreciated by me.\n\nLet me point out that we are facing a very hard winter in the Peace River District due to bad weather. It has been raining since many weeks, especially since two weeks. The crop is rotting in the fields. No threshing done at date. It is so wet that it will be nearly impossible to pass machines in the fields. No sign of change yet. Snow in some districts. Grain and vegetables may be a complete lost.\n\nI would appreciate receiving an affirmative answer to my inquiry re charging the Milling Mill bought to the current year credits.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention,\nI remain, Dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

You would have seen for yourself, Mr. Laird.\nIt is very difficult it is to teach the children how to work without dishes. This is the object of my letter.\n\nI know how devoted you are for these poor children, and that you will do all in your power to come to our aid.\n\nI have been here a number of years and find it impossible to get on without the dishes.\n\nCould you not get the Department to help us?\n\nI would like to have twenty double dishes with divided sets, and six single school dishes.\n\nThanking you in advance for all your trouble.\n\nRemain\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nSister Langlois\n\nSt. Albert, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Boarding School, in which she requests that 20 double desks with divided seats and 6 single desks be supplied for the use of the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the per capita grant for this school is allowed for only 25 pupils, it is not understood why the teacher requests that seating accommodation be provided for 46 pupils. We would be prepared to consider supplying a sufficient number of desks to seat 25 pupils. It will, however, first be necessary to state the number of children between the following ages, in order that desks of the proper size can be ordered, viz: -\n\n| Pupils between 5 and 8 years | 8 \" 10 \" |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| \"                            | 10 \" 14 \" |\n| \"                            | 14 \" 16 \" |\n| \"                            | 16 \" 18 \" |\n\nFull shipping instructions should also be given.

He requests that the wood work sufficient for five (5) No. 3 single school desks be forwarded and that five (5) more castings for the size 5 desks be sent as he could use all this equipment and it would solve the present difficulty.\n\nPlease arrange to forward to the address mentioned in our letter of January 29 last the following:\n\nWood work for 5 No.3, B.B.A. single desks;\nCastings complete for 5 No.5 single school desks.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from you regarding this matter and to state whether you can arrange for the shipment of the extra equipment mentioned above, care being taken to see that sizes and no's. of each size as ordered are forwarded, also the price charged.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[F.

He wants an allowance for the other materials and for the labour. He offers to send a plan of the new school, which is to be larger than the present building \"because we have other Indian children besides the wards of the Government.\"\nSeptember 23, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Grouard:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge Your Lordship's letter of the 10th instant, addressed to the Honourable Mr. Stewart, who is at present in Europe. I note your intention of rebuilding the Wabasca R. C. Indian Residential School and that you require assistance for materials other than lumber and for labour. Before the Department can give intelligent consideration, it will be necessary for Your Lordship to forward an estimate of the cost, and I should be grateful if you would let me have a copy of the plan for the proposed new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

C. Indian Residential School in reference to his application for a number of extra desks. As stated in our letter of January 13th, last, seating accommodation has been provided for 37 pupils, and the Principal now requests that 4 extra desks and 6 front seats be supplied. It is noted that there are 45 children on the roll, 4 of whom are under school age. The information which you furnished in your letter of December 2nd, 1924, regarding the dimensions of the dormitories shows that there is air space sufficient for 35 pupils only, and the Department is, therefore, of opinion that there is overcrowding in the dormitories, and that the enrolment should not exceed that number.\n\nPlease inform the Department whether all the pupils in residence are Indian children, or if any of them are half-breeds, also why children under school age have been taken into the school. We consider that there should be sufficient seating accommodation for the children for whom there is dormitory accommodation only, and are not, therefore, favourably disposed to grant the Principal's request to supply a further number of desks until information is furnished as to the excess of pupils over the number for which a per capita grant is allowed, and also as to whether they are all Indian children, and if there is any overcrowding in the dormitories.

An Order in Council, similar to the one you prepared a few months ago for the Residential School, will be suitable.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nOttawa, Nov. 6, 1928\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nOctober 9, 1928.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRight Reverend Joussard, C. M. I., Auxiliary Bishop of Athabasca, called at the Department today and saw Dr. Scott with reference to the building programme at Indian residential schools in his diocese. His Lordship pressed for the reconstruction of the Wabasca R. C. School and urged that the Department provide a grant of $15,000 next year. They would like to know in time to get the early freighting done in March and April. His Lordship was glad to know that an addition at Sturgeon Lake was noted for Estimates and that Parliament would probably be asked for a grant of $2,000. He was also interested in the new wing at St. Bruno's. My opinion is he had never discussed this before, as he was pressing first for the reconstruction of Wabasca.\n\nRussell Ferrier\nOffice of the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency\n\nJuly 9th 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 95, amounting to $114.50 in favour of The Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., Ltd., Preston, Ontario for School Desks, &c., supplied St. Martin's School, Demerais, Alta.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold [signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\n**The Canadian Office & School Furniture Co.,**\n\nManufacturers of\n\nOffice, School, Church, Lodge and Opera Furniture\n\nBank, Office, Hotel, Drug and Jewelry Store and Court House Fittings\n\nA Specialty\n\nPRESTON, April 20th-1928\n\nONT.\n\nSOLD TO Department of Indian Affairs, Canada,\n\nNo. 40101-C Ottawa, Ont.\n\n| CONVEYANCE | CPR & E.D.& B.C.Rly. | TERMS | NET |\n|------------|-----------------------|-------|-----|\n| 131-9-5    |                       |       |     |\n| C.         | No.2 B.B.A. Single desks | 6.-   | 32.-- |\n|            | No.2 \" \" \" fronts      | 6.25  | 37.50|\n|            | No.16 Teacher's desk   |       | 29.50|\n|            | No.210 \" arm chair     |       | 15.50|\n|            | f.o.b.

Indian Residential School. Mr. Orr is at present out of the city, on duty; but, upon his return, he will write to you concerning the heating system. I believe he will not advise a hot air system.\n\nConcerning the Department's financial assistance, there is a grant of $15,000 available and I do not know that further funds can be provided. The Department will also try to help with the electric lighting system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. A. Rault, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nWabasca R.C. Residential School,\nDesmarais, Alta.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour favourable reply of September 24th caused great joy in our far-away northern mission. With my most sincere thanks, I also extend to you the most respectful and profound gratitude of the Sisters in charge of the school.\n\nKnowing the great interest you take in the welfare of our mission work, I was more than once inclined to correspond with you or rather to meet you, and I deeply regret not having been fortunate enough to be at St. Bruno's Mission while you visited there last year. I do not want to abuse your kindness but please allow me to state in the most briefly manner possible that\nwhich I would have expressed with more minute details, if I had had the opportunity of doing so.\n\nWhen I first was named Principal of the Wabasca R.C. Residential School in 1923, I was very badly impressed by the sad condition of the buildings, which were built with logs some thirty years ago... the foundations are mostly worn out. Besides, the number of pupils, continually increasing; we needed more space, I then conceived the necessity of renewing the buildings as soon as possible. I communicated the idea to His Lordship Bishop Howard who in return sent me a saw-mill to prepare the lumber necessary for a new school. Our first plan was 100' x 50' with wing 30' x 40'. Then His Lordship turned to you for financial help and received a favourable reply with the sum of $15,000 for the labor, the purchase and freight of doors, windows, nails, etc. In the meantime, His Lordship\nand his adviser thinking the plan too large for the $15,000 granted, greatly diminished it. By building according to this new plan, we would have been obliged to make use of the old buildings as long as they would have stood up and then to be obliged to build anew. What trouble and nuisance for the Sisters and pupils to be continually going from one house to another, especially during winter. Therefore I insisted in favor of our first plan which is now being executed and which I am sending you under separate cover.\n\nMy first idea was to install a hot air heating system but the more I think of it, the more unsatisfactory I find it, as it will hardly heat the basement and be more dangerous for fire accidents. I am very anxious to know Mr. Orr's ideas about a steam system... Would it be much more expensive?\n\nAt the present time water is being\nhauled by a team and waggon two or three times a week... If the installation of a steam system with the water system were to exceed the amount already granted for our school, could I turn to you and ask if your kindness to balance the amount.\n\nForgive me Honourable Sir, if I have given you all these details concerning the Wabasca R.C. Residential School but they will help you to understand the situation and approve me for improving the state of things at our school.\n\nWith sentiments of esteem and best wishes, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

We also confirm our recent telegram reading as follows:\n\n\"Your file 131-9-5 will supply six kilowatt Brutton in place of Marshall with tetrope drive, increase in price One Hundred Fifty Dollars extra. Expect reason for taking order for Marshall instead of Brutton equipment is that diesel engine on cheap fuel oil would produce current cheaper than gasoline engine. Would you supply Brutton equipment. Our Manager just returning from Edmonton and will confirm with details on his return.\"\n\nWe wish to apologize for the delay in confirming this message owing to the writer's absence on a Western trip.\n\nWe presume the reason for the Marshall engine, switchboard & generator and battery with tetrope drive being quoted in place of the Lister Brutton Automatic, is on account of cheaper operating costs. If they can secure fuel oil at this point, it will be cheaper to operate on than on gasoline.\n\nOn the other hand, the Lister-Brutton Automatic Equipment would be more simple to operate.

One of the teachers being very ill; it was the only mean of transportation to Edmonton.\n\nSince then, the Western Canada Airways established a service, not quite regular yet, between Edmonton and Wabasca.\n\nNeedless to tell you, Honorable Sir, that we would be more than pleased, if you were taking advantage of that flying bird, to come and honor us of your visit.\n\nWaiting this realization, kindly accept, once more, the expression of my sincere thanks for your kindness and the interest you take in our welfare.\n\nI am,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\nBishop's Residence, Grouard, Alta., October 17th, 1930.\n\nMr Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr Ferrier:\n\nDuring my last visit at your office I brought your attention on the fact that an amount promised by the Department for the reconstruction of Wabasca R.C. Residential School had lapsed with the end of the last fiscal year. The Principal and Rev. Father Falher, having borrowed the necessary money, were simply waiting for the completion of the work to present the Department the receipts of all material and work. The fiscal year was brought to an end. The Reverend Fathers were unaware of the necessary lapsing of unexpended amounts. I regret this ignorance on their part but believe that same can be remedied by a revote.\n\nI therefore take the liberty of asking from the Department to include in the next Estimates the sum of $20,000.00 for the above work. I add $5,000.00 on account of the excessive cost of material (some of which we had to send even by aeroplane and the other freighted over exceptionally bad roads) and difficulty to obtain in such a remote country, skilled hands.\n\nI hope that you will give this matter your personal attention and thank you for so doing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nOttawa, October 25, 1930.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 17th instant, concerning a grant towards the cost of reconstructing the Wabasca R. C. Indian Residential School. A note for next year's Estimates has been made in this connection. It is probable that only $15,000 can be considered, as the Order in Council authorizing this amount has been passed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I regret that our Vote is not yet available, but I can promise that Your Lordship's request will not be overlooked and that cheques will be directed as soon as possible.

GUY, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, Grouard, Alta., dated July 10, 1931, addressed to Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nI take the liberty of asking if it would be in order for the Department to give at least a partial payment on accounts promised for St. Bruno's and Wabasca Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI must say that we have already paid more than $2,000.00 interest at the bank for Wabasca and $1,200.00 for St. Bruno. The returns from Wabasca are not in yet and I must admit that through the inexperience of the Principal, proper receipts were not signed by the men nor labor returns made. I have asked the Principal to prepare a return with affidavit and hope that same will prove satisfactory. Regarding St. Bruno, everything is in order and labour returns, receipts and invoices in part are presently in Mr. Ferrier's office. Pending the sending of the balance could you not send us a partial payment at least to allay the situation.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6379, file 768-5, part 1)\nOTTAWA, March 31st, 1931\n\nM.

I had spoken of $40,000.00. You will note that we have gone over that amount as the interest alone of the money (that promised by the Department and the balance we had to borrow) has reached over $6,000.00. Moreover equipment has also been charged. I can safely say that $50,000.00 would be the right price for the building.\n\nI take the liberty in the face of the heavy expenses we have had to incur to ask from the Department payment of the oven, washing machine and range for which invoices are already in your office. Rev. Prault has also spoken to me about some other equipment for which he has invoices. He will send same to me by next mail. He has just left by airplane.\n\nWhen in Ottawa I had also taken up with you the question of storm windows and I was to write about same.

O. Indian Residential School. As you have been informed, an advance of $10,000 in this connection was made on the 10th instant. I believe that it would be advisable to have receipts for the materials. I note that receipts are not obtainable from the labourers. The following items, however, should be supported by receipts or paid cheques:\n\n- 200,000 ft. of Lumber at $40 per M. - $8,000.00\n- Excavating for Foundation - $450.00\n- Hauling of Gravel - $250.00\n- W. Clark Company, Edmonton, for Cement - $1,156.60\n- A. Prudhomme & Sons, Montreal - $2,748.12\n- J. E. Ashdown Hardware, Edmonton - $21.95\n\nWhen these receipts are to hand, the balance of the grant, viz.: $5,000, can be directed to Your Lordship.\n\nI have also Your Lordship's letter of the 5th instant, and I note that the cost of this building will be approximately $50,000, counting the interest you have had to pay. The pictures which you have left suggest that the building is quite suitable for the purpose of Indian education. With reference to reimbursing Your Lordship for equipment, the receipts now in Ottawa will be here until such time as all are to hand, and then consideration will be given.

It is noted that there is a fire escape from each of the dormitories.\n\nRegarding the supplying of fire extinguishers, I would request that you furnish the necessary shipping instructions. You should state the name of the railway station to which they should be sent, the distance from the school and if there would be anyone to properly look after them when they arrive at the railway station. I may say that the extinguishers we supply are the 1\u00bd quart Pyrene and 1\u00bd gallon Thermene extinguisher, with non-freeze chemical.

Would this be too many? We could even go down to twelve, but not less, as we have a number of large pupils who need a larger size of desks.\n\nIf granted, would you kindly procure them in the following order:\n\n| Rear Desks | No. 2 |\n|------------|-------|\n| 3          |       |\n\n| Desks      | No. 2 |\n|------------|-------|\n| 12         |       |\n\nHoping to receive a favorable reply,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nRev.

This is something that will be of value to the School and I am sure would be appreciated by the teacher.\n\nI am quite sure that the cost of this is not very great to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I would especially ask that this set of books be supplied, as well as the new sewing machine.

August 2nd, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection made of the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Wabasca; I spent some time in each of the classrooms there, and found that the Indian children attending were receiving an excellent education, and that the work at this school compared very favourably with that performed at any of the schools on the outside.\n\nThere are three classrooms in the school and the grades taught are from I to VIII. I was quite surprised to find children in Grade VIII at this institution. The Senior Classroom is in charge of Sister John of Egypt, who holds a Second Class U.S. Certificate, and has taught in Indian Schools for a number of years; Sister Helen of the Crucifix, who has a U.S. standing and has taught 15 years in Alberta Indian Schools, is in charge of the Intermediate Classroom; and in the Junior Classroom is Sister Denise Helene who has a Grade X Alberta standing and who has taught for six years in Alberta Indian Schools.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6379, file 768-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAt the time of my visit there were 115 children in residence: 75 Indian and 30 Halfbreed children. They all looked well and it was interesting to note that after the Doctor and Nurse examined them all, there was only one boy attending the school who was not just up to the mark.\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\nThe building is practically new and was built under the direction of the Principal in charge of the school; The lumber was all sawn on the premises as the Church authorities operate a mill there. It is three stories high and with the basement comprises four. I do not care for this kind of a building as it is very difficult to heat in the winter; You can well realize that the North winds sweeping across the lake are very cold, and the building being so high gets the full force of them. The School is heated with a hot air furnace which, of course, is not satisfactory and I believe some parts of the school are practically impossible to heat during the winter. There is a partial water system in the school: That is to say, one basin on each floor.\n\nAnother disadvantage of having such a high building is that in case of fire it is very difficult for children sleeping on the top floor to get out. Their only means of escape are either by the outside stairs from the top down to the ground, or by the inside stairway. They have fire extinguishers, &c., but\nin a frame structure of this kind, it would be almost impossible to get fire under control if there was any wind.\n\nA study building program is under way and a new barn was to be erected this summer. There are also several other new buildings in connection with the school that have recently been erected. They have a further building program in mind, as they can saw about 10,000 feet of lumber there each year.\n\nFARMING:\n\nThe school farms 25 acres of land and they were clearing 15 acres. They also have a large garden. They own about 12 work horses and have all the implements they require, including a small threshing machine. They have about 60 head of cattle and at the time of my inspection they were milking five cows. They also make butter and the children have all the milk they can drink. They keep 100 hens.\n\nWORK PERFORMED OTHER THAN CLASSROOM:\n\nI also went thoroughly into the matter of other work performed by the children attending this school and found that sewing, knitting, cooking, &c., are taught to the girls, and their work compares very favourably with that of other schools. The boys are taught gardening and farm work. One thing with which I was very pleased was that they boys and girls all have gardens of their own and the school gives prizes for the best-kept garden. This is certainly a step in the right direction.\nSTAFF:\n\nThe Staff at the school consists of 12 Sisters of Providence, the Rev. Principal L. Beiglette, is quite an outstanding man. He has only been there a short time. He is assisted by Father E. Petour and four lay brothers, and they also give a lot of work to Indians clearing land, &c. At the time of my visit there were seven Indians employed. A night-watchman is also employed.\n\nI must say that this is a splendid institution and is carrying on good work. It is situated right on the banks of the lake, and when they have completed their buildings and fixed up their grounds according to their plans, it will be a beautiful place.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

He states the building is difficult to heat in winter and the disadvantage of having such a high building is that, in case of fire, it is extremely difficult for children sleeping on the top floor to get out - their only means of escape being either by the outside stairs from the top down to the ground or by the inside stairway.

I am sure that every precaution is taken by the principal and staff - there being a night watchman at the school. However, I should be pleased to have your views as to whether every provision has been made to overcome fire hazard and, in case of fire, if the necessary facilities are available that the children can leave the building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The latter have been quite looked after but of course have served their time and purpose. They will not stand the year's run and in fact we are wondering if they will last the whole Winter.\n\nConsequently I have taken upon myself to ask for tenders and I am enclosing the lowest from the J.H.Ashdown Hardware Company of Edmonton, for your kind consideration and approval with request of course of payment by the Department.\n\nI may add that freighting to Wabasca School is possible only during Winter and therefore only one more month is left for said freighting. In consideration of that fact I would take the liberty of asking for prompt action and would ask for the favor of a telegram to be sent either to me or to the J.H.Ashdown Company in Edmonton. If you wire me please note that I will in Grouard until the 9th inst when I leave for Ottawa where I expect to be on the 18th.\n\nWith anticipated thanks for above and pleasure of meeting you soon, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nMarch 7, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nIn a communication dated the third instant, His Lordship Bishop Guy, Grouard, Alberta, requests that new batteries be supplied for the lighting system at the Wabasca Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, (Reserve No. 166, Grouard Indian Agency - Federal District of Athabasca) Alberta.

This is the type of battery that has been supplied to a large number of Indian residential schools.\n\nBishop Guy states that freighting is possible only during the winter, and he therefore requests that the new batteries be forwarded at an early date.

McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI take the liberty of sending enclosed account for a washing machine bought lately for the Wabasca R.C. Residential School, a machine similar to those you authorized last year for St Bernard's Residential School and from the same firm.\n\nAs I was afraid that winter roads to Wabasca would be closed I ordered the machine on my way to Ottawa and was expecting invoices in Ottawa before leaving. I received them this morning upon my return from my trip.\n\nPlease note that the School at Wabasca, though of rather large pupilage, has no laundry machinery of any kind, except wash tubs, hand washing machines and one small electric machine (the size of an ordinary hand washing machine) out of order. I thought you would favor the purchase of the machine referred to in the enclosed invoice and authorize payment of same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\nBEATTY BROS., LIMITED, EDMONTON, ALTA.\nVERNON, B.

General,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI take the liberty of forwarding to the Department a bill of Beatty Bros. Ltd., for Laundry machinery destined to R.C. Residential School at Wabasca. You would oblige me greatly if you could pay this bill directly to the Company.\n\nAllow me to call your attention on the fact that the Company is requesting payment for the 26th of February. By the notes left by His Lordship Mgr Guy, O.M.I., I see that there should be a credit for Laundry Machinery at Wabasca. In order to avoid debts, I have bought a rather small laundry equipment. I have done so only after having requested the advice of the Sisters who have testified that such equipment would be sufficient.\n\nIf you foresee that the bill will not be paid for the mentioned date, you please notify me. I would not like to deceive the Beatty Bros. Co.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Mr. McGill,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nGrouard, Alta., Feb. 15th, 1938.\n\nDr. Harold W.

I was pointing out that the Company was requesting payment by the end of this month.\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter I have just received from the same firm on this matter. The letter talks by itself. Not to deceive these people, I take the liberty of communicating it to the Department with the hope that it will be possible to answer the request. Should that be impossible, I would appreciate you getting in touch with Beatty Bros. stating that the bill will be considered at the earliest convenience possible.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will kindly give to this matter, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nEdmonton, Alta., Feb. 14, 1938.\n\nRev. Father S. Lajoie, O. M. I.\nGrouard, Alberta.\n\nReverend & Dear Sir:\n\nWe have just today received a letter from the Winnipeg Company who supplied the washer and extractor for the Wabasca Mission urging payment without fail before the end of this month and we hope you will not mind us writing you now again asking you kindly to write the Department at Ottawa once more if you have not done so since our last letter of Feb. lst urging for immediate payment if they have not already sent their cheque.\n\nPlease understand this is not so much for ourselves as for the Company who supplied the goods who are apparently in urgent need of payment.\n\nThanking you again for your courtesy and co-operation and with kind personal regards, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nBeatty Bros. Limited\n\nper [signature]\nEdmonton Manager\n| Name of Employment | No. of Hours | Rate | Time | Total |\n|--------------------|-------------|------|------|-------|\n| Foreman            |             |      |      |       |\n| Labor              |             |      |      |       |\n\n**Witness**\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed and prices are fair and just.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI take the liberty of directing to you the documents in connection with the painting of the R.C. Indian Residential School of Wabasca, Desmarais, Alta. This work was authorized last year by what I understand from His Excellency Mgr Joseph Guy, O.M.I.\n\nAllow me, Mr. Phelan, to make you a confession... I am awfully short of money. I have not received a cent on all the work done last summer. To pay bills and wages on this work, I have been compelled to delay other payments. Besides, I have not touched yet the allocations for the Wabasca School, I mean the balance due on September term and all the term of December. If you could do something to alleviate the burden. I am so worried with that money question.....\n\nYour are aware that the Department has agreed through the Hon Minister to pay so much a year on the money we borrowed to rebuild the Boys' School. Having in his mind that we could borrow money at 3\u00bd%, the Hon. Minister has stated in his communication $2,500.00. This amount has proved not to be sufficient to pay interest and a valuable instalment as it was impossible to get money as less than 4%. Lately, Mgr J. Guy wrote to the Hon. Minister requesting him to raise the amount to $3,000.00 a year. On the reception of the bill for the first six months interest and instalments, I have forwarded this bill to Dr McGill inquiring of the intention of the Department to pay directly to the lenders or through the Corporation. If you happen to be consulted on the matter, I would appreciate advising to pay directly. It makes business easier.\nI would appreciate receiving some large envelopes for reports, communications with the Department.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will give to the questions referred to in this letter,\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Mr. Maclean,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Residential School.\nAppropriation: $2,000.00\n\nWork to be done includes chimneys. Estimated cost .............$ 1,200.00\n\nThe material was bought early in January last to be hauled on winter roads. We pay an average of two cents a pound in winter when it costs five or six cents for summer hauling, when it is possible to do. Besides, when I was notified to purchase through the Department's Agent, all the stuff had reached Wabasca since weeks.\n\nWork to be done includes Diesel engine. Estimated cost ..........$ 850.00\n\nThe old engine for the electric plant got out of order last winter. As replacement could not be deferred, the Principal took on him to buy a new one. This was before I was notified to pass through the Department for any purchase. Besides, when I heard, the deal had been done.\n\nWith this engine, we will save a lot on gas and oil. Nevertheless, had it not been absolutely needed, it would not have been bought. It was out of question to leave the Mission without light and power for a month or so.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nIn letter dated May 30, 1938,\n(File 131-1-5) Reverend S.
