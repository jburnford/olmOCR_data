(RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received an application from Mr. Indian Agent Strang for authority to expend the sum of approximately $110.00 to fence the grounds of the Shalalth Indian Day School, which amount covers the cost of materials and labour.\n\nAn item was included by the Agent in the 1941-42 Lytton Agency Estimates to provide for this expenditure. It is not known, however, just what provision has been made by the Department in this connection, and I shall be obliged if you will kindly advise me regarding same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, if you consider it necessary to fence the grounds of the Seton Lake Indian Day School you may arrange for having this work done. It is understood that the total cost will not exceed $110.00. When forwarding the account you should attach to it a copy of your purchase order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter from Miss Mary Winter, teacher at Seton Lake Indian Day School, Shalalth, B.C., in which she requests a further allowance for hot drinks, etc. for mid-day meals at the school during the month of June.\n\nIn previous years these provisions have been allowed up to the end of the school term in June and owing to the destitute condition of most of the Indians sending their children to the day school and their inability to supply the needed food for the children's lunches, I would respectfully request the Department to consider allowing the $5.00 for the month of June as requested by Miss Winter. Some of the school children have to walk several miles to school and warm nourishing drinks are very helpful in maintaining the children's resistance to disease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Strang Esq.,\nThe Indian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nI would like to request you for a renewal of the five dollar grant for lunches for the month of June, for this school. The reason is that I have noticed a number of the children with only dry bread for their lunch. This will cause malnutrition and make sickness and diseases likely to break out amongst them. We have already had an epidemic of measles since the grant closed at the end of March.\n\nHoping you will find it possible to renew this grant for the one month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box # 70,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nYour File No.:215-7-3223.\n\nI refer to your letter of the 22nd instant with regard to several suggestions put forth by Mr. H. McArthur in connection with his recent inspection of the Seton Lake Indian Day School:\n\nAt the present time it is considered that the oil stove now used by Mrs. Marsden should be sufficient for the needs of the School. With regard to the sandtable recommended by Mr. McArthur, the matter is being laid before Mrs. Marsden and if she considers that one is necessary, will obtain local prices for its construction. I will communicate with you at a later date in this regard if Mrs. Marsden wishes this table installed in the School.\n\nJ.D. Caldwell,\nActing Indian Agent.\nSeton Lake Indian Day School,\nShalalth B.C.\nApril 8th, 1943.\n\nJ.D. Caldwell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Mr. McArthur's suggestion of putting in a cook stove to provide practical cooking lessons for this Day School:\n\nI am afraid under the present conditions it would be full of difficulties. Much more than the stove would be needed. There would have to be kitchen table, and kitchen equipment, dishes etc., pans, baking tins, sauce pans, also cooking materials, butter, fats, sugar and spices, all rationed or under priorities.\n\nBread could be baked, but a difficult matter in a building left vacant over night. Loaves baked the same day as set would often entail staying late at night. There is no lighting system.\n\nThere are at present only five or six girls who are old enough to benefit by such an outlay. These are bright and intelligent and can be helped by oral cooking lessons and taking home recipes to practice on in their own homes. There would be less waste and no friction as to whom is to benefit by the cooked food. Always a touchy matter with Indians.\n\nHave already given oral lessons on cooking and diet, and have suggested they bring material to the school and I would supervise the mixing of ingredients.\n\nI may say, as Field Matron up the coast, I made many attempts to teach practical cooking. As the teacher's residence was in the building, the obstacles that we have here were eliminated. But there was always the difficulty of supplies. It's almost impossible to persuade the Indians to provide even a few eggs. Should they provide one, they feel they are entitled to the whole cake.\nLYTTON, B.C. April 12, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box #70,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nYour File No.: 215-7-3507.\n\nI refer to your letter of the 2nd instant with regard to cooking accommodations at the Seton Lake Indian Day School and enclose herewith, a letter from Mrs. Marsden in this connection, which is self explanatory.\n\nI beg to advise you that I have asked Mrs. Marsden to obtain quotations from a local source, regarding the construction of a sand table for her school.\n\nJ.D. Caldwell,\nActing Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 29th ultimo, file 165-62-6, with reference to Inspector McArthur's report on Seton Lake Day School, I would advise that the matter of his recommendations was taken up with Mr. Acting Indian Agent Caldwell and I enclose herewith his letters of the 31st ultimo and 12th instant, and that of Mrs. Marsden, the teacher, of the 8th instant, which, it would be observed, is not particularly helpful. Mrs. Marsden's teaching experience is limited to that of a pupil teacher in England many years ago and several years as wife of an unqualified teacher who taught some time ago at some of our Indian Day Schools. Apparently, it is not much use endeavouring to have her make any departure from the strictly orthodox methods prevailing at the time she was trained in England and I would suggest that the matter of domestic science training be left in abeyance for the balance of this term in the hope that a better qualified teacher can be secured for the position when the subject will be re-opened.\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing Inspector McArthur's report on the Seton Lake Day School. It would appear from this report that the Inspector considers there has been an improvement in the school during the past year. The following remarks are contained in the report:\n\n\"No improvement has taken place during the past year with respect to a program for vocational education. To all intents and purposes there is no program. Insofar as I can learn the only vocational activity was the knitting by the girls of mittens for themselves. (I am informed that a small patch of lettuce is to be planted.) A cookstove required for the teaching of baking and cooking, the installation of which I suggested last year, has not been provided, and essential materials have not been supplied for sewing.\n\n\"The grounds are very unsatisfactory.\n\n\"A sand-table has not been supplied, as I suggested last year.\"\n\nYou may purchase whatever supplies are needed for teaching sewing.\n\nI should appreciate a report from you regarding the Inspector's suggestion that a cookstove be supplied. With the limited space available I doubt if we should endeavour to teach cooking. However, we will be guided by your recommendation in this regard.\"\nIt is felt that the teacher could organize the boys to clean up the yard. While they might not make a perfect job, they should be able to effect some definite improvement.\n\nIn official letter of March 29 last you were authorized to supply a sand table for this school. Evidently this was overlooked and it would be appreciated if you would make the necessary arrangements at once.\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-5, part 3)\nI have for reference your letter of the 4th instant enclosing Inspector McArthur's report on the Seton Lake Indian Day School and requesting my comments on the observations contained in the above report.\n\nI beg to advise you that with regard to the Inspector's indications under Vocational Education, a garden for this School is out of the question as there is no water available for irrigation purposes. Aside from this, owing to the fact that the school is closed during the months of July and August, when everyone, including the teacher, is away on holiday, the garden would be completely burned in the space of a week or so.\n\nAs to the installation of a cook stove in the school building, I beg to point out that no provision was made in the construction of the school for such purposes. This matter has been gone into several times with previous teachers and was considered impractical for the reason above given. Mrs. Marsden was asked last year to submit me a list of her requirements for sewing lessons and so far this information has not been forthcoming. I would point out that no teacher's residence was provided in the school for the reason that good accommodation was available within easy walking distance of the school.\n\nIn view of the fact that such accommodation still exists I see no reason for the Inspector's remark in this connection. The necessary quotation for the construction of a sand table for this school was obtained last year and the authority for the expense granted me. However, the carpenter concerned lost his material in a fire and as a consequence the table was not provided. Mrs. Marsden, since then, having failed to interest any other person in the construction of the table required.\n\nI am of the opinion that Inspector McArthur's observations are made without due consideration of the lack of provision made in the design of the building for vocational training. In order to provide practical cooking lessons for the school, more than a cook stove would be required. A kitchen table, kitchen equipment including dishes, etc., would be required and at the present time, much of the material required for simple cooking is rationed or difficult to procure. Mrs. Marsden has informed me that she has been giving oral lessons in cooking and diet to those girls who are sufficiently old and has given them recipes on which to practise at home. Due to the above mentioned lack of\nspace, an oil stove has been placed in the school in order to prepare warm mid day meals for the pupils during the winter months. Mrs. Marsden avails herself of this opportunity to give the children what information she can in the way of demonstrating cleanliness and efficiency in the preparation of a simple meal.\n\nI do not appear to have a copy on hand of your letter of July 21st, 1943, and in order to give the matter consideration I would much appreciate your forwarding me a copy of same.\n\n(Sgd.) A. Strang.\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied by M.)\nA. Strong, Esq., Indian Agent, Lytton, B.C.\n\nI received a call today from Mrs. Marsden, teacher of Shalalth Indian Day School, and she discussed a number of problems affecting her school, some of which are quite small and could, no doubt, be attended to without very much difficulty.\n\nOne of these was that there is no chain on the furnace drafts leading up into the classroom or whatever room is above the furnace, and it is necessary to make frequent trips from one end of the school and then back to the other end of the basement to adjust these drafts. She also pointed out that it would be a great advantage to have some screens for the windows with which I quite agree. No doubt, the adjustable screens that fit in underneath the windows would be suitable for the purpose. It was also pointed out that the furnace shoots the dust up into the school room and may be in need of cleaning out between the casing and the inner furnace. I do not know whether this could be done without a great deal of difficulty.\n\nIn the course of discussion of manual training for the school, it developed that there is something wrong with the flooring in the basement which she states becomes a \"gooey mess\" when damp. This is the first time this has been brought to my attention and I would appreciate your report.\n\nApparently the school desks have become loose in the joints and need a general tightening up. This should be attended to in order to avoid necessity of replacement as these desks are now quite hard to get.\n\nConcerning the manual training, Mrs. Marsden thought that Mr. Hughes, the white school teacher, would be pleased to give manual training instruction to the boys for amount \u00a32.00 a week and, if this could be arranged, it would appear to be quite reasonable and I would suggest your investigating the matter and advising me further. If Mr. Hughes is agreeable to undertaking this work for a reasonable sum, it will be necessary then to secure material with which to build benches in the basement and some wooden mats for the boys to stand on in order to keep their feet off the floor, and, of course, a number of manual training tools and material will also be necessary.\nThe question of domestic science instruction for girls as mentioned by the School Inspector was discussed, and if this work was to be carried on a kitchen stove in the basement would be necessary. This could be of a very inexpensive type but would, of course, require the construction of a chimney and is a subject on which I would like your report, giving some estimate of the cost of erecting a satisfactory chimney for this purpose. In connection with domestic science teaching, the question arose regarding the provision of a sewing machine and you could, no doubt, advise me whether you wish to recommend same.\n\nThe lack of domestic water at the school was also mentioned but I do not know what could be done about this unless it is possible to dig a well and install a pump, which is another matter regarding which you could advise me.\n\nMrs. Marsden has been closing the school when the Priest visited the Reserve and held services during school hours. She was informed very definitely that the only person outside of the Department at Ottawa who could authorize the closing of a school would be the doctor in case of an epidemic. She was shown the circular setting out the days school was to be open but she questioned our authority in the matter and stated she would see the Archbishop about it. Please see that the Department's instructions are adhered to. Probably a tactful chat with Father Fehlman will overcome future difficulty.\n\nFor: D. M. MacKey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nCopied by M.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant, file 165-62-5, with reference to Inspector McArthur's report on Seton Lake Day School, I would advise that I have requested Mr. Indian Agent Strang to ascertain the sewing needs of this school and also to endeavour to have the children clean up the yard and make what improvements are possible.\n\nIn respect to the sand table, I enclose herewith copy of Mr. Strang's letter of the 13th instant advising that the carpenter who was to make this was burned out and that he has been unable to secure another person to do the work. You will also note his comments regarding cooking lessons, etc. I enclose a copy of my letter of July 21st addressed to Mr. Strang which he refers to in his letter.\n\nOn ascertaining the requirements of this school, I will make the necessary purchases.\n\nD.M.

An investigation in this connection has now been made and a report submitted by Engineer J.A. Mackenzie, a copy of which has gone forward to Mr. T.S. Mills of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Ottawa.\n\nThe scheme involves an outlay of $150.00 to change the position of the Neal Evans Transportation Company's storage tank from which the proposed supply is to be obtained, and a rate of $2.00 per month for the water. There is no way by which we could secure a suitable supply at less cost, and, as it is essential that the school be provided with this service, I would strongly recommend that the Department approve of the proposal.

(RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-5, part 4)\nVancouver, B.C.\nJune 11, 1945.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Shalalth Indian Day School\nSeton Lake I.R.\n\nIn accordance with instructions I visited the Indian Day School at Seton Lake I.R. to investigate the water supply for the school.\n\nTwo sources of supply were investigated (1) a creek flows within a few yards of the school. However as the creek bed is wide and gravelly no water appears on the surface at the school. At this season water was found flowing 2,600 feet above the school. Although there was abundant water at this season, it is doubtful whether the supply would continue through the dry season. Cattle and horses use the stream for a watering place and the water would be subject to contamination.\n\n(2) The second source of supply is water pumped from Seton Lake. At the present time Neal Evans Transportation Company supply their offices and workshops by pumping water to a 500-gallon tank from Seton Lake. The tank is not high enough to deliver water to the school. Neal Evans Transportation Company would be agreeable to supplying water to the school at a rate of $2.00 per month, provided the Indian Department would move the tank to a higher elevation, supply a float switch for the tank and make all the necessary connections. This work would cost $150.00.\n\nAs Neal Evans Transportation Company is a reliable concern, this arrangement is recommended provided that the rates are satisfactory to the Indian Department. The Neal Evans Transportation Company have agreed to submit this proposal in a letter if requested. It is estimated that fifteen gallons per day would supply the requirements of the school.\n\nJ.A. Mackenzie\nSenior Assistant Engineer\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file S41-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMR.

Kindly advise us of your wishes in this matter.\n\n13/7/45.\n\nJ.M.W.\n\nI.A.1766-18\n\nJuly 9th, 1945.\n\nRe: SHALALTH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nSETON LAKE I.R.\n\nJUL 14 1945\n\nAttached in duplicate is a report dated June 11th from Mr. Mackenzie dealing with a proposal to supply water to the Shalalth Indian Day School.\n\nIt is recommended that the requirements of fifty gallons per day be obtained from a storage tank owned by the Neal Evans Transportation Company. The work involved would consist of moving the present tank to higher ground, installing a float switch and laying the necessary pipe to the new location of the tank and from the tank to the school.\n\nThe estimate for this project is as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost |\n|-------------------------------|------|\n| 200 ft. 1-1/2\" pipe           | $48.80 |\n| Float switch & fittings        | $18.00 |\n| 250 ft. 3/4\", 1 bibcock, fittings pipe | $25.00 |\n|                               | $91.80 |\n| Labour - Moving tank, pipe trench, pipe fittings, etc. | $58.20 |\n|                               | $150.00 |\n\nThe monthly rental charge of $2.00 seems reasonable, but the Department should have some guarantee that this charge will remain at this figure for a definite length of time. We would suggest that an agreement with the Neal Evans Transportation Company be executed covering a period of ten years.\n\nA domestic water license might also be necessary to give the Department the legal right to use fifty gallons per day from Seton Lake.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Strang advises that a suitable stove may be secured from the Japanese Division of the Department of Labour through the War Assets Corporation. No indication is given as to the cost of one of these stoves, but I would appreciate authority to purchase one should the price be reasonable.\n\nD.M.

Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\n744 W. Hastings St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile No. 24708-67\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 29th, we feel that a ten year period is too long a time to enter into such an arrangement. We would be satisfied with a three to five year agreement, with the proviso as stated in your letter \"or such lesser period of time as the water system at Shalalth is operated by our Company etc.\"\n\nTrust this will be agreeable to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNEAL EVANS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY LTD.\n\n\"Frank Chapman\"\nManager.\nRecommend that Agreement subject to the limitations suggested by the Neal Evans Transportation Company should be accepted. Kindly advise if you concur in this view and if you wish us to have the Agreement drawn up.\n\n11th January 1946.\n\nThe following report has been received from Mr. Webb under date of January 8th:\n\n\"This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of Dec. 8, regarding above project. So far, owing to the fact that the Neal Evans Transportation Company were not favourably inclined to our connecting to their system during the severe weather conditions which now pertain, we have not proceeded with this project. As soon as weather becomes more favourable work will be put under way and completed.\n\n\"I have discussed with Provincial Water Rights Branch the question whether water license will be needed and on their advice have made arrangements for the obtaining of the necessary license.\n\n\"The Neal Evans Transportation Company are not inclined to enter into an agreement for a period of 10 years. I have discussed this matter with Indian Commissioner McKay, who considered that an agreement for a period of 5 years is all that could be expected. With this in mind, I am forwarding you herewith copy of letter from the Neal Evans Trans. Co., dated 2nd January, in which you will note that they would be satisfied with a 3 to 5 year agreement with a proviso that such agreement would be for such lesser period of time as the water system at Shalalth is operated by their Company. This latter suggestion was made by us to meet the objections of the Company to entering into an agreement which might bind them if at some future date they ceased to operate at Shalalth.\n\n\"Will you please advise at your earliest convenience as to whether or not the proposal made by the Company is agreeable so that I may acknowledge their letter.\"\n\nA copy of letter from the Neal Evans Transportation Co., dated Jan. 2nd, is attached in duplicate. We believe that an agreement to deliver water to the School during a period of five years or during such lesser period as the water system is operated by the Company and to maintain the water rate at $2.00 per month for this period is as much as we can expect to obtain.\n\nIn the event of the sale of the assets of this Company it would be necessary to negotiate another agreement with the new owners, and if the use of the system should be discontinued by the Company, Indian Affairs would lose their water supply.

(RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-5, part 4)\nRe: WATER SUPPLY - SHALALTH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nSETON LAKE I. R. No. 1\n\nReferring to your notation on copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs dated 18th January, we are now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Webb dated February 5th in which the matter of an agreement with the Neal Evans Transportation Company is discussed as follows:\n\n\"This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 1st February asking me to prepare and forward a draft agreement embodying the conditions and mentioning the water licences affected. As you know, we have no legal assistance here, and I do not feel we are capable of drawing up the legal document necessary in this case, or that an agreement, if drawn, will be signed by the Company.\n\n\"At present we have not yet received a water licence although preliminary arrangements have been made to obtain one. On Oct.23,1946, the Comptroller of Water Rights advised me that his records do not indicate that the Neal Evans Transportation Co. Ltd. holds any water licence for diversion of water from Seton Lake at or about Shalalth. I doubt if the company will look favorably on our demanding that they obtain one, especially as to dispose of water by sale may require them to take out a Class C water licence and might also necessitate them obtaining change in their memorandum of association as well as paying additional fees which they would be required to pay if they simply took out a licence for their own purposes. While I have no official advice, my understanding is that the province does not consider the cost warranted to insist on licences being taken out by the numerous parties who divert small quantities of domestic water from large lakes and rivers for what might be classed \"Riparian rights\", although such rights are not recognized by law in British Columbia, except under certain conditions.\n\n\"I have discussed this matter with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and he concurs that in view of the small investment by us, the fact that the Company are supplying water more as a convenience to us than as a business matter, and that they are only prepared to supply water while in business at Shalalth, we should simply get a letter from them setting forth what they are prepared to charge for fifty gallons per day. We have letters covering what they are willing to do, and might get these incorporated into one letter. As stated, I do not feel the Company would be justified in representing that the transportation is considerable expense if the school is to be supplied.\"\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq., Director,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nWe believe that it is unnecessary to consider any action that would cause additional expense and trouble to the Neal Evans Transportation Company, as the benefits to accrue to the Company under the arrangement with Indian Affairs would not recoup these for such outlay. It seems correct that permission for the use by Indian Affairs, of water delivered through the Company system, would be in the nature of a favor and nothing should be done which might lead to reconsideration and cancellation of this privilege.\n\nAs the arrangements to date appear to have been handled from Mr. Webb's office, we suggest that he be authorized to acknowledge the letters of August 20th and January 2nd from the Company, and state that the conditions outlined in these two letters are accepted and no formal agreement will be executed.\n\nWe have consulted the Departmental Solicitor, who approves this arrangement. Will you please authorize this procedure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nOttawa, March 15, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Water Supply, Shalalth Indian Day School,\nSeton Lake Indian Reserve, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of March 12, we approve Mr. Webb being authorized to acknowledge the letters of August 30 and January 2 from the Neal Evans Transportation Company, stating that the conditions outlined in these two letters are accepted and no formal agreement will be executed.\n\nDirector.\n744 W.

This work will have to be done by Indians on an hourly wage basis so I am unable to quote the exact cost but feel that $75.00 should cover this work and would recommend authority be granted to spend that amount.\n\nD.

I told him to get estimates on the lumber that it would require and he has now sent me an estimate of $250.25.\n\nMr. Finnegan has undertaken to be responsible for the erection, if the Department will provide the necessary material.\n\nMr. Gains and I talked this matter over and came to the conclusion that it certainly would be more satisfactory, if there was a house for the teacher, where he could stop and board himself or herself, as the case might be, as the only stopping house at the present time is Mr. Rebagliati's, which is certainly not very congenial.\n\nWe have, of course, to take into consideration the fact that whilst Mr. Finnegan is there the house will be very useful, but perhaps if there is a change of teachers, the next one might not want to back, still as long as things are as they are at present, I would like to recommend that a building be provided for this purpose.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter its earliest attention, as it is very necessary to get the building erected as soon as possible before the cold weather comes, if it is decided to build one.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Her return for the last quarter indicates a good attendance and conditions at the school are satisfactory. I have not had an opportunity to visit this school since the opening. Arrangements have been made for a suitable supply of wood for the school and necessary drugs are being requisitioned. Arrangements are also under way for tuition in manual training for the pupils of the school and a requisition for necessary equipment and supplies has been submitted for approval.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMrs. Bertha Hugh, teacher of the Seton Lake Indian Day School has suggested that her husband, who is teacher of the Provincial white school at Shalalth, devote a short period of each week for instruction in manual training for the pupils of the Indian Day School and that she, in return, instruct the white pupils in domestic science. This proposal would appear to have considerable merit and is approved by the Provincial School Inspector and the Indian Agent. I would recommend that the Department approve of the arrangement.\n\nIt will be necessary to supply various tools and supplies to the Indian Day School, the cost of which should not exceed $80.00. If the proposal meets with the approval of the Department it would be appreciated if you would approve an expenditure of this amount from the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nD. M.

As you know we have a big Hospital at Lytton & attend to many Indians who may come in for treatment. Dr. Sarson is our visiting Surgeon & I am general Medical Superintendent but the work takes up so much of my time that I must give it up and we wish to have a medical man in charge who will also be responsible for the Indians of our Mission. I have applied to the S.P.C. and the S. P. C. K. at home through the Bishop asking them to make us a grant of \u00a3150 -0 -0 a year towards the salary of a regular fully qualified medical missionary & then I meant to write the Indian Department asking them to make a grant of $600-$600.00 per year towards the salary of a medical man in charge of this district from Spuzzum to Spences Bridge & from here to Foster's Bar-within 20 miles of Lillooet & also intended asking the Indian Department for an annual grant towards the medical supplies. These are the main features of what we have been trying to do & the home societies have favourably received our application and at their annual meeting in March will, we hope make us the grant we have asked for and send us one semi-anl.\n\nI feel sure that this is the only way we can get the Indians properly attended to, you know how the general practitioner out here neglects his Indian work & attends to his white practice, & to avoid a chance of this sort of thing happening we practically make his stay here depend on his doing the Indian medical work thoroughly as if he neglects it we can withdraw the grant from the\nHome Societies. I hope I have made this clear we shall be very glad if this meets your approval & you can further our application at Ottawa.\n\nI do not know whether it would be right to ask the Department to make their annual grant payable also the Indian Hospital account so that the whole would then come from us. I doubt whether this could be done.\n\nI have one other matter I wish to write to you about particularly in regard to the Nicola Indians on the Shulus Reserve. We have a school there and would like to put up a Hospital & a decent School with rooms attached for the teacher's to live in. I feel certain the best way to reach the Indians is to give them Day Schools on the Reserve with teachers who will visit the Reserves & help to teach cleanliness in their houses & also teach sewing, lace making & a few other useful things in sewing classes to the Indians generally, not only the young ones, teach the older women to cut out and make clothes, and so put them in the way of being independent & self reliant. The salary the Government pays the teachers is very small only $400.00 a year, but if they will help us in the buildings we will add to it & try and get thoroughly 60.00 teachers.\n\nThen we want a Hospital there badly, the Indians have been so badly treated by white doctors generally that they have no confidence in them, and we intend that the Dr. shall have charge of the Hospital & that he makes weekly visits there, we shall always keep fully trained nurses there & the doctors in the Valley can always look after any patient they send in.\n\nThese buildings will cost in all between furniture land, pump house &c over $7000.00 I shall be glad if you will kindly go into it & if you can support my application will you help us in getting a grant from the Department towards the buildings. If we can get $3000.00 towards the Hospital & school it will make it possible for us to set about it this year.\n\nIf any of these plans are not clear I shall be very pleased to answer any questions in regard to them.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Signed) Edward W. Hugh\n\nThe Honourable Senator Bostock\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 11th, 1920.\n\nDear Senator Bostock,\n\nI have your note of the 27th of January with enclosure from Archdeacon Pugh. When the Archdeacon finds a physician to occupy the position as outlined, this Department will be prepared to pay a share of the salary; not more than $600.00, which must include the cost of medicines issued to Indians. It is also proposed to give some measure of assistance to the Hospital and Day School on the Shuswap Reserve. It is thought best to confine whatever aid is to be given to the school, and I propose to include in the Supplementary estimates for consideration of the Superintendent General an item of $5000.00 for the erection of school buildings. When the hospital is established we might also give the usual maintenance grant. We should I think be prepared to pay the current rate for teachers' salaries in British Columbia, otherwise it will be quite impossible for us to obtain qualified teachers for the work. In communicating with Archdeacon Pugh I trust that you will make it clear that the assistance to the school building depends upon the Department being able to obtain a parliamentary grant for the purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHon. H. Bostock,\nThe Senate,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to the letter from Archdeacon Pugh of Lytton, B.C., which the Hon. Senator Boetock forwarded on the 27th of January I beg to say that the arrangement for a physician outlined by the Archdeacon is one that could be accepted by this Department. In fact the correspondence with Senator Boetock which led to this suggestion arose from the official correspondence with our own Office in Victoria endeavoring to obtain a medical attendant for the Indians of this district. As Senator Boetock approves, when Archdeacon Pugh finds a man to take the place we will be prepared to consider our share of the salary, which should I think be about $600.00, including the cost of medicines.\n\nI think we should also consider favourably the question of erecting a Hospital and Day School on the Shulus Reserve. Archdeacon Pugh's suggestion is that we contribute $5000.00 toward the Hospital and School. We would prefer I think to erect the school building ourselves and give a maintenance grant toward the hospital. We should be prepared to pay the current rate for teachers' salaries in British Columbia. If we are prepared to take this action the recommendation of Archdeacon Pugh which are supported by Senator Boetock will have been favourably considered.\n\n(Signed) D.S. Scott\nChief Accountant.\n27th January 1910.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley,\n\nI enclose a letter from Archdeacon Pugh at Lytton. I presume you know Mr. Pugh and that his work lies almost entirely with the Indians. I think the recommendation he makes are along the right lines and I would like you to meet his views as far as possible.\n\nYours truly\n\n(signed) R. H.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B. Drummond, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has just been advised by Mr. Inspector Green of your appointment as teacher of the Sholus School. Reference has been made to the amount of salary promised you, which the Department considers inadequate, and it has been decided to pay you at the rate of $600.00 per annum from the time you took charge.\n\nShould Mrs. Morris interest herself in work among the Indian girls and also among the women on the reserve and should results justify, the Department will consider the payment of a special grant for this work. I shall be glad to hear from you at intervals as to your work among these Indians.\n\nIt is hoped that the Church authorities, who are responsible for the erection of the buildings, will see that the accommodation is completed at the earliest possible date and the Indian Agent is being so informed.\n\nAny supplies that are needed for the class-room will be furnished upon the receipt of a requisition, which should be sent to the Department through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. W. Morris, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSholus Indian Day School,\nLower Nicola P.O., B.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn Mr. Inspector Green's report on the Sholus school he speaks in very commendatory terms of the qualifications of Mr. R. G. Morris, who has recently taken charge. Mr. Morris has a college education and is taking hold of his work with much earnestness.\n\nNo salary had been fixed for a new teacher at this school under the improved conditions, as the name was not submitted to the Department and no report on the matter had been made by you. I may say that the Department will be prepared to pay a salary of $600.00 per annum to Mr. Morris. It is said that his wife would be willing to assist the girls by teaching them sewing, etc. This will be quite satisfactory to the Department and, should results in the future justify it, some allowance might be made Mrs. Morris for this work.

I wish to state the supplies are extremely short and I am at present supplying pencils and scribbling myself. I may state that there is absolutely nothing in school supplies here; with the exception of a few second class primes. I should esteem it a favour if you would send at your earliest convenience a full outfit of supplies for the 1, 2, 3 classes. As soon as the house is complete my hope remains to have a class for girls at night. She is at present helping me with the Infants. I am starting a music night class on Monday. Should I be justified in using the children's supplies for this purpose. Would you kindly inform me to whom I am directly responsible for the School. I would like to state without casting any slur upon my predecessor that the School life of my children...\nI have the honor\nTo Be Sir\nYour obedient servant\nR. E.

A cheque for $150.00, which is one quarter's salary up to the 31st of March, is being sent you. You will be good enough to forward a return for this period and on June the 30th, the end of the current quarter, you should submit another return, upon the receipt of which payment of another quarter's salary will be made.

I may state further that at the present time my wife and two children are living without the proper necessities of life. I have written two letters to the Indian Agent at Sutton but have received no reply; hence I could send in no. I cannot return as there\nno forms here to fill in.

(RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, April 25, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to our conversation when you were in Ottawa recently in reference to the salaries paid at the Sholus and Lytton Day Schools I beg to state as follows:\n\nOn February 12th, last, upon receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector A. E. Green on the Sholus School, in which the qualifications and work of Mr. R. C. Morris were spoken of in very commendatory terms, and as no salary had been fixed for Mr. Morris, the Department decided to pay him at the rate of $600.00 per annum and further to allow Mr. Morris a special grant for her work among the Indian girls and the women on the reserve, should future reports justify the Department in making such a grant. It is considered, therefore, that this is a fair salary at the commencement for Mr. Morris, when it is taken into consideration that he has also a residence provided.\n\nWith reference to the Lytton School, which is in charge of Miss Blachford, I beg to say that the salary paid now is $400.00 per annum, which is the usual Departmental grant to teachers of day schools in British Columbia. It must be remembered that Miss Blachford has no professional qualifications and also that the attendance at this school\n\nVen. Archdeacon Edward W. W. Pugh,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 1)\nis comparatively low. No returns have been received since the September quarter, last, but the last two which came to hand showed an average attendance of six and seven respectively. The Department recognizes that Miss Blanchford is a faithful worker and, should she be able to show in future returns any substantial increase in the enrolment and average attendance, the Department will be prepared to consider the granting to her of some increase over her present salary.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to request the teacher of both the Sholus and Lytton schools to forward duplicates of their returns for the December and March quarters in order that payment of the salaries due for these two periods may be made. These returns should be sent direct by the teachers to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, April 18, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn reply to the inquiry contained in your memorandum of the 17th instant I beg to say that I have no means of finding out how far Archdeacon Pugh's jurisdiction extends, but there are only two Church of England day schools in the Lytton Agency, one at Lytton and the other at Sholus. The teacher at Lytton is paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum and the Sholus teacher receives $600.00 with residence when completed. The Sholus school is in charge of Mr. R. C. Morris, whose wife assists him in the work. I should say that until Mr. Morris, who recently took charge, can show some results it would not be well to make an increase. Mr. Agent Drummond was informed that the Department would be prepared to pay this amount to Mr. Morris and that if his wife assisted in teaching sewing to the girls, etc., and the results justify it some allowance might be made her for her work. The Department has nothing to do with fixing the salaries at the boarding and industrial schools under Archdeacon Pugh's jurisdiction.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will not be a complete list and any further articles needed will be gladly supplied upon receipt of requisitions on the forms provided, a supply of which is being sent you. The school material will also be supplied for the night classes.\n\nAs to the responsibility to which you refer I may say that you should report direct to the Department in all matters relating to the school through the medium of the Indian Agent, who, as the representative of the Department, is required to give you such assistance as may lie in his power.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the buildings will be completed in a satisfactory manner at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

Sir,\n\nWhen you next visit Sholus, which you propose to do in the near future, the Department would like you to consult with Ven. Archdeacon Pugh in reference to the attendance at this school.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh, M.A.,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have gone into the matter of your letter very carefully with both the Rev. G.S. Benson and Mr. Indian Agent O'Gorman with regard to the attendance at the Shulus Indian Day School. Mr. Benson has already written to Mr. O'Gorman several times drawing his attention to the fact that the average daily attendance is not what it ought to be, and has asked his assistance to enforce a more regular attendance, and he and Mr. Benson and the Chief have made some visits to the various houses on the Reserve to try and insist on the parents sending their children to School regularly, so far without any success, and the attendance today is worse than ever as so many of the parents are away and have taken their children with them to various fishing places and Big Island. So my mind, and both Mr. Benson and Mr. O'Gorman agree with me, the only thing we can do is make an example of some of the parents and send to the Indian Industrial School most children who constantly refuse to attend the Day School. It is no use to keep on complaining that the Department will do nothing and then never do anything, like white people they naturally conclude that nothing will be done and pay no attention to what is said to them. Will you please enforce the act. I had hoped to see Mr. Inspector Comanahop but unfortunately whenever he has been in Lytton I have been away.\n\nI can suggest no better system than the one set up now at Shulus. Mr. Benson is an Oxford graduate with some good experience as a teacher.\nDiocese of New Westminster, B.C.\n\nBishop\u2014The Right Rev. A.

Mr. Green teaches some part of every day, and goes to the houses of the children to try and bring them to the School, and at the same time keeps Mr. Graham informed as to the condition of affairs. Miss Williams to my mind has done more in the way of teaching the children than anyone we have ever had and has brought them on better. The present is an unfortunate time as so many of the Indians in B.C. are being excited by unscrupulous people over the Indian Lands question, so that it is difficult to deal with them and influence them, and unfortunately the Nicola Valley is one of the hotbeds of this fomentation. In Lytton it is different and I have them more in hand as I live amongst them, and they have absolute confidence in me as they have known me for so long, and I have told them that the Government at Ottawa has their grievance at heart and is anxious to what is right for them all; but in other parts of B.C. this is far from the doctrine that is preached to them. I really think that if you deal with them with a firm hand by sending up Mr. Green you will find that a lot of this carelessness will stop, he is able to influence them and at the same time to keep their confidence as he is always so quiet with them. It would be a great wrong to treat the Nicola School harshly as it has not had a proper treatment at this present time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. S.

Miss Waghorn sent in her resignation to me and also to the Indian Agent who advised me to accept it as she was evidently a person hard to get on with. At the time I told him Miss Williams would take on the work at the School, apparently this fact slipped Mr. Graham's memory, and on the day he called at the School Miss Williams had gone into Merritt to see the Provincial Iey School there and so Mr. Graham did not meet her, and the Revd. F.E. Eteson was taking the School that afternoon. I have no desire to change the plan I laid before the Department when I made request for the grant towards the buildings, viz., \"that the Principal should be a Clergyman holding a University degree and that he should also have someone else at the School with him.\" The Revd. F.E. Eteson is a Master of Arts of Oxford, and has had four years experience as a Teacher, while Miss Williams is a graduate of Ambleside Teachers College and also holds Certificates of the Royal Horticultural Society as a fully qualified Gardiner. I am most anxious that the Shulus Iey School should be a success and am prepared to do all I can to make it so, and I am quite sure that when the Inspector of Indian Schools, the Revd. W.F.

Mr. Eteson has been placed in charge as teacher.\n\nIt is desired to know whether it is your wish that Mr. Eteson should be the regularly appointed teacher of this school. It appears to the Department that it would probably hardly be possible for him to give the necessary attention to this work in addition to his mission duties. As you are aware a salary of $600.00 is paid at this school and for this sum the Department considers that it should obtain the services of one who could give practically his whole time to the school.

E. W. W. Pugh, to go to Lytton, that he might consult with me regarding \"Shulus\" Indian Day School. So when in that Agency I went to Lytton on Feb. 25th., and had a long interview with Archdeacon Pugh.\n\nThe trouble at Shulus is between the teacher Miss. Waghorn, and the missionary in charge of the tribe, Rev. Mr. Eaton. Miss. Waghorn was engaged last October by the Right Rev. A. U. Be Fencier, Bishop of New Westminster, and sent to take charge of the school. At the close of the December quarter Mr. Eaton insisted that she should be entered in the report as Principal, and the real teacher, Miss. Waghorn, as assistant. She rebelled at this and in January sent in her resignation to Mr. Pugh. At first he refused to accept it, and wished her to reconsider the same. But as they continued to disagree the Archdeacon wrote Miss. Waghorn on Feb. 24th., the day before I arrived, accepting her resignation to take effect on February 28th. All admit that Miss. Waghorn is an excellent teacher, but it is important that there should be harmony between the teacher and the missionary working among the same people.\n\nThe Archdeacon now requests that the clergyman in charge, Rev. Mr. Eaton, be the acknowledged Principal of Shulus School, and will impart religious instruction, and have an assistant to teach. I have asked Mr. Pugh to make it clear to the clergyman that if he is Principal he will be expected to attend the school daily, and that we must look to him to be responsible for the proper running of the school, and for a reasonable average attendance.\n\nMr. Pugh assures me this shall be done, and a journal kept...\nwith the register for official inspection, stating what the Principal has done each day in the school.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nB.C.

The third year I accepted the Irene Training School at Fort Vermilion,\nPeace River District when the Teacher went to St. John's College Winnipeg. I became Mr. Dewhurst to the\nname. I got on splendidly there with big boys most of whom are half bloods but I found them most\nintelligent & could even grasp Stokes II in arithmetic & geometry, & I began Latin & French with them.\nThe people of Fort Vermilion wished me to remain but my friend Bishop Holmes only asked me to fill this\nposition for a year, hence I came away. On a visit to my brother in Vancouver last August the Bishop\nof New Westminster B.C. desired me to take this Shuswap Indian School & it was offered to me by the\nVicar Archdeacon Hugh. And here I am.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFrances Kathleen Waghorn S.M.\nOttawa February 4, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the quarterly return and requisition for teachers salary of the Sholus Bay school for the quarter ended December 31st, last.\n\nYou were informed in official letter of September 9th, last, of the appointment of Rev. P.B. Eteson, as teacher of this school, his salary to be the same as his predecessor, namely, $600.00 per year. The December quarter return, however, shows that Miss Frances K. Waghorn taught during that period and the requisition for salary is also made in her name.\n\nThe Department has no information regarding Miss Waghorn, and you will be good enough to state who appointed her to the position of teacher of this school and also as to what her qualifications are. It is necessary to have this information before the Department can decide as to the amount of salary she is to receive. In the meantime the December quarters salary, at the rate of $600 per year, is being paid and the cheque for the amount of $150 will be sent to her address.\n\nThe quarterly returns from the schools in your agency are not required by the Department in duplicate, one copy being sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr Nelson for the work performed during the month of August.\n\nFrom Mrs Morris I am enclosing her letter which I have certified too, for which I have the Rev. Arch. Hughes word that the same is correct.\n\nAccording to arrangements made with Mrs Morris she was to be paid at the rate of $10.00 per month, at which rate I have entered her for on the pay list.\n\nTrusting that you will find everything in order.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Toronto, Ont.\nSept. 29 / 12\n\nMr. Graham\nIndian Agent,\nSydenham, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received communication regarding salary which Mr. Pugh gave me to understand would be $10 per month. I sent average attendance of girls and women to night school, which I held two evenings per week from the latter part of January until the end of June, to Attawin (at that time there being no agent at Lytton). This statement must be verified by you before I receive any salary, also some discriminating instructions etc., Mr. Pugh will be able to give you more particulars if you would be kind enough to ask him.\n\nHoping this will not put you to any inconvenience.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. P. C. Monroe\nCertified Correct. A. Graham. S.H.\nOttawa, October 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant in further reference to your claim for arrears of salary as for yourself as teacher of the Sholus Day School and for your wife as field matron I beg to say that a letter was addressed to you on the 19th ultimo to 215 Parliament St., Toronto, which fully explained what the Department required before any payment could be made. No return or voucher for your wife's salary has been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nR. O. Morris, Esq.,\n515 Annette St.,\nWest Toronto,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to ask you when I can expect my pay and also my Wife's pay for services rendered on the Shuswap Indian Reserve. I have been waiting on this for three months and am in urgent need of the money. I stayed at school during August on purpose that the school should be kept going; this is the return I get for it. My Wife sent in her letters before she left. I thank you for a reply before the 1st. I have the honour\n\nTo Be Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. R. O. Morris in which he asks for pay for the month of August. This should have been a holiday month, as is provided for in the regulations governing Indian day schools, but, since Mr. Morris taught, the Department desires to pay him and I have to ask you to be good enough to request the present teacher to make out a return showing the attendance up to the time Mr. Morris closed the day school. You should then certify this and forward it at once to the Department for payment, as Mr. Morris states that he is pressing need of the money.\n\nMr. Morris further states that his wife performed field matron work during four months of the year. She has been asked to make out a statement showing the work performed and the dates on which she commenced and left off and forward this to you. When you receive it you will be good enough to certify it, if correct, and payment will be made her at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C\nOttawa, September 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in further reference to the salary due you as teacher of the Cholus Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this school should not have been open during the month of August, as the regulations distinctly state that July and August are to be holiday months unless other arrangements are made with the expressed consent of the Department. However, under the circumstances, the Department will pay you for this month, but no payment can be made until returns are received certified to by the Indian Agent. He will be written to today and asked to have the present teacher prepare a return showing the attendance up to the time you left the school.\n\nThe Department is also prepared to pay your wife for the work she did as field matron. It will be necessary for her to make out a statement showing the time when she actually commenced work and ceased, with a short account of the work performed from day to day during that period. This statement should be transmitted to the Agent for his certificate and he will be asked to forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is regretted that these payments cannot be made until properly certified vouchers are received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. O. Morris, Esq.,\n215 Parliament St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your communication 336204/1. I must say I do think this is entirely unjust. The school opened on Aug 1st, the children had one month holiday starting from July 1st to Aug 1st. I wanted to leave on Aug 1st but the Rev Archdeacon Pugh particularly requested me to stay until such time as he could procure another man to take my place which I consented to do. As I have promised the Archdeacon that I would do this I had to give up a business which was offered me in August where I would have probably made much more than $15 per day. My wife taught in night school for a period of four months, besides calling on Indian Women and nursing sick babies and teaching them dressmaking. I would also call your attention to the fact that I also had night school, also that I was engaged at a salary of $600 per year & not by the month. I do not ask you to take my word for school attendance during August; but if you will kindly write...\nto Shurea for Register you will find the facts exactly as I have stated. I might mention her that I was relying on your check to a certain amount to pay off a business which I am taking next week. If you would be kind enough to forward my check next week; so as to enable me to meet obligations as already promised, I shall be pleased to refund same if you do not find statement exactly as I have quoted them. Should you desire it I will come to Ottawa to see you if you will let me know when to come. Relying on your fairness & justice of the place I have no doubt that you will see this matter righted at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have\n\nThe honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nP. C. Davis\nOttawa, September 16, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in reference to the salary due you as teacher of the Sholus Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary for the June quarter has been paid and, as you are no doubt aware, July and August are the usual summer holiday months. I would ask you, however, to inform the Department whether you taught any during these two months.\n\nWith reference to your wife's services I have to ask you for a full report as to the nature of these services and the time spent in the service of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. C. Moffis, Esq.,\n215 Parliament St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have found it necessary through family affairs to leave for Toronto on Sept 1st. As the Rev. Eaton is taking charge & he has been here sometime with me in the school which opened on Aug 15th 1912. I conclude you would have no objections to my leaving. I should esteem it a favour if you would forward my check and if there is one for my wife to forward it to 115 Parliament St. Toronto. Thanking you for your kindness whilst I have had the pleasure of being in your employ.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. B.

He is to receive the same salary as was allowed Mr. Morris.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to give Mr. Eteson every assistance in your power to make the work at this school a success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is to be hoped that you will meet with a large measure of success in your work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. B.

Through August, Archdeacon Pugh has appointed me here as resident priest in charge of the Indian work in this valley. I am a master of Arts of Oxford & took an honours degree.

Mr Woodruffe the Teacher that was there up to the end of 1911 has since left the country, and it is impossible to locate him, so we are unable to get the full report.\n\nI have certified to what has been sent in, and trusting that this will meet with your requirements.\n\nI am\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Last winter we had a very flourishing class of twenty or more who came to learn how to make their own clothes instead of buying them at a store. The teacher was a serious one last year but this year I doubt if we shall get any as every one is working for the war. I am sure you will agree that the work is both useful for the class and a big need as there is no good all round when it is most needed. After last year's effort was so well appreciated and backed up it would be a great pity if the thing was dropped.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.B. Stern.\nSir,\n\nHaving been given notice to leave at the end of this month by the Rev. Archdeacon Pugh, I beg leave to ask if this applies also to my position as Principal of the Indian Day School on the Shuswap-Hummette Reserve, a position which I always thought I held directly under the Indian Department by a legal licence. If it does not so apply will you inform me if the house I at present live in is for the school teachers use as I understand that when the school was built a grant was made for the building of a house for the school teachers use & there is no other on the Reserve.\n\nI am the humble servant\n\nRev.

I am therefore requested by the Department to take this matter up with you with a view of securing for that School, in accordance with the suggestion of the Inspector of Indian Schools; a competent teacher. I would say a lady teacher believing a lady teacher to be the best suited for such a School.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you on the subject, as I am expected to report on the same.\n\nI have the Honor to Remain Your Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Rev Archdeacon Pugh,\nArch-diocese of New Westminster.\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If so, kindly state the name of a suitable person to act as truant officer and also what salary he would expect for this service.

He having to go from house to house every morning and after recess to gather them up.\n\nThere are some twenty (20) children of school age on that reserve, with seventeen (17) on the school roll; and only seven (7) in attendance on the day of my visit.\n\nFor some invisible reasons, there is evidently a great lack of interest in the parents of these children in the school which has become very much more pronounced during the present term, from no apparent fault in the efforts of the teacher.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department trusts that there will be an improvement in the attendance, as the continuance of Miss Hobden's services will be dependent upon the success with which she meets.\n\nI would ask you to be kind enough to give her every assistance in your power towards maintaining a full and regular attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esqr.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nExtract from Monthly Report of Agent John J. Smith on the Kamloops Industrial School, dated July 7, 1915.\n\nI visited the Shulus Indian Day school on the 23rd ultimo, now in charge of Mr. Jack Hardwood, a young man no doubt of good parts. There were seven (7) children (six boys and one girl) in attendance on the date of my visit, and the record showed that nine was the highest for several months back. While there are seventeen (17) on the roll. The teacher informed me that the others were away with the parents camping and fishing and that he found it difficult to get those who are home to attend school without hunting them up every morning. In that way the children attend school in a very shabby appearance, they were not clean neither in dress or person.\n\nTherefore with all due respect to the capacity and ability of a male teacher, it is generally conceded that with children of the age of those attending this school, a female teacher would give the best satisfaction and get the best results. As a rule children of their age get more attached to a lady teacher and they are usually better teachers for small children, they pay more attention to the appearance of children attending school, both in their dress and cleanliness of their person. This is very noticeable since Miss Williams the late teacher has given up the work.\n\nSgd. John J. Smith\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 15, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns in a recent report on the Shulus Indian Day School states that it should be possible to get a trained teacher for this school and that the position is not isolated and should attract a teacher of the right type.\n\nThe Department would like you to take up with the Church of England authorities the question of securing a suitable teacher to take charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn F. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's Monthly Report on the Shulus Indian Day School dated April 30, 1915.

The position is not isolated and should attract a teacher of the right type.

In the event of my not hearing from you I will ask the Department at Ottawa the reason for the delay.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nE. W. W. Pugh,\nArchdeacon of Lytton.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith Quarterly Report of Shulus School for the Quarter ending December 31st., 1918, which I trust will be found in order.\n\nMr. Hooper has resigned his position as teacher of the School, resignation to take effect at the end of the December Quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJFS/S.\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nThe Diocese of Cariboo, B.C.\n\nBishop: The Right Rev.

I am afraid I am to blame about it.\n\nI understand Mr. Fyall to tell me he had told Mr. Smith he was leaving, he married the Nurse at the hospital, and they left to take up work on his ranch in the Nicola Valley. I hoped to get a man who has a degree to take on the School but at the last minute he could not come. Then a man who had been a patient at the Hospital with Empyema, an old Malborough Public School man of excellent education asked me if he could get the job; he is hard up, with very little money only able to do the lightest work, he has a wife and ten children. I felt sorry for him and told him if he cared to go and see Mr. Cairns, the Inspector of Schools for the Province and he was willing for him to have the School it's right so far as I was concerned, he went and Mr. Cairns agreed to the appointment and Mr. Hooper took up the work. I am afraid I left it at that and quite forgot to inform Mr. Smith, as a matter of fact I really thought Mr. Cairns would have done so, that is really what happened, Mr. Cairns as I know now expected me to inform Mr. Smith. Please blame me in the matter and keep Mr. Cairns out of it when you write to Mr. Smith, I really am very sorry and will take care such a thing does not happen again. Poor Mr. Smith is awfully touchy and although I seem to have done all I can to remove his prejudices it seems no good. He has heard me tell the Head Nurse always to give him meals and a bed at the Hospital whenever he may find it a help to stay there rather than return to Merritt, but it is no good. In regard to consulting the Department I really did not know that I should do that, I did really think that after consulting with Mr. Cairns the whole thing was alright so far as I was concerned. I hope to be in Ottawa in September for me hard. With kindest regards and many sincere apologies,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 13, 1918.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nThis return shows that the school was taught during the quarter by R. E. Hooper, who, the Department is informed, was appointed by you on the retirement of Mr. Ryall, who resigned at the end of the March quarter, but no notice of such resignation was received. The receipt of the return was the first intimation received of a change of teachers. I have to request that you will be good enough to state what qualifications Mr. Hooper possesses and the terms of his engagement.\n\nThe Department allows the church authorities the privilege of nominating teachers for the schools under their auspices, but all such nominations are subject to the approval of the Department.\n\nBefore a new teacher was appointed by you, the Department should have been consulted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh, M. A.\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Fyall as teacher of the Shuswap School. I beg to say that the first knowledge I had of the appointment was on my visit to the School on the 11th of September. I found the present incumbent in charge. I was not consulted, or informed in any way, nor had I had any previous knowledge of any arrangement with any one to take charge of the School.\n\nI never knew or heard of the man before I met him at the School on Sept 11th. The School was then opened six days, and there were but two children in attendance up to that time. Mr Fyall informed me that he was engaged and appointed to the position by the Ven. Archdeacon, and that he had lived in the Valley several years and had acquired a great deal of the Thompson language. I did not question him as to his age, religion or qualification to teach. He represented to me that he thought that his knowledge of the language would induce a better attendance of children to the School. I have no doubt, but it will.\n\nI visited the School on the morning of the 15th inst., at 9:30 a.m., there were five children present, two girls and three boys. The teacher informed me that there were ten the day before, and that it was early for the others, who would be in later.\n\nIt is evident that the Ven. Archdeacon consider that it is no business of mine to know who is engaged to teach that School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

E. Fyall. He taught 19 days and is being paid salary for that time at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\nThe Department has no information regarding the appointment of Mr. Fyall as teacher of this school, and in this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of May 12th, last, in which you were instructed to take up with Archdeacon Pugh the question of securing a suitable teacher to take charge of this school.\n\nYou should have informed the Department of the action taken by Archdeacon Pugh and yourself in securing the services of a teacher and informed the Department of the name and the qualifications of the teacher secured.\n\nYou will, now, be good enough to state the age and religion of Mr. Fyall and the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJohn F.

I got him to see my objective. He is anxious to do good work. He should have the hearty cooperation of the Missionary, the Rev.G.Davies, so that the attendance may be improved. Mr.Davies was absent at the time of my visit, but has written me since his return. I am writing him today in reply.\n\nI am quite sure the Agent of the district would lend his aid. He was away from home so I did not see him. I am trying to stimulate to more determined effort these who have the control of this school.\n\nDate of Inspection,-May 5th, 1919.\nExtract\nOriginal on file...116659-1.\n\nLetter from Agent Smith dated August 6th, 1919.\n\nSNULUS BAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school was reopened after the influenza epidemic had subsided in February last with Rev. Geo. Davies, in charge, and who was later succeeded by Mr. A.E. Pyall, who is still in charge with an average of about seven children in attendance. The difficulty of enforcing attendance still exists and I have been unable to secure anyone who will take on the duties of Truant Officer. The teacher informs me that he finds the children willing and glad to attend the school but that the parents of the children are real hindrances to their attendance by frequently taking the children away without notice to their hunting and fishing expeditions. If this could be overcome, that is, if there were any way of severely punishing the parents who deliberately block the way of their children's attendance at school, the roll could be increased and the attendance would be much more regular.\n\n(signed) John F. Smith\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 16th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Cairns, who recently visited the Shulus Day school, states that the children have average ability and that, if they had a fair chance, they would make progress, in the class-room.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will do everything possible to increase the interest of the Indians' in their children's education. The attendance should be regular, and, no doubt, your influence will have a beneficial effect.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn F. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops,\nB.C.\nOttawa, March 10th, 1924\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the closing of the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report as to the attendance, the Department concurs in your suggestion that this school be kept open until the 30th of June, next, when it can be closed until the first of the following October. Kindly inform the teacher accordingly. It is hoped that the attendance will keep up until the school closes for the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nEm. C. Dallin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to Department letter under date of October 24th, 1923, file 154-33-1, regarding the closing of the Shulus Indian Day School at the end of March, I beg to state that I visited the above mentioned school on the 29th ultimo, and am pleased to report that there has been a material increase in the daily attendance since the 25th of October last, on which date I attended a meeting of the Band on the Shulus Reserve. At that time I advised the Indians of the Department's decision to close the school at the end of the following March unless the daily attendance materially increased.\n\nI am advised by Mr. Fyall that the daily attendance has increased from an average of five in 1923, to sixteen at the present time. In view of the fact that there are only about 21 children of school age on the Shulus Reserve, the increased attendance is a marked improvement. I would therefore suggest that the Department keep the school open until the 30th of June, on which date it could be closed until the First of October, as during the months of July, August and September, most of the Indians of this Reserve are away from home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wm. C. Dallin)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, reporting on the action taken by you to increase the attendance at the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you have taken this matter up with the Band, and that the Chief assured you that he will do all in his power to improve matters, and that a more regular attendance of Indian children can be looked for in future. The continuance of the school will depend upon the appreciation shown by the Indian parents in having their children attend regularly. The Department will await the results as shown by the returns for the December and March quarters, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. C.

I have notified Mr. Fyall accordingly.\n\nI beg to state that I attended a meeting of the Band on the Shulus Indian Reserve on October 23, and warned the Indians that unless there was a larger attendance that the Department would close the school. Chief Tom Peter assured me that he would do all in his power to improve matters and that he hopes there will be a much larger attendance in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wm. C. Dallin)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, Oct. 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the quarterly report for the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Fyall's salary and bonus for the month of September are being paid; but you should give him to understand that, if the attendance does not materially increase, the Department will be forced to close the school at the end of March. Mr. Fyall will be allowed salary at the rate of $60 per month, plus any bonus provided by law, while the school is in operation. Please inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Dallin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, August 20th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the Shulus Indian Day School. I have noted that Mr. A. E. Fyall, the teacher, has been instructed to keep the school open from October 1st to March 31st.\n\nYour action in calling a general meeting of the Indians of the Shulus Reserve in October for the purpose of explaining the school situation to them is approved, and they should be given to understand that, if a good attendance is not kept up in the early Spring, school will have to close, as already directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. O. Dallin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Department letter of July 31st., file 154-33-1, I beg to state that I have interviewed Mr. A.M. Fyall the teacher at the Shulus Indian Day School, and instructed him to reopen the school on October First, and to keep same open until March 31st only.\n\nMr. Fyall would rather defer in giving an answer as to whether he would consent to conduct the school for a period of six months each year, at present, but states that he has hopes that the attendance may increase during the coming term. If, however, this does not prove to be the case, I am of the opinion that the closing of the school for the period of one year, sending the few pupils to Lytton Industrial School, would be the most advisable.\n\nAs I intend to call a general meeting of the Indians of the Shulus Reserve in October, and this matter will be put before them at that time, and may have the desired effect, and cause the parents to send their children to school, as I feel sure they would much prefer their children to attend a day school than to have them sent to an Industrial School some distance from home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wm. C. Dallin)\nIndian Agent.\n\nWCD/S.\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his recent inspection of the Shulus Indian Day School, recommends that this school be kept in operation from October 1, 1923, to March 31, 1924, only. He states that the attendance is so small that he does not feel we are justified in keeping it open more than 6 months in the year. He further states that unless the Indians take more interest in the school it might be well to close the same for a year, and place 4 or 5 of the pupils in the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nIf you consider it advisable to carry out the Inspector's recommendation, you may inform the teacher that the school is not to re-open until October 1st, and that it will be conducted for 6 months only. I shall be pleased, however, to have your views in the matter, and a report as to the action taken by you in carrying out the Inspector's recommendation as to the advisability of conducting the school for a period of 6 months each year. You should state whether, if this is done, the teacher would consent to remain and teach for that period only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. C. Dallin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Shulus Indian Day School, June 11, 1923.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that this school be re-opened October 1, 1923, and kept in operation till March 31, 1924. The attendance is so small in the summer that I do not feel we are justified in keeping open more than six months in the year. Only some three or four pupils are making progress. Unless these people wake up it might be a good policy to close the school for a year and take four or five of the pupils to the industrial school at Lytton.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 18th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from Mr. Agent Dallin, Kamloops, with reference to the closing of the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a communication has been received from Mr. Dallin, and he was informed that the Department would concur in his recommendation that this school be kept open until the 30th of June, next, when it could then be closed until the 1st of the following October.\n\nIt is hoped that the attendance will keep up until the school closes for the summer holidays, and we are very pleased to note that the general conditions as regards attendance has greatly improved at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nHerewith I enclose to you a copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Dallon of Kamloops. The Shalus Day School was re-opened October 1st and the recommendation that I made to the Department at that time was that the school be closed March 31st.\n\nIn view of Mr. Dallon's letter, I would recommend that the school be kept open till June 30th, and closed, as recommended by the Agent, for July, August and September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nINLAND AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nMarch 3, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I paid a visit to the Shulus Indian Day School on the twenty-ninth ultimo.\n\nI am very glad to state that I found the daily attendance had increased to sixteen. This is a great improvement over last year, when I think the average was only five. The general conditions seem to be much improved.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would suggest that school be kept open until the 30th of June, and closed from that date until October 1st., as most of the Indians are away from this Reserve during the months of July, August and September.\n\nShould this arrangement meet with your approval I would be obliged if you would make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Wm. C. Ballin.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. H. Cairns, M.A.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nOttawa, November 4th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Agent Helmsing, Kamloops, has forwarded a recommendation that an increase be granted in the salary of Mr. A. E. Fyall, teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, to date from April 1st, last. He states that Mr. Fyall has been very faithful in his duties and takes considerable interest in the Indian children in his care. Mr. Fyall is a married man and has been in the employ of the Department for about seven years. Over and above his ordinary duties he has for some time attended to janitor's duties, for which he receives no compensation. The salary which he receives is at the rate of $600 per annum, plus the bonus. The last return received shows an enrolment of 22 pupils, with an average attendance of 14.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware Mr. Fyall has no professional qualifications, but it appears that the work at this school has progressed under his charge. I shall be pleased if you will give your views as to whether you would recommend that an increase in salary be granted him or not. You are no doubt cognizant of the work which Mr. Fyall is performing. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 402 Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, November 4, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting an increase in salary to Mr. A. E. Fyall, teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Inspector Cairns to forward a report stating his views as to whether he would recommend that an increase be granted Mr. Fyall or not. I may add that the Department would be favourably disposed to comply with your request, but will await the report of Mr. Inspector Cairns before definitely deciding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Mr. A.E. Fyall, teacher at the Indian Day School on Shulus Indian Reserve, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that Mr. Fyall is, and has been for the past seven or eight years a very faithful servant of the Department, and takes considerable interest in the Indian children in his care. This is very much in evidence when making a visit to the school while in session, and he appears to be very much liked by the children themselves. Mr. Fyall is a married man living some mile or a mile and a half from the school, and is, I believe, in receipt of a salary of $600.00 per annum, which was the initial salary upon which he first engaged himself to the Department. Over and above his ordinary duties, he has for some considerable time attended to the janitor's work, scrubbing and keeping the school clean for which he received no compensation. I also find that various little things that he requires for teaching, instructions in natural history or animal life, he has purchased himself, not wishing to trouble the Department, which goes to show nevertheless, that the man has the interest of his work at heart.\n\nI am not acquainted with the agreement made with Mr. Fyall, nor the conditions under which he was engaged by the Department, but I am convinced that for eight years service, the man is most assuredly entitled to an increase in salary, and I would most respectfully ask that the Department give favourable consideration to a recommendation of mine, that his salary be increased $15.00 per month as from April 1st, last, as the man is undoubtedly having a difficult time in making his way and meeting his necessary obligations.\n\nMr. Fyall is a man, whom I have reason to believe would never ask this for himself, but being a man who gives his whole life to the interest of his work, I would recommend that at least his services be recognized by the increase mentioned.\n\nAll of which is most respectfully submitted.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.

The bonus you speak of, of $150.00 a year is a mere bagatelle and is not permanent by any means, so that the total of $750.00 per annum is far from being a reasonable remuneration for services rendered as ordinary every day laboring men earn far more than this.\n\nIn the second paragraph of your letter you state that Mr. Fyall is in receipt of a salary of $62.50 per month for twelve months in the year. In the fourth paragraph of your letter you state that if the bonus is cut off on March 31st., that he would then recommend that he receive a salary of $75.00 a month for his work. These two paragraphs appear to me to be somewhat conflicting, as surely if Mr. Fyall's work in March next, after eight or nine years' service is worth $75.00, it must surely be worth that much at the present time and since the First of April of the present year as stated in my recommendation.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to Dr. Scott in order that he may see the attitude that I adopt, and I still maintain that Mr. Fyall is entitled to the increase in his salary, bonus or no bonus.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H.F. Helminger)\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.,\n402 Holden Building, VANCOUVER, B.C.\nR\n\n402 Holding Building,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNovember 11th, 1924.\n\nJ.D. McLennan, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir; This acknowledges your letter of Nov. 4th concerning an increase of salary to Mr. A.E. Fyall, teacher at the Shulus Day School.\n\nMr. Fyall is receiving at the present time the sum of $600.00 per annum plus a Bonus of $150.00 making the total $750 per annum. He is kind and considerate in his dealings with both pupils and parents. The manual work is neat.\n\nHe has no teacher's certificate. No pupils are farther than the Book II. All work is very elementary. I believe he is getting all he is worth as a teacher. I am under the impression that he gets a small sum as janitor.\n\nIf the Bonus should be cut off March 31st., then I would recommend that he receive $75 per month for his work.\n\nAfter careful consideration I do not feel that I would be justified in recommending an increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian schools of B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Department letter of the above file and date, and I am very pleased to note therfrom that the Department, taking into consideration, Mr. Fyall's faithful service has agreed to an increase in salary of $50.00 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nWith reference to this matter, I presume that, should the bonus at any time be discontinued, that cognizance of the fact will be taken by the Department and a further increase allowed Mr. Fyall in lieu thereof.\n\nThanking you for the kind consideration given to my recommendation on Mr. Fyall's behalf,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

Taking into consideration Mr. Fyall's faithful service, the Department has agreed to an increase of $50 and as from the first ultimo his salary will be at the rate of $650 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nI wish to refer to the fourth paragraph of your letter to Mr. Inspector Cairns and to point out that Mr. Fyall's salary has been paid and will be paid on the basis of ten teaching months per year. Mr. Inspector Cairns' recommendation was not conflicting as Mr. Fyall's salary, including bonus, has been at the rate of $75 per teaching month. As from October first it will be at the rate of $80 as long as the bonus is continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, November 20, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the advisability of increasing the salary of the teacher at the Shulus Indian Day School. The Department realizes that Mr. Fyall is doing only elementary work; but, as he has been faithful in his service, his salary will be increased $50 per annum as from the first ultimo. No other male teacher in British Columbia Indian day schools is receiving as low a wage as $600, and if Mr. Fyall's services are worth retaining, I consider he should be allowed $650 and bonus for the ten teaching months. Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing is being informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Blg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of letter written today to Mr. Inspector R.M. Cairns, of Vancouver, B.C., with reference to the requested increase in Mr. Ryall's salary.\n\nUnder date of the 12th inst., Mr. Cairns forwarded me a copy of his letter to the Department in which he refused to recommend an increase. I might state that a few days ago, while Mr. Cairns was in Kamloops, I spoke to him on this matter, and he agreed with me that if he was approached in the matter, he would be willing to recommend an increase, but apparently since leaving Kamloops he has changed his attitude.\n\nFrom the explanation given in my letter to Mr. Cairns, I am sure that you will agree with me that paragraph two of his letter conflicts with paragraph four, and I would ask you to use your kind offices in bringing about the increase for this man whom I can assure you, sir, is a faithful and loyal servant of the Department who has his work at heart, and the interests of the Department and Indians always take prior place in his work.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your very kind consideration in this case, I am,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nN.F. Helminger\nIndian Agent\n\nKML/S.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to report that on Tuesday, the 8th of December, in company with Mr. R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, and Mr. A.M. Barber, attached to this office, I visited the Shuswap Indian Day School, and Mr. Cairns made his annual inspection. After the inspection was completed Mr. Cairns expressed himself very favourably with the progress of the pupils, and also the conduct of the school by Mr. A.E. Fyall, the teacher.\n\nDuring our visit the matter was brought out, that Mrs. A.E. Fyall is doing an enormous amount of work among the Indian children, particularly the girls, in teaching them sewing, knitting, etc., and to my knowledge she is also doing quite a lot of missionary work among the Indians at Shuswap village, who are sick, aged or destitute. She has, to my personal knowledge, on several occasions supplied blankets, soup, jellies, etc., as well as warm clothing to several of the Indians coming under this category. For all of this Mrs. Fyall receives nothing. I took the matter up with Mr. Cairns, and Mr. Barber's presence, and we discussed the thing over fully, and Mr. Cairns was very strongly in favour of my recommending the Department that, if at all possible, in view of the good work which is being carried on gratuitously by Mrs. Fyall, she be granted a small monthly remuneration of, say, $15.00 monthly. This work has been going on for a considerable time without any compensation, and should the Department decide afloat my recommendation, I do not hesitate to state that the work will continue to go on, as Mrs. Fyall is that type of woman who would not see any of the Indians suffer for want of clothing or medical attention, and is too interested in the children to discontinue teaching them sewing and knitting just because she is not receiving any remuneration for her services.\n\nMrs. Fyall is a woman whose services are invaluable to the Department among a band of Indians such as the Shuswap, who are in a very low financial circumstances generally, and she is very popular among them, and is looked upon with a great deal of respect and kindness by the people of that village.\n\nI am positive that if the Department should approach Mr. Cairns, he will strongly recommend and support these statements of mine, in fact he gave me to understand very forcibly, that he would do so, and I most respectfully submit that favourable consideration be given the matter of granting some monthly compensation to Mrs. Fyall for her time and expense in doing these works of charity and kindness for which she is, I understand, well known.\n\nMr. Fyall, on the other hand, I might state, is a man who has the interests of the Indians at heart and devotes a great deal of his time outside of his regular school duties to the welfare of his charges and their parents.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 1)\nEXTRACT from Third Report of Mr. Geo. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Kamloops, B.C., dated July 14th, 1920, on his inspection of the Nicola Indian Agency.\n\nI inspected the Day School at Shulus Reserve. There were sixteen in class on the day of my visit, and the children seemed to be doing very well. Mr. Fyall, the teacher in charge, examined the children in my presence. He also showed me some manual training work the boys were doing, and with what tools they have at their disposal, they have done some very nice work. Mr. Fyall is well fitted to give such instruction, and I think it would not be a bad idea if one bench and some tools could be arranged for, for this school.\n\nMrs. Fyall takes the girls in sewing, and once a week the children take tea with Mr. and Mrs. Fyall. The children at this Day School are particularly lucky in having Mr. and Mrs. Fyall to instruct them.\n\nThe school house needs painting outside very badly, as the sun has cracked off most of the paint.\nOttawa, July 20, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. A. E. Fyall, teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, requesting one month's extended leave of absence, together with a communication from Mr. Agent Barber, recommending that this leave of absence be granted.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to allow Mr. Fyall leave of absence until the 1st of October, next, with salary for the month of September. It is hoped that Mr. Fyall will return and resume duties on or about the 1st of October, next. Please inform him of the extended leave granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP.O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of letter from Mr. A.E. Fyall, school teacher of Shulus Indian Day School, Shulus Reserve, making application for an extended leave. I also enclose letter from Mr. A.H. Barber, Indian Agent, explaining and recommending that the leave be granted. I also have much pleasure in recommending that this leave be granted.\n\nMr. Fyall is deserving of every consideration that we can grant him as he is a most conscientious worker, and in addition has done a tremendous lot of good and charitable work amongst the Indians, of which no one will ever know except those on the spot, as he is not given boasting. In fact, I always say that Mr. Fyall is one of the best missionaries that we have, though, of course, he is not in Holy Orders.\n\nMrs. Fyall also does a lot of work amongst the Indians, training them in various ways and trying to get the Indian girls to have some idea of house and child management.\n\nI therefore strongly recommend that this leave be granted, and if possible, although he does not ask it, without his pay being stopped. Please note that it is important that Mr. Fyall knows before the 26th of this month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. A.M. Ryall, teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, which is self explanatory.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Ryall's application for one month's leave, I would respectfully recommend that same be granted, as to my knowledge he has not been quite in the best of health, being run down, for some time past, also, as he states, the majority of the Indians of this reserve leave for the hop fields at Agassiz during the latter part of August, taking their children with them, returning about the middle of October.\n\nAs you know, Mr. Ryall is a very conscientious worker among the Indians, doing a great deal for them in a very quiet way, also cooperating with and doing all he can to assist the officials of the Department.\n\nIn view of the above, I would be pleased if you would kindly take this matter up with the Department, at your earliest convenience, in order that Mr. Ryall may be advised in the matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to ask if you would be kind enough to consider my application for leave of absence for the month of September this year. For some time past I have been run down in health, and desire to take advantage of an offer of an ocean voyage, which is expected to extend for about eight weeks, ending sometime towards the end of September. I would point out that during the twelve years I have been at the school, I have never requested or had, any special leave, other than the authorised statutory holidays.\n\nMay I also mention that during the month of September, most of our Indians are away from the district, engaged in the hopfields of the Fraser Valley district, so there would not likely be any harm, or inconvenience to the Indians if the school were kept closed until the first of October.\n\nFeeling that I will greatly benefit in health by a sea voyage, I trust that you will look with favour upon this, my first request for leave during my twelve years of service.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am yours obediently,\n\nA. B. Ryall,\n(A. B. Ryall)\nSchool Teacher.\n\nP.S. I would be glad to receive a reply on or before the 26th, of the current month, to allow me to complete my arrangements.\nKamloops, B.C., Nov. 11, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReport on Kamloops Agency, No.1.\n\nShulus Day school, in charge of Mr. Fyall, is excellently run. Both he and Mrs Fyall are doing a lot of good and no complaints are ever received by this office or the agent.\n\nG. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, reporting on the work that is being performed by Mrs. A. E. Fyall, the wife of the teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, in visiting the sick and destitute, and in teaching the girls sewing, knitting, etc., and requesting that a salary be allowed her for her services.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not wish to increase its establishment by the addition of an assistant teacher and matron at this school. In view, however, of the excellent services being performed by Mrs. Fyall, it has been decided to grant Mr. A. E. Fyall, the teacher, an increase of $10 per teaching month in his salary from the 1st of January, 1926. This will make his salary from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month. This increase is allowed in lieu of any remuneration to Mrs. Fyall for her services. It is hoped that Mrs. Fyall will continue her work among the girls and Indians on the Reserve. Please inform Mr. and Mrs. Fyall of the increase in salary allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. F.

Fyall, teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department considers teachers in Indian day schools are temporary Civil Servants and not eligible for superannuation. Mr. Fyall is, therefore, not entitled to become a contributor to the Superannuation Fund.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. H. Barber, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMerritt, B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to Mr. A.E. Fyall, teacher at Shulus Indian Day School, of this Agency, I would be pleased if the Department would kindly advise us as to his status as an employee of the Department.\n\nMr. Fyall has been teaching at this School since 1916 continuously, being in receipt of a salary of $600.00 per annum during the period 1920-1924, 8 years. From October 1924 to December, he received an annual salary of $650.00, and since Jan. 1926 he has received $900.00 per annum, he being now in his sixteenth year of service with the Department, and he recently informed me that he did not know what his status with the Department is. Whether he is classed as a permanent employee, or Civil Servant, or only as a temporary. He has not contributed any part of his salary to the superannuation Fund, and it is in this regard that Mr. Fyall has consulted me.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate it, if the Department would advise as to the status of Mr. Fyall, and if he is entitled, or was entitled, to become a contributor to the Superannuation Fund under the Act. Not unnaturally, Mr. Fyall, being a married man, and hoping to spend many more years in the service of the Department and the Indians, is beginning to think of the future.\n\nMr. Fyall, I would respectfully advise, is very greatly interested in his work with the Indian children, and both he and Mrs. Fyall spend most of their time, irrespective of school hours, working among and with the children, and are greatly respected by all the Indians of the Lower Nicola. Mrs. Fyall gives her services as sewing teacher to the girls at the School, one half day each week, a service for which she receives and expects no remuneration.\n\nI shall appreciate hearing from the Department in this regard, as to any possibility of Mr. Fyall being brought under the Superannuation Act, and whether or not he is classed as a Civil Servant, permanent, or temporary.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Alfred H.

I am therefore having to lay up anyhow until I hear from you.\n\nI regret this apparently abrupt action after 19\u00bd years in teaching for the Indian Department, which latter has been very considerate to me.\n\nHowever, the matter is unavoidable as I fear a complete breakdown.\n\nI have consulted with Mr. Inspector Pragnell, Kamloops, B.C., in the matter.

To teach, however, for so long a period in one place is undoubtedly a strain on one's nerves. I hope that in accepting this resignation every consideration possible will be given by the Department to the fact that Mr. Fyall's long service has not been paid so highly that much saving could be done by him, and recommend that as long a retiring leave as possible be given him.

Though I have only known him since I took over \"Kootenay\" just under two years ago, I have had several experiences which have convinced me that he is a man of consistent high principle and wholly interested in the all-round training of child life, identifying himself with their out-of-school activities and sound moral development. Of his academic qualifications I have had no opportunity to judge, but he has held his appointments at various schools for some years in succession, and has always won the esteem of the people of the various districts.\n\nAs Bishop of Kootenay I know the Shulus School well and its needs, and I think that he is admirably suited for such a post; he will carry on its best traditions and yet be ready to introduce such improvements as are needed.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Mr. Barber,\n\nThank you ever so much for your kind letter and deep interest you have taken shown on my behalf.\n\nI fear it would be impossible for me to return & take up duties immediately; my health would not permit it after the nervous strain to which I have been subjected in fact I have been in the hospital for a few days.\n\nI may also state that I very well had a conference here with my lawyer during part of which I was present. The result of this conference was that my lawyer advised me that it would be unwise & unsafe for me to return to the district at the present time. I may say that my lawyer knows all the facts of the case.\n\nI much regret having found it necessary to tender my resignation after almost 20 years of service. I would however withdraw my resignation - all parties\nconcerned being agreeable, provided I be allowed leave of absence until March 31st to enable me to recuperate my health.\n\nI greatly appreciate the consideration shown me by Colonel Pragwell yourself & Bishop Wells. I shall be grateful if you will put my suggestion as regards leave before the authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.E. Tyall.\nMy dear Mr. Barber,\n\nJob who has applied for the Shulus School is in every way a good man; he not just a \"teacher\" but one who has always made the whole of the children's interests his own, and never spared himself to help them both in and out of school. If his academic qualifications are good, and I think that they are, you can recommend him for the post with unqualified assurance. He will carry on the best that Fyles gave to the children and yet be ready to make improvements where such are wanted. I hope you will be able to appoint him.\n\nI am glad that this worrying cloud of uncertainty under which you have had to exist these last months shows signs of being finally settled - I refer to the Cariboo Reserve trouble. With every good wish\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWalter Kootenay\nMr A H Barber,\nIndian Agent,\nMerritt, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber,- Re Frederick Job.(Teacher)\n\nI have seen Mr. Job and discussed the work at Shulus with him.

Mr. Ryall, the resigned teacher, received $900.00 per annum.\n\nIn view of the fact that the year is so far advanced, and the school has now been closed for one month, I would respectfully submit that there is no urgent necessity of making a new appointment immediately, and that the school could remain closed until the start of the new term after Christmas holidays.

Therefore, I was unaware of the closing of the school until I received the telegram from the Department dated October 25th, which was forwarded from my office.\n\nOn the 26th Mr. Ryall called on me at my hotel in Vancouver and advised me of his resignation and told me of his troubles, which were of a personal nature, and handed over to me the keys of the School.\n\nOn the 31st October I interviewed Bishop Wells of Cariboo, at Kamloops, in regard to the school, and at my suggestion he agreed not to make any recommendation in regard to appointment of a new teacher until I had given Mr. Ryall an opportunity to return and take up his duties, which I did. However, Mr. Ryall states he is not fit to resume his duties for several months, but hopes to return after some months rest.\n\nI have since taken up the matter again with Bishop Wells, and in consequence now forward the application of Mr. Frederick Job, Vernon B.C., for the position of Teacher at Shulus Indian Day School, together with the letters of recommendation on his behalf from both Bishop Wells of Cariboo and Bishop Adams of Kootenay.\n\nMr. Job's qualifications will be noted in his letter. Also it will be noted that Bishop Wells states he has seen his credentials and recommendations, and is of the opinion he will make a good teacher for the School.\n\nI have not seen Mr. Job, whose address is Vernon B.C., but have written to him advising that his application is being forwarded to the Department for consideration, and that he will hear further in due course.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 27, 1935.\n\nA.

C. Authority is not so good as under the Department of Indian Affairs; but I feel that working in a white school with the higher grades will be more congenial than the work among the Indians, consisting as it does, of so much Kindergarten and Primary work, for which a special training is necessary that I feel myself not so qualified as I thought.\n\nI am advising the Bishop of the Cariboo by this same mail of the step I have taken and my reasons for doing so.\n\nWith kind regards to Mrs. Barber, yourself and family, and every good wish for Christmas and the New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrederick Job.\n\n(Frederick Job)\nSir:\n\nI respectfully beg to forward, hereto attached, a letter of resignation received from Mr. Frederick Job, who was recently appointed teacher at Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nApparently, work among the Indians did not appeal to Mr. Job.\n\nI would be pleased to be instructed as to the selection and appointment of a new teacher, and if the Department will advise me by wire, I will interview the Right Reverend Bishop of Cariboo in the matter and endeavour to have the teacher selected for the date of school opening, January 6th.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Job's salary for the month of December, I would ask that the Department be kind enough to forward the cheque through this office, as it was necessary for me to advance Mr. Job the sum of fifteen dollars to assist him over the holidays.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you, of yesterday's date:\n\n\"Reference letter twenty-seventh ultimo, have Bishop Cariboo nominate teacher, Shulus School. Considered female teacher, age twenty-five to thirty, with British Columbia qualifications, most suitable. If satisfied regarding qualifications Bishop's nomination, make appointment. Advise name, qualifications and date begin duties. Salary ninety dollars per teaching month.\"\n\nIn order that there will be as little delay as possible in obtaining the services of a teacher, the Department will approve, as stated in the telegram referred to, of His Lordship the Bishop of Cariboo and yourself selecting a qualified teacher and making the appointment. However, you should advise the Department of the name, age, qualifications and experience of the teacher appointed and also state the date on which the teacher began duties. It would appear inadvisable to appoint elderly teachers, and, as stated in our telegram, it is considered that it would be more suitable to obtain a female teacher, as our experience in the past has been that elderly teachers do not readily adapt themselves to conditions. It is hoped that a suitable teacher will be obtained in time to re-open the school as soon as possible after the present holidays. The salary, as stated, will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Job's salary for the month of December, I have to say that the cheque in payment was sent him in time to reach him before the school closed for the Christmas holidays. Mr. Job should therefore arrange to reimburse you for the sum which you advanced to assist him over the holiday period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. H.

I also wish to draw your attention to the fact that I no longer recommend individual teachers for positions on the staffs of our Indian Schools. Your best course would, therefore, be to communicate with the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, who would, of course, know of any vacancy that might occur in British Columbia. As a rule when a vacancy occurs in one of the Indian Day Schools, the authorities of the Church, in connection with whom the School is administered, nominate a suitable teacher. The Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa reserves to itself the right to accept or reject any such nomination. Teachers with certificates obtained in some Province of Canada would almost certainly receive preference from the Church authorities, as well as from the Department of Indian Affairs. I am, however, forwarding your letter to the Department for their consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

You should keep in touch with the Bishop of Cariboo, with a view to securing the teacher desired by the Department.

Copies of my letters to the above-named persons are also attached for the information of the Department.\n\nI was under the impression that Mr. Frederick Job had been appointed as teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, as mentioned in Departmental letter No. 169/13/1 dated November 28th, 1935, but it is, of course, possible the vacancy has since occurred of which I have no knowledge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

I may say that I have resided here since 1920, keeping a general store and Post Office, therefore I know all the Shulus Indians quite well and the school children are well acquainted with us. Although I have only been teaching school in South Wales as a pupil teacher for two and a half years, I know that I could fulfil this position satisfactorily to all concerned. I am writing to the Rev. Jas. Thompson of St. Martin's Vicarage North Lonsdale, North Vanc., who will no doubt furnish you with a brief outline as to character etc.\n\nI am Sincerely,\n\n\"Thos.

Barry\nInspector of Indian Reserves.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that Thomas Bevan of Lower Nicola is applying for the position of Teacher at the Shulus Indian Day School & I would like to speak on his behalf; though I am not in that part of the world now, I have known Shulus well for many years & also its day school. I also know Mr. Bevan & am sure he would endeavour to give satisfaction if he were appointed. I know he has some experience as a pupil teacher in Wales & having lived in Lower Nicola for some years has a knowledge of the Indians. I gladly speak on his behalf - even though I am not now associated with the Nicola Valley, where I was in charge of the Anglican Church work for many years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"J.

It would seem that the job did not suit Job.\n\nI have had several applications for the position and am now in position to make a recommendation.\n\nThe enclosed application from David Westaway gives full information regarding the young man. I have been in touch with him for the past year and have confidence in his ability and character and determination. I think he will be satisfactory. The fact that he is preparing to go on to University and is anxious to provide funds to carry him through his course is a kind of guarantee that he will stick to the school for two years or until September 1937.\n\nI would recommend him for the post.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

INSPECTOR BARRY, REGARDING HIS REPORT ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SHULUS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON FEBRUARY 25th, 1936.\n\nWhile the officials or the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa know my views on the employment of untrained teachers in Indian schools on the recommendation of Anglican Bishops, I wish them to know that I have done everything in my power to make Mr. Westaway's work a success. Dozens of suggestions have been noted by him during this inspection. He seems a very nice young man, and knows that he is only appointed for the balance of the term.\n\nI wish to suggest to the Department that in this particular case, AND IF MR. WESTAWAY GOES TO THE VICTORIA SUMMER SCHOOL IN JULY, he be given a chance at Shulus for the school year 1936-37. If his work is not a success when I next inspect the school in the early part of 1937, I shall at once recommend that a new teacher be appointed for the 1937-38 school year. This will provide a reasonable check on the work done at this school and protect the interests of the Indian children. It will also probably satisfy the Right Reverend the Bishop of the Cariboo. I hope that the Department of Indian Affairs will agree with me in this, and I would ask that this letter be kept as a confidential document.\n\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT.\n\nMr. Westaway is a theological student with one year's standing at the Anglican Theological College in Vancouver. This college is attached to the University of B.C. Mr. Westaway passed the Senior Matriculation Examination in Kamloops where he attended high school.\n\nHe has no qualifications whatever as a teacher. I have advised him to attend the next Provincial Summer School for Teachers to be held in Victoria and to take a course in Primary Work and a second course depending on which subjects are on the Programme of the School. I have explained to him that the Department may not sanction the continuation of his appointment here after the end of the present school year even if he does take a Summer School Course, as even then he would not have a Teachers Certificate. I have explained to him that it is unlikely that I shall be giving a course at the Summer School myself, but that if he asks me later when the Programmes are published, I shall do my best to indicate a course suitable as his Minor Subject, the work in Primary Subjects being his Major Course.\n\nMr. Westaway was anxious to take any hints given during my inspection. I had him write full notes of all suggestions so that he would not forget them later. I look on him as a boy who has probably been a good student with no particular intention of taking up teaching as a profession. He obviously wishes to get as much money as will take him through the remainder of his Theological Course, a further two years. The greater part of the time during this inspection was devoted to the instruction of this young man, programmes of work to be covered in the various Grades and Sub Grades being indicated, and a number of short lessons taught. Methods in teaching some of the most important Primary and Junior work were indicated on the blackboard. In fact I believed that the Department would wish me to do my best in the very limited time to give Mr. Westaway some idea of what he should do in the schoolroom, and in this belief I did all that possibly could for this young man.\n\nWhile this young man knows nothing about teaching from a professional point of view, his attitude is good, he appears to be liked by the people, and if he will go to the Provincial Summer School in Victoria this next July, might be quite a success here. In any case I have done the best I can for him at the moment.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge with thanks receipt of Departmental letter 169-17-1 dated January 25, 1936 informing me that the Department is approving the appointment of Mr. David C. Westaway to succeed Mr. Job as teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, Nicola Agency.\n\nI have made a note of the fact that the above appointment is only for the balance of the present school year, and that the salary allowed is at the rate of $80.00 per teaching month.\n\nI may add that I shall make a point of inspecting this school during the next two months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa, February 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department is forwarding a cheque for $150 to Mr. A.

V. Mosher.\n\nPlease extend to Miss Mosher our appreciation for her efforts in this regard.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a report received from Miss V.V. Mosher on her work with adult Indians at the Shulus Indian Reserve. Miss Mosher has just completed her first very successful year as our teacher at Shulus.\n\nThe organization of night classes for adult Indians was undertaken by Miss Mosher shortly after her appointment and I am sure you will be interested in this brief account of her efforts in this direction.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nIn August of 1944 I was commissioned to teach at the Shulus Indian Day School. This school had not been operated for two years hence it was necessary to gather the children together preparatory to the re-opening of the school.\n\nThis necessitated my visiting all the homes on the Reserve and brought me in contact with the parents and young people. After the school became a going concern and I had spent much time in visiting the parents to gain their cooperation, I felt there was a need for something in the educational life for the older people, even if it was only to encourage cleanliness and a right way of living.\n\nAfter chatting with them and becoming friendly which took some time to accomplish - at first they would shut their door and talk to me outside, now it is \"Come in, Come in\" - they volunteered that they would like to meet together to learn to improve themselves.\n\nOn November 29, 1944, the first meeting was held with about 20 present, a mixed company of adults. From then on for two evenings a week, Tuesday and Fridays, (7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) a study was made of Reading, Writing, English, Arithmetic, Geography and Singing. The adults were placed in two classes, Beginners and Advanced Beginners. Some of them could not read at all, but were all very interested in learning, and during the year have made fairly good progress. A few adults could write quite nicely, others had to start from zero. As spelling improved it was found easier to write, and spelling was made as pleasant as possible by its connection with stories. Some elementary lessons in Grammar were taught to improve their use of the English language in order to eradicate some of their peculiarities of speech. The men often brought their problems to night school, as how to measure hay on the stack by the ton. This for instance brought in a review of their neglected arithmetic. In Geography they were interested in deep sea and inshore fishing as compared with their own efforts on the lakes and rivers. A special study was made of all the provinces in Canada with their different resources. During the course of each evening a period was set aside for singing. At first they were very bashful but the more acquainted they became the greater was the volume of sound, and to my joy I found that the sound was \"real harmony\" giving me the idea of a future \"Toy\" Symphony Orchestra.\nFinding that Sundays were spent by the Indians very often in not to be desired occupations, I gave Sunday evening classes which consisted of Bible Study and Singing. The Indians seemed to appreciate this very much, often bringing their children.\n\nOne product of these evenings was a sacred concert on Good Friday of this year when the white people and Indians gathered together in the hall and the Indians gave such a creditable performance that the white people were astonished beyond measure.\n\nFor the purpose of teaching singing it was necessary to have a reasonably decent piano, I was fortunate to be able to rent from \"Lower Nicola Community.\" When about sixteen Indians brought a truck to return it on June 20, 1945, they asked for music before taking it away, and at the end insisted on singing, \"God be with you till we meet again.\" It was a sad moment when the piano disappeared from sight; wondering what would happen with regard to the future and whether I or some one else would be able to continue along the lines we had started and develop a higher culture among the Indians.\n\nWith regard to their social life, they overcame their shyness and as their English improved they entered into conversation quite easily. At first their manners were not particularly polite but there is a marked difference in this side of their character.\n\nCleanliness, as learned through the children and night school has made vast strides, both in person and in their homes. The adults know I am going to visit them and they know that I am prepared to eat with them on occasion when they so invite me therefore they put forth their best efforts to have everything as nice as possible. I find that \"visiting them\" is an education in itself and will eventually draw goodly numbers to the night school (provided that I return in the fall to carry on with the work).\n\nThere was an average attendance at night school of 22, with about 33 names on the roll.\n\nI did find the Indians very appreciative of all that I have done for their welfare, the climax coming when they gave me a \"Farewell Party\" presenting me with a gift accompanying it. I received various small personal gifts and the cry was \"Please come back,\" \"Please come back with us.\"\nNo words could express how much I have enjoyed the work among the Indians during the past year. At times it has been strenuous and hard but there has been a great joy in \"much serving.\"\n\nIf circumstances over which I have no control prevent my return to Shulus I hope that someone else will be prepared to give their time and talents to carry on this work I have so much enjoyed and not find the extra burden too great.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\n\"V. Verlean Mosher\"\nSchools:\nThe average attendance at Shulus Day School remained fair during the quarter, with common colds being the only sickness reported. Increasing numbers of adults are attending the night classes. No sickness other than colds and mild 'flu have been reported from either St. Georges or Kamloops Residential Schools.\n\nG.E.

When forwarding the account you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMiss Mosher, recently appointed teacher at the Shulus Indian Day School, has advised me that it is possible she may find it necessary to reside in one of the rooms at the school until more suitable accommodation can be secured as she has no means of getting to and from the school if she takes up residence in the town of Merritt, some three miles away. It appears too that she prefers to fix up the existing accommodation at the school for living quarters rather than reside at the Mission house, feeling that she would be more at liberty to use her spare time visiting the Indians, etc., if she had her own self-contained quarters.\n\nSome items of furnishings such as single bed with spring and mattress, an easy chair and ordinary chair, a few dishes and pots and pans may be necessary to assist her to become established and I should appreciate authority to purchase these at your early convenience. The cost will be kept as low as possible. Please let me have a reply by airmail.\n\nD.M.

I am under the impression, however, that Miss Mosher will not insist on as high a salary as she is receiving at West Quesnel, which guarantees her $100 clear after paying taxes, if the Department or Indians could be persuaded to put up a small cabin. (Miss Mosher advises me that she is not very particular about the size, as long as it is fairly warm).

Also noticed the pupils clean and tidy appearance. Miss Edith Aylwin the teacher, fully agreed with the department's instructions in closing the school during September. Many children, during September, are out in the harvest fields and berry picking.\n\nG.C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nMerritt, B.C., May 1st, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON NICOLA AGENCY FOR APRIL 1940.\n\nThe Indian school at Shulus was inspected. Very few pupils in attendance. Many of the children were out in the fields assisting their parents in planting potatoes and other vegetables. When the seeding season is over these children will at once return to school.\n\nG.C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nMerritt, B.C., April 3, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON NICOLA AGENCY FOR MARCH 1940.\n\nDuring the month I inspected the Indian day school at Shulus on three occasions, Miss Edith Aylwin, teacher. Attendance of pupils was up to normal. The pupils looked clean, fairly well dressed and healthy.\n\nG.C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you advise the Department of the death of Miss Lily Blachford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School.\n\nIf the Church authorities recommend the transfer of Miss Aylwin from Shulus to Boothroyd salary will be allowed her at the Boothroyd School at the same rate as was allowed the late Miss Blachford; namely, $950.00 a year.\n\nIn the case of the new teacher, however, whether appointed to the Boothroyd or Shulus School, salary will only be allowed at the rate of $850.00 a year.\n\nWith regard to the janitor services I find that we have been allowing $50.00 a year at Boothroyd and $30.00 a year at Shulus. This is an old arrangement made some years ago and I cannot see any reason for there being any difference in the amount allowed at the two schools. Possibly it would be fairer to allow in future $40.00 at each of them. This would not increase the total expenditure. Please let me have your opinion regarding this suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR.A.

Chiefly caused through funerals on neighbouring reserves. During the end half of the month a marked improvement was noticed.\n\nG.C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nMerritt, B.C., Feb. 1st, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON NICOLA AGENCY FOR JANUARY 1940.\n\nThe attendance of pupils at Shulus Indian Day school is up to normal.

Sawyer, Qualicum Beach P.O., B.C., to be the new teacher at the Shulus Indian Day School.\n\nFrom correspondence with her, from enquiries about her and from an interview with her I am convinced that she would be a very suitable person to teach and to train the group of children at present attending the Shulus School.\n\nEnclosed, at your request, are two copies of a letter from Miss Sawyer to me, which will give you the information you desire.\n\nI shall be much obliged if you can deal with this matter as soon as possible, for I have pointed out to Miss Sawyer that it would be desirable for her to contact the present teacher, Miss V. Mosher, before the latter leaves the school at the end of the present school term, in order that she may become acquainted with the methods Miss Mosher has been using with the children to obtain the very excellent results which have shown from her work there.\n\nIn this regard I am anxious that there shall be no break in the continuity of the progress of the children.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 2)\nApril 10, 1946\n\n\"I am a full member of the Church of England. I was born of English parents and educated in England. I have taught for 10 years in India and 18 years in Hong-Kong, where for 16 years I was Headmistress of the Diocesan Girls school, thus I am used to work among different races and among people of different religions.......\n\nUntil the last 6 years I have always taught in Church schools. I tried to go back to Hong-Kong, but have been told definitely that I cannot return, so now I feel that I can offer my services to the Indian Mission for as long as I can serve...\n\nI have been teaching for the past five years in the Boy's Private School here, (A brother lives at Q. F.C) and thus have some knowledge of the Canadian curriculum.\n\nI shall be glad to know as soon as possible if you will consider my request, because I should like to tell Mr Knight of my plans, so that he may fill my place on his staff.\n\nI am very strong. Dr East gave me a certificate stating that I was \"in excellent health\" when I was applying for permission to return to Hong-Kong last year, and only twice in the last five years have I had any medical attention.\n\nI am quite used to living alone and looking after myself and am not afraid of a lonely station...\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will forward my letter to the proper person.\n\nWith Kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) H.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nBFN/IM.\nTo The Commissioner\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn June 1st of this year, I received a letter from the Vancouver Indian Office stating that the Department from Ottawa had informed them that because I shall attain the age of 65 during the next academic year it will necessitate my retirement from the Shalus Indian Day School at the end of June. This date naturally took to mean June 1949 as I do not reach the age of 65 until 1949, and at the same time I expected to be given more than one month's notice if such retirement is necessary. Because of this I made no plans to give up my work last June, and now find myself at a loss as to what to do. The news that my successor has been appointed and intends to take up work this coming Fall was given me by a friend. I at once wrote for confirmation of the fact to the Agent in Morissett. He referred me to the Commissioner in Vancouver who gives me no further explanation of the matter. I now address this letter of protest to you. I have been given no notice in which time I could save up money for such an emergency, so I am now planning to return to England as soon as I can. I have no home in Canada and shall have to dispose of certain possessions, get a passport and a passage etc., all of which takes time. Had I had proper notice of my dismissal I could have planned differently, and should not have left Shalus for here.\nThe Government requires me to give at least 3 months notice, thus I feel that 3 months notice is due to me. Will you please explain why it is that I am being treated in this way? I was in Alberta when the news was sent to me by my friend and it was not until August 10th I heard from Mr. Sharpie, and August 17th from Mr. Arnold of Vancouver. I am on my way back to Merritt now, but do not expect to be there before August 25th.\n\nIf I am compelled to give up my work now I shall require at least 4 months salary in lieu of notice, as I am not free until Jan 1949.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n(Miss) J. Dorothy Sawyer,\nTeacher,\nShuswap Indian Day School,\nMerritt, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Shulus Indian Day School,\nMiss H. D. Sawyer\nYour file 153-3-1 (E)\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of August 25th, and a copy of the above-named teacher's letter which was attached.\n\nFollowing the receipt of Mr. Neary's letter dated May 26th, in response to our letter in which we recommended that Miss Sawyer no longer be retained at the Shulus School, we informed her in a letter dated May 31st that in view of the fact that she would reach the age of 65 in the coming academic year it would be necessary for her to retire at the end of June.\n\nWe also notified Supt. Sharpe that we were seeking a replacement for Miss Sawyer. Subsequent to this we received an application from Mrs. Jane Massey requesting a transfer from Hazelton to some school closer to Vancouver. Mrs. Massey was then offered the Shulus School and her application was forwarded to the Department on July 21st with a recommendation for her appointment. This application was approved by the Department.\n\nI do not consider that Miss Sawyer has any reasonable grounds for complaint and no action in line with her request is indicated.\n\nW. S.

The matter is of urgent importance to me.\n\n[Signature]\nSt. Dorothy Sawyer.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1948.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nI am enclosing for your information reports (Form N.H. & W. 503), (in duplicate), received from the Civil Service Health Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare in connection with the permanent appointment of the following Teachers in the Indian Affairs Branch:\n\nC. W. Jackson,\nDirector,\nAdministration and Personnel.\nFile 169 - 13 -1 (E)\n\nTo\nThe Superintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Sept. 21st 1948 I submit that I have been prematurely retired, that is virtually dismissed, without adequate reason, and further that I did not receive even a month's notice.\n\nRetirement. I knew that I should be eligible for retirement, unless invited to continue, on reaching the age of 65; and I assumed that this would be, at the earliest, at the end of the academic year in which I attained that age i.e. June 1949.\n\nAccording to your letter teachers are compulsorily retired at the end of the academic year previous to that in which they become 65 years of age, in my case at the age of 64 years, 5 months. If this be so, I submit your Department is responsible for the losses I have sustained by failing to make this explicit.\n\nNotice. I believe that had I wished to vacate my post it would have been necessary for me to give the Department 3 months notice. I assumed that likewise I should receive 3 months notice or any decision to retire or dismiss me. According to your letter however, only one month's notice is requisite.\n\nI submit that I did not receive even one month's notice.\n\nIn the first place the letter addressed to me by the Commission on May 31st 1948, a letter which purports to constitute one month's notice did not reach me in Shulus until sometime after the beginning of June. I say \"purports to\" as this letter does not in fact constitute notice to the effect that my appointment would terminate at the end of June 1948. The letter is so worded, that its only effect was to corroborate my belief that my appointment would terminate \"in the coming academic year\"...... \"at the end of June\".\n\nI would again point out that this premature retirement without adequate notice has cost me dearly. I have suffered financial loss through cessation of salary before reaching the age of 65. I was obliged to return to Shulus from my holidays to make what was virtually a forced sale of my furniture and other belongings. I was compromised in the eyes of my friends and acquaintances who, like me, received the news of my \"retirement\" so suddenly that it bore at least the resemblance of dismissal.\n\nSuperannuation. I have now received a cheque for $145.58 \"being refund of Retirement Fund\", which I have returned to the Chief Treasury Officer as inadequate.\n\nI submit that I am entitled to \"one month's pay for each year of service\" according to the terms of the Civil Service Superannuation Act; the refund...\nof premiums which has been sent to me would only be justifiable if I had been dismissed or had voluntarily retired.\n\nI therefore repeat my request for reasonable financial treatment both in regard to salary in lieu of notice, and superannuation benefit.\n\nUnless I receive satisfaction within the course of this month I shall feel obliged to take steps for the matter to be raised in the House of Commons.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Miss) Dorothy Sawyer\nOctober 16, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Sawyer:\n\nI have just answered your letter of October 7 which arrived when I was absent from Ottawa on a school inspection trip to the Province of Manitoba. I regret that you have not apparently become thoroughly acquainted with the difference between employment as a \"temporary civil servant\" and as a \"permanent civil servant\", as outlined in various issues of the Indian School Bulletin.\n\nAs an Indian day school teacher, you were classified as a temporary civil servant until such time as your application for appointment as a permanent civil servant was approved in the prescribed way. The details of this procedure were outlined in issues of the Indian School Bulletin. You did not, apparently, make application for classification as a permanent civil servant.\n\nI also note that, had you done so, you would not have been eligible because of the fact that you do not hold a teacher's certificate granted by one of our provincial Departments of Education. While we are allowed to give credit for an English teacher's certificate for the purposes of our salary schedule, our regulations specifically require the holding of a provincial teacher's certificate before the classification of Permanent Civil Servant can be requested. These points were made very clear in the June 1947 issue of the Indian School Bulletin, as follows:\n\n\"The classification of permanent civil servant for the purposes of superannuation will be applied only to certain of our teachers as detailed below:\n\n(a) Teachers who are in possession of permanent teaching certificates as granted by Provincial Departments of Education.\"\n(b) Teachers who have been employed for a period of at least two years as Indian Day School Teachers and upon whose work satisfactory School Inspectors' and Indian Agents' reports have been submitted.\n\n(c) Teachers who otherwise qualify within the regulations laid down in the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\n(d) Teachers of day schools in operation for a full academic year of ten months.\n\nNote: Married women to be eligible must provide proof of the fact that they are, of necessity, self-supporting.\"\n\nThe Retirement Fund was set up for temporary civil servants and since September 1, 1939, a deduction has been made from the salary of all such civil servants. This subject was clarified in the December 1946 issue of the Bulletin, as follows:\n\n\"Teachers in Indian Day Schools are at present classified as temporary Civil Servants. Like all temporary civil servants a deduction, therefore, is made from the salaries of those who have joined the service since 1 September, 1939. This deduction is at the rate of 5% and is called a Retirement Fund withdrawal. Please note that this deduction is not made from the salaries of teachers who were in the service prior to 1 September, 1939.\n\nWhen teachers leave the Service the total amount of these withdrawals is returned to them with interest at the rate of 4%.\"\n\nYou will note that I stated in the beginning of my letter that I had recently inspected schools in Manitoba. As a result of my visit, we are opening three temporary classrooms as additions to present day schools. I found a serious shortage of teachers in Manitoba and since I have returned to Ottawa, I understand that we may be able to get special authority...\nto hire teachers approaching or past the age of 65, for teaching services in that province.\n\nThese positions are at the Poguie Centre and North Bay Schools, near Redfern, Manitoba, and at the Fairfield No. 3 Indian Day School, near Cypressville, Manitoba. I note from one of your previous letters that you are anxious to return to England. If you are interested in one of these positions, I would like to hear from you as soon as possible. I can then provide you with further details as to location, number of pupils, etc. A furnished teacherage will be provided and you will share this accommodation with another female teacher, already appointed. Therefore, I would suggest that you send me a \"Collect\" wire as soon as you receive this letter, advising if you are interested in one of these positions. I can then immediately apply for authority to retain your services up to June 30, 1949. I am requesting an answer by wire so that arrangements can be made for you to report for duty by November 1, 1948. Your salary would be at the rate of $156.00 a teaching month, plus free house and fuel (to be shared with another teacher).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBertrand F.

Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated October 16th 1948, part of which has been briefly answered already by cable, as requested. It is not now possible for me to accept the situation offered as I have recently made plans for the immediate future.\n\nI wish to thank you for the detailed reply regarding Superannuation benefits, and I note that I am entitled to the repayment of pay deductions plus 4% interest. I should be glad if you would kindly give further instructions to the Chief Treasury Officer accordingly.\n\nUnless the offer of a position was so intended your letter does not refer to my claim for compensation in view of the fact that my appointment was prematurely terminated at the age of 64 years and 5 months without notice; for the letter which I received in June cannot be considered adequate in view of its date and content.\n\nIn law and equity I am entitled to the compensation already requested. This matter having been promptly and satisfactorily settled, along the lines already indicated, I shall then be happy to consider, on its merits and as circumstances may permit, any post which you may then care to offer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Dorothy Sawyer\nOttawa, January 10, 1938.\n\nREGULATIONS GOVERNING THE EMPLOYMENT OF TEACHERS IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\n1. An Indian day school teacher may be notified of his (or her) appointment or dismissal by official letter or by an Indian Agent acting under instructions from Head Office.\n\n2. An Indian day school teacher is not required to sign a formal contract and may be dismissed for cause at any time. It is the policy of the Department, however, to give a month's notice prior to dismissal and it is expected that a teacher desiring to resign shall notify the Department at least one month prior to the date on which the resignation is to become effective.\n\n3. Teachers of Indian day schools are temporary government employees and do not come under the Civil Service Act. They do not contribute to the government superannuation fund and do not qualify for superannuation allowances.\n\n4. Teachers of Indian day schools must hold the complete academic and professional certificates required by the Province in which the Indian school is located.\n\n5. Salaries are paid monthly. The teacher is required at the end of September, December, March and June to prepare a quarterly return and to send this promptly to the Indian Agent. The illness of a teacher, or the closing of a school, for any cause, should be immediately reported to the Agent.\n\n6. Teachers in Indian day schools are required to be protected by successful vaccination against Smallpox, and by the toxoid treatment against Diphtheria, and evidence of such protection, in the form of a certificate from a qualified physician, should, if possible, be included with the application for employment.\n\n7. Teachers should send all requisitions for school supplies to the local Indian Agent. They should notify the Agent when repairs to school buildings are required. Strict observance of this regulation will obviate unnecessary delay and ensure prompt action when duly authorized requests for supplies reach the Department.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nNovember 1, 1948.\n\nMiss H. Dorothy Sawyer,\nQualicum Beach, B. C.\n\nDear Miss Sawyer:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 19 and I regret that you are unable to accept the position offered to you in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nI have requested our Chief Treasury Officer to forward to you again your Retirement Fund cheque which you previously returned.\n\nThe regulations governing the employment of teachers at Indian day schools are quite clear concerning the question of dismissal. These regulations have been in effect for some 10 years and should be found on file in every Indian day school.\n\nRegulation 2 reads as follows:\n\n\"An Indian day school teacher is not required to sign a formal contract and may be dismissed for cause at any time. It is the policy of the Department, however, to give a month's notice prior to dismissal and it is expected that a teacher desiring to resign shall notify the Department at least one month prior to the date on which the resignation is to become effective.\"\n\nI note that you are at present employed but that there is a possibility of your returning to our service according to the offer made in my letter of October 16.\nI have kept one of the Manitoba positions open for you in the hope that you would be able to accept by the opening of the January term. Could you please advise me whether this will be possible or whether I should make arrangements for the employment of another teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It would seem obvious that, if arrangements can be made for these Indian children to attend the new white school, this arrangement would certainly be better than constructing our own Indian school just across the road from their new school. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could discuss this matter with Inspector Davey and have him visit educational officials in Victoria to ascertain if they are interested in such a proposal. The Parliamentary Committee feels that we should be generous in making these agreements and there is a possibility that we might even be able to get authority for a partial payment of capital cost. This latter point is a difficult thing to discuss with provincial authorities as we are not sure whether we have the necessary constitutional authority under the old Indian Act. However, Inspector Davey could discuss with provincial educational officials:\n\n(a) their reaction to the operation of such a school,\n(b) their ideas as to how the school could best be financed.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 842-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIt must be emphasized that we would not wish to have any control over the administration of the school, the hiring of the teachers, etc. We would be quite prepared to leave this in the hands of the local authorities and would pay them on a pro rata basis for the education of the Indian children of Hazelton.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

I am therefore returning this cheque to you for emendation. My salary at end of June 1948 was $156 per month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) H. Dorothy Sawyer\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Shulus Indian Day School, No. 842.\n\nThis will confirm my telephone message in which I advised you that Miss R. D.

As a result, she is now prepared to accept the retirement Fund cheque which she previously returned to you. This cheque can now be sent to her at Qualicum Beach, B. C.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nIndian Education have received a further letter from Miss Sawyer in which she refuses to accept the cheque and insists that she be retired under Sulin Act.

The Department have requested that the cheque, which you returned in your letter of the 7th October to this office, be returned to you.\n\nW. Lauchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nMEMORANDUM TO FILE:\n\nSITUS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nMr. J. L. Gibson, M.P., phoned yesterday concerning the payment of back-salary to Miss Sawyer. There is little doubt but that the notice of dismissal sent by Mr. Arnell is ambiguous. As a result, it may be necessary to pay her one extra month's salary in lieu of notice.\n\nBernard Z. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 5, 1949\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nShulus Indian Day School,\n\nYou will recall that on November 16, 1948, you forwarded to the Department the letter of dismissal sent to Miss Sawyer, formerly teacher at this school. This letter read as follows:\n\n\"Dear Miss Sawyer:\n\n\"The Department has informed this office that in view of the fact that you will reach the age of 65 in the coming academic year it will be necessary for you to retire at the end of June.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\"\n\nMr. J. L. Gibson, M.P., has contacted our Division with regard to claims made by Miss Sawyer concerning the payment of back salary. You will also recall previous correspondence with regard to superannuation and to the payment of four months' back salary. It would seem that the only claim which she now has on the Department is with regard to the wording of the dismissal notice sent her. Her claim is of course that she interprets your letter to mean that her dismissal was to be effective at the end of June, 1949. If you will review this letter yourself, you can understand how it\nis possible to take such a meaning out of it, particularly when money is concerned.\n\nIt may be necessary therefore to make a payment to Miss Sawyer of one month's extra salary, in lieu of the month's dismissal notice required by our regulations. I would suggest that in future every care be taken to ensure that dismissal notices are very clear and that no ambiguity exists. Mr. Gibson is again writing to Miss Sawyer and we will hear from him further when he has had a reply.\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nFurther to our recent conversation regarding Miss H. Dorothy Sawyer, who was formerly employed by your department as an Indian School teacher, I am now advised by her that she would be willing to accept one month's salary, viz., $186, in lieu of notice, in full settlement of her claim against your department. I would appreciate it very much if you would give favorable consideration to the acceptance of this offer and, in order that you may have her original letter on your files, I am enclosing it herewith and am keeping a copy for myself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Gibson,\nM.P. for Comox-Alberni.\n\nJLG:jmer\nenc.\nQualicum Beach School,\nQualicum Beach, V.I.,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nFeb 9th 1949\n\nDear Mr. Gibson,\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of 5th inst.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that I was prematurely released from the service without adequate notice. This sudden severance not only embarrassed me financially but also cast a slur upon my professional reputation. The latter was removed by the offer of re-employment, and your letter suggesting one month's salary in lieu of notice is some acknowledgment of the monetary loss I sustained.\n\nI should like to assure you that in pressing my claim as I have done, I have been motivated solely by a sense of justice and fair play both for my professional colleagues and myself and not in any spirit of vindictiveness or mere desire for financial recompense, although I am by no means a 'well-to-do' person.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I am prepared to accept the suggestion you have made, one month's salary, $156.00, in lieu of notice in full settlement of my claim against the Department.\n\nI am deeply indebted to you for your interest and help. I felt any appeal to you could not fail to receive sympathetic consideration and prompt action.\n\nYours gratefully,\n\nSt. Dorothy Sawyer.\nMarch 1, 1949.\n\nJ. L.

They quite obviously enjoy their work in school.\n\nIt will be noted that the school enrolment has reached 32 and I believe an effort should be made to secure the admission of Grades 4 and above to the Provincial school. I have already asked the Superintendent to investigate this possibility. This proposal would leave an adequate pupilage for a primary school and would avoid the construction of an additional room in the near future, as well as give the advantage of joint education. Since the pupils would have to be transported on the Provincial school bus some 4 or more miles, I do not believe we should seek the admission to the Provincial school of the three primary grades.\n\nR.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6412, file 842-5, part 1)\nOttawa, April 8th, 1910.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nIn the month of January, last, the Department received through Senator Bostock a communication from you in which, among other things, application was made for a grant to erect a school and a hospital at Shulus.\n\nSenator Bostock has no doubt communicated to you the reply of the Department, which was to the effect that a salary of $600.00 would be allowed a physician, this to include cost of medicines, and that assistance would be given to establish a day school.\n\nI may say that the Department quite agrees with you as to the benefits to be derived from day schools on the reserves under competent teachers and to enable you to carry out the programme you have in view Parliament has been asked to appropriate the sum of $3000.00 to erect a modern school-house at Shulus.\n\nAnticipating that this sum will be voted the Department would like to have from you a report in which you should deal with the size of building necessary, the material of which it should be composed, the best means in your opinion of having the work performed, whether by day labour or by contract, and whether a suitable site on the reserve\n\nVen. Archdeacon Edward W.W. Pugh,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\n2.\n\nis available, one easily drained and of sufficient area to allow gardening operations to be conducted, if the soil is suitable.\n\nAny additional information or suggestions you can give the Department will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 11, 1910.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo in further reference to the erection of a school and a hospital at Shulus, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the attitude of the Department in the matter of assistance towards these projects is apparently not clearly understood, it would appear expedient to recall previous correspondence.\n\nIn your letter to Senator Bostock of January 20, last, after dealing with the necessity for two new buildings you wrote as follows:\n\n\"These buildings will cost in all between furniture, land, pump-house, etc., over $7000.00. I shall be glad if you will kindly go into it and if you can support my application will you help us in getting a grant from the Department towards the buildings. If we can get $3000.00 towards the hospital and school it will make it possible for us to get about it this year.\"\n\nSenator Bostock was told that the Department was disposed to grant the assistance asked for and that the sum of $3000.00 would be inserted in the Supplementary Estimates for consideration, but that it was thought best to confine whatever aid was to be given to the school.\n\nIn official letter of the 6th ultimo you were\n\nVen. Archdeacon Edward W. W. Bush,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\nadvised that Parliament had been asked to appropriate $3000.00 to erect a school-house and the Department, anticipating the vote, asked for certain information as to the proposed building. This grant was made and the sum of $3000.00 is now available to proceed with the erection of the school building.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department has complied with your original request and provided the required amount ($3000.00) your application in letter of the 14th ultimo for a grant towards an hospital building, so that both buildings might be erected at the same time, is not understood. True the Department confined its aid to the school building, but made such provision that the church will not be called on for any part of the cost and will thus be in a position to devote its available funds to the hospital. The Department was asked for aid and responded to the extent asked.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to send a sketch of a building you think would be suitable for school purposes, stating the number of pupils to be accommodated and an approximate estimate of the cost. You might also say whether there are contractors in the neighborhood who would be competent and willing to undertake the work. No doubt better prices could be had if both buildings were erected at the same time.\n\nWith reference to the salaries I beg to say that in the letter to Senator Bostock it was stated that the Department would pay the current rate for teachers' salaries in British Columbia. The amount to be paid will depend upon the qualifications and the work done. If field matron work is undertaken the services of those engaged will\nbe paid for, but until the nature and extent of this work is known a limit in salary cannot well be set.\n\nYour remarks in regard to the salary for a doctor will be dealt with in another communication.\n\nTrusting to hear from you again at an early date,\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nThe Mission House\nLytton, B.C.\n\nApril 14th, 1910\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of last\n31st ult., No 336204/1 and also of April 7th No 336204/5\nI have been away from home I had no opportunity of answering letter, I sincerely hope my delay will not inconvenience you.\n\nWith regard to your first letter, Capt. B.L. Willey is a present taking temporary charge at Shuswap, he is really an excellent teacher I was educated at Charterhouse & Sandhurst & is a good disciplinarian.\n\nCapt. Willey is only helping out until we get proper help from home, I have reported things to our house committee and asked them to send out a university graduate either with his wife and another lady or else a graduate with two sisters so that the school work can be followed up with proper visiting on the reserve & that the ladies teach the older Indians how to cook, care for their children & keep their houses clean. Simply the school itself is not sufficient, and a male teacher must have ladies with him to do the work well to look after the while ladies alone although they can teach sewing, cooking, embroidery & house cleaning can never...\ninfluence the children to attend regularly as a man can through the parents; Smeaton Bostock in his letter says the Department is willing to pay the ordinary rate of teacher's salary, if we have a fully qualified teacher - in this country the lowest rate of teacher's salary is $55.00 per month - but judging from Smeaton Bostock's letter I also believe I should think they did not anticipate more than $600.00 per year to this own funds at home have promised $960.00 per year so that I hope to be able to hire three teachers on the Reserve and to aim at doing all we can for the welfare of the Indians in every way, teaching them about farming, gardening and stock-raising.\n\nWe hope to put up buildings near the Reserve touching the road on a piece of land suggested & the Chief as there is splendid drainage and it is a particularly healthy site. I have not had any plans drawn out yet as I do not know how much money we shall have until your grant has been made, for the School building there also I would like one big and two smaller class-rooms with porch and lavatory outside, and the teachers' house attached and the necessary closets and outbuildings, a deep well must be dug and an engine put in to pump the necessary water for school-house and hospital - if we cannot put up the Hospital immediately there we shall have to do so as soon as possible.\nThe Mission House.\nLyttle, B.C.\n\nApril 14th 1910\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of June 31st ult., No. 336204/1 and also of April 2nd No. 336204/5. I have been away from home and had no opportunity of answering either, I sincerely hope my delay will not inconvenience you.\n\nWith regard to your first letter, Capt. B. L. Hillyer is a present taking temporary charge at Shuswap, he is really an excellent teacher & was educated at Charterhouse & Sandhurst & is a good disciplinarian.\n\nCapt. Hillyer is only helping out until we get proper help from home, I have represented things to our Home Committee and asked them to send out a University graduate either with his wife and another lady or else a graduate with two sisters so that the School work can be followed up with proper visiting on the Reserve & that the ladies teach the older Indians how to cook, care for their children & keep their houses clean. Simply the School itself is not sufficient, and a male teacher must have ladies with him to do the work with to help advantage while ladies alone although they can teach sewing, cooking, embroidery & house cleaning can never...\ninfluence the children to attend regularly as a man can through the parents; Sinclair Bostock in his letter says the Department is willing to pay the ordinary rate of teacher's salary, if we have a fully qualified teacher\u2014in this country the lowest rate of teacher's salary is $55.00 per month\u2014but judging from Sinclair Bostock's letter I also in Ridley's I almost think they do not anticipate more than $600.00 per year to His own funds at home have promised $960.00 per year so that I hope to be able to have three teachers on the Reserve and to arise at once all in case for the well being of the Indians in every way, teaching them about farming, gardening and stock-raising.\n\nWe hope to put up buildings near the Reserve, structuring the road on a piece of land suggested by Mr. Chief as there is splendid drainage and it is a particularly healthy site. I have not had any plans drawn out yet as I do not know how much money we shall have until you grant has been made, for the School building there else I would like one big and two smaller Class-rooms with porch and lavatory outside, and the teachers' house attached and the necessary closets and outbuildings, a deep well must be deep and an engine put in to pump the necessary water for School-house\u2014and Hospital\u2014if in course\u2014The Hospital immediately here we shall have to do so as soon as possible.\nAt Sutton we have a resident medical officer, & I also studied medicine at Cambridge, but he does not work for any grant for the present from the Department. He has been here for two months or so before him we had Dr. Scott but he went home to take up new appointment offered to him there; our present medical officer was also in the staff of one of the London Hospitals and intends returning here in the autumn and will get a young man to come out & they will both settle down here, so that if this is away the other will be at hand; such is the present situation.\n\nBetween the House & Mission Fund $960.00 is provided for the salary of the Resident Medical Officer independent by of any Government Grant.\n\nWith regard to Shielus what I distinctly feel is it would be a tremendous advantage if the Government could give us a grant towards the building of a Hospital now so that both buildings could be put up at one time, they must be same buildings, plastered or cemented, with furnaces & put up by contract, the greater part of the labour will have to come from the Vancouver Mills and it will save a saving tons in cost of freight & travelling expenses where the whole lot done at once.\n\nThese plans have Mr. Youell's entire support and approval.\n\nI.

This grant was made and the sum of $3000.00 is now available to proceed with the erection of the school building.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department has complied with your original request and provided the required amount ($3000.00) your application in letter of the 14th ultimo for a grant towards an hospital building, so that both buildings might be erected at the same time, is not understood. True the Department confined its aid to the school building, but made such provision that the church will not be called on for any part of the cost and will thus be in a position to devote its available funds to the hospital. The Department was asked for aid and responded to the extent asked.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to send a sketch of a building you think would be suitable for school purposes, stating the number of pupils to be accommodated and an approximate estimate of the cost. You might also say whether there are contractors in the neighborhood who would be competent and willing to undertake the work. No doubt better prices could be had if both buildings were erected at the same time.\n\nWith reference to the salaries I beg to say that in the letter to Senator Bostock it was stated that the Department would pay the current rate for teachers' salaries in British Columbia. The amount to be paid will depend upon the qualifications and the work done. If field matron work is undertaken the services of those engaged will\nbe paid for, but until the nature and extent of this work is known a limit in salary cannot well be set.\n\nYour remarks in regard to the salary for a doctor will be dealt with in another communication.\n\nTrusting to hear from you again at an early date,\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nMay 31st 1910.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to yours of May 11th 1910 No. 336204/5 I am sorry I misunderstood your intentions. I did ask for $3000.00 for the Hospital & School buildings for the Shuswap Indians, but not for $3000.00 toward the School alone. I understand from your letter of April 8th 1910 No. 336204/5 that the grant would be only towards the School, as you say, \"the sum of $3000.00 to erect a modern School house at Shuswap.\" So I took it that we were expected to put up a $3000.00 building for the School-house itself, which rather upset our plans a bit\u2014turned necessary quite an elaborate School-house. Thank you very much for your explanation that the grant will extend toward these buildings as not as I misunderstood.\n\nWe shall have to delay matters a bit as the Board of Health has rather been obliged to stop with the present committee and shall have to make arrangements when a new Board is appointed. I will try & write again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdward W. C. Pugh.\nEX.\n\nOttawa, February 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to the site of the proposed Shuswap school-house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department can erect a building only on reserve land. Under existing conditions the suggestion to obtain a surrender of a portion of the reserve cannot be given consideration. The Department can, however, with the consent of the Indians give the owner right of occupancy so long as the proposed hospital and other buildings are used for the purposes of Indian education and the land remains an Indian reserve.\n\nThe Department is prepared to proceed with the preparation of plans for a school-house so soon as a satisfactory site is decided upon and information in respect to the accommodation needed is furnished. It would be well to give full particulars as to the number of children to be provided for, materials to be used in construction, heat means or heating, etc.\n\nYou will be good enough to communicate the contents of this letter to Venerable Archdeacon Pugh.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. H. Drummond, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, June 14, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has under contemplation the erection of a new school-house at Shulus, B.C., and an appropriation of $3,000.00 has been granted for this purpose.\n\nIt is desired to put up a frame building of a sufficient size to accommodate the necessary number of pupils with teachers' rooms attached. It will also be necessary to sink a well. The site has already been selected by Venerable Archdeacon Pugh and the Department would like you on the first convenient occasion to visit the location and confer with the church authorities. If the Department has not on hand a plan which will prove suitable for a building such as is required one will be made and Archdeacon Pugh has promised to forward a sketch of a building he thinks would be suitable.\n\nAs the season is advancing little time should be lost in forwarding the Department all necessary information to proceed with the work. A report from you will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nK. O. McDonald, Esq., M.D.,\nInspr. of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, June 11, 1910.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that its attitude towards assistance to erect buildings at Shulus, B.C., does not appear even yet to have been made quite plain.\n\nThe Department will undertake the erection of the school building. The sum of $3,000.00 has been voted for this purpose and it is thought that all this amount will be required to put up a creditable building, heated by a furnace and with teachers' rooms attached, if thought necessary. The Department will await the sketch of a building you think would be suitable with a report as to the best means of having the work done and an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Edward W. W. Pugh,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\nMarch 24, 1911\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI don't wish to be misunderstood from me when I say that in regard to the proposal of the Indian Chief at Shiloh's tract in view of the fact that now Mr. Smith has declared to sell the piece of land adjoining the present one which we were anxious to build, that the Indians give us three acres immediately adjoining the line of the Smith's place and on the S.W. corner of the Indians Reserve along the C.P.R. right-of-way. This was a suggestion of the Indians themselves and quite spontaneous when they realized the difficulty of draining the whole makes the present \"School Reserve\" with our funds an impossibility.\n\nI shall be glad if the Department can reconsider your decision of Feb. 15th as expressed in your letter to Mr. Drummond. We are prepared to expend about $6,000 in Hospital for other outbuildings if we can secure about 3 acres of land immediately adjoining the Reserve. I believe you will agree that we cannot spend that money elsewhere unless later or unless we do so on land which is our own. Mr. Drummond quite agreed with the offer of the Chief and said that he would convey the suggestion to you & further advised that in order to secure the title absolutely if the Indian Department agreed to the arrangement that we pay the Provincial Government their price for what they claim as reverting...\nThe Bishop:\nThe Right Rev.

The land we asked to purchase is worthless from an agricultural point of view but I have offered him $500.00 for the acres, he first of all agrees for $500.00 an acre. Other changes of view decline to sell unless I agree to buy the estate of his quarter section. It has been particularly humiliating all through as the several home societies have agreed to support my application & promised to help in paying \u00a3150.0.0. a year towards a doctor's salary \u00a3200.0.0. a year to a resident married clergyman & other societies have promised help in purchasing & paying the salary of the nurses at the Hospital & the estate twice we have been kept back & one man playing with us; unfortunately the man's health was very bad but his agent told me very last summer as the land. The only other place for purchase the least bit suitable would be across the river this puts everything away from the Reserve where I particularly want it. Since due at the Coach again in the first week of April & shall try once more, if I cannot manage it I sincerely hope you will find it practicable to withdraw any objections to the price of land offered & the chief buyer made over to us.\nDiocese of New Westminster, B.C.\n\nBISHOP:\nThe Right Rev.

W. Pugh.\n\nJ. D. Maclean, Esq.,\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 5, 1911.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in further reference to the establishment of a day school and hospital on the Sholus Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department, while most anxious to expedite this matter, cannot under existing conditions consider the surrender of any portion of the reserve, nor can buildings be erected outside the confines of an Indian Reserve unless on land the title for which is vested in His Majesty the King.\n\nReferring to the plan recently forwarded the Department by Mr. Drummond would it not be possible, provided the Church authorities are able to make satisfactory arrangements for the piece of land marked \"A\" on the tracing, to so place the buildings that those erected solely by the Church would be on the property belonging to it and a schoolhouse, which would be erected by the Department, on the piece of land marked \"B\", the use of which for school purposes has been agreed to by the Indians. This would mean that the Church buildings would be west and the schoolhouse east of the boundary line of the reserve as shown on this plan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVen. Arendoon Edward W. Pugh,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have again to consider the land I referred to in my former letter, which I observe is situated between Mr. James Agnew's homestead but the owner positively declines to sell any part unless we buy the whole of his quarter section. Once again we quite decide that the School Reserve is at present an utterly impossible location for any building as it is flooded during the irrigation season or the great cut of drainage to place it quite outside any but those who are prepared to spend several thousand dollars in sewage pipeline alone. So we have decided to build on the Reserve on land adjoining the Smith pre-emption & the rail road, it is near a good spring of water, dry gravelly soil, free from hoppers and mosquitoes & is to all our minds quite the best piece anywhere on the Reserve & closer to the Indians themselves as being the most suitable.\n\nI enclose rough copies of the plans of the Hospital, School & dwelling house.\n\nMay 27th 1911\nThe amount of the contract is $7000.00 for these buildings alone. We have not yet decided about the pump-house or our electric light and hope to have our engine to run both these systems. The fitting up of the Hospital will amount to $2500.00 probably more.\n\nThe original plans were rather more elaborate so we have had to modify them as at the present price of lumber they totalled up to much more than this and again I would rather wait a bit and feel our way as the land is not our own, still the work is for our people. I have been much away lately and no time to write to you & this work the contractors told me if he could not go as it immediately it would be impossible to finish the work by the fall.\n\nI shall be up north until July, if your letter is urgent please mark it so that it may be forwarded. I fear that only the present plans are copied into the statement, but they will be sufficient to give you an idea.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE. W. W. Pugh\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose, duly certified, vouchers in duplicate in connection with and on account of monies paid out by the Ven Archdeacon Pugh for the Shulus school to date. This is not in full payment of the contract.\n\nThese amounts have been already paid out and although the receipt of the money, is not forwarded with the present vouchers, if the Department so desires, they will be got and forwarded with the next application, which will cover the balance of the grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.B. Drummond,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Ven. Archdeacon Pugh in which he advises that the Church of England has decided to erect the teacher's residence, hospital and school building on the reserve.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the Department will be prepared to contribute its share of the cost of these buildings, viz.- $3000.00 when properly certified vouchers showing that an expenditure of this amount or over has been made are forwarded. The plan for the school-house was not altogether satisfactory and I enclose herewith for your information a copy of the reply sent to Archdeacon Pugh.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B. Drummond, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, June 9, 1911.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th ultimo enclosing ground floor plans of a hospital, dwelling house and school building which it is proposed to erect for the Indians on the Sholus reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you have decided to erect these buildings upon reserve property and it would be prepared upon completion of the work to give the amount of the grant promised, viz.-$3000.00, it to be understood that the school building is to be solely the property of the Department.\n\nCertain modifications, however, in the plan of the school building are considered advisable. In the first place the height of the wall is given as only ten feet. The larger of the two class-rooms provides floor space for 24 pupils, but, if only ten feet in height, the cubic air space would only be sufficient for 16 pupils. The floor space of the smaller room has accommodation for 21 children, but the air space will only accommodate 13. You will see from this that it is absolutely necessary that the ceilings be higher to provide adequate air space for the number of children in each room for whom there is floor space. The ceiling should be at least 15 feet high. This, however, will not add very much to the cost of the building.\n\nThe wisdom of having two small class-rooms in a building\n\nVen. Archdeacon Edward W. W. Pugh,\nThe Mission House,\nLutton, B.C.\nbuilding of this size is not apparent, in fact one teacher would have no difficulty in teaching the number of pupils for which space would be provided even with the ceilings 15 feet high, as suggested. Two class-rooms will necessitate two teachers. The Department will, of course, be pleased to provide two teachers should the attendance of Indian children at the school warrant such action. It is suggested that there should be only one class-room of the size at present occupied by the two rooms, or, if it is considered advisable to provide two class-rooms, that the space be increased by adding a few feet to the width of the building and to the length of the class-room by reducing the width of the teacher's room and waiting room. I would ask you, therefore, to re-consider the plan of the school-room, which can no doubt be done to the mutual satisfaction of yourself and the Department.\n\nI would also add that it would save delay if these matters were brought to the attention of the Department through the office of the local Indian Agent. In the meantime could not the contractor proceed with the erection of the residence and hospital buildings? Adequate provision should be made in the class-room and hospital buildings for a system of artificial ventilation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 28th., 1911.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st. instant enclosing a voucher for the sum of $250.00 in connection with the erection of a school-house on the Nicola-Namet Reserve. In reply I beg to say that this voucher cannot be paid until the Department is furnished with receipts from those who supplied material or who were paid for labour in connection with the erection of the building. These accounts should show in detail the amount of materials purchased, with prices, and the labour paid for, with rate of wages. Kindly advise whether the necessary changes to provide adequate accommodation were made in the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B. Drummond, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, October 5, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nOn August 28th, last, you were written to and informed that payment of the sum of $2500.00 in connection with the erection of the school-house on the Nicola-Mameet Reserve would not be made until receipts were furnished from those who supplied the material or were paid for labour in connection with the work. At that time it was neglected to send you back the voucher sent with your letter. This is now done and I have to ask you to be good enough to immediately have attached to this the receipts asked for and certify the account in the usual way for payment. The Church authorities are in need of funds and the Department desires to make payment without any further delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B.

The Department agreed to make a grant of $3,000.00 towards the erection of the school-house in question on the Nicola-Mamet Reserve. $2500.00 of the amount in question was paid in October 1911 upon the presentation of a voucher for that amount. Before the balance of the grant can be paid, it is necessary that the Department receive a voucher covering the same. Although the voucher for $2500.00 was accepted, it was not altogether satisfactory and it is now desired that you will forward a voucher for the $3,000.00, the full amount of grant. If it is found, upon receipt, to be satisfactory the balance of the grant will be paid. The Department should be furnished with receipted accounts from all persons who supplied material for the erection of the building, or who were paid for labour. They should show in detail the amount of material purchased with prices and the labor paid for; also rate of wages and they should be attached to the voucher for the $3000.00 which should be certified to by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Green,\nInspector.\nOttawa, July 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th and 10th instant regarding the balance of the cost of building the Sholus School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it will not be possible for the Department to pay the $500.00 until detailed accounts are furnished and both you and Archdeacon Pugh should endeavour to obtain such accounts from the persons who supplied the material. Should it, however, not be possible to obtain these accounts the Department might be able to make payment upon receipt of a declaration from the Archdeacon setting forth the fact that he had handed the original accounts to the late Agent and that they have been lost or mislaid and since then he has made every endeavour to have them duplicated without success and you should also make a declaration to the effect that you have searched the papers in the office unsuccessfully. The Department regrets that it cannot comply with the Archdeacon's request to make an immediate payment. Archdeacon Pugh's declaration should also state the actual amount of money paid out on the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nLyttan B.C.\n\nJuly 10th, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nFolio No. 336,204, dated June 27th.\n\nWith further reference to the balance of $500.00 due to the Rev. Archdeacon Pugh upon the erection of the Shulus Day School upon Nicola Mamet Re serve.\n\nIt appears from the statements shown me by the Rev. Archdeacon Pugh that he is out of pocket just $1500.00 through negligence on the part of the late Indian Agent in not having attended to his duty.\n\nMay I ask whether it is possible for you to have a cheque for this amount in question $500.00 made out to the Rev. Archdeacon Pugh or myself, & sent to me to be held here until I get a voucher for the full $3000.00 properly made out with receipted accounts from all persons who supplied the material for the erection of the building.\n\nThat when I have these all in order that I have your sanction to pay over this cheque to the Rev.

Arch. Pugh & he states that he handed everything that was in his possession over to the late Indian Agent, so it is impossible for him to give you any more receipted accounts or detail as asked for by you.\n\nIf it is absolutely necessary I can go up to the Reserve & see the contractor & try & get a detailed account from him, if he is able to give it.\n\nI am enclosing a general statement made out by the Contractor for the different classes of work performed on the said building; also a list of payments made to the contractor Diocesean Treasurer with dates to same, this will show you that up to date the Contractor has been paid $5500.00.\n\nIf there is any way of having this matter settled without all this extra work which will cause no end of delay, & then it is doubtful whether we will be able to get the detail.\n\nI am\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nDept. & Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nBought of S.

C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nIn company with the Agent, I visited the Day School at Shulus Reserve, which has been in charge of Mr. Fyall for so many years. The school was neat and tidy and everything in good order. There were present sixteen children out of a roll of 17. The children were divided into Grades 1, 2, and 4, besides beginners.\n\nBoth Grades 1 and 2 read well and grade 2 seems a little ahead of their work. Grade 4 also read well. This grade was good at mathematics, and the lower grades up to their work. The children seemed bright and intelligent and not too shy, but anxious to show what they could do. Discipline was excellent and Mr. Fyall knows how to handle and interest the children.\n\nI am very pleased with the school throughout, and I know that both Mr. and Mrs. Fyall are, in an unobtrusive way doing excellent work in other ways on the Reserve, not only amongst the children but parents as well. Mr. Fyall gives the children a certain amount of manual training and his wife teaches them sewing and mending besides health hygiene.\n\nIndian Agent Barber expressed every satisfaction with Mr. Fyall's work in every way.\n\nI understand that Mr. Fyall has now been with the Department for eighteen years, but is not on the Superannuation list.

If more pupils come to school, as seems likely, owing to the popularity of the teacher, the desks might be placed at right angles to their present position, so that the children will have light from over their left shoulders. If the desks are placed on strips in the way indicated to the teacher, there will be enough seating for about 24 children. By the present arrangement in short rows several available desks are not made full use of, owing to the absence of REAR SECTIONS.\"\n\nPlease arrange to have the Inspector's suggestion carried out.

You may also purchase 12 yards of towelling, 6 bars of soap, and 16 feet of rope for the swing.\n\nAn amount not exceeding $9.00 may be expended in the purchase of sewing material.

I find suitable locks are priced at $4.00 and Yale at $5.25, plus a reasonable charge for installation.\n\nEarly authorization of this in order that the building may be securely locked whilst closed for the summer, will be appreciated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n(Alfred H.

It is noted from your letter that the exterior of the school can be painted for $90.00. Consequently, funds are available for this work. If the material required does not cost over $50.00 you may proceed with the painting immediately. If, however, the material will cost over $50.00 it will be necessary for you to let me have full details regarding the paint required in order that purchase can be arranged by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nOwing to lack of funds it will not be possible to tar or stain the roof this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

The Inspector further reports as follows:\n\n\"The teacher in this way is of much greater assistance to the Indian Agent as she can assist with community efforts in the Indian village. Miss Aylwin is, I understand, paying some $10.00 per month for the use of this Mission House, which she has furnished. I would request that if possible she be allowed a sum of $5.00 per teaching month towards its rent, and that she be further allowed $30.00 worth of coal for heating her home per year. Some correspondence has, I understand, been received from the Indian Agent in this matter. In the northern part of the Province fuel is provided in many schools for the use of the teacher, even when the latter is Missionary and living in a Mission House. Here the extra assistance given by the teacher due to her residence on the actual Indian reserve is in my opinion worth more than the suggested assistance towards rent and fuel. The winters are very cold indeed at Merritt and I am most anxious that Miss Aylwin be given the assistance noted above so that we may make use of her services among the women and children of the reserve, the Indians being in many ways quite backward.\"\n\nMr. G. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent,\nMerritt, B.

The roofing is past fixing and will take one roll of new roofing.\n\nAn Axe is also badly needed for the wood-shed.\n\nRope for swings in the yard would give the children something to amuse themselves with in their play-time.\n\nAs Miss Mosher to give entertainments for the children during the winter as well as teach older girls after school hours, lamps will be needed and coal oil.\n\nI had hoped to get soft-balls but find it impossible.\n\nI have been trying to work out a scheme to make the building warmer by building a board form around the outside walls from the ground to just above floor level and about twelve inches away from the wall and having this filled with saw-dust or shavings.

Our experience has been that to make effective use of such an instrument it is necessary to have a teacher who is able to play the piano, and such teachers are the exception rather than the rule. If a piano is not being used it would soon deteriorate.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMiss V.V. Mosher, teacher of the Shulus Indian Day School, has since December last been renting a piano for the school at the rate of $3.00 per month. This instrument was rented from the Lower Nicola Public School Board and as they are at present endeavouring to sell the piano the Department will no longer be able to have the use of it unless we buy it. The price asked is $100.00 and as it has been of great value at the school and Miss Mosher has given excellent service as a teacher, I would recommend that if funds are available authority be granted for the purchase of the instrument.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated as if the Department is unable to buy the piano, it will be necessary to return it to the Lower Nicola School Board before the end of June.\n\nD.M.

Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE:- Additions to Shulus Indian Day School,\nLower Nicola I.R. No.1.\n\nI am forwarding a plan of the proposed construction. This has been made for me by a local building contractor, (J.Okert)\n\nMr. Davey expressed the desire to have the classroom enlarged if possible and several changes in its appointment such as dimensions and lighting etc.\n\nIn the enclosed plan you will note that we have moved the north wall of the present class room back approximately four feet taking that chimney out entirely.\n\nThe main entrance has been moved from the south west corner to the centre of the west side. Windows from South side moved to the East side to light from the left side of seating arrangement.\n\nThe extension to the north of 14 feet with an added extension at the North West corner will make a fine teacherage of 3 rooms and bath. The rooms marked bathrooms at both sides of the main entrance are in hopes of inside toilets when running water is put in and will do away with the present out houses, 3 in number.\n\nIf this plan is approved, Mr. Okert will submit his estimate of cost completed to your specifications and be prepared to do the work as far as time will permit this summer holidays. He is a good workman and the only carpenter in the area.\n\nThe plan shows the location of two chimneys one for the kitchen and one for the class room which will also serve for the teacherage living quarters.\n\nI am sure that Mr. Davey, having examined the present building will readily understand the new plan.\n\nMr. Okert will not dismantle the roof except to extend it to cover the addition on the north.\n\nG. H. Sharpe,\nSuperintendent.\n\nS/u\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 25, 1949.\n\nRe: Teacherage, Shulus Indian day School\n\nI refer to Mr. Superintendent Sharpe's letter of June 22nd with the attached plan for the alterations to the above mentioned school.\n\nIn my opinion, the plan submitted by Mr. Sharpe is an excellent solution to the problem. It will be noted that Mr. Sharpe has made provision for the installation of plumbing in the hope that at some later date running water will be made available on the reserve. I feel that this is particularly desirable but it will not be necessary to incur an expenditure for plumbing this year.\n\nI would strongly recommend that if it is at all possible that this work be completed this year.\n\nF. F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nNicola Indian Agency,\nMerritt, B.C.\nJuly 6th, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE:- Repairs to Shulus Day School.\n\nMr. Okert has submitted the enclosed quotation on the proposed work.\n\nHe says that he will start work as soon as possible to have it completed while school is out if given the contract.\n\nHe is supposed to build a new school at Douglas Lake but as they are very slow with accepting his plan he assures me that our work will be first. I might say that he has proven to be very conscientious in his work and has made all his work to a good standard. With the exception of gyproc or other finishing material has used local lumber.\n\nAny further specifications as to material to be used will have to be gone into later as he is very busy with finishing two contracts.\n\nG. E. Sharpe,\nSuperintendent.\n\nS/u\nNicola Indian Agency,\nMerritt, B.C.\nJuly 18th, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE:- Shulus Indian Day School Teacherage.\n\nMr. Okert considers that the job can be done both cheaper and faster under contract. He uses 4 men and himself. His daily income is $52.40 per 8 hr. day. He uses power saws and concrete mixer. On contract he would assemble and cut in town by power and haul out to the school ready to go up. This in window and door casings alone would save many hours of time over hand sawing and fitting.\n\nOn day labour this work would all be done out on the job by hand as there is no power out of town. He has several jobs waiting on him and would much rather do this on contract at the figure stated, but if the Department insist will do it on a Day Labour Basis.\n\nHe is quite anxious to get at the job as he has a school to build at Douglas Lake. In my opinion it would be better to let him do it by contract and be free from the purchase of material with its numerous vouchers and accounts.\n\nMy time is so taken up this summer that I dread the thought of added work.\n\nG. E. Sharpe,\nSuperintendent.\n\nS/u\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Addition to Shulus Indian Day School\n\nWe have for some time been considering what construction would best meet our requirements in the matter of accommodation for the teacher at the above-mentioned school and recently decided that an addition to the existing building would not only be most suitable but less costly.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing Supt. Sharpe's letter of June 22nd and enclosures, memorandum dated June 25th from Mr. Davey and further communications dated July 6th and 18th from Supt. Sharpe. You will note that we are in a position to secure the services of Mr. J. Okert, building contractor, who will remodel the building in accordance with his plan for the sum of $4900.00, which amount covers both material and labour. Mr. Okert is the only carpenter in the area and I doubt very much whether we can interest anyone outside the area in this small project.

Although Mr. Sharpe suggests the contractor's price is high, it would appear to me to be more or less in line with prices being secured elsewhere on similar projects.\n\nIt is considered that the exterior painting might well be left until next year but it would be wise to have the interior painted, possibly during the Christmas holidays. I would recommend acceptance of the tender of Reg. Eagles and Sons for interior painting at a cost of $376.00.\n\nW. S.

All the new rooms in the teacherage need either painting or papering. (The teacher would like paper for walls and ceiling.) The floors should either be covered with Linoleum or varnished. The class room is now a mixture of old and new lumber after being enlarged and needs to be repainted.\n\nThe outside is partly old siding and partly new the same as the roof with old shingles and new.\n\nI had the local painter look it over and submit an estimate. But to me his estimate is very high. I am enclosing a copy.\n\nYour advice will be greatly appreciated.

O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C., July 28, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith copy of report dated July 14th, by G. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, with respect to the inspection of the Nicola Agency. In regard to item No. 4 in which the Inspector offers the suggestion for the provision of certain manual training equipment for use at the Day School at Shulus Reserve, I wish to say I have advised the Inspector that it is the policy of the Department that manual training accommodation be furnished to residential schools only, although an exception might be made where the day school attendance is very large, such as at Nanaimo. In the case of the Shulus School, however, I have examined the blue book and find that last year the attendance showed an average of 9 out of an enrolment of 14 - 7 boys and 7 girls. It is pleasing, however, to learn of the satisfactory work done by Mr. and Mrs. Fyall at this school and, if it is found that the attendance from now on is steady, the inclusion of an item such as suggested by the Inspector might be feasible of consideration in connection with next year's estimates and the Inspector has been advised to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD.) W. E. DITCHBURN.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SHULUS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON OCTOBER 23, 1934.\n\nMr. Fyall has been here a very long time. He is not a Normal trained teacher, but he is trusted by the Indians. His main value to the Department lies in activities outside the actual laid down Programme of Studies. I particularly wish to see regular Manual Training started at this Indian Day School. If the Department would supply two sets of tools, as was done at Metlakatla Day School, and sufficient lumber for making useful articles, the whole costing less than $50.00, a very great advance in the educational value of the school would result.\n\nGirls' Work:\n\nI hope that the Department will supply the Singer Sewing Machine recommended above. Mrs. Fyall, who is paid nothing for her work, has rendered excellent service to the Indian girls by teaching them to sew, knit, etc. With a treadle sewing machine, the girls could be taught to make their own clothes, etc. I certainly believe that in out of the way Indian schools like this the vocational training is one of the most important things for the children. I, therefore, ask that a small sum be taken from the B. C. Special Grant for this purpose.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY DATED NOVEMBER 9, 1934, FORWARDED WITH ABOVE REPORT.\n\nI wish to recommend that vocational training be given a trial at this school. I understand that when the Deputy Superintendent General visited the Metlakatla Indian Day School near Prince Rupert, and saw what we have done there, he was pleased with the result, and wished this manual training etc., carried on at other Indian day schools. Mr. Fyall is just the man to make a success of such training. Mrs. Fyall is doing splendid work with the girls.\n\nI am certainly glad to report favourably on this little day school. I shall try to visit it more often in the future as requested by the teacher.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Shulus Indian Day School on October 23rd, 1934.\n\nMr. Barry strongly recommends that manual training be started at this school and, for this purpose, he suggests that two sets of tools and sufficient lumber for making useful articles be purchased. Mr. Barry estimates that the cost of the equipment just mentioned would not exceed $50.00. You may incur an expenditure to this amount and, when forwarding vouchers, you should mark on them \"Payable from B. C. Special\".\n\nYou should communicate with Mr. Barry and ascertain what tools should be supplied. Mr. Fyall will, no doubt, assist you in choosing the proper lumber.\n\nA sewing machine is being ordered by the Department for the Shulus Indian Day School from the Singer Sewing Machine Company and will be shipped to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is plain that the demoralizing effect of the cannery life, on the young Indian, will mean the destruction of the race. They learn all that is bad there, and nothing for their good. They are away from their pastors and agents and are under no restraint. If we ever do anything to uplift the Indian, there is a surety that they must be kept in their homes. When they go away it is nothing but disease, demoralization and dead bodies we get, in return. Here they learn; are away from evil influences; have their Church and School to uplift them. We can watch and punish the erring and fit them from something that is now dragging them down,-to take their places in the land which so many of them seem fit to occupy.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 22, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo enclosing a request signed by a large number of Indians of the Skidegate Band asking for the establishment of a boarding school on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In reply I may state that Mr. Agent Todd, under date of December 3rd, 1894, enclosed an application to this office which was received by him from Miss Kate Helen Ross for permission to open an Indian day School at Skidegate - no mention being made of assistance in the way of a grant in aid of the proposed School.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nA copy of Miss Ross' application together with a copy of Mr. Agent Todd's letter of the date quoted were forwarded to the Department under cover of my letter of the 23rd. of April 1895, No. 66 N. 2. The Department's reply to my letter bears date May 1st. 1895 File No. 126,932 and grants to Miss Ross authority to open a day School but states that no funds are available for a grant in aid thereof. I may further inform you that an item to provide for a grant in aid of an Indian day School at Skidegate was included in the Estimates for this Superintendency which were forwarded to the Department under date of August 30th. 1895, No. 502.

A Sutherland, D.D.\nGenl: Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nIn a letter from the Department dated March 3rd, No. 126932, in reply to one of mine of February 28th, forwarding returns from the day school at Skidegate, B.C., it is stated \"that as no returns have been received from this school for nearly three years no provision was made in the estimates for a salary for a teacher;\" also \"that the Department will be unable to contribute anything toward the maintenance of this school.\"\n\nOn receipt of your communication I wrote to the Rev. Thos. Crosby of Port Simpson, Chairman of the District, on the subject, and in a letter of his dated April 6th, I find the following:\n\n\"Permit me to say that it is two years next August since Miss Ross went to Skidegate, Q.C.I., and I have no doubt but the returns have been faithfully made out since that time. Before that the Rev Mr Freeman taught the school himself.\"\n\nThe above statement by Mr Crosby would seem to be confirmed by the following letter from the teacher at Skidegate, Miss Kate Helen Ross. I may say that her letter was not in answer to any communication from the Mission Rooms, nor from Mr Crosby as I know, and hence her reference to returns, &c., are quite incidental, and for that reason have greater force:\n\n\"May I beg of you to send me one dozen Forms for Indian Day School reports. I cannot make up last quarter's Report because I have not enough Forms. December report took eight Forms. Mr Todd returned what I sent him, they were not properly filled out. I have not enough to make all out. March included, even using those that came lately from the Mission Rooms. I trust that you will favor me with quite twelve forms. I assure you I will be careful not to waste them. Mr Todd, Indian Agent, was here on last boat. He looked over the school register, and spoke well to me about the school, but I fancy Mr Todd will not help us to get it acknowledged by Government. I trust that Government aid will be granted, for they are the most intelligent children I have yet met with in the Indian.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nwork. One boy of ten years reads in the second reader, and understands well what he reads.\n\n\"I find the children like coming to school, and usually come to school as soon as they return to the village from camp or elsewhere.\"\n\nIt seems clear from the foregoing that default in regard to returns is not with the teacher, and if there is foundation for Miss Ross' allusion about the attitude of the Agent, there is some reason to infer that the neglect in forwarding any returns has been with the Agents of the Department.\n\nI submit therefore that we are fairly entitled to the grant for this school for the period during which it is said that returns were not received.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward the Department School returns from Indian Day Schools at Skidgate, Q.C.D., Sept. quarter 1895 - Dec. quarter 1895. It is quite possible the Department may have received the above returns, but as duplicate copies came to this office, I have thought it best to send on one copy without delay.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C. Freeman, the Methodist missionary stationed at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands, the following paragraph appears in relation to his wish that the Indian day School in operation at that point be allowed the usual grant to such institutions, viz.:\n\n\"For nearly three years our school has been kept open two sessions a day according to law, and reports sent you regularly, with request after request that the school be recognized by the Department. For over two years our church has maintained a resident teacher. There are thirty-two children of school age on the reserve, and there will be a considerable increase with the arrival of the Clow people this autumn. In spite of the wandering habits of the people, the average for the quarter ending last March was \u00a36.5, and for the next quarter, \u00a34.2. In conversation with Miss Ross, the teacher, you asked if it was\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\na personal matter with her to have the school receive governmental recognition. She very properly answered that it was not. It is a matter of simple justice that we require recognition.\n\nIn reference to the subject under consideration I may state that an item to cover the cost of a teacher's salary at Skidegate was inserted in the Estimates from this office for the year '1897-'98' as well as for the previous fiscal year.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Carman\nGenl. Sup't. Met. Church.\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, June 17th, 1896.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant written from Winnipeg in which you present a statement concerning a building at Port Simpson designated the Band of Workers Hall built by the Christian Band of workers of the Methodist Church, etc., etc.\n\nI thank you for the full details given which will receive my best attention and in connection with which I have already written to Mr. Indian Agent Tod giving him instructions to attend to the matter and report without delay.\n\nIt is certainly a pity that such a question ever arose; and I trust that the matter may be settled satisfactorily to all parties concerned.\n\nRegarding the day Schools at Skidegate and Kitamaat, on inquiry I find that Miss Ross applied for permission to reopen the Skidegate\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. A. Carman\nGeneral Superintendent\nof the Methodist Church,\nBelleville, Ontario.\nIndian day school in December 1894 and that her request was acceded to by the Department, and in doing so it stated that no funds were available for the payment of a grant for a teacher's salary at that point. An item to cover a yearly grant to that school was, however, inserted in the estimates of this Department for the fiscal year 1896-'97.\n\nFrom January 1st, 1894 to date only one Return from the Skidegate school was received at this Office and it had to be sent back for correction, and up to the present time it has not been returned.\n\nWith respect to the Kitamaat Indian day school I may remark that as far as I can ascertain only one report was received in connection therewith and it was for September Quarter 1895; but as no provision had been made in the Estimates of the Department for that Institution no funds were at hand for the payment of a grant thereto. As in the case of the Skidegate school provision was made in the estimates for the approaching fiscal year for an item to cover the cost of a teacher's salary at Kitamaat.\n\nA general outline of the course to be followed when it is the desire of any religious body to establish an Indian day school on an Indian Reserve.\nReserve I append herewith, viz:- An application in duplicate, for the privilege sought should be made to the Indian Superintendent for the Province, through the local Indian Agent for the district in which it is contemplated to erect the building for school purposes, and carry on the same, etc.\n\nThe application should be explicit in detail stating the number of Indian children of school age (from 6 to 15 years\u2014both numbers inclusive) in the immediate vicinity and whether in the event of the establishment of a school on the Reserve selected, a good continuous attendance could be secured. Any other matters of interest bearing upon the application should not be omitted to be stated.\n\nIf the consent of the Department to enter upon the Reserve be obtained and a grant towards a teacher's salary be authorized the same is paid at the rate of $75.00 per Quarter, irrespective of attendance\u2014although the Department expects that every effort will be put forth by the teacher to secure as large and constant an attendance as possible. This is in case the average attendance does not exceed 25 scholars, but where a greater than 25 pupils attend the school an additional allowance of\nof $12.00 per annum, or $3.00 per quarter, per pupil, is allowed up to 48, which would make a maximum allowance for the latter number of $504.00 per year.\n\nA register of attendance is kept and entries made therein as called for by the various columns ruled thereon. At the close of each of the four quarters in the year a report, copied from the Register, is made out, in duplicate, and forwarded to the local Indian Agent whose duty it is to carefully examine the same, and see that it is made out in accordance with the instructions thereon contained. When the Agent has satisfied himself that such is the case he shall then forward the same to this Office, first having signed the certificate thereon provided.\n\nThe Register of attendance and all the necessary forms are supplied for the School by the Department.\n\nPupils should be thoroughly grounded in the work of one standard before being advanced to that of a higher grade.\n\nRegarding the latter portion of your letter where you refer to our conversation respecting provision for an Industrial School at Hog-wul-set I would say that when such an application is formally made...\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(A.W.Vowell)\nIndian Superintendent, O.C.\nSir,\n\nI find myself under the necessity of calling the attention of the Superintendent General to the course pursued by Mr. Indian Agent Todd, of the North-West Coast Agency, British Columbia, in regard to certain Indian schools conducted under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. For several years past it has been a matter of common report from our Missionaries and others that Mr. Todd has in many ways shown himself to be unfriendly to the work of the Methodist Church. Some of these complaints have already been definitely stated in a communication laid before the Superintendent General by the Rev. Dr. Carman, and others, on behalf of the Methodist Church. In the present communication I refer to the case of two schools located respectively at Port Essington, and Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands, B.C.\n\nIn regard to the school at Port Essington, the facts are stated in a letter from the Rev. D. Jennings, missionary at that place, a copy of which I enclose herewith. Concerning the school at Skidegate, the facts are substantially as follows: Several years ago this school received the customary grant from the Department; after a time we found that remittances were not being received, and on enquiry being made at Ottawa, we were informed that no reports had been received from the Skidegate school for a length of time past, and consequently no grant had been made for its support. I at once wrote to the Rev. Mr. Crosby at Port Simpson and received a reply from him to the effect that he had reason...\nTo believe that reports had been regularly forwarded. Almost at the same time a letter came from Miss Ross, the teacher at Skidegate, written before she was aware of any complaint respecting the reports. Although not stating in so many words, the letter seemed to imply that reports had regularly been sent to the Agent, and I communicated the substance of that letter to the Department at Ottawa. During the present winter Mr Crosby wrote to me saying that Miss Ross had been unable to obtain forms for the quarterly reports, although she had written repeatedly to the Agent for them. It would seem that this matter has been corrected, for in a letter received this morning from Miss Ross, she intimates that school returns for September and December quarters have just been mailed to my address, though the latter quarter is defective because she had not sufficient blank forms.\n\nBesides the direct financial loss to the Society, these things cause a good deal of annoyance to our Missionaries and Teachers, and also to those having the direction of the Missionary Society's affairs. It would be very gratifying indeed if something could be done to overcome these delays in the transmission of reports. This is especially necessary in some parts of the North-West and British Columbia where mail communication is to be had only at wide intervals. If the Agent instead of returning a report to the teacher on some trivial technicality, as in the case of the teacher at Port Essington, would forward the report to the Department drawing attention to the supposed discrepancy, much valuable time might be saved, and a good deal of annoyance avoided.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sutherland, D.D.,\n\"Mission Rooms,\n\"Wesley Building,\n\"Toronto.\n\nDear Bro. -\n\nThis afternoon Miss Tranter's school report for the quarter ending September 30th last, was returned to her by Mr Agent Todd who in a note said that the divisor in striking the average for the quarter should have been 66 instead of 29. In the September quarter there are 66 teaching days. During that quarter Miss Tranter took her summer vacation whose length, not including Saturdays or Sundays, was 37 days. In former years the divisor has always been the actual number of days the school was kept open, i.e., vacation quarter. These reports have been accepted up to the last. Mr Agent Todd informs us that all authorized holidays should be marked as days present and counted as such. Is it meant that the 37 days' vacation should be marked as days present, and then use 66 as divisor? You will observe that the aggregate number of holidays must not exceed 149, deducting from this number 104, Saturdays and Sundays, 45 holidays remain, or 9 teaching weeks. Miss Tranter has kept within this limit. Our desire is that you will get from the Indian Department an authorized statement which divisor should be used for the quarter in which the vacation is taken.\n\n\"Owing to the demand for laborers on the Skeena in July and August each year our school attendance is small. This year the aggregate attendance was 222.5 for the September quarter, for which divided by 29 gave an average of 7.6,- but which divided by 66\nwould give only an average of 3.87 -- quite a difference. Miss Tranter always notifies by letter Mr Todd when she closes and opens school for vacation. Hoping that you will be able to get at something satisfactory re those reports, I am,\n\n\"Yours Fraternally,\n\n(Signed) \"D.Jennings.\"\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the Indian school at Skidegate B.C. conducted by your Society; and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it has no funds available from which the salary of the teacher could be paid. At the time the School Appropriation for B.C. was cut down, the Skidegate school was supposed to be closed, as no returns had been received for a long time previous to the preparation of the Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nRev. A Sutherland D.D.,\nC.M.

RC Schools & Indians were discussed at the last meeting of the Council. No returns had been received from them. The school was closed. The only way to provide for the school would be by taking the grant of some other Methodist School. However, for instance when all the Indians\n\nM. B. Smith\nSir,\n\nLast year I wrote to the Department to the effect that we were receiving no grant in aid of the Indian school at Skidegate, B.C., and was informed in reply that no quarterly reports had been received for a length of time, and the school had been dropped from the list. In correspondence with the Rev. Thos. Crosby, Chairman of the Port Simpson District, and also with the teacher at Skidegate, I learned that reports had been sent whenever blank forms could be obtained from the Agent. It would appear therefore, that through an omission for which the teacher was not responsible the grant to the school lapsed, and has been carried on for the last two or three years entirely at the expense of the Missionary Society.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Miss H.H. Ross, the teacher above referred to, in which she refers again to the difficulty of getting blank forms, but states that Mr. Freeman, missionary in charge, has obtained a good supply from Mr. Indian Commissioner Vowell, and that in future proper return will be promptly forwarded. She also gives the average attendance for a number of quarters as follows:\n\n| Quarter       | Average Attendance |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| March quarter, 1895 | 14,759             |\n| June          | 16,566             |\n| September     | 9,066              |\n| December      | 20,606             |\n| March         | 16,536             |\n| June          | 14,2                |\n| September     | 7,191              |\n| December      | 26,125             |\n| March         | 18,806             |\n\nTo the above statement the teacher appends the following note:\n\"All November and December I have school, Saturday included, to make up the number of days Government requires by law.

I therefore petition that the Indian Department make a grant of $400 four hundred dollars for that purpose which grant together with what outside aid may be obtained will I think be sufficient to meet the expense incurred in the removal, erection and fitting up of the school house.\n\nYours respectfully\n\n(sgd) B.C. Freeman\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH.\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nMarch 1907\n\nTo: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in enclosure, relative to the aggregate and total attendance schools.\n\nReferring to the matter of a report on the Mississaugas school, I beg to say that reports are not being regularly received from this school by the Department excepting out of season, and consequently until the Minister has had time to quote the whole matter of the report, I do not propose to give any further information as to the computation of the average attendance. I beg to say that the aggregate attendance of all the pupils divided by the number of days the school was open during the quarter will give the desired result.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A. Sutherland B.D.\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto, Ont.\nOTTAWA 30th July 1897\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with further reference to the Mikagane school; and in reply I beg to say that the department regrets that it has no funds for a grant to this school this year, a note will be taken of the matter for consideration in connection with school assistance for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nRev. A Sutherland D.D.\nConf. Body:\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto\nSir,\n\nReferring to Departmental letter of the 12th ultimo, No. 126932, in which \"the Department regrets that it has no funds available from which the salary of the teacher\" at Skidegate, British Columbia \"could be paid,\" I beg to refer the Department again to a letter of mine dated March 2nd, 1897, in which I state the facts respecting the Skidegate school, showing that the failure of the grant was not due to the neglect of the teacher in sending quarterly returns, but to the neglect of the Indian Agent in sending these forward. I quite expected that when these facts were made known to the Department would take prompt measures to reimburse the Missionary Society's loss, or at the very least to provide for future payments to the Skidegate school, and it is a great disappointment to learn that this has not been done. In a second letter of mine, dated June 2nd, 1897, I gave the average attendance at the Skidegate school from March, 1895 to March, 1897, and I trust that on the basis of the information thus supplied the Department will include in the year's estimates an amount sufficient to cover the legitimate claim of the Society for these years during which no grant has been received in aid of that school.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nBritish Columbia\n\nIndian Office\n\nVictoria, July 5th 1897\n\nSir;\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith the Report of the Somenos Indian day school for the quarter ended the 30th June 1897 together with requisition, in duplicate, for teacher's salary ($75.00) for the period mentioned. The address to which the cheque in payment is to be sent is given on the requisition.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent B.C.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nPrebendary,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mr. St. Letherland for the usual grant towards the school at Bridgeport, Queen Charlotte Island, I beg to say that, as this is the only school at this point and as the Department make the proposition to use the money voted for the Roman Catholic school for the school at Bridgeport (as it was discovered that a mistake had been made in allowing a grant to a Methodist school in the heart of a Roman Catholic tribe (at Bowman) while the entire population at Bridgeport\u2014179\u2014is Protestant), it would seem very reasonable that the usual grant of $850 should be made to the latter school. The Methodist Church is the Roman Catholic only denomination that has a school at this point.\n\nH. Ross.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to request that at the ensuing session of Parliament provision for the usual grant to the following Indian schools, under the supervision of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, be made, namely:\n\nSKIDEGATE, Queen Charlotte Island.\u2014This school has been in effective operation for a number of years, but owing to the neglect of Mr. Indian Agent Todd, in respect to quarterly returns, the grant lapsed and has not been received for several years past.\n\nBELLA COQUIA.\u2014A school has been opened here by the resident Missionary, and reports of attendance, &c., will be forwarded in due time to the Department.\n\nSOMENOS, in the Cowichan Agency.\u2014We ask that this grant may be continued.\n\nCLAYOQUOT, West Coast Vancouver Island.\u2014A Missionary has been stationed at this point, and a school will be opened as soon as arrangements can be completed.\n\nI am,\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith for the information of the Department the report of the Skagit Indian Day School for the quarter ended June 30th, 1897.\n\nAs no grant was made for the payment of a teacher's salary for this school no appropriation accompanies the report.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent B.C.\n\nThe Deputy Sect. General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa 16th August 1887\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in further reference to the Indian school at Skidegate, which is carried on by the Methodist Missionary Society; and in reply I beg to say that the following remarks will explain the position in which this school now stands in regard to the Department:\n\nAn application was made by Miss Kate Ross on the 20th October 1884, for permission to re-open this school, which was recommended by Mr Agent Todd and Mr Deptt. Veall. Permission was given by the Department to open the school on the distinct understanding that it was not to be called upon to contribute anything towards its support, as there were no funds from which such contribution could be made.\n\nQuarterly returns have been received up to the 31st December 1886, through your Society and Mr Agent Todd. On the 2nd March last, you wrote the Department complaining of the course pursued by Mr Agent Todd in regard to schools conducted by your Society and more particularly the Skidegate school, and stating that the teacher had been unable to obtain blank forms of report. In another paragraph of your letter you may remark that it would seem that this matter has been corrected, for in a letter received from Miss Ross she intimated\n\nRev. A. Robertson, M.M.,\nMethodist Mission, Toronto\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nMr. Todd's explanation in regard to this matter is that acting under instructions received from Mr. Superintendent Vowell, he had informed the teacher personally that until the grant of a salary was made the school there was no necessity for sending in quarterly returns to the Department. He further stated that he knew of no reason why Miss Ross should fancy that he could not help to get the school established by the Government, and that in fact he had written to say that the school was worthy of government support.\n\nOn the other hand, I have been informed that although reports have been regularly received from the Skidegate school, the Department would not take out any hopes of a grant being made until the Minister had time to go into the whole matter of schools in British Columbia.\n\nYour Society has a school at So'enos in the Cowichan Agency conducted by the wife of the missionary, which does not appear to be fairly entitled to the grant, as it is in the heart of a Roman Catholic settlement, which had a school of their own, and which through an oversight in the preparation of the estimates was dropped and a Methodist school substituted therefor. A proposition was made to you to have the grant to the So'enos school transferred to the Skidegate school, and you were asked whether you would consent to this being done, but as yet no reply has been received.\n\nYe r obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn connection with the Rev. Dr Sutherland's letter of the 11th instant in reference to the Methodist Indian Day school at Skidegate, the undersigned begs to say that this school is not provided for in the Estimates. An application was made by Miss Kate Helen Ross, for permission to re-open the school at Skidegate, which was recommended by Mr Agent Todd and Mr Supt: Vowell. Permission was given by the Department to open the school on the distinct understanding that it was not to be called upon to contribute anything towards its support, as there were no funds from which such contribution could be made.\n\nQuarterly Returns have been received from this school up to the 31st December 1896 through the Methodist Missionary Society and Mr Supt: Vowell, the last return being received on the 2nd March last. On the 2nd of that month the Rev. Dr Sutherland wrote complaining of the course pursued by Mr Agent Todd in regard to certain Indian schools conducted by the Methodist Missionary Society, and particularly to the Skidegate school. The teacher had been unable to obtain blank forms of report. In another paragraph of the same letter Dr Sutherland remarks that it would seem that this matter has been corrected, for in a letter received from Miss Ross, she intimates that returns for September and December quarters had been mailed to his address. The gist of the complaint against Mr Todd in this matter is that he was said to be too exacting in regard to the filling up of Returns.\n\nDr\nDr Sutherland was written to on the 22nd of the same month and informed that although reports are now being regularly received from the Skidegate school, the Department could not hold out any hope of a grant being made until the Minister had time to go into the whole matter of schools in British Columbia.\n\nIt should be mentioned that in a letter addressed to Mr Supt Vowell on the 15th June 1896, Mr Agent Todd explains that he informed the teacher personally in accordance with instructions said to have been received from the Superintendent, that until the grant of salary was made to the school, there was no necessity for sending quarterly returns to the Department. He further stated that he knows of no reason why Miss Ross should fancy that he would not help to get the school acknowledged by the Government, and that in fact he had written to say that the school was worthy of Government support.\n\nIt would appear that this school is entitled to Government support, as the Indians of Skidegate belong to the Methodist faith, and if the Department approves of giving it recognition, an item might be included in the Estimates for next year to pay the salary of the teacher.\n\nThe Methodist Church has a school at Somenos in the Cowichan Agency, conducted by the wife of the missionary, which is not fairly entitled to the grant, as it is in the heart of a Roman Catholic settlement which previously had a school of their own, and which through an oversight in the preparation of the Estimates was dropped and the Methodist school substituted therefor. A proposition was made to the Rev Dr Sutherland to have the grant for the Somenos school transferred to the school at Skidegate, and he was asked whether he would consent to this being done, as the Roman Catholics object and reasonable, it is thought, to the Government establishing a school of another denomination in their midst. All the Indians\nin the Cowichan Agency belong to the Roman Catholic faith, with\nthe exception of the Nanaimo Band, which is given in the last\nCensus Return as Protestant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nIn a letter from Miss K.H. Ross, teacher of the Indian day school at Skidegate, Q.C.I., dated Victoria, August 4th, 1897, she writes as follows:\n\n\"Mr A. Vowell, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Victoria, sent me word that the report of the Skidegate Indian day school for the quarter ending March 30th, 1897, had not been sent to him. I made out the report in duplicate, sending to Mr C. Todd, Indian Agent at Metlakatla, two copies, and two copies addressed to yourself. Will you kindly inform me whether you received the report of day school for quarter ending March 30th. I cannot tell where they are or how lost, but should they be lost I will make new copies.\"\n\nI find that the copies addressed to myself were duly received, and they show 56 pupils on the roll, with an average attendance of 16.20. That the other copies were received by Mr Indian Agent Todd I have not the slightest doubt. If this were the only occasion on which a similar failure had occurred, it might readily be attributed to accident; but as the same thing has continued almost without interruption for several years past, I can only infer that the reports have been deliberately suppressed by the Agent.\n\nIn view of all this, it is my duty to state that the information conveyed in the Departmental letter of July 20th, No.126932, that the Department \"has not funds for a grant to this school for this year\" is very unsatisfactory to the Missionary Committee. It seems very unreasonable that we should be deprived of grants for years together through the persistent neglect of the Agent to forward reports that have been sent to him. I am,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Honorable the\nSuperintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nImmediate\n\nAccountant,\n\nThe Ministry approved $300.\n\nSchools\n\nYes, but I cannot say whether the new ones stand yet.\n\nHas Capt. Vowell\n\nhis estimates &\n\nT.J.\n\n11 Dec. 97\nSir,\n\nI beg to call the attention of the Department to the case of the Methodist Indian school at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Island. For several years this school received the customary grant from the Indian Department. Then for a number of quarters in succession, through the neglect, wilful or otherwise, of the Agent, the reports were not furnished to the Department, and the grant was discontinued. For several years past this school has been kept in efficient operation, reports having been regularly sent by the teacher, but until now no steps have been taken by the Department, so far as I am aware, to correct the neglect. I have now to request on behalf of the Missionary Board that provision be made for the customary grant to the school above mentioned.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 3rd November, 1896.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, in respect to a grant in aid of the school conducted by the Methodist Church at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that provision was made by Parliament at its last session to pay a salary of \u00a3500 to the teacher of this school, and upon the receipt of the return for the first quarter of the present fiscal year, the salary will be paid at that rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Dr. J. C. Spencer, Missionary at Skidegate, with reference to an increased salary for a Teacher at the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nOn my recent visit, to Skidegate, I learned that Mrs. Spencer and the family, including Miss Spencer, were leaving Skidegate, for the South Coast, in order to obtain educational facilities for the children of Dr. Spencer's family. Miss Spencer has been teaching the Skidegate children and was also leaving. Dr Spencer informed me, at that time, that an Indian named Green desired to teach in the school. I have since ascertained that this man is not desired. He had trouble, recently, at the Cannery where he was employed, and it would not be advisable to have him.\n\nIt would be in the interests of all concerned if we could have a good White teacher at this school, and, considering the cost of living, in isolated places like Skidegate, the sum asked for is very reasonable for a good man. As Dr. Spencer states, it would not be advisable to have a lady teacher.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nS.S. P. Albert.\nAug 9th 1911\n\nMr. Hon. Deputy,\nand Dept.,\nMassett\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are just returning from Rupert Harbour, have had a fine trip. Things are quiet at our end. People not come yet, save 6 young men who returned lately.\n\nI write you in behalf of our day School.\n\nI have hope of getting a senior matriculation man for teacher. Do you think the Dept would give $500?\n\nI fear he would not entertain the idea of coming at $400. My family being away makes it impossible for me to employ a lady.\nI shall be glad to hear from you and if you write any time before the 23rd address as I shall be over here till then.\n\nThe road gang has done nothing on the reserve at Shingwauk and have ceased working entirely for this year as the appropriation is exhausted.\n\nMrs. Smith is failing slowly by a gradual loss of strength.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ. H. Spencer\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th ult., with reference to the increase of salary to a Teacher for the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nApparently my letter of the 26th August was misunderstood. In said letter I stated: \"On my recent visit to Skidegate I learned that Mrs. Spencer and family, including Miss Spencer, were leaving Skidegate, for the South Coast, in order to obtain educational facilities for the children of Dr. Spencer's family. Miss Spencer has been teaching school and was also leaving etc.\"\n\nI am pleased to state that Dr. Spencer did not resign. His daughter was teaching the children, and, when Miss Spencer left, the Doctor desired to obtain a good man to take the place, in the school. As Missionary, Medical Officer and Teacher, Dr. Spencer could not give his time to the School, and had Miss Spencer to assist him. When the young lady left, he was alone, in Skidegate, and desired to bring in a good teacher, to take charge of the school.\n\nI will notify Dr. Spencer that the Department will grant $500 for a Teacher with the qualifications mentioned in your letter (No. 126932-1).\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Sept. 14th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. Mr. Spencer who has resigned his position as missionary and teacher at the Skidgate in your Agency. In reply I beg to say that the Department will pay a salary of $500.00 to a teacher with the qualifications mentioned by Mr. Spencer, namely, senior matriculation. You will kindly advise the Department what action is taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nTheo.

Dr. J. C. Spencer, dated 22nd May ultimo:\n\n\"We are sending a married teacher to Skidegate and I hope we shall have good results. Mr. J. H. Young who has been teaching at Simpson for two years is going to Skidegate. He used to teach in Columbia College. I believe you will find him a capable and effective worker. The state of the Mission House is now in order and I shall be glad if you can put the deal through as soon as possible as we would like to build during good weather. (Signed) J. C. Spencer.\"\n\nI have also to report that the following answer was forwarded to Rev. Dr. Spencer, dated 2nd June instant.\n\n\"Sir:-I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 22nd May ultimo, with reference to the placing of a married teacher, Mr. Young, at Skidegate Indian Day School. In reply, permit me to state that Mr. A. C. Brown is resigning, and will he leave at the end of the quarter? The regulations governing the Indian Day Schools call for one month's notice when a Teacher resigns, and no notice of his resignation was received in today's mail. Mr. Brown sent me a letter, a short time ago, on school matters, and did not mention that he was resigning. He brought up the question of holidays and reported some trouble with the Indians, in which he sent him a letter asking for a report on the matter. I will send a copy of your letter referring to the 'sending of a married teacher to Skidegate' to the Department and would be pleased to have further particulars from you on the question.

Rev. Mr. Spencer claims that the amount allowed the teacher, $500.00, is totally inadequate. He draws no salary as a missionary and his whole time is taken up with the school work. This is one of the largest and best attended schools in British Columbia and I think the Department would be quite justified in increasing the salary to $700.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you of the receipt of the following, from Rev. J. C. Spencer, Methodist Missionary at Skidegate Reserve:\n\n\"Sir:-I beg to call your attention to the fact that the salary paid to the Teacher of our Indian School is totally inadequate, and makes it impossible for us to secure the services of well qualified and experienced teachers. There are forty-eight children's names on our School Register. The salary paid our Teacher is only $500.00. He does not do missionary work, hence his total income is $500.00. When we consider the fact that he follows the children to the cannery and keeps school open, and is obliged to pay one dollar a day for board in the cannery boarding house, you can easily see how little he has for his labour. There are three provincial schools, within ten miles of us, with 8, 12 and 14 pupils respectively, where the teachers are paid $600, $85, and $90 per month respectively. Now, as you will see, our teacher does as much work as any two of the above-named teachers and gets only half as much pay as their lowest salary paid. This is enough to discourage any teacher. I hereby apply to you and trust you will see your way clear to recommend the Department to grant an adequate salary for our teacher. A married Teacher is really what we need but we cannot ask any married man to teach on $500.00. A number of our young men are anxious to take up such work as mensuration, bookkeeping and music, while the girls are quick to learn fancy work, dress making and other useful branches. This is a lonely village, and no place for a single young man. All these phases of our work could be better served by a married teacher. (Sd.) J. C.

I found\nquite a number of Indian children on the Reserve and the\nIndians complained about the absence of the Teacher. I\nunderstand the Methodist Church Missionary Society appoints\nthe Teacher of this School, subject to approval, and I do\nnot know what action I am supposed to take in the premises.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, September 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the appointing of a teacher for the Skidegate School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of the man to whom you refer in the second paragraph. Your remarks with regard to the salary to be paid are noted and will be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to securing the services of a Teacher for the Skidegate Indian Day School, I am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Dr. Spencer, in which he states: \"I am anxious to get a good man and have a better salary paid. You know how hard it is to get a good man to take hold of one of these schools on $500 salary. I don't think the Department expects us to be able to secure the best teachers. Now if we had, say, $800 or $1,000, to offer a teacher, we would have a much better chance. A cheap teacher is, in my opinion, an expensive piece of business, because each year a number of boys and girls leave the school, being beyond school age. It is too bad to see how many go out without a working knowledge of English. If you know of any good man I would like to have his address.\"\n\nIn another letter Dr. Spencer states: \"Mr. Haley was down to Vancouver and promised to secure, if possible, a good teacher for us. If he fails to secure one, there is at the Sand Spit a man with his wife and little girl. They came two weeks ago. Teaching is his hobby. He says he will fill a gap for us, if necessary, till we can secure a teacher. He would, I believe, do good service. He taught Indian children at Simpson for awhile. I am told, by Mr. Haley, if we could get from the Government a decent salary,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nfor teacher, we could get a man who has been teaching in Columbia College. I wish such a thing could be worked.*\n\nIn connection with the schools of this Agency, I might be permitted to make a few suggestions.\n\nThe two large schools are in districts where the cost of living is high. Even the Indians will not work for the cannery at less than $3.00 per day. They look for results, from teachers, and the kind obtainable, at a low salary, is only men who are looking for something better. Mr. McConkey, and Mr. Russell, were both giving satisfactory service; but Mr. McConkey asked for $1,000 a year, and Mr. Russell worked overtime, in the cannery.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that the teachers receive $900 a year. The Massett Teacher has a house, at Massett Reserve; but is not provided for, by the Government, at Naden Harbour.\n\nHaving the largest school, the free rent would be a difference in his favour, above the teacher of the Skidegate School. The Indians are anxious to have good men stay with them, especially married men; but we cannot keep them. Teachers, without certificates, are allowed to have charge of the Provincial Day Schools, and they receive $80 per month, on Graham Island. The attendance at the White schools is small. Our teachers have a large attendance. The Massetts and Skidegates are willing to learn. They are progressive, and a credit to the Department, with good towns and showing more signs of advancement than any of the Indians on the Coast. The Bands are large, and they reside in only two places, Massett and Skidegate.\n\nIf it could be possible to engage first-class teachers the results would be remarkable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nOttawa, June 26, 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant advising the Department of the resignation of B. J. Russell, teacher of the Skidegate School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted and you will be good enough to take up with the resident missionary the matter of securing a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 14/6/12\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Mr. B. J. Russell, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, has written me that he intends to resign, at the end of June, which is, he states, the end of the term and beginning of the Summer holidays.\n\nRev. J. C. Spencer, Missionary of the Band, has been notified, by Mr. Russell, of his intention to leave.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 2, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo in reference to the qualifications of Mr. Russell, teacher of the Skidegate School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to know that efficient work is being performed by Mr. Russell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNasnett, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th Nov. last (No. 126932/1) with reference to the salary of the Teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School and the qualifications of said Teacher.\n\nOn my last trip to Skidegate Reserve, I accompanied Mr. Russell from Prince Rupert, and was present, in the schoolroom, on opening day. It was a pleasure to me to find that the School had been placed in the hands of Mr. Russell and to know that the good work accomplished under Dr. Spencer and Miss Spencer would be continued under another competent teacher. I learned, from the young man, in the presence of Dr. Spencer, that he had passed the preliminary examination for entrance into the Methodist ministry and was studying for another examination. Since then Dr. Spencer has reported his work satisfactory. He is directly under the supervision of Dr. Spencer, who lives with him, in a building adjacent to the School. I considered that the heads of the Methodist Church had the appointment of the teacher, and was introduced to Mr. Russell, by the Rev. Mr. Haley, who informed me of Mr. Russell's appointment. It is difficult to find a teacher for the outlying Indian schools, and I felt pleased to know that we had good teachers in both schools, in this Agency.\n\nI will write Dr. Spencer, asking for the status of the teacher, otherwise than given above.\n\nWith reference to dealing with more than one subject in my letters, I must apologize, thinking as I did that\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nschool matters were all under one heading. In the past I have gone to a great deal of trouble to explain everything satisfactorily, and do not mind the trouble it gives me to do so. I am trying to do as much work as possible, around the new buildings, in the daytime, and am even now writing late at night. It has not been often that the Department finds fault with my work, and one is liable to make mistakes now and then, it is only human.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your letter of the 30th ultimo you state, among other things, that B. J. Russell has commenced teaching on the Skidegate Reserve.\n\nAs you are aware the Department agreed to pay a salary of $500.00 to a teacher with proper qualifications. No mention is made of the qualifications held by Mr. Russell. No doubt they are satisfactory and payment will be made, but the Department would like to have a report from you.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the fact that you should not deal with more than one subject in each of your communications. In your letter you refer to requisitions for both the Massett and Skidegate Schools and also to other matters relating to each of the schools and it is necessary for the Department to make extracts, whereas it would be very little more trouble for you to deal with the matters in separate communications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Denay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\nIndian Agent's Office.\nMassett Reserve, Massett B.C., October 30th 1911.\n\nSir-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Requisitions for supplies needed in the Massett and Skidegate Indian Schools, in this Agency.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that both schools are now open, with a good attendance at each, and male, White, Teachers.\n\nWhen Mr. B. J. Russell commenced teaching, at Skidegate Reserve, it was apparent that the young man took an interest in the work and, considering that he is studying for the Church, is proof that he will continue to exercise good judgment.\n\nMr. McConkey re-opened the Massett School, which was closed through sickness among the children.\n\nWith two good White male teachers, the day schools of this Agency should now show marked improvement, and it is also a matter of congratulation that both the Anglican and Methodist Churches take so much interest in the schools that they have both increased the salaries of the teachers, supplementing the grant allowed by the Department. Mr. McConkey now receives $1,000 per year and Mr. Russell $800.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the receipt of the following, from Mr. A. C. Brown, Teacher of Skidegate Indian Day School, and the Rev. Dr. J. C. Spencer, formerly Missionary at Skidegate:\n\nMr. Brown's letter reads as follows:\n\n\"Dear Sir.\u2014I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 28th and beg to inform you that the school is now out of my hands, the Conference having replaced me by Mr. Young, of Port Simpson Boys Home, who, I understand, is entering the ministry. I had not any intention of leaving the school, and Dr. Spencer never said a word about it to me and I did not say that I wanted to leave, hence the reason I asked for my holidays at the usual time. It's what I call a low down trick to play on a fellow; but I suppose the least said the better it will be. I closed school on June 6th as the rest of the Indians went away on the following Monday to the Skeena. The reason that the big girls were turned out of school was because they were constantly quarreling, one with the other, and generally causing a disturbance in the school. This was done at the request of the Council, who held a meeting and then sent them letters telling them that they must stay away from school if they could not behave themselves.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nThe remainder of the Indians came over on the \"Albert,\" W. Ross and Charles Jefferson being the only two families remaining in the village. I would have liked to have come over to see you, but it was a case of waiting around. I will write you again when I get below. (Sd.) A. C. Brown.*\n\nDr. Spencer's letter is as follows:-\n\n\"Dear Sir:-In reply to yours of June 2nd, which has just reached me, I may say that Mr. Brown did not resign. During the Winter and early Spring he spoke frequently as though he would like to be relieved. But, as you know, it is often difficult to find anyone between times to take up such work. He did not seem to get on at all well with the pupils. There was constant war in the school; for that reason I thought it would be well for us to try another. Besides that we have a Mr. Young here at Port Simpson, who has given good satisfaction in this big school and will, I feel sure, do the same at Skidegate. When school closed Mr. Brown had, apparently changed his mind, and would have been willing to stay on; but, for the sake of the school, I think a change is needed. Most of the Indians are on the Skeena and Mr. Young will spend holidays on the mainland and be at Skidegate in plenty of time to begin school. He is, I believe, B. A. and a studious man. Mr. Brown made no attempt at studying of any description. I am sorry I have neglected resigning myself but supposed that would be taken for granted. Yes, I hope to keep in touch with you for all that makes for the welfare of the Indians. (Sd.) J. C. Spencer.*\n\nWith regard to the above I beg to state that Mr. Brown, and Rev. Dr. Spencer, did not agree on many matters; but, when I visited Skidegate, no complaint was made against Mr. Brown, either by the Indians or the Missionary, at any time. The school was conducted and reported on in a satisfactory\nSummer, so far as I could see or learn, and Mr. Brown appeared to be painstaking, sober and regular. I spent some time at Skidegate Reserve, last Winter, and visited the school frequently. When I heard that Mr. Brown had dismissed some of the older girl pupils, I asked for an explanation, in writing, and his answer is above. Mr. Brown did not care about taking up Missionary duties, in connection with teaching, and the salary was low, until recently, when it was increased. It is better to have a teacher there that will agree with the Missionary, considering that both live on the reserve; and the Department is not responsible for any of the troubles of the former Missionary and Teacher. We simply endeavoured to have the school conducted according to instructions, and it was, so far as I could see.\n\nThe Skidegate Indians are away. It is the time of the Summer Vacation, and no difficulties will arise over any lack of a teacher, for some time yet. He would have no pupils, if at Skidegate.\n\nI understand that Mr. Young will be a very satisfactory gentleman, to act as teacher, and only regret that it is so difficult to retain teachers and others, on these islands.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the receipt of the following message from Dr. J. C. Spencer, formerly Medical Officer of the Skidegate Band, dated June 9th instant:\n\n\"School closed June six. Indians gone to main land. I go to-morrow. Please send forms for School. Reports to A. C. Brown, General Delivery, Vancouver. I shall be glad to hear from you. My address Port Simpson. (Sd.) J. C. Spencer.\"\n\nI replied, on the 16th instant, as follows:\n\n\"Sir.-I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your message. In reply permit me to state that I forwarded blank forms for School Report to the address specified. With Mr. Brown away, and you also, there will be no-one on the reserve according to the message. Might I ask when Mr. Young is likely locating there? If Mr. Brown is resigning, would it not be well for him to follow the instructions to Teachers, and send in a month's notice, as called for therein? On the last steamer, of the 9th instant I forwarded your letters to the address given me, in Vancouver. I informed the Department of your intention to locate, in future, in Port Simpson. A large number of the Skidegate Band took up residence at Langara island, where they are now fishing with the Massetts, and I hear that all are well. (Sd.) Thomas Deasy.\"\n\nApparently, Rev. Dr. Spencer, and Mr. A. C. Brown, the Teacher, have both left Skidegate, and will not return. Almost all of the Indians are in this neighbourhood, from Skidegate, and will be away for some time, and the affairs of the Department will not suffer from the absence of both of the above-mentioned gentlemen. A general exodus of Indians takes place, every summer, from the Massett and Skidegate reserves, to the fishing grounds, giving time to fill the places of the medical officer and teacher of the Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file S43-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to report the receipt of the following, from Mr. J. H. Young, Teacher of Skidegate Indian Day School: \"The Conference of the Methodist Church has just closed, in Vancouver. During that Conference many changes were made, including that of myself. For some time past, I am informed, that Miss Gladstone has been begging for a position. Through the agreement between Mr. Cairns and another Eastern official, it was decided to give her the Skidegate School. There was strong opposition to such a move; but the head men carried it through. I have been offered a good position on the mainland, and have almost accepted same. I would be pleased to hear from you by return mail, as to your opinion of the choice. (Sd.) J. H. Young.\"\n\nRegarding the above, I understand that only teachers with certificates would be appointed, to our Schools. Not having any definite information on the above, and knowing that such a change will net, in my opinion, prove satisfactory, I trust that Mr. Young will be retained. I considered Mr. Young a very competent man in the position. I informed Mr. Cairnes, verbally, and state now, that I do not consider any Haida Indian woman, or girl, competent to take charge of an Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant requesting the Department to confirm the appointment of Miss Sophia Gladstone as teacher at Skidgate for the coming year at a salary of $500.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before doing so the Department would like to know Miss Gladstone's age, nationality, qualifications and experience. I may say that no official notification has been received of the resignation of Mr. Young, the present teacher. Mr. Agent Deasy has written the Department saying that it is proposed to have an Indian woman in charge of this school should Mr. Young resign and he states that if this is the case it would be only fair that she should pass an examination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

H. Young, Teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, handed me a letter, on my recent visit to the Skidegate Reserve, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Deasy:-When I came to take charge of the Skidegate Indian Day School I found no accommodation at the Mission House. Being a married man, I had to rent an Indian house. Enclosed please find receipts in duplicate of my expenditure for seven months rent, at $10.00 per month. I make application to the Department of Indian Affairs for the recovery of my expense.\"\n\n(Sd.) J. H. Young.\n\nIn connection with the above permit me to state that Mr. Young informed me that he receives a small grant from the Church Missionary Society, and is expected to collect a greater portion of it. Rev. John Gibson, the Missionary on Skidegate Reserve, informed me that the Church grant will be cut off, from Mr. Young, in the near future; Rev. Mr. Gibson is now able to take charge of the Church work. If Mr. Young remains with the Church, he will be moved to another field. Mr. Young states that he intends to resign. Without desiring in any way to interfere with any Church, it is my opinion that it would be better to have the Skidegate Indian Day School under the charge of the Government, like the Massett Indian Day School. Constant changing of teachers, and the work expected of a teacher, outside of his regular school duties, is not conducive to making the school better.

Considering that a large number of the Indians of the Skidegate Band will be away during the Summer, returning about September, or October, it would be advisable to grant Mr. Young's request, provided that he intends to return, to take up school work at the end of the time allowed for the Summer vacation.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 27, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a copy of a letter you received from Mr. J.

Mrs. Young is available, and would take the position, for a few months of the year, at a salary of $25.00 per month. Considering that Mrs. Trainor, of Massett Reserve, teaches during the Winter months only, and an appropriation of $500.00 is made for the Assistant Teacher in this Agency, both Mrs. Trainor and Mrs. Young could be engaged, while the pupils are at home, on the two reserves, without exceeding the appropriation, and it would be a great benefit to the children.

As you are aware, I have always complained of the attendance at the Day Schools in this Agency during the summer months. The whole of the Indians are nomadic\u2014they are away at fishing camps, canneries\u2014and the reserves are practically deserted then. We have no way of keeping the children at Massett and Skidegate for months in each year. We send as many to Cqualaatza as the Industrial Institute can accommodate.\n\nThe Inspector, Mr. Cairns, informed me that the attendance was poor, all along the coast, at the Day Schools. We are doing our level best to keep the Day Schools up to the standard; but cannot keep the Indians at home all of the year, when they have to make a living elsewhere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, January 11th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Cairns reports that the attendance at the Skidegate day school is unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Department will expect you to put forth immediate efforts to increase the attendance at this school.\n\nA copy of the Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian Children are enclosed, herewith, and if necessary, these regulations should be enforced against those parents, who do not send their children to school, regularly.\n\nKindly advise the Department of the result of your efforts in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Her case was fully discussed with Mr. Scott, Mr. Calhoun and myself last March in Vancouver, and it was agreed that she should be placed in charge of the Skidegate school. In harmony with this, I wrote Mr. Young that his services would not be required at Skidegate after the 20th of June and offered him the school at Kitselas. I have also written the chairman of the district notifying him of this appointment and I may say that it meets with the hearty approval of our missionary at Skidegate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nOttawa, July 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo embodying a copy of a communication from Mr. J. H. Youngs, teacher of the Skidegate School, in which he states that he is being moved from Skidegate and that Miss Gladstone has been appointed to take his place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev.

The Agent also says that he does not consider any Haida woman or girl competent to take charge of an Indian day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Fowden,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nQueen Charlotte Reserve,\nSkidegate, B.C., April 26, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith Quarterly Report, to 31st March 1917, of Mrs. A. L. Fakeley, former Teacher of Skidegate Indian Day School, just received by me.\n\nMrs. Fakeley left the Agency early in April without tendering her resignation.\n\nOn my arrival at Skidegate Reserve found one of the Indians, Henry Green, in charge of the Indian Day School. He informed me that Rev. S. E. Livingstone placed him as Teacher two weeks before the end of the Quarter. Henry Green is still teaching.\n\nI am not aware whether Mrs. Fakeley intends to return, although I have heard that the lady left Skidegate with no intention of returning.\n\nThe Report shows the number of days school was reported open. I understand Mrs. Fakeley was ill for some time and confined to her house.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\nThomas Deasy\nIndian Agent\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nOttawa, May 1, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, in which you inform the Department that Mrs. A. L. Fakeley, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, had left her duties without giving any notice of her intention of doing so.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being informed accordingly and requested to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for this school to begin duties after the summer holidays. In the meantime the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Henry Green until June 30th, next, and will allow him salary at the rate of $60.00 a month for his services and a cheque for the amount due will be sent to him instead of the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society. You will be good enough to forward properly prepared vouchers for his salary, together with a return from the teacher showing the attendance, at the end of the present quarter.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. Fakeley did not prepare a quarterly report for the March quarter last, and if so, Henry Green should prepare a return for that quarter. It is thought that he can get all the information from the Daily Register of Attendance which should be in the school. As soon as this return is prepared you should forward it in order that the amount of salary due for Mrs. Fakeley can be sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThomas Denay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island,\nB. C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, May 1, 1919.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a communication received from Mr. Agent Deasy, of Skidegate, in which he informs the Department that Mrs. A. L. Fakeley, the teacher of the Indian day school, had left her duties without giving any notice.\n\nIt is considered that Mrs. Fakeley should have given due notice of her intention to give up her duties in order that a successor could have been secured. Mr. Agent Deasy is being informed that the temporary appointment of Henry Green, an Indian, as suggested by him, is approved, to carry on the work in this school until June 30th, next, and he will be paid for his services at the rate of $60.00 per month. The cheque for the amount due will be sent direct to the teacher instead of to the treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society. Henry Green's appointment is approved in order that the school may not remain closed until a qualified teacher is secured.\n\nAs Mrs. Fakeley left without preparing a return for the March quarter last, salary due for that quarter has not been paid. She has forfeited the bonus for that quarter and this will not be paid her.\n\nThe Department would like you to keep this school in mind and endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take up the work after the summer holidays on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev.

I then learned that a native teacher had been installed in the Indian Day School. I have no Quarterly Reports to date, from Mrs. A.L. Fakley, former teacher.\n\nThe Indian Teacher appears to be doing well with the pupils.\n\nI would recommend that the present incumbent, Henry\n\nThe Asst.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nMassett, B.C., June 7th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith \"Agent's Report\" on the Day Schools in this Agency.\n\nAs you will observe, both schools have been closed\u2014one through the presence of \"Whooping Cough\" in Skidegate Village, and the other on account of the lack of pupils. In fact, but eight children were attending at Skidegate, when I last visited the School.\n\nIt is practically impossible to keep the children at school, during the good weather. They go and come; one day the family is on the reserve; the next day they go in boats to gardens, camps, mill towns, and away, here and there.\n\nYear after year, we are compelled to shut down the day schools, at the beginning of May, and they are not opened, on the reserve again, until September, or October.\n\nAt times, when the canneries employ a number of the Indians, the teachers go there, and open school; but little advancement is made, and the children fall back, until we never have a child, the product of a day school, that shows any marked ability.\n\nI have consulted with the recently appointed Anglican Missionary here, Rev. J. Gillett, and also with the Chief Counsellor, Alfred Adams. We have\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\ngene thoroughly into the question of education of the Indians, and find that the children must be kept at home, during the whole year, if they are to be properly educated. This can be done by having a central place, for the children to reside in, on the reserve, during the time the parents are away, earning their living. Rev. Mr. Gillett is new at the meeting of the Synod, and intends bringing up the question there. Chief Counsellor Adams is also at the meeting, and will give the Indian side of the question. With the assistance of the Missionary and Chief Counsellor, it is possible to work out a plan that will be acceptable both to the Department and the Church authorities. We have laid the groundwork, and will place before you our conclusions, after the return of Messrs. Gillett and Adams.\n\nThe school question has been one that requires our best efforts. The Indians are now surrounded by loggers and White fishermen, in camps and towns. The children must be kept away from the influences found there. If we must advance the Indian, it is wrong to have children of tender age running around towns and camps, doing nothing. They learn no good there. If we can devise some means of keeping the children on the reserve, during the Summer months, we will solve the education and saving of the Hydahs.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nThe Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, who called at the Department today, stated that he has sent Miss Wharton to Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands, as field matron and nurse and Mrs. Fokely as teacher. Miss Wharton's salary is to be $60.00 a month.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of the 8th, No. 126932/1:\n\nI am surprised to hear that Miss Cook did not reach Skidegate. The last word I had was to the effect that she would reach there about the 7th of January. She has not written me anything to the contrary. I have written Mr. Livingstone our missionary there, and will do my best to secure another teacher at the earliest possible date. I have already written Mrs. Fakeley of Meanishkinight, asking her if she will go to Skidegate. This a much more important place as far as number of pupils is concerned. We could supply her school later on. Would this be satisfactory to the Department providing Mrs. Fakeley is willing to go?\n\nI have also a nurse in view, a Miss Wharton, a graduate of the Bella Bella Hospital. I expect to be in British Columbia next week and will try and solve the difficulties that exist.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nOttawa, February 6, 1915.\n\nRev.

Of this I am certain, that Miss Gladstone\nis capable of doing good work. She informed me she was\ngoing to Normal Jan. 1st, 1918.\nExtract from report of Agent Deasy on the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of April, 1919.\n\nThe Field Matron and Nurse and also the teacher of the Indian Day School, were both absent during my visit, and I am not aware whether they will return. They did not inform me that it was their intention to leave the islands, simply taking their departure. I found an Indian, Henry Green, in charge of the Day School, and he informed me that he was placed in charge by the Missionary. Shortly after my arrival, the Missionary and his wife left the reserve, for the South, and I learned the medicine is locked up in his residence. At present we have no whites looking after the Skiddgates, although there is communication by telephone between the Reserve and my office. Fortunately there is little illness. The School will be closed, in a short time, on account of the absence of the Indians, at their fishing grounds and gardens, and there will be no necessity for a Field Matron and Nurse, and School Teacher, on this reserve, during the summer, as the place is, practically, deserted, from the middle of May until September. Miss Wharton and Mrs. Pakeley, were both ill, during the Winter, and that may account for their absence. Apparently, they did not consider it advisable to give notice of their intention to leave, for the reason, as I understand it, that they were not engaged here, and the responsible heads were those who gave them the positions. The acting Indian Teacher appeared to fill the vacancy, very acceptably, and was greatly interested in the work, when I reached Skidegate. I visited the schoolhouse often, and found that the children appeared to advance, and were under better discipline than on any other occasion. It would be advisable to temporarily appoint Henry Green to take charge of this school, during the Winter months, and place him under the regulations governing the two Indian teachers of Massett Indian Day School.\nOttawa, May 5, 1919.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing the March quarter return from Mrs. Fakeley, late teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mrs. Fakeley is being paid salary for the 42 days this school is shown to have been conducted by her during the quarter.\n\nAs this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, I beg to say that, as you were informed by official letter of the 1st instant, the Department can only consent to Henry Green being appointed temporarily. The nomination of all teachers is in the hands of the church authorities and if they are favourable to Henry Green being appointed permanently, the Department will have no objection, provided he is able to carry on the work successfully.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNassett Reserve,\nGraham Island,\nB.

I trust the way will be much easier for the new officers to carry on their work under the Agent Desy. If not it will be next to impossible to keep suitable people there. They will need to receive more friendly consideration than was meted out to Miss Wharton and Mr. Fakeley.\n\nI trust we will have the positions properly filled when school opens in August next.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nMassett, B.C., July 21st, 1919.\n\n525675\n\nSr.\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 5th instant, with reference to the temporary appointment of Henry E.

Mr. Green informed me that he was in charge, for a short time, during the Quarter ending 31st March last, before Mrs. Pakeley left the Agency. The amount due him, for that time, is not included herewith, as I understand that he would seek to Mrs. Pakeley, or the Church authorities, for payment.\n\nIn connection with the appointment of a Teacher, and a Field Matron and Nurse, for this School, permit me to ask that, before appointments are made, the parties willing to accept be given distinctly to understand conditions, at Skidegate, and that the Field Matron and Nurse will know, beforehand, what is expected of her, and whether fuel and light will be granted, or not. Attending to Indians, on these islands is a very difficult position for any lady to fill. Living on an Indian reserve, with high cost for everything, \"no\n\nThe Assistant Deputy General Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file S43-1, part 2)\nthe many disadvantages met with, is a strain on any lady filling the position of Field Matron and Nurse. The School Teachers have their duties defined, and the responsibilities connected with their offices is easily understood. It is quite different with a Field Matron and Nurse. With no doctor in the neighbourhood; irregular means of communication with outside parts; dealing with a peculiar band of Indians that claim to be more civilized than the ordinary Indian, and with the independence not found in other Indians\u2014the position is one not to be envied. It would be advisable that the newly appointed Field Matron and Nurse should understand, in written instructions, her responsibilities, and her duties.\n\nIn asking for the appointment of Field Matrons and Nurses, some years ago, my aim was to have someone, on the ground, ready to assist sick and indigent Indians and to endeavour to suppress tuberculosis. Indian women were first appointed, and I found no fault with their work. They were dismissed, and White women appointed, at the instance of the then Inspector of Indian Agencies. The work of Field Matrons was then included; but their principal work has been attending to the sick. They have a great deal to do in this work, in fact, it takes up a great deal of their time, and I find they are more useful, in this respect, than Medical Officers, who visit the reserve, periodically, while the Nurse is always on hand. Recently, at Skidegate, the former Field Matrons and Nurses understood they were under the direction of the Church authorities, and although we had telephonic communication to the reserve, we heard little of conditions on the reserve, until the monthly report was submitted. The fuel and light question arose, and I was blamed for not supplying same. I was\nalso told, by the Missionary, that the Field Matron and Nurse was appointed by the Church authorities, and was responsible to them. If this is correct, I would be pleased to know that my duty, in connection with the Field Matron and Nurse, is to simply inspect, as in the case of teachers, and report to the Department. All I am anxious about is the good of the Indian, morally, socially and intellectually. Any instructions given, in the past, emanated from the Department. Without a medical officer, a great deal of responsibility rests on the Field Matron and Nurse. If a lady teacher is appointed, the Field Matron work might be accomplished by her. With these Indians, a lady teacher has a difficult position. The children \"rule the home,\" and would rule \"the school,\" if permitted. The last teacher had difficulty with them.\n\nA Returned Soldier, for teacher, and his wife, as Field Matron and Nurse, would be preferable, if qualified persons could be obtained. Personally, I would be pleased to see Rev. J. C. Spencer, and his daughter, return to Skidegate. Miss Spencer is a qualified Nurse, and Rev. Dr. Spencer was medical Officer of this Band, for some years, and gained the respect and esteem of the Indians. It is to be regretted that he ever left the Band.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, in further reference to Henry Green, the acting teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that his appointment was only temporary. The Reverend T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, under whose auspices this school is conducted, informs the Department that he is endeavouring to secure a suitable teacher and nurse to take charge of the school after the summer vacation.\n\nHenry Green will be paid salary only for the time he taught and he should prepare a return covering that period. You will be good enough to forward a voucher for the amount of salary which you consider he should receive for his services and a cheque for the same will be sent you for Mr. Green.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

H. E. Livingstone, the Methodist Missionary residing there. Henry Green informed me that he was teaching for two weeks, during the Fourth Quarter. I found him in charge of the School, when I visited the Reserve.\n\nI understand the Skidegate Indian Day School closed on the 20th June. On account of the \"Strike,\" our mail service is demoralized, and I received no word from Henry Green, over the telephone, informing me that he intended to close the School, or that it was closed.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file S43-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI telephoned to Skagway, and ascertained about conditions there, and found that the school had been closed, most likely through lack of pupils, as the Indians leave, during May and June, for the canneries and fishing grounds.\n\nWhat I desire to ascertain is: Will Henry Green be paid for the two weeks, in the last Quarter, by the church authorities, and also whether he will be paid, for this Quarter, through the church authorities? He was engaged by their Missionary, to take the place of Mrs. A. L. Pakeley, who left without tendering her resignation.\n\nIn my opinion, the teacher of this school should be paid only during the time the school is open, and not during the Summer months, when a male teacher engages in fishing, or other occupation. It is most probable that this School will not re-open until October, or November, and it would be unfair to the teachers of Massett School, if Henry Green is appointed, that his pay should continue, whilst the Massett teachers earn their living, otherwise, as Henry Green will do, during the months the schools will be closed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 1, 1919.\n\nRev.

Possibly, Mr. Green was paid by the authorities of the Methodist Church.\n\nIf Mr. Green has been paid by them, the cheque, which was sent to you should be returned to this Department so that the necessary payment may be made to the Methodist Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nTheo.

Green, closed the school, at Skidegate, on the first week in June last. From that time, and until Miss McDonald arrived, on the 23rd September ultime, the school was closed for two reasons, absence of a teacher and absence of pupils.\n\nThis, the first \"Quarterly Report\" of the teacher, is incomplete, as Miss McDonald was at Aliford Bay, five miles across an inlet from Skidegate, when making out the \"Return.\" But II pupils attended, during the six days Miss McDonald was in charge, in September, at Aliford Bay. In \"Marginal Notes,\" Miss McDonald makes explanations.\n\nIt is my intention to visit Skidegate Reserve, on the next steamer.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Monthly Reports on Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools, for the month of November, 1919.\n\nDuring the early part of the month, I visited Skidegate school. Found Miss Lilian McDonald in charge. This lady was making the first attempt to handle Indian pupils, and complained of conditions, as found. It is difficult for a lady to control Indian children, on outside reserves. Much is expected by the parents; but they do not discipline their own offspring, and seldom visit the school. As the School is under the auspices of the Methodist Church, the Missionary, who lives in the adjacent house, might be requested to visit the School, and assist the Teacher, in maintaining discipline. It is difficult for a woman to teach Indian children, at any time or place. Miss McDonald is giving every attention to her pupils, and is to be commended for her efforts; but informs me that it is not her intention to remain.\n\nAt the Massett Indian Day School, the two Indian teachers are making good progress. We have introduced the making of baskets, an almost lost art amongst the Indians, and the girls are taking quite an interest in the work. During the time the Indian woman is teaching the girls, Teacher Adams instructs the boys in singing. These Indians are musical, and many of them have instruments in their houses. The attendance at the\n\nThe Aest. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMassett Indian Day School is good, considering that so many families are absent, taking advantage of the fur market prices, the logging, cannery work and other occupations throughout the country.\n\nI would like to see a Night School started, for the men, and elder boys and girls, which would be well attended, during the Winter months, especially at Massett; also a Library, where the men and boys would pass the long Winter evenings, receiving instruction. These institutions would benefit the Indians, materially. They will not take the initiative, in anything for their benefit. Old and young need instruction, in many ways. The Church is building a new Rectory; while the Indians are constructing a new place of worship. The old Church might be used, for Library purposes. The Indians have a Hall, which is falling into decay, where they might have an athletic club, and library; but they will not contribute the funds for the upkeep of such institutions. The Council of 1919 has been more or less scattered, working in various places, and little has been done by the Councillors, to advance their fellow members of the communities.\n\nWe are now at the stage when the Indian problem must be considered, with these affecting the Whites. No community suffered less than the Indians of these islands, during the war. Their education has produced diverse characters, from the older generation, and the future is fraught with many difficulties, now that immigration is tending towards these islands. The pity of it is that they must leave their homes, during the Summer, to obtain employment, feed and means to live, during the Winter.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 30, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant enclosing your reports on the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools for the month of November, last.\n\nWith reference to the Skidegate Day School it is noted that Miss McDonald, the present teacher, has informed you that it is not her intention to remain. Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has been informed accordingly.\n\nYou should see that Miss McDonald prepares and forwards returns showing the attendance, days taught, etc., before she leaves, in order that the salary and bonus due can be paid her.\n\nWith reference to your remarks that you would like to see a night school started for the men and older boys and girls at Massett I beg to say that the Department would be disposed to pay a reasonable salary for instruction in a school of this kind during the winter months. It is presumed that the night school could be carried on in the day school building. You will be good enough to furnish a full report as to who would give the instruction in the night school and the salary required. It is considered that three nights per week would be a sufficient period to conduct these classes. You should furnish a full report as to what arrangements you can make for the proper carrying on of a night school at this point.\n\nIn reference to your remarks that an athletic club and library be provided for the Massett Indians and the hall fitted up for this purpose I have to request that you will furnish a further report concerning this matter. You should state what it would cost to have the building put in repair and the amount necessary to provide books and a small supply of athletic utensils, also who would take charge of the library and the athletic club. The Department will not be justified in going to any undue expenditure in fitting up this building and providing for an athletic club and library unless it were assured that the Indians would avail themselves of the privileges granted and also that the club and library would be properly conducted and the material and the books cared for. You should give your views fully regarding this matter, with a full estimate of the cost involved and the salary, if any, that would have to be paid to manage the scheme.\n\nYou should furnish a full report regarding the\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If she does so it will be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher, and I have to request that you will communicate with the authorities of the Methodist Church in that district with a view to securing the services of a qualified teacher to succeed her.

Since January I have found the strain of the large, though splendid school attendance very severe and after my break in February, do not feel that it would be fair to the pupils to think of returning next September, with the prospect of breaking down, and leaving in the middle of the term. (Sd.) Blanche T. Ward.\"\n\nI regret very much the resignation of Miss Ward, one of the best and most conscientious teachers we ever had, in this Agency. Every argument was used, to retain the services of Miss Ward, without avail. The young lady has been in failing health for some time, and regrets, as much as we all do, leaving the Agency and the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nOttawa, March 10th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, in further reference to the request made by Miss Blanche E. Ward, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, that she be granted permission to teach the senior classes in the forenoons and the junior classes in the afternoons, owing to the large attendance. We note that she states it would relieve her of the present strain, and she would be able to give more attention to the pupils in their classes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this arrangement being carried out during the winter months, when the large attendance keeps up. The pupils should be entered on the Register as having attended a full teaching day. We hope that, as a result of this change, it will mean less strain on Miss Ward, and that better results will be accomplished in the classroom. You should inform her of the Department's permission to allow her to divide the classes - teaching the older pupils during the forenoons and the younger during the afternoons.\n\nWe hope that Miss Ward has recovered from her illness, and that she will be able to remain as teacher for the balance of the school year, at least, and also, if her health permits, continue in the service as teacher of the Skidegate School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of February 2nd instant, with reference to the arrangement of classes in Skidegate Indian Day School, and the request of Miss Blanche E. Ward, for permission to divide the classes, in order to teach the senior classes during the forenoon, and the three junior classes, during afternoons.\n\nDuring my recent visit, to Skidegate Reserve, met the Teacher; but, unfortunately, Miss Ward was taken ill, and was under the care of Dr. Palmer. It was apparent that Miss Ward was exerting herself, beyond her strength, and it is probable that Miss Ward will not continue, as teacher, after this year. This is to be regretted, Miss Ward is one of the most conscientious teachers, and has done a great deal to advance the pupils. I agree with you, and would be sorry to lose the services of Miss Ward. I would recommend that her request be granted. It would mean less strain, on the teacher, and the results would be even better than teaching the whole of the children, at one time. The Indian children come and go, with their parents. During the winter months, almost all of the families are on the one reserve, when Spring opens, they go off to their camping grounds. During the Summer, they are at the canneries, and the fishing grounds. During the Fall, they gather fish, fruit and other food, for the Winter.\n\nFor a few months, they overcrowd the day school; the teacher is then overtaxed. If the Indians talked the English language, in their homes, we might expect good results, even from day school teaching; but the older generation continues to converse, in the Haida language; yet it is remarkable that many of the children are more than anxious to learn. Where we now have over one hundred children, at two Day Schools, and a large number, at Coqualeetza, it is to be regretted that we have no residential school, in this locality, and no boarding school, ready to take those desirous of attending.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, February 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, embodying a copy of a communication which you received from Miss Blanche K. Ward, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, requesting permission to teach the four senior classes in the forenoons only and the three junior classes in the afternoons only.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that Miss Ward finds the work a great tax on her strength, and makes this request owing to the number of children in attendance and in order that she may be able to give better attention to them while in the classroom. If you consider the suggestion made by the teacher to be in the best interest of the work, and that it will relieve her of the difficulty in handling the large number of children, you may authorize her to carry out the suggestion regarding the half-day system. We note that you intend visiting Skidegate. You will then, no doubt, be able to form an opinion as to the advisability of complying with the request made by the teacher. Kindly inform the Department of the decision arrived at by Miss Ward and yourself regarding the conducting of the classes on the half-day system. We would be sorry to lose the services of Miss Ward, and hope that, if the above arrangement is carried out, it will greatly relieve her in her work.\n\nWe also note your recommendation regarding the establishment of a residential school for the Indian children of the Massett and Skidegate Bands. It will not be possible to provide a school of this class at the present time, nor until Parliament provides the necessary funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Ward, Teacher of Skidegate Indian Day School, with reference to conditions, on the Skidegate Indian reserve:\n\n(Copy.)\n\nSkidegate Mission,\nQueen Charlotte Islands, B.C.,\nJanuary 13th, 1923.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas Deasy,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Deasy:- I received your letter last night. Thank you very much for all your good wishes. It is indeed refreshing to receive such kind words, at the close of a strenuous week, and I appreciated them very much. I am sorry to tell you that I am finding my work too great a tax on my strength-about collapsed, this week, and began to fear that I would have to leave, at once. However, if you do not mind, I am going to try teaching the four senior classes in the morning, and the three junior classes in the afternoon, and see if that will relieve the pressure, so that I can continue. I would be sorry to leave the children without a teacher, so early in the year, for many of them did not start school until October. The plan, if feasible, will give the children more teaching than they are getting at present, and my hours will be lengthened, rather than shortened, for the first bell will ring at 4:00, as usual, and I am afraid that I will not be able to get through until 4:15; then the blackboard work will keep me till six. However, I will not have over forty children tucked into twenty-five desks (double), many of which are too small for one pupil, let alone two. The discipline under these conditions is such a constant strain my health will not stand it any longer. As I am trying to somewhere near approximate, the course of studies, as outlined by the Vancouver Schools, I cannot allow the discipline to slip, and thought if I had the children in two groups, I would not be working under such a tension. I may be mistaken in thinking it will relieve me in any way, but some such plan has been tried in Vancouver, when there was much overcrowding. However, a fresh teacher was always put on, for the afternoon work, though the first one may have started earlier than mine. I am so glad you are so soon to visit us, when we can talk over the problems. This letter will give you an opportunity to think over the matter before you come. The school has been very comfortable, throughout the coldest weather, thanks to the improvements you had done and the excellent wood.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\"\nThe Stove Pipes are about burnt through, we need 12 new lengths, A\" Pipe, and a new Elbow. I wonder if it would be possible to get the Pipes in the new ten-foot lengths, so that they would be safe and much more easily cleaned? I hope you have a good trip when coming to Skidegate. Unfortunately, my Quarterly Report would not give any accurate idea as the attendance was small at the beginning of October, and that made the Quarter's Attendance low. (Sd.) Blanche E. Ward.\n\nIt is my intention to visit Skidegate Reserve on the 21st inst., when I will interview Miss Ward on the above. The young lady takes a great deal of interest in the education of the Indian children, and her resignation would be a great loss to both the Department and pupils. The plan suggested would be possible; but the question of the disposition of the children, during the daytime, when outside the schoolhouse, is one to be considered. We have them, for only a few months, in each year, and only for a few hours, each day-five days in each week. During the spring, and summer months, they forget a great deal of what they learn, during the few winter months. Parents, and children, talk the \"Haida\" language, at their homes, and when outside the schoolhouse. What is needed is a Boarding School for the large number of children of both the Masset and Skidegate Bands, increasing in numbers, and without a Boarding School, in the whole of this great northern country, we send a number to Chililack to the Coqualeetsa Industrial Institute, hundreds of miles away; out, where we guarantee an attendance of over one hundred pupils, in a Boarding School, in this neighbourhood, of children, eager to learn the English language, the need of such a school is apparent.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the same time I wish to draw the attention of the department to the fact that $1,000 was paid at Skidegate last year and in the transfer of Miss Roode it was understood that she would receive the $1,000.

C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th March ultimo, with regard to \"the petition or Skidegate council,\" requesting the appointment of a \"second teacher, for Skidegate Indian Day School.\"\n\nThere is but one \"class room\" connected with the school building, on Skidegate Indian Reserve.\n\nDuring the winter months, the attendance is large; but it must be remembered that the Indians of this Agency are without any industrial plants, near the reserve, while the families leave, for the canneries and fishing grounds, in the summer. An assistant teacher might be employed, during the five months, from the end of October; but, in my opinion, the Indians will again be away from the reserve, during the coming summer, and will not leave their young children, with no-one to care for them.\n\nIt is possible, the lady teacher is over-taxed, during the fall and winter months, although no complaint comes from that source. The Indians of this agency require a residential school, where the children would remain, the year round, when the parents are engaged, in canneries, and while away, fishing.\n\nThe Massette and Skidegates take a great interest in the education of their young, and should be encouraged. They have forty-six pupils, at Oogma-leetza Institute, and could readily send one hundred more, to a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Thomas Denny)\nIndian Agent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 25, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 4-324 of the 10th instant, enclosing a petition from the Indian Council in which they request the appointment of two teachers at the Skidegate Indian Day School. In reply I have to inform you the Department recognizes that this school has a large attendance for one teacher and it is because of this that a former teacher, who was in ill health, was permitted to use the half-day system.\n\nBefore intelligent consideration can be given to the question of appointing a second teacher, the Department will be pleased to learn if a second classroom is available and, if not, what arrangements could be made for one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nAfter considerable correspondence with the Reverend Thompson Perrier, Superintendent of Indian Schools, under the United Church of Canada, it was decided to accept the application of Miss Elenece Bertrand, as teacher of the Skidigate Indian Day School.\n\nShe is thirty-five years of age and has taught for twelve years in the province of British Columbia, in rural schools. She has a third class British Columbia certificate and excellent reports have been given her by the Public School Inspectors, under whom she taught.\n\nMrs. Charles A. Wickens, a prominent worker in the W.M.S. Organization, living in Vancouver, assures me that the young lady making application is an efficient teacher.\n\nMiss Bertrand will leave Vancouver for Skidigate on September 30th and will have everything in readiness so that the school will reopen Oct. 1st, 1926.\n\nWe, therefore, recommend to the favourable consideration of the Department the appointment of Miss Bertrand at the same salary as her predecessor, viz: at the rate of $850.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nMay 23, 1928.\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your request I found it possible to spend a few hours in your native schools at Skidegate and Massett, after attending to the inspection of my own schools at these points. I beg to give you in a friendly way my finding as follows:\n\nSKIDEGATE: I have frequently visited this school in the seven years that I have spent in the north. Indeed with the single exception of last year when this school was not in operation during May, I have always looked in upon the work. After these six visits I almost feel as if the school were part of my regular work. This year, however, I was free to go more thoroughly into the work, since you yourself and the Council invited me to do so. You will therefore please regard this as a friendly criticism and not in any way official.\n\nThis is the best small native school that I have ever visited. I attribute this to the class of teacher that you have almost invariably employed. To Miss Ward, who, I believe, was the first to use at Skidegate, modern methods of teaching; great credit is due. Her successors, Misses MacKay, Rood, Young, Bertrand and McRea, have, as far as their individual ability and experience allowed, followed in her footsteps, and have demonstrated to me that it is quite possible to get response from native children when the work is made interesting. Candidly, were the white schools staffed with the type of teacher that I have so often seen in native schools, I am inclined to think that the interest and progress would be at a low ebb. It is a real pleasure to see the response to modern teaching in this school.\n\nIn some native schools that I have visited there has been no definite objective, no well defined Course of Study. In Skidegate for at least six years your teachers have endeavoured to follow the B. C.\nCourse of Study. If compulsory attendance and punctuality were insisted upon as in our white schools, this would soon be productive of even more marked results.\n\nThere are too many enrolled for one teacher. In a school the size of this at least two teachers should be employed. This would mean an additional room. The present building is commodious but the lighting is wrong, and doors and windows are so placed that only about one-fourth of the necessary blackboard space is available. In a native school even more than in a white school, should there be the maximum of blackboard space. In this way many children may be working at the board at the same time under supervision and the efficiency of a teacher is multiplied many times.\n\nA library of supplementary readers with a score or more copies of each book would be found very useful. These books should not be taken home, but should be used in the schoolroom under the teacher's direction. Indeed it would seem to me a necessity to have such a library of well chosen readers. Dent's Canadian History Readers I to VIII, by Miss Dickie, would be of value, especially III to VI.\n\nYour teacher, Miss McRea, is not a disciplinarian. She has not made more mistakes than the average young teacher makes in her first school, and after being several hours in the school I feel that she should give better service, since I have candidly pointed out her errors and commended her good points. Should you engage two teachers for next year, Miss McRea would be much better with the lower division than with the larger pupils.\n\nSince you yourself visit this school regularly, I need not point out that the pupils are clean and that the room itself is clean and tidy.\n\nMASSETT: There is here a large building with two good rooms. While the blackboard space is greater than in the Skidegate schoolroom, it is not so great as a modern school requires. Our ideal today is windows on one side of the room and blackboards on the other three sides.\n\nMost of the children were with their parents at the Tow Hill Clam Cannery. At this point I met with the teacher and children and saw enough of the work to assure me that both Miss Stella Shopland and Miss Dorothy Shopland have proceeded in a modern way to instruct the hundred or more pupils in their charge. It would seem that in these young ladies you have efficient, faithful teachers.\nWere this a Provincial School we would employ three qualified teachers. It is our policy to employ a teacher for less than 40 pupils, two for between 40 and 80, and three for between 80 and 120. With the native children it would seem to me that 25 or 30 to a room would be quite sufficient until the schools had attained a higher standing. I do not see how one could look for really efficient work unless at least one more room were added to this building.\n\nMy remarks re attendance, punctuality, and library in my report of Skidegate would also apply here.\n\nIn closing I beg to assure you that having the time at my disposal, it was a pleasure to look more intimately than usual into your interesting schools. At the same time I should like you to regard this as a friendly criticism and not in any way official.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.C. Fraser\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, June 15, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the first instant which is relative to the motion of the Skidegate Band that the appointing of a teacher for the school be left with the Department, through the agent. In reply I beg to say that this school is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, and it is thought that if the required notice of intention to resign is given by a teacher, the nomination of a successor could be made by the church authorities in due time.\n\nPlease inform the Department as soon as possible whether Miss Melnea, the present teacher, intends to resume duties when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays, or not. If not, we will immediately take up with the church authorities the question of nominating a teacher to succeed her in due time to begin duties when the school re-opens on or about the first of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

C.\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nMasset, B.C., June 1, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of May for the Massett and Skidegate Reserves.\n\nThe other motion was:\n\nThat the appointing of a teacher for Skidegate be left entirely with the Indian Department through the Agent.\n\nThe reason they gave for this was that in the past oftimes the school has not opened until a month or so late, on account of delays in the appointment of a teacher. As the selection is made by Mr. Ferrier in Brandon, it takes some time before a teacher can be appointed.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nJ.

In my daughter's absence I can give information asked for.\n\nMary received notification of her acceptance from you on Thursday morning, October 6th. On inquiry, we found she could take the Prince Charles that evening for Prince Rupert and catch the Prince John to Skidegate. The next boat would probably be two weeks later, we were told. So she left Thursday evening. Before leaving she wrote Rev. T. Ferrier giving her qualification and references. She has a B. C. Second Class Certificate, is aged twenty years, and a member of North Vancouver St. Andrews United Church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"(Mrs.) Helen McRea.\"\nMasset, B.C., Oct. 3rd, 1927\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of Sept. for the Massett and Skidegate Reserves.\n\nThe Massett school opened on the sixth. The Skidegate school is not open yet. It appears that Mr. Ferrier found some difficulty in securing a teacher. I wired him on the fifth regarding same. The reply was that Miss Gray of Vancouver was appointed. Later I received word that she could not take the appointment, and was asked if I could secure a teacher. I immediately got in touch with the Teachers' Bureau in Victoria, sending the following wire,\n\n\"Could you secure lady teacher Skidegate Indian school, United Church, preferred, salary one hundred and five per month.\"\n\nI regret that a mistake was made in stating the salary, but I was under the impression that Miss Bertrand, the last teacher, was getting one hundred and five. Mr. Baillie received that at Massett last year, and I understand from Miss Shapland that she was getting one hundred and five at Kincolith. I therefore thought that this was the usual salary. The answer to the above wire was,\n\n\"Miss Mary McRea of North Vancouver is available.\"\n\nI then wired Mr. Inspector Cairns in Vancouver asking him to get in touch with Miss McRea and to notify Mr. Ferrier. I have heard nothing since, but trust that the teacher will arrive at Skidegate by the next boat from Vancouver, which should be around the seventh of this month.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nRev. C. Ferrier,\nInspector of\nIndian Schools and Hospitals\nUnited Church of Canada.\n\nBrandsen, Man. Oct 1 1927\n\nThe Secretary Dept.\nIndian Affairs &c &c.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the last moment I received a wire message from Miss Jean Gray of Vancouver that she could not go to Skidegate & at once wired likewise. I asked if there was any one they could suggest that would be willing to take Agent Mrs. Elliott's position. Miss M. McRee of Vancouver was willing to meet with my approval. So I hereby give the request.\n\nI am not familiar with her standing.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. Ferrier\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith the Agent's report for the Massett, Roe Hill and Skidegate Schools, for the month of May. I am also enclosing Mr. Inspector Fraser's letter to the Agent regarding these schools. His remarks on the Massett and Skidegate Schools regarding the number of teachers required expresses the need which the Agent has seen for some time, namely, three qualified teachers for Massett School, and two for Skidegate. Massett this year had over one hundred on the roll, and Skidegate over forty. There will be more in both schools next term.\n\nIf the suggestion for three qualified teachers for the Massett school is carried out, it will be necessary to have another room added, such as the Department's original plans called for. I realise that there was not anything provided for in the estimates for 1928-29, to take care of this, so that I suppose the new room could not be added this year. However, the present school could be rearranged so as to make three rooms with very little expense. All that is required is the partition between the large room and the cloak room moved, and two new doors. The enclosed plan of the present school and a sketch of the alteration will show what I mean. If nothing can be done this year, possibly the old Church could be used, as before the new school was built. With a little renovating it would do temporarily, and this would be better than disturbing the present arrangements in the school.\n\nThe Skidegate school is quite an old building, I believe originally a church, and a new one will be required in the near future. It is large enough to allow for a temporary partition, so as to accommodate two teachers.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is in getting the attendance large enough to require the number of teachers mentioned, during the months of September, May and June. But it could be done from the middle of October to the end of April, with a little more rigid enforcement of Sec. 10 of the Indian Act. The Skidegate attendance has been good for the time the people were in the village. Massett attendance has also been very good, but would have been better if it had not been for the sicknesses. The people themselves are taking more interest in school affairs and the Agent feels with Mr. Fraser, that if the Indian schools were conducted on the same lines as the White Schools, the results would compare favourably. There would then be no reason why there should not be pupils from these schools taking the Entrance exams every year.\n\nThere would be no necessity for hiring the extra teachers for September, or after April. I understand that there are plenty of teachers in B.C. who could be obtained at any time. As far as the present teachers are concerned, Miss Dorothy Shopland will be coming back, but Miss Stella Shopland hopes to go to University. Miss Mahie will not be returning to Skidegate. Shall I make arrangements to secure a teacher to replace Miss Shopland. I suppose the United Church will have the privilege of nominating someone for Skidegate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J.

Please advise the Department the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you. Salary at the same rate as was paid Miss McRee, viz., $95 per teaching month, will be allowed.\n\nI might add that the agent suggests the employment of a second teacher from October first to the end of the following April and the fitting up of an extra classroom by the erection of a temporary partition.

T. Ferrier, Inspector of Indian Schools and Hospitals of the United Church of Canada, has nominated Miss M. B. Wright for the position. Miss Wright has been teaching at Kitsegukla in the Bubine Agency, where she met with success in her work. The Department is approving of her transfer to Skidegate, to begin duties on or about September 4th, next, when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $100 per teaching month.\n\nI have to request that you will give Miss Wright every assistance you can upon her taking up duties at Skidegate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Inasmuch as Miss M. B. Wright, who has taken charge for this year, is an experienced teacher in our Indian work, I would suggest that the question of the need of a second teacher for seven months be left in abeyance for the present.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nGRD\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding Miss Wright, of the Skidegate School, I do not think she is suitable for this place. Mr. Fraser, the Provincial School Inspector, is also of this opinion. As the United Church has the privilege of nominating the teacher for Skidegate, it is possible that they would be able to place Miss Wright elsewhere, where she would have a smaller school. Even if there are two teachers at Skidegate next Fall, as I hope the Department will sanction, I could not recommend Miss Wright to be one, as she has peculiarities which would make it very difficult for another person to get along with her. I have not said anything to Miss Wright about not coming back, as I take it that the United Church will arrange for another place for her. I presume that the Department will notify the Church that a change is needed. I will notify Miss Wright directly, if the Department so wishes.\n\nMiss Wright is getting along in years, and it would seem rather cruel to dispense with her services entirely, as I believe she has given faithful service elsewhere. I think there are small places where she could still be able to give satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 8, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your general letter of the 25th ultimo, nominating teachers for the Indian day schools under the United Church, I wish to state that the Department is not satisfied with the services of Miss M. B. Wright at Skidegate, B. C. Mr. Indian Agent J. Gillett, on the 17th ultimo, wrote that he and the Provincial School Inspector considered her unsuitable for this important school. Would your Society please consider these representations and inform the Department, at your earliest convenience, if a change can be made for the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, concerning Miss M. B. Wright, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School. I may say that the United Church Board of Home Missions has already nominated her for this post; but, upon receipt of your communication, I wrote to the Secretary of the Board, asking him to consider a change. It is possible that they may request the Department to approve of Miss Wright's retention for the time being; but, if there are any developments, I will immediately write to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. James Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

B. Wright at Skidegate, B. C.\n\nThis matter will be given due consideration and I will write you again in regard to it.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAMA.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of July 8th, No. 157-11-1 received today. On no condition should Miss Wright be re-nominated by the United Church for the Skidegate Day School. I have already given my reasons for this, and these can be enlarged upon if necessary. I am quite certain that no one teacher would consider living in the same house with Miss Wright. If the United Church cannot secure another teacher, I can, through Mr. Watson of the Teachers' Bureau in Victoria, get in touch with someone who he could recommend. Mr. Watson's knowledge of the teachers is trustworthy, and he is in touch with all in B.C. who are looking for schools.\n\nI have made my recommendations in this matter, and have given my reasons. I consider the education of the Indians an important matter, and I fail to see why recommendations such as the above are not carried out. The United Church should know that Miss Wright is not suitable for Skidegate. The Council waited on Mr. Barner this year, myself asking him to make a change. As it was then an awkward time to make a change I suggested that we could manage with her until the end of the term. If the United Church want reasons why Miss Wright was not satisfactory, I can give them, and I can have them backed up by the School Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant and note that you are quite satisfied that Miss Wright should not return as teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School. As you have been informed, the Department is in correspondence with the United Church Board of Home Missions and they have promised to give the matter of a successor proper consideration.\n\nI may say that your report of June 17th, last, was the first intimation that Miss Wright's services were not suitable. In future, if a change in teaching services is necessary, your report should reach the Department approximately two months before the teacher's services will be no longer required. This gives time for correspondence with church authorities and then an opportunity to give one month's notice to the worker who is being dismissed or transferred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. James Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nDear Mr. F.

Therefore I thought we ought to give her another year and wrote asking her if she would be willing to stay. When I received a favorable reply I sent her name to Toronto. I think it is not fair to her to dismiss her now. I do not know where to send her anyway, so hope she may be treated in the same way the Department is treating Miss Earl and if these ladies are kept satisfactory we will give them notice during the year. If this suggestion does not meet with your approval write not met with your approval write Toronto at once. Expect to be home 16th inst.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Warner\nOttawa, August 9, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding the continuing of the services of Miss M. B. Wright as teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, I have to say that, as the Church authorities have arranged with Miss Wright to resume duties, it would be difficult at the present time to make a change.

As arrangements have already been made for her to continue the work at Skidegate during the next school year, the Department will approve of her re-engagement. It is hoped, however, that satisfactory arrangements can be made for a change in teachers at this school for next year. Miss Wright's services might be satisfactory at a smaller school.

In view of the representations of the Indian Council and yourself when the Reverend Mr. Barner was at Skidegate, I am surprised that the church authorities did not make arrangements for a change in teachers this summer. Yesterday, I telegraphed to you, following receipt of a telegram from the Indian Council, and I am very hopeful that you will be able to secure the services of a teacher who will be satisfactory to all concerned. There must have been a misunderstanding on the part of the United Church Board of Home Missions. You were quite right in making strong representations to the Department in this connection. I regret that you did not write at the time the Indian Council interviewed the Reverend Mr. Barner.\n\nYou have already received instructions in connection with the erection of the new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. James Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett,\nB. C.\nMascott, B.C.\nAugust 24th, 1929\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince June of this year I have been in correspondence with the Department regarding the removal of the teacher at Skidegate. By Departmental letter of August 9th I was informed that the Department had approved of Miss Wright's re-engagement for the coming school year. As the Church Authorities had arranged with Miss Wright to resume duties it would be difficult at the present time to make a change.\n\nApparently the Church authorities are using Skidegate as a place for the teacher instead of finding a suitable teacher for Skidegate. The United Church must have known that Miss Wright was not giving satisfaction, as when Mr. Barner was in Skidegate in February of this year, the Council were very emphatic in their remarks to him regarding a change of teacher. Whatever the Church authorities' attitude, the Department has approved of their action and ignored the advice of their Agent, and it therefore reflects on his judgment and ability. I have no objection to the United Church having the privilege of nominating a teacher, but when they insist on someone who is not giving satisfaction, and is not up-to-date in her methods, I must voice my protest.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department to accept the recommendations of the United Church Board of Home Missions, irrespective of the views and advice of their Agent, then I can only say that I cannot remain as their Agent. The sooner I know their policy in this matter the better.\n\nHowever, if the Department has approved of Miss Wright only because there is no other way out at the present time, I would suggest that a second teacher be appointed for Skidegate, the duties to commence the first of November. According to the recent Census, there should be over forty children at school, and\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\n( this is )\nthis is too many for one teacher to make good progress with.\n\nI have already recommended that a new school be built, and two teachers appointed. Provision was made for this in last year's estimates, and if the Department has approved of it I see no reason why the building could not be erected by the first of November.\n\nIf the above is carried out, I want to insist that the teacher be fully qualified, with a B.C. certificate. If the United Church has no one in view who could be at Skidegate by the 1st November, I would suggest that the Department wire me so that I can get in touch with teachers who have made application for positions. The teacher should be employed by the month, at One Hundred dollars, and guaranteed six months, and longer if the attendance keeps up.\n\nMiss Wright's accommodation with another person would still be a difficulty, as she says she will not live with another person, and I do not think that another person should have to. Last year, when she anticipated the Nurse living with her, she asked that she be given one room to be used for all purposes, bed, living, dining room etc. I think this could be arranged, so that she could be put up with for another year if it has to be. Possibly with a small class she may be able to make some progress although her teaching methods are out-of-date.\n\nOn any condition, the educational situation at Skidegate should be improved this year, because to my mind, the most important thing today among the Indians, is their education.\n\nI have taken the liberty of bringing these things to the notice of the Deputy Superintendent General, as I feel the matter is of vital importance, and merits his personal attention.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-1, part 2)\nOttawa, September 4, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation with Mr. Ferrier yesterday, I wish to confirm the arrangement which terminates Miss M. B. Wright's engagement as teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School. The Indian Council telegraphed the Department that all parents at Skidegate refused to send their children to school if Miss Wright was re-engaged. After discussion with you, the Department telegraphed the Indian Agent, Rev. James Gillett, at Massett, to engage a suitable teacher as from October 15th or as soon after as possible. Our representative is giving Miss Wright notice immediately, and he was promised that you also would write to her. The Indian Agent will urge the Skidegate parents to have their children attend under Miss Wright for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Also understand that the United Church authorities are writing you. J. Dillett.\"\n\nNo explanation whatever was given. I am totally unaware of any reason for such speedy dismissal. I had been promised by Rev. A. Balmac as teacher in the school at Skidegate for the coming year commencing September 1929. Why then has the contract been broken? By record is good, and can be proved by many unselected testimonials not the least important of which was one from the Indian Department. Under July 16, 1928, this message was transmitted to me by the Indian Agent at Hazelton. In view of the services that Miss\nWright has performed at this school (Kitsegukla), the Department hopes that she is giving up duties. (At that time I had just been transferred by the United Church authorities to Kidegate).\n\nSince 1913, I have been in the service of the Indian Department, starting as teacher in Coqualeetza School, Sardis, B.C., Mr. R.H. Carman (later Inspector of Indian Schools in British Columbia) was then the Principal of this school.\n\nthe year 1917 until 1928 - with the exception of about 6 months at Cape Mudge and Port Simpson - I was stationed at Kitsegukla School, Skeena Crossing, B.C.\n\nAre these sixteen years of faithful service to count for nothing?\n\nI now ask most respectfully for an explanation of the treatment which has been accorded to me.\n\nPlease reply to\n\n4662-12th Ave. West,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) M.B.

The Department learned that your services were not acceptable to the parents at Skidegate and that there would be a very serious falling off in attendance if you continued as teacher.

As there are forty-six children on the roll, I recommend a second teacher for this school. It will be difficult to get a teacher to take duty at the beginning of December, but the present teacher, Miss Wark, has a daughter who is now teaching near Vancouver, who would be willing to come by the first of January. Miss Wark is twenty-one years of age, and has a 2nd class B.C. Interim certificate, and has taught for two years. As the teachers have to live in the same house, this would be an ideal combination, a mother and daughter. I would recommend that she be given the same salary as the other teachers in this Agency, namely, One Hundred dollars per teaching month.\n\nIf the Department approves of the above recommendations, will they please wire me, as Miss Wark will have to give one month's notice where she is now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S.

Mrs. Elsie Wark was appointed as senior teacher, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month; her appointment to date from October 15th, last. Our local Indian Agent states that Mrs. Wark is a middle aged widow, who had some years' teaching experience before she married and has taught since and has her certificate.\n\nThe Agent strongly recommended that, as there are 46 children on the roll, a second teacher be appointed, and recommended the services of Miss Jean Wark, daughter of the senior teacher. Miss Wark is twenty-one years of age and has a second class B.C. interim certificate and two years' teaching experience. The Department has approved of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month.

If new teachers are required for the coming year, I have to request that you will endeavour to secure suitably qualified teachers and forward full particulars to the Department, stating the names, qualifications and experience of the teachers whom you recommend be appointed.

Gillett\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has been informed by Mr. Agent Gillett, Massett, B.C., that Miss Jean Wark, junior teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, tendered her resignation to take effect as from the 30th instant.\n\nIn view of recent orders to make a further cut in our Appropriation, the Department considers that it might be possible for one teacher to carry out the work at this school and that it would not be necessary to fill the position vacated by Miss Wark. The returns received show the highest enrolment to be 19 pupils, with an average attendance of 42. It is thought that Mrs. Elsie Wark, senior teacher, could carry out teaching services without assistance during the coming school year. I understand it is your intention to visit the Department in the very near future, when the matter of the appointment of a second teacher could be discussed. In the meantime, the matter will be held in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. T. Maclean,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. K. J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Mr. Barner,\n\nOn my return today from a vacation, I found your letter regarding the probability of having one teacher only for the Skidegate Day School.\n\nI think that an average of 42 pupils would be too many for Mrs. Wark to handle. As the full attendance is not likely until October, I would suggest that the hiring of a second teacher be left until then, and only hired for seven months, as the people begin to leave again in April. At Massett we have a second, for five months only, and we have found it quite satisfactory and have had no trouble in securing a second teacher when needed.\n\nThere are a number of Skidegate children who are anxious to go to Coqualeetza, and Mr. Raley has promised to take them if permission is granted. If they do go, it is just possible that Mrs. Wark could carry on alone for the whole term. I would recommend that five or six children be sent to Coqualeetza, and that the question of a second teacher be left in abeyance for the time being.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner,\nToronto, Ont.\n31/1787.\n\nOttawa, August 9, 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you addressed to Rev. Mr. Turner, with reference to the appointment of a second teacher at the Skidegate Indian Day School or the sending of a number of the children to the Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, if the Indian parents are in a position to properly care for their children, it is considered that it would cost less to provide a second teacher from, approximately, the first of November until the end of March following. However, in this connection I would point out that the average attendance is 42 pupils, and it is considered that one teacher should be able to handle this number. Our funds this year are extremely limited and it is necessary to curtail expenditure at every possible point.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear further from you as to whether you do not consider one teacher could carry on the entire school work during the coming academic year, without the engaging of a second teacher for a five month period. In any event, the Department is not prepared, at the present time, to authorize the expenditure required in connection with the transportation and the per capita grant for a number of children from Skidegate at the Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nSir,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter to Mr. Barner regarding a second teacher for Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nWill the Department approve of the suggestions made, and allow me to send six children to Coqualeetza? The cost of transportation will be approximately One Hundred dollars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAug. 8th,\n1933.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRE: JUNIOR TEACHER,\nDAY SCHOOL - SKIDEGATE, B.C.\n\nAfter our conversation concerning the possibility of Mrs. Wark handling all the pupils in this school herself, I wrote to Mr. Gillett, the Indian Agent, asking for his opinion in regard to the matter.\n\nHis suggestion - which has just arrived - is that we hire a second teacher for seven months, October to April, inclusive. He says that the people do not get back from fishing until almost October, and sometimes they begin to leave again in April. In addition, there is the possibility that five or six children may go to Coqualeetza this fall.\n\nMr. Barner and I are quite satisfied with this suggestion, and if it meets with your approval we will proceed to find a teacher who is willing to accept an appointment on this basis. Could you let me know, in your reply, what salary rate would be allowed?\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB:GWF.\nOttawa, August 14, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, regarding the appointment of a second teacher at the Skidegate Indian Day School during the coming fall and winter months. In this connection I have to say that the Department received a communication from Mr. Gillett, the local Indian Agent, regarding the matter.\n\nIn our reply, it was pointed out that the average attendance is 42 pupils and that it was considered one teacher should be able to handle this number. The Agent was informed, further, that our funds this year are so limited that it is necessary to curtail expenditure at every possible point. The Department requested him to give further consideration to the necessity for a second teacher for approximately a five or six month period and to state if, in his opinion, the appointment of this teacher was really necessary.\n\nMr. Gillett requested a grant of $100 to cover the cost of transportation in sending six children to Coqualeetza. In this connection he was informed that the Department would be unable to provide the funds required.\n\nIt was suggested to him that, if any action is necessary, it would incur less expense to provide a second teacher for the period mentioned above than to send a number of children to Coqualeetza and provide the per capita grant for them.\n\nWhen a further report is received from Mr. Agent Gillett, a decision will be given regarding the appointment of an additional teacher, and you will be advised. In any event, it is considered, if it is necessary to engage a second teacher, that her duties should not commence before November first next, and that it should be possible to secure a suitable teacher at a salary of $80 or $85 per teaching month, less the deduction of 10%.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSir,-\n\nReplying to your letter No.157-11-1 of Aug. 9th, I may say that I consider that one teacher could carry on the school work at Skidegate during the coming academic year, without engaging a second teacher, providing the average attendance is not more than 42. I would recommend trying it out in any event. If it should prove unsatisfactory, I could take the matter up with the Department later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nThe Postmaster,\nSkidegate Mission,\nvia Skidegate, B.C.\n\nCharge - Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed by Mr. J. Gillett, Indian Agent at Massett, that he has received the resignation of Mrs. Elsie Wark, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, to take effect on the 30th instant. Mr. Gillett has been informed that Mrs. Wark's resignation is accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaten, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nAugust 23rd, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\n\nThe Department has received the resignations of the teachers of the Skidegate Indian Day School, (Reserve No. 1, Electoral District of Skeena).\n\nAt this school, one teacher is employed for the whole academic year, viz., from September 1st to June 30th, and a second teacher is employed for the period November 1st to May 31st. During the latter period, the Indians have returned to the reserve and two teachers are required to handle the large number of pupils that attend.\n\nIn the past, the Department has permitted the United Church of Canada to nominate the teachers. We are in receipt of a letter from Rev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A., Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, nominating the following teachers:\n\n(1) Miss Lois E. Kinley - to be in charge of the school for the full academic year. Miss Kinley is fully qualified and has had ten years' teaching experience.\n\n(2) Miss Cama Okamura - for the seven months' period. In nominating Miss Okamura, Reverend\n\nMr. Beaton\nMr. Beaton writes:\n\n\"She holds a first class professional British Columbia certificate from the Victoria Normal School and has taken the course which Captain Barry gives each year in connection with the summer session of the Normal School.\n\n\"Miss Okamura is a Canadian-born Japanese from a fine Christian home; has a pleasing personality; and will, I feel sure, prove to be an excellent teacher. It seems better to try her out in one of these short-term schools by way of experiment before committing ourselves to a permanent appointment in connection with our work.\"\n\nI should appreciate your direction in this matter.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nThe Skidegate school will require a second teacher by the first of November. As the United Church Authorities at Toronto have the privilege of nominating a teacher for this school, I would suggest that action be taken immediately so that one may be appointed in time. It is to be understood that the teacher's services will not be required after April 30th, 1935.\n\nLast year the second teacher took charge on October 1st. This year November will be soon enough, as a number of the Indians will be away from their village somewhat longer this fall on account of the cannery work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nUp to the present I have had no further word regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nI hope that a lady teacher has been appointed, as the teacher will have to share the house with the nurse who takes Mrs. Gladstone's place. While Mrs. Gladstone was nurse, it was not necessary for her to live in the teacher's house, as she is married to an Indian in the village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 10, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nEnclosed is a copy of official letter addressed to you on June 1st, last. No reply has been received. Possibly the matter has been overlooked, and I would appreciate your letting me know as soon as possible whether or not you intend to make a nomination for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1934.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your 30/2261 of the 19th ultimo regarding the Skidegate Indian Day School, it is noted that you state that, if eight children were sent to Coqualeetza, the services of one of the teachers in the day school would not be required.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of August 9th, last, the Department considers that, if the Indian parents are in a position to properly care for their children, it would cost less to provide a second teacher from, approximately, the first of November until the end of March following. This is the same procedure as was followed last year and, as far as the Department is aware, it was satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have had a number of enquiries from parents at Skidegate regarding their children going to Coqualeetza Residential School. I may say that Mr. Raley is continually writing to Skidegate asking for children from there.\n\nWhat is the Department's policy this year in the matter of allowing children from Skidegate to go to Boarding School. I may say that there is an up-to-date school at Skidegate, with two qualified teachers, for the last four years. If the Department would allow eight children to go to Coqualeetza, one of the teachers at Skidegate could be dispensed with.\n\nIn the past the majority of graduates from Coqualeetza returning to Skidegate, have been a credit to the school, and are now a credit to the village. Some of them have married, and their homes compare favourably with those of white people.\n\nI would recommend that the Department give permission for at least eight pupils to be sent from Skidegate, providing that the parents pay the fares.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter dated June 16th, instant, as received from Capt. G.H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., with attached copies of correspondence dealing with the resignation of Mrs. Elsie Wark as teacher of the Indian Day School at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Agency.

Unless you have already made arrangements to have Miss Phillips go to the school on October first, the Department considers that it would be advisable to utilize her services for six months only. However, if you have advised her that her services would be required for seven months, you may notify her to reach the Skidegate School on October first.\n\nSalary will be allowed Miss Phillips at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Phillips, teacher of the junior room at the Skidegate Indian Day School, was paid for the month of November and also for the month of December. She wrote the Department about the latter part of December stating that she had begun duties in October. It was presumed from this letter that she began duties on October 1st, and, consequently, arrangements have been made to forward her a cheque at the end of this month for the months of October and January.\n\nIn a letter dated the 10th instant from Miss Phillips, she states that she did not begin duties until October 15th. Consequently, in issuing her a cheque at the end of this month for two months' salary, an over-payment of half a month is being made to her. Please advise her at once to cash this cheque when she receives it.\n\nYou should at once advise the Department on what date Miss Phillips will discontinue teaching, and arrangements will then be made to deduct from her salary the amount that has been overpaid for the period October 1st to October 15th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SKIDEGATE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL - (Date of Inspection May 29/36).\n\nI wish further to recommend that this Skidigate Indian Day School be not opened till October 1st each year and that it be closed on May 31st yearly, but that during the period October to May inclusive the TWO TEACHERS be employed. This would be a very much better educational arrangement than the present one of opening with one teacher for Senior and Junior children in one room, going on in November to two teachers and then having only one teacher for both Senior and Junior children in June. The attendance in September and June would not be sufficient to make such a mix up of teachers and pupils a worth while practice.\n\nWhile I do not like the practice of having one teacher living alone in this village, the conditions are not quite as bad as they are in Massett, and the fact that the Field Matron, Mrs. Gladstone, lives quite near makes things much better. There is, however, I have every reason to believe, considerable drinking among the Indians in Skidigate at present and the Department certainly takes quite a risk in permitting single girls to live alone in these villages. Two teachers from October to May, inclusive, would solve the difficulty.\n\nEXTRACT FROM MR. BARRY'S LETTER DATED MAY 30, 1936, ACCOMPANYING THE ABOVE REPORT.\n\nI have recommended in this report that school be not opened till most of the Indians are back from fishing on say October 1st and that it be closed at the end of May. If my recommendation of having both teachers here from the opening on October 1st till the close on May 31st be followed, the girls will be much safer, and far better educational work can be done. The present practice of moving children from teacher to teacher is not good and is holding back the school.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am very sorry to report that Miss Bunice Phillips arrived back in Vancouver after her year's work at Queen Charlotte tired and run-down. Her doctor claims that she is an incipient T.B. case, and has ordered her to take a year's rest. She has therefore asked us for leave of absence for one year which we are reluctantly granting.\n\nSomething unique happened in connection with the Skidegate School this year, because we received a letter from the Chief and Council expressing appreciation of the work of these teachers both in the classrooms and in the extra-curriculum activities. Most of the letters we get from our Indian Reserves are complaints.\n\nI would like to suggest that Miss Vera F. Weaver should be appointed as the ten-months' teacher at Skidegate for the ensuing academic year beginning September 1st, and as a supply for the seven-months' teacher I would like to nominate Miss C. A. Vanderveen. She holds a First Class B. C. Certificate obtained at the Vancouver Normal. She has also a Strathcona Physical Training certificate, and has graduated from the Lowndes School of Commerce, New Westminster. Miss Vanderveen has known Indians all her life, having been born at Ucluelet where her father at that time was engaged as a missionary. I feel quite satisfied that she will be a very competent supply during Miss Phillips' absence, and I hope that the nomination will meet with your approval.\n\nIf the question arises as to what is to be done a year from now, we can only say that every consideration will be given to transferring Miss Weaver to another school in B. C. of a similar grade rather than allow her to revert to the $700 salary status.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB:BJ\n\nIndian Affairs.

He, therefore, recommended that this school be kept open from October first to the end of May each academic year and that the two teachers be employed for the full eight months' period.\n\nMr. Barry considers that the above arrangement would be better for the teachers, as there would be two of them in the village during the full term and, from an academic standpoint, it would be preferable for the pupils.

C.\nMasset, B.C.,\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report as follows for the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of April 1937.\n\nThe Skidegate Indian Day school average was as follows, Boys 10, Girls 8 Total 18, Senior room average attendance 12.83 in the junior class were boys 12, girls 10, average attendance 16.85.\n\nI visited the school in company with the Chief Councillor and Indian Constable, as I had occasion to speak to the pupils regarding the use of Slingshots which were doing some damage to property, we took away several slingshots from the pupils and warned them not to have them in their possession again. Outside of the above complaint, the general behaviour has been very good and a cleaning up of the village is in progress.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 13th, 1937. File No 157-11-1, and note your wishes contained therein? (also enclosure).\n\nI have just returned from a visit to Skidegate and find that Miss Vanderween (junior teacher) finished her duties May 21st. I understand that Miss Vanderween started her duties one week earlier, this information from Miss Weaver, (senior Teacher) who is now taking both classes until the end of June.\n\nRe:- Inspector Barry's recommendation for the full eight month period.\n\nWith regard to the above recommendation for an eight month's period, I have taken this up with the Council, and they feel that as the majority of pupils come home early in September that this month would be wasted as far as their education is concerned, there will be over 20 of school age to start school in September, bringing the total up to around 90 pupils, (this at the Massett Indian Day School). They suggested that a third teacher be appointed for that 5 month term, ending March.\n\nPersonally I think that the above suggestions are the best solutions to keep the children well under control, to advance their education, and to keep them out of trouble during September; unless we have a third teacher, it means that the Junior class will be over 60, this number of course is rather hard to control by one teacher, perhaps as Mr Barry has just inspected these Schools, he may have come to a different opinion, although at the time of his visit many had already gone away to their fishing grounds,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.T.

The majority going with their parents to the North Island fishing grounds, the average attendance being 14.74 in the Senior class and 16.66 in the Junior class.\n\nSince the 21st of May the senior teacher has taken both classes with a total of 25 pupils.\n\nB.

I would appreciate receiving your comments in regard to this matter.\n\nAs you can easily understand, it is difficult for the Department to reach a decision when the reports of our officials are at variance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJune 30, 1937.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to my report on the Skidegate Indian Day School forwarded to you on May 15th last from Tlell, I have now received Departmental letter 157-11-1 dated June 21st and a copy of a letter from the Acting Indian Agent dated Massett, May 27th 1937.\n\nThe Superintendent of Welfare and Training asks for comments in regard to the closing of the above mentioned school during the months of September and June, which was the recommendation made in my report on this school on a previous occasion.\n\nWith great respect I would first point out that to me the discussion of the administration of the school with the Indian Council appears a great mistake.\n\nAs pointed out on other occasions the Indians of the Queen Charlotte Islands wrongly consider that the schools are paid for out of Indian funds and that they as Indians should have the decision as to what should be taught in the schools, how they should be conducted, etc.\n\nMr. Phillips has very little experience of Indians in general and of the Skidegate Indians in particular. He has little or no knowledge of school administration, and while I regret that he now appears to have come to an opposite opinion than that expressed when he discussed the matter with me during my visit to the Queen Charlottes, I simply am unable to modify my own professional recommendation in the matter.\n\nTo take up in detail the remarks of Mr. Phillips is a very difficult matter, as I do not understand what Mr. Phillips means in the third paragraph of his letter, nor do I understand his reference to the need for a third teacher, or what his reference to the Massett Indian Day School means.\n\nIt will be best for me to indicate again the reasons which prompted my recommendation of an eight month school year.\n\n| Senior Room Average Attendance |\n|-------------------------------|\n| September 1934 12.31          |\n| September 1935 16.55          |\n| September 1936 17.78          |\n| June 1935 10.16               |\n\nDuring the above months all the children were in the Senior Room and only one teacher was employed.\n\nMay I say that in Skidegate the majority of the children most certainly do not come home early in September as stated by the Council.\nIt is a very bad practice to start small children with one teacher, the senior one, as has been done in Skidegate, and then in October or November have them go into another room and restart work with the other teacher. I do not believe that any competent authority on education would recommend such a practice, and it is mainly this foolish procedure that I understood that the Indian Affairs Branch had decided to abolish, hence my remark in the second last paragraph of Page 5 of my Skidegate report dated May 15, 1937.\n\nThe old procedure was for all the remaining pupils to again be taken together in the Senior Division in June thus destroying all chance of carrying the work of the senior division to a successful conclusion just before the High School and other Tests.\n\nThese remarks also apply to Massett, though the actual attendance figures are different and as given in my reports. In September 1926 it happened for I understand the first time and due to failure of fishing, that there were enough children to warrant Mr. Collison opening the two rooms at Massett together and on September 1st.\n\nIt is very important that one teacher be not sent to live in either Massett or Skidegate BY HERSELF.\n\nI would not object to the opening of the two rooms at either Massett or at Skidegate on September 1st this year if the Indian Affairs Branch considers this the best course, nor do I object to the same two rooms being kept open in June 1938. There are not in normal years enough pupils to justify keeping the rooms open in June, and for the other reasons given in my reports the teacher of the senior room should certainly not be left in the village by herself.\n\nWhat Mr. Phillips means by the statement that the junior class will be over 60 unless we have a third teacher I do not know. I may say that my remarks and recommendations were not based on the actual number in school when I inspected as Mr. Phillips would have seen had he consulted the copy of my reports in his possession before he wrote to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMy recommendation is still to open Senior and Junior Divisions in Massett and Skidegate on October 1st and to close these schools on May 31st yearly. The progress of the pupils will not be retarded in any way, regardless of the opinions of non professional persons, and the wishes of Indians whose one aim is to have the children attend a Residential School if possible or if that is impossible get rid of their children for as long as possible in the day schools.\n\nI hope that by the time of my next visit to the Queen Charlotte Islands in May 1938 a permanent Indian Agent will have been appointed and I can then explain in detail to him just why the recommendations were made in my reports which the Indian Affairs Branch knows were with a view to lessening the possibility of a criminal attack on one of our teachers by drunken Indian youths.\n\nI certainly hope that this explanation will carry some weight with the Director of Welfare and Training, and I would ask you to add your own recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the Skidegate Day School the average was Senior 17.68 and the Junior class 18.79 an increase at both schools during December.\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nHarold W. McGill, M.D.,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of December 2nd. I quite appreciate your statements concerning the employment of qualified teachers. But really both Mr. Bryant and Mr. Kinley are not without qualifications. Mr. Bryant has a number of official qualifications though he does not possess a B.C. Teachers Certificate. One particular training he possesses is perhaps the most useful thing in an Indian School. He has a natural gift in mechanics and has developed his school along that line in an unusual degree. Besides, even Mr. Barry must agree that in ordinary school work he has been outstanding. As for Mr. Kinley, he has taken two terms at the Summer School in Victoria under Mr. Barry's instruction. It is my confirmed conviction that the Department is most fortunate in having two such men in its employ, not only as teachers but as an influence for good on the reservations. I very sincerely hope you will find it expedient to retain them in their positions at their respective places.\n\nAs to the new work at Kitwancool and Kisgagas, I note that you think favourably about it. Both these places are so isolated and accommodation so poor that we could hardly ask any white person to go there. It seems to me that the only immediate thing to do would be to get hold of the most capable native and try him out in the work and in the meantime try to find a young native and get him properly trained for the work.\n\nI have, as my previous letter informed you, a couple of natives who have unusual education who could do some good work until we could obtain better qualified men. I have at least one such man in view. One qualification necessary is that any teacher at these places would have to be able to speak the local language. This restricts a choice. A white qualified teacher at these places seems to be out of the question. I do not know where such a person could be found who would be able and willing to stick it.\nMcGill.\n\nYou mention in your letter that it was your intention to recommend a grant be made to both of these school immediately after the opening of the school year in 1938. Does this mean that the grant will be available at the beginning of 1938 and will it be available for the men I have mentioned, Mr. Wale and Mr. Williams?\n\nThanking you again for the informative letter you sent and wishing you and yours a happy Christmas and New Year,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

During the past few years our salaries have been slowly decreased to the point where it is almost impossible to live here.\n\nIn view of these facts, may I respectfully request that my salary be increased to the minimum which, I believe to be $1,200 per annum. Another small detail is that I was appointed to the school and expected to assume full responsibility as Principal which I did. I understand that the Principal's salary was $10.00 per month more than the usual salary. In the past three years, my salary has been the same as the Junior Teacher's and yet I have been acting in the capacity as Principal.\n\nIf it is possible to make some adjustment, Sir, would you be so kind as to let me know as soon as it is convenient for you so that I may make my plans accordingly.\n\nThanking you for your indulgence and hoping that you can see it possible to make an increase, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJohn H.

While here I also called on Mrs. Gladstone, our field matron, and the local United Church Missionary, the Rev. Mr. Afleck. The meeting with the council was on the whole quite satisfactory and matters on which information was requested were dealt with, these having mainly to do with medical service, preparation of income tax returns and the Indian Day School. No requests for relief were submitted nor complaints made against the Agent.\n\nCertain improvements and repairs to the day school building are necessary and some work is also required to the teacher's residence. I instructed the Agent to prepare a list of these needs and secure an estimate of the costs involved in order that if possible some of the repairs could be undertaken during the months of July and August. The teacher's residence is a large, poorly constructed building and, in my opinion, should not have been acquired by the Department. It will be costly to maintain properly and it might be better to either dispose of it or tear it down and build a smaller new house in replacement as the cost of remodelling would probably equal the cost of a suitable new building. A small new teacher's residence for this Reserve might be included in our post-war program of worthwhile works.\n\nIt is doubtful if Miss Mackie, principal of the Indian day school, will continue at Skidegate after the close of the current school year as she is not enjoying good health and has been advised by the doctor to take a year's rest. Miss Mackie had done excellent work for use at Skidegate and is highly esteemed by the Indian people. It will be extremely difficult to replace her. She assured me, however, that she would be glad to seek employment with us should she decide to resume teaching on regaining her health.\n\n(over)\nI spent some time with the field matron, Mrs. Gladstone, R.N., who although somewhat dissatisfied with the salary we are paying her, still carries on and is doing very good work. At the time of my visit she was busy fixing up the new dispensary which is now located in the teacher's residence. A small expenditure for material and labour required to complete the painting and installation of shelving in the dispensary was authorized. Mrs. Gladstone reported that there was very little sickness in the village and that on the whole the health of the Indian was quite good.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D.M.

She has asked to be transferred to another Indian Day School and Commissioner MacKay has recommended her transfer to the Metlakatla School.\n\nIt will be necessary, therefore, for you to nominate another teacher to succeed Miss Merritt at Skidegate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nActing Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\nQ.C.I.\nMasset, B.C.\n\nJuly 4th, 1946.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report as follows for the Queen Charlotte Agency, B.C., for the Quarter ending June, 1946.\n\nEDUCATIONAL:\n\nThe Schools of both the Massett and Skidegate Reserves were visited several times each during the months. At the Skidegate school the teachers of both rooms, have made quite an improvement with their pupils during their terms, and it is regretted that Miss Merrett is being transferred to another school, however we are lucky in having Miss Strong return in her place, she too being a very capable teacher, Miss Mackie the Junior room teacher is staying for another term.\n\nAt the Massett school both the Senior and Junior teachers are not returning, both have done very well since they took over in February, however in conversation with Bishop Gibson, who was here on a visit, I was informed that he was sure that he would be able to recommend two teachers for this school for September both the Massett teachers were very active in social work and were very well liked by the Natives.\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT FOR MARCH QUARTER\n\nEDUCATIONAL:\n\nThe schools of both the Massett and Skidegate Reserves were visited several times each month. At the Skidegate school the teacher of the senior room has her class well disciplined, also in this class manual training has been introduced, and the boys have made a bookcase with doors and shelves for their room. I have recommended that tools be purchased for their use, to encourage them in this work. At the Massett school both the teachers commenced their duties in February, and are doing very well with their classes. They are very active in social work on the Reserve, have a teenage canteen and a kindergarten for those under school age under their supervision. The junior teacher (Mrs. Conroy) was taken out by plane March 17th with a throat affection to Prince Rupert, but returned to her duties March 28th. Both teachers are very well liked by the Indians of the Reserve.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nEducational:\n\nThe Schools of both the Massett and Skidegate Reserves were visited several times each month. At the Skidegate Reserve the Teachers of both the Senior and Junior rooms appear to have things well in hand, and it was noted that the discipline in both rooms are much better than in previous years, a Christmas Concert was held at the Community Hall by the pupils which was very good according to the Council, the parents were particularly pleased with the children. At the Massett school, we only had one teacher, (Mrs Fray) who took both senior and Junior rooms morning and afternoon respectively, Mrs Fray was a very good teacher and a good disciplinarian and was very well liked by the pupils, however Mrs Fray was taken out by plane on the 17th of December to Hospital for an operation, her complaint is \"Ascites\" and the Field Matron has informed me that she will not be returning to teach at Massett, the school of course is closed down.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING SEPTEMBER 30th, 1945, ON QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY\n\nEducation: The schools of both the Massett and Skidegate Reserves were closed during July and August, during which repairs and cleaning were done. I visited both schools during September; two new teachers were at the Skidegate school (although Miss Mackie was Junior teacher here before). Miss Merritt is the New Senior teacher and appears to be a very capable person, taking a great interest in all matters pertaining to the welfare of the children and the school etc. The Natives appear to appreciate having two good teachers, as some of the white schools seem to have difficulty in this respect. At the Massett Reserve we have not been so fortunate, as to date we have not got a Senior teacher, but Mrs. Fray has her junior room going with 49 pupils up to this time, no doubt there will be many more when the Indians are all back on the Reserve. Mrs. Fray however is able to cope with any increases, and the children are very orderly under her care.\n\nB.T.

As she informed you we employed her from September 1, 1944 to June 30th, 1945 at the Walpole Island Indian Day School. At that time she held an interim second class certificate. The Inspector's report and the Agent's report on her work during the year she was employed on Walpole Island were very satisfactory.\n\nIn a letter dated August 27th, Indian Commissioner MacKay forwarded an application of Mrs. Ruth Adna McMahon for position as teacher of the senior room of the Skidegate School. Indian Commissioner MacKay stated in his letter that he referred the application to Reverend Horton who is acting for Reverend W.M. Hunt and Reverend Mr. Horton approved submitting the application to us. Mrs. McMahon has no certificate but in the absence of any qualified applicants and in order to open this classroom and relieve Miss Mackie of an overload of work, the Indian Commissioner urged the appointment of Mrs. McMahon, and this was approved in official letter of August 30th.\n\nPossibly you would desire to nominate Miss Chinnick for some other school but on the other hand we could advise Indian Commissioner MacKay to find another school for Mrs. McMahon and allow Miss Chinnick to take Skidegate.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I have written today to Major MacKay, saying that we are sending her name forward but that the nomination is subject to his approval.\n\nWe shall be glad to hear from you, as Miss Chinnick plans to go out the middle of this month.

You do not state the salary that you suggest be allowed but it is considered that $90.00 a teaching month plus bonus of 24.1% should be sufficient as Mrs. McMahon does not possess any certificate.\n\nYou should have her complete and return the usual forms as soon as she begins duties.\n\nBernard F.

You will note that Mrs. McMahon is not a certificated teacher but in the absence of any qualified applicants and in order to open this classroom and relieve Miss Mackie of an overload of work, it is considered advisable that Mrs. McMahon be appointed for the current academic year only. I may say that previous attempts to operate the Skidegate Indian Day School with one teacher and even on a half-day basis were most unsatisfactory and in one case injurious to the teacher's health.\n\nMrs. McMahon is a widow with a son six years of age who will no doubt attend the junior room of the Skidegate School with the approval of the Department.\n\nI would appreciate confirmation of Mrs. McMahon's appointment by airmail as there is only infrequent mail and passenger service to Skidegate.\n\nFor D.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for British Columbia,\nP.O. Box 80,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSeptember 10th, 1946.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI wrote you on September 4th, saying that we had sent the nomination of Miss Betty Jane Chinnick to the Department, subject to your approval. Now we find that, in conference with Rev. H.E. Horton, acting for Mr. Bunt, you have sent forward the nomination of Mrs. Ruth Anna Molaison for what I presume is the same position, and the Department has approved of this, according to their letter of August 30th. We have absolutely no criticism of the action taken by you and Mr. Horton, but I am writing to ask if you would consider the following facts:\n\nMiss Chinnick is only available for Skidegate. She is a comparatively young person. She has taught at Malpole Island for a year and holds a second-class certificate. Her work is satisfactory. Her parents would be glad to have her go to Skidegate, where she could be associated with Rev. Mr. Affleck; but I am afraid they would not consider the possibility of her going to any other school in British Columbia. Under the circumstances, if Mrs. Molaison has not already proceeded to Skidegate, would it be possible for you to appoint Mrs. Molaison to some other school, so as to allow Miss Chinnick to go to Skidegate? I hesitate to make this request, as no doubt Mrs. Molaison expects to go to Skidegate; but, if it were at all possible to carry out this suggestion, it would give us two teachers in place of one.\n\nI may say that I had a conversation yesterday with Mr. Bunt, who thought that it would be satisfactory for me to write you in this way. I need hardly say again how much we appreciate your co-operation. If this matter can be arranged, will you please send me a wire - c/o General Council, The United Church of Canada, Erskine-American Church, Montreal, where I shall be for the next ten days.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\n(Sgd.)

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI wrote you on September 4th, saying that we had sent the nomination of Miss Betty Jane Chinnick to the Department, subject to your approval. Now we find that, in conference with Rev. A.H. Horton, acting for Mr. Bunt, you have sent forward the nomination of Mrs. Ruth Edna McMahon for what I presume is the same position, and the Department has approved of this, according to their letter of August 20th. We have absolutely no criticism of the action taken by you and Mr. Horton, but I am writing to ask if you would consider the following facts:\n\nMiss Chinnick is only available for Skidegate. She is a comparatively young person. She has taught at Valpole Island for a year and holds a second-class certificate. Her work is satisfactory. Her parents would be glad to have her go to Skidegate, where she could be associated with Rev. Mr. Affleck; but I am afraid they would not consider the possibility of her going to any other school in British Columbia. Under the circumstances, if Mrs. McMahon has not already proceeded to Skidegate, would it be possible for you to appoint Mrs. McMahon to some other school, so as to allow Miss Chinnick to go to Skidegate? I hesitate to make this request, as no doubt Mrs. McMahon expects to go to Skidegate; but, if it were at all possible to carry out this suggestion, it would give us two teachers in place of one.\n\nI may say that I had a conversation yesterday with Mr. Bunt, who thought that it would be satisfactory for me to write you in this way. I need hardly say again how much we appreciate your co-operation. If this matter can be arranged, will you please send me a wire - c/o General Council, The United Church of Canada, Erskine-American Church, Montreal, where I shall be for the next ten days.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Rev.

At the Massett Reserve, we were not so fortunate in having a concert owing to the lack of teachers at this school, however we are opening the school in January, teachers having been appointed.\n\nB.T.

However, we do require two teachers for the Massett Indian Day School, which is in the same area. This school is located about two miles from the white settlement of the same name. At present there is no electricity on the reservation, but the Indians are contemplating the installation of a plant. There is also no water system. There is a Superior School in the town of Massett, which will give instruction to pupils up to Grade X and possibly beyond.\n\nA second possibility is to employ the teacher to whom you refer in the Alert Bay Indian Day School when its construction is completed. This school is about a mile from the Provincial Superior School, which also gives instruction up to Grade X. The school and teachorage will be connected to the regular Power Commission Plant which supplies 110 volt 60 cycle current. The Reserve is also equipped with a water system. I may say that it is anticipated that the school will not be ready until January of 1948.\n\nThese are the only two possibilities in Protestant schools close enough to a white High School to permit attendance of a student from a Reservation.\n\nD.-M.

The Department will be prepared to allow salary at the same rate as was paid the previous teacher of the junior room, viz.: $100 per teaching month, less 10%.\n\nThe authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices the school is conducted, informed the Department that they intend to nominate Miss Lois E. Kinley and that her appointment will meet with the approval of Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B. C. No doubt, Miss Kinley will begin duties at the time mentioned. We have not yet received particulars as to her qualifications and experience, which, however, appear to be satisfactory.\n\nI would request that you give the workers at this school any assistance you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, is being so informed, but it is possible that he has already arranged for Miss Phillips to proceed to the school on October first. If so, Mr. Beaton has been authorised to permit her to begin duties on October first. The salary allowed Miss Phillips will be at the rate of $100 a teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Under these circumstances, Miss Phillips' name should be omitted from future paylists and the following entry should appear on the May paylist:\n\n843 - Skidegate - Lois E. Kinley - Skidegate Mission, -$1000.-$100.00 B. C.\nOttawa, August 7, 1936.\n\nSIR:\n\nThe authorities of the United Church of Canada have requested that Miss Lois E.

Phillips, the junior teacher, part time, at Skidegate, be appointed senior teacher to succeed Miss Kinley. The Department is approving the appointment of Miss Phillips as senior teacher, as from September third, next, the date the school re-opens after the present holidays. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $80 per teaching month.\n\nBy arrangement with the church authorities, the department has agreed that Miss Kinley's salary at Fort Simpson should continue to be at the same rate as she received at Skidegate and that the salary rating at the Fort Simpson School, viz.: $80 per teaching month, should apply at Skidegate.\n\nI would request that you give Miss Phillips every assistance you can in her work at the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nWith regard to a teacher, part time, for the junior room at Skidegate, the church authorities will take up this matter with the Department at a later date, and you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

You might let me have an estimate of the cost of putting all the desks into satisfactory condition mounted on the usual strips of wood at the correct distances. As Captain Barry is not prepared to recommend the purchase of any desks at the present time, I am returning herewith copy of the requisition for school materials.\n\nOn examination of the above mentioned requisition, I find that the teacher included a number of articles in addition to the desks which, if required, should have formed the subject of a separate letter to this office. Requisitions for school supplies should, as heretofore, be directed to the Department at Ottawa, while requests for the purchase of such articles as desks, furniture, etc., should be forwarded to me in triplicate.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

This two room structure is in fairly good shape but I would point out that it is surmounted by a cupola housing the school bell, flanked on each side by two very low brick chimneys and a wind is liable to carry sparks into the cupola and set fire to the building. (See photograph attached) The building is in fair repair but requires interior and exterior redecoration. The children appear to be somewhat hard on this school and should be checked up by the staff and Agent.\n\nIn order to encourage gardening in the village I believe it would be well to fence off part of the school grounds and establish a school garden. It was observed that the Agent had some clearing done behind the school by relief recipients and this work might be extended to putting the grounds in shape next winter. This work could also include graveling of the walks in place of the wooden walks now in place as these are worn out and broken and liable to cause accidents to the children.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. B.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 5th, 1940. Re: improvements at Skidegate School and grounds.\n\nWith regard to the two very low chimney's at the above school, also at the teachers residence, I would like to recommend that an extension be made out of one eighth of an inch plate welded together, as per attached sketch. I obtained a tender for the three to cost $10.00 each (3 costing $30.00) there would also be the cost of wire for stays, and labour which altogether should not cost above $45.00 for the three chimney's, the extension would be about 5ft.\n\nA brick extension of 5ft on each chimney would cost in the neighbourhood of $25.00 each chimney and would also have to have iron stays made to hold against the wind storms; it is difficult to get materials for the above, and bricklayers are very scarce, perhaps I could get a tender for the above work, if this is desired.\n\nWith regard to fencing off a part of the school ground for gardening to encourage the children, I took this matter up with the Council, and it was their opinion that a fence would not last long owing to the cattle roaming around, and that the most of the children go away with their parents to the canneries etc. from time to time. I have had the teachers (residence) fence repaired several times, but have come to the conclusion that it is better to leave it open, the children too are very destructive, and on my recent visit I cautioned both classes against this practice, and also advised the teachers to check the pupils from time to time.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe matter of getting relief recipients to work graveling the walks to the entrance and back entrance of the school was taken up with the Council, the only persons on relief are the aged, sick, and T.B., the Indians usually give two days work each in the spring; this is for road improvements and cleaning up the Reserve, it was felt that the Department should take the responsibility of graveling of the above walks to the school, it would cost for hire of truck to haul gravel, and to spread same on walks, about $30.00, this would be from road to front Entrance, and from back entrance to boys & girls toilets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.T.

The cost of these has now been determined at approximately $500.00 in the case of the Skidegate School and $630.00 for the Massett School.\n\nMr. Phillips made provision in his 1944-45 Estimates for part of these amounts, and it is requested that, if sufficient funds are available, authority be granted to have the work proceeded with. These two schools were the subject of criticism by the Provincial School Inspector and it would be advisable to have the necessary repairs and painting done as soon as possible.\n\nD.M.

While here I also called on Mrs. Gladstone, our field matron, and the local United Church Missionary, the Rev. Mr. Affleck. The meeting with the council was on the whole quite satisfactory and matters on which information was requested were dealt with, these having mainly to do with medical service, preparation of income tax returns and the Indian Day School. No requests for relief were submitted nor complaints made against the Agent.\n\nCertain improvements and repairs to the day school building are necessary and some work is also required to the teacher's residence. I instructed the Agent to prepare a list of these needs and secure an estimate of the costs involved in order that if possible some of the repairs could be undertaken during the months of July and August. The teacher's residence is a large, poorly constructed building and, in my opinion, should not have been acquired by the Department. It will be costly to maintain properly and it might be better to either dispose of it or tear it down and build a smaller new house in replacement as the cost of remodelling would probably equal the cost of a suitable new building. A small new teacher's residence for this Reserve might be included in our post-war program of worthwhile works.\n\nIt is doubtful if Miss Mackie, principal of the Indian day school, will continue at Skidegate after the close of the current school year as she is not enjoying good health and has been advised by the doctor to take a year's rest. Miss Mackie had done excellent work for use at Skidegate and is highly esteemed by the Indian people. It will be extremely difficult to replace her. She assured me, however, that she would be glad to seek employment with us should she decide to resume teaching on regaining her health.\n\n(over)\nREPORT ON QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1944.\n\nAt the Skidegate Reserve which I visited during the month, I visited the school and teachery, checked up delivery of paint for school, and found a shortage which was located at the Wharf and delivered. I measured up lot at teachery for lumber for a proposed new fence, interviewed the Field Matron, Dr. McColl, Indians at the Office, also held a Council meeting when matters pertaining to the welfare of the Village were taken up, I visited several homes on the Reserve, and work is progressing on two new five roomed houses in the Village, also several new boat houses have been erected, many boats were anchored in the Village, owing to bad weather.\n\nB.T.

New wood shed and toilet have been built at the teahery and new furniture and alterations for the comfort of our teachers. At the Skidegate Reserve a new urinal is being built, and also a new fence is being built at the teahery. There is no doubt that the Indian schools are the best on the Islands; the Indians children of this Agency are very bright, and several are now attending superior schools here. The children are exceptionally good at needle work, drawing, painting and very musical. The parents are very keen on giving their children a good education. We are not equipped for Manual training, but have a large class room for this purpose at the Massett school as soon as conditions permit an instructor for that work. Basket making also Slate Totem pole Carving was taught at both schools, but this was stopped at the beginning of the war. Several Indian drawings and designs have been entered in a competition at the Stanford University, U.S.A. We have not as yet heard the result of judges. I usually visit the Massett School three times a month and the Skidegate twice a month. Junior Red Cross work is being carried on at both schools. The Massett school has been adopted by the Sir James Barrie Imperial Daughters of the Empire, from which sporting goods etc. have been received for the pupils.\n\nB.T.

Owing to the majority of Councillors being off the Reserve, no Council meetings were held, but matters pertaining to the welfare of the Village were taken up with those individual Councillors who happened to be on the Reserve. I visited the school twice each visit, had new heaters installed in both class rooms, had rooms scrubbed out, and minor repairs attended to both at the school and teachers residence, the teachers being supplied with household necessities. I also interviewed several Indians on the Reserve and at the Office, re: trap lines, Allowances, Birth Registrations etc., gave Indians trap-line sketches of their trap-lines to take with them when trapping. I also visited the Massett Reserve several times each month, visiting the school and teachers residence, had two new heaters installed in both class rooms at the school, and attended to minor repairs, and cleaning up. All the wood (fuel) has been delivered and stacked at both the Massett and Skidegate schools and teachers residences, several matter were taken up with the Massett Councillors pertaining to the welfare of the village, the majority of the Indians are still away from the above Reserves, but are expected back about October 30th.\n\nX X X\n\nB.T.

Original on file 315-6-3\n\nThe school was visited and appears to be well run and well kept. School children and some of the adult population were examined for trachoma. The incidence is low. School teachers live in an old residence on the reserve. This building is in a poor state of repair, and should be repaired and modernized. Teachers living in isolated areas are giving up enough without giving up home comforts.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 157-11-5 (WT-1)\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 11th regarding repairs to the teachers residence at Skidegate reserve, I expect to be at Skidegate on May 2nd and will make the necessary survey at that time.\n\nA further report will then be submitted.\n\nJ.A. Findlay\nActing Indian Agent.\nQueen Charlotte Agency\n\nMassett, B.C.\nMay 10, 1947.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File: 157-2-5 (WT-1)\n\nI have your letter of April 12th with regard to janitor service at the Masset Indian Day School for acknowledgement. This building, although not new, is in fair condition and with minor repairs additional equipment and a third teacher (kindergarten) could become one of the finest day schools in the district. In the near future, after the School Inspector's visit, I shall submit several suggestions with regard to these matters for consideration by the Department.\n\nThe question at present is that of satisfactory janitor service. The man who had been engaged for this work had very poor vision and could not satisfactorily perform his duties. At present, due to fishing operations and the small remuneration paid for such work, it has been impossible to engage another man. The teachers have taken over the duties for the balance of the term.\n\nHowever, it is not, in my estimation, fair to expect Day School Teachers to be burdened with janitor work in addition to their teaching and supervising duties.\n\nIn a school of this type, janitor's duties should include lighting of fires each morning, sweeping, dusting, washing and oiling of floors when necessary, inspection and cleaning of outside toilets and general supervision of the upkeep of the building.\n\nIt is obvious that no person will assume these duties for the remuneration offered of $12.00 monthly, which sum works out, on the basis of an average of 21 teaching days per month, at fifty-seven cents per day.\nI would suggest, that since similar conditions exist at the S kidegate Indian Day School, where $10.00 monthly is paid, the entire janitor situation be revised with the object in mind of obtaining satisfactory janitor service for which a decent remuneration be paid.\n\nI would recommend that a man willing to assume the duties as mentioned be paid at minimum rate of $25.00 per month. No doubt if this were approved, suitable janitors could be obtained.\n\nThe matter of ventilation has been investigated and several of the windows have been loosened to allow them to be opened providing proper ventilation.\n\nAdvice and decision in the matter of janitor service will be appreciated.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\nFurther to my letter of May 2nd, 1947 with reference to the teachers' residence at Skidegate Reserve, I have recently returned from a patrol to that village and submit a report herewith.\n\nWhen visiting Skidegate six or seven years ago, I had occasion to be in the teachers' residence and was amazed at the poor condition of the home at that time. Seemingly very little has been done over the years to make it habitable or in any way comfortable during the cold weather.\n\nIn order to give you as clear as possible a word picture of the building, I am stating the following facts as I found them.\n\n1. Building is of frame construction, very old, with a fancy tower construction at one corner of the roof.\n2. The building is out of line.\n3. Roof: Minor repairs have been made from time to time, but it still leaks. The shingles are in poor condition and should all be replaced.\n4. Walls: Single wall only. Siding was nailed to studs and inside wall board nailed to studs. There is no subfloor lining in the walls either inside or out. Wallboard being on studs only is bulging which condition also exist with the ceiling.\n5. Floors: Living room has double flooring and is in good condition, except that the floor slopes to rear of house. Upstairs floor sags and when anyone walks in any room the house vibrates.\n6. Stairs: These are dangerous\u2014poorly constructed and one steps sideways from the top step to the upstairs landing.\n7. Interior Decorating: Very poor in general and should be renewed for entire house.\n8. Windows: All windows are loose. Frames are bad and in some cases collapsing. Wind drives in between frames and walls. Window glass is needed in some windows and putty in all.\n9. Doors: As a result of the house being out of line, the doors are off balance and will not close securely.\n\n10. Foundation: Posts in poor condition; ends of some rotten and giving away. Complete new foundation needed.\n\n11. Steps: Front and back steps and verandah will have to be replaced.\n\nThe house is extremely cold and without a doubt whatsoever is a fire-trap. Miss Mackie, one of the teachers, who has served faithfully at Skidegate for seven or eight years, definitely states that should she leave the service this year, it will be because of the living conditions. She cannot bear it any longer and I must say I sympathize with her in what she has had to suffer though\u2014extremely uncomfortable living quarters.\n\nMy survey of the building indicates the following necessary repairs:\n\n1. New foundations (posts and sills) well braced.\n2. Removal of all wallboard lining and partitions. Shiplap lining spoiled and replacement of wallboard in good condition and new sections where needed.\n3. Stairs removed.\n4. Window frames replaced where necessary\u2014all windows repaired.\n5. Front and back steps removed. (renewed)\n6. Doors hung properly.\n7. Roof renewed and it is suggested that the unsightly tower construction be removed.\n8. Complete new interior decoration.\n\nIt is obvious from the condition of the building that unforeseen repairs might be necessary once the above suggested repairs were started. Thus I would hesitate to make any estimate of costs without first getting the advice of some building contractor.\n\nImmediately adjacent to the present ten-acreage, is a partially complete new house being constructed by a Skidegate Indian. I was not able to contact the owner on my recent visit but the house is the type ideally suited as a teacher's residence. If the owner would consider selling and the Department buying, the amount of money necessary to effect the repairs to the old building would be more than sufficient to complete it. This matter will be investigated further on my next visit to Skidegate.\nIn any event no repairs could be effected until after the close of the present school term and even then, at the height of the fishing season, it will be difficult to obtain labor.\n\nI may say that the conditions under which the Skidegate teachers are living, sets no example to the natives in the matter of decent homes.\n\nThere is a building contractor at Massett who will, if requested, go with me to Skidegate and make a more complete survey of the necessary repairs and will submit an estimate of costs. At the same time he could place a value on the unfinished house referred to above. Expenses in this matter will incur only hotel charges while at Skidegate.\n\nIf the Department concurs in this suggestion, a vote to that effect will be appreciated.\n\nJ.A.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nJanitor Services - Skidegate Indian Day School\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Findlay's letter of May 10th attached, concerning janitor services.\n\nWe have no standard rate for janitor services because of conditions which vary so much throughout Canada in the various reserves where our schools are located.\n\nHowever, we would be willing to make payment at the rate of $12.00 per month, per room, at this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/RGD\nOttawa, May 28th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nSkidegate Indian Day School\n\nThe attached letters have been received from Mr. J.A. Windlay, Acting Indian Agent at Massett, B.C.\n\nIf you concur, it is suggested that his recommendation concerning the building contractor available at Massett and who is willing to submit an estimate of the costs concerning repairs required, should be adopted.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nJ. A. Findlay, Esq., Acting Indian Agent, Massett, B.C.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of May 12th to the Department in reply to Mr. Neary's letter of April 11th in connection with the teachers' residence at Skidegate. Contrary to the conclusion reached by you with respect to lack of maintenance since your visit to Skidegate six years ago, our records indicate that various expenditures have been made from time to time, particularly within the last two years, to make this building more comfortable, and there is nothing in our records to indicate that any request for funds for maintenance or improvement to the building was ever refused.\n\nThere is nothing in this office to show whether the building in question is the property of the Department or the United Church, although I am inclined to think that it belongs to the latter, in which case if conditions are as bad as your report indicates it is doubtful if the Department would be justified in making any large expenditures for repairs.\n\nIt is noted that there is a building contractor at Massett who will, if requested, go to Skidegate with you and make a complete survey of repairs necessary to the residence and at the same time place a valuation on the unfinished Indian house which you consider might be suitable for a teachers' residence.

They are both staying at the Mission house with the clergyman's family, and this does not seem to be a very happy arrangement, and at the same time it is too much to be expected of Mrs. Matthews for she has a family of three children. This arrangement of boarding at the Mission house has caused trouble in previous years. Hence the reason for my putting in an estimate for a teacher's residence, in the annual estimates for 1925-26. I feel however, that something will have to be done before a permanent residence can be built. I would like to suggest that the Department supply furniture so that the Nurse and Teacher can live together in a building which I can secure for them. This would be a temporary arrangement, but the furniture could be such that it can be used later in a new residence, if the Department desires to erect a new building. I would suggest the following items:\n\nCooking stove: $50.00\nHeating stove: $15.00\nTwo beds complete: $40.00\nLinoleum: $10.00\nThree chairs: $5.00\nCooking utensils: $10.00\nBedroom china: $5.00\nBureau: $20.00\n\nTotal: $161.00\n\nThe following will be required to improve the house conditions:\n\nTwo doors: $12.00\nWood shingles: $10.00\nToilet: $3.00\n6 cords firewood: $54.00\n\nTotal: $89.00\n\nIf the above meets with the Department's approval please wire, so that I can make arrangements as early as possible. The prices of household furniture given are merely estimates based on mail order prices, but the total given will probably cover all that is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-8, part 1)\nOttawa, December 29, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter, undated, in which you recommend that authority be granted you to purchase certain furnishings to fit up a residence for the teacher and nurse at Skidegate and also to supply fuel, etc. In this connection I beg to confirm the following night-lettergram to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter recent date you may prepare house for teacher and nurse at Skidegate, purchase furniture and fuel at an approximate total cost of $250.\"\n\nIn the purchase of the various articles of furniture and improving of the condition of the house, the expense should be kept down to the lowest possible point. After the furnishings have arrived and the house has been improved and the fuel obtained, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expense.\n\nIt is noted that the present arrangements for the boarding of the teacher and nurse are unsatisfactory and that you will be able to obtain a building which can be fitted up as a residence for them. I shall be pleased if you will furnish particulars regarding this house, stating its present condition and whether it will be necessary to pay rental for same or not. It is thought that if the house which you can obtain is satisfactory, after slight repairs, it might be possible to purchase same or arrange for its rental for a term of years and have any repairs required carried out in order to provide suitable future accommodation for the teacher and nurse at this point. Please report regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Residence for Nurse and Teacher, Skidegate.\n\nReplying to your letter 157-11-8, Dec 29th, I beg to report that the house secured for the teacher and nurse at Skidegate is one which originally belonged to a mining company who had a lease from the Ban near the village. In default of payment, the Council took possession of the house and moved it onto the Reserve. This was done several years ago. Miss Andrews lived in it for a time. It is a two-room frame building 22x14', and is not satisfactory as a permanent residence. The Council is putting on a lean-to, laying on the water and making it as comfortable as possible. The two doors mentioned in my estimates for repairs etc will not be charged to the Department, as the Council is standing all expenses regarding repairs. The Council will rent this house for ten dollars ($10.00) per month, and keep it in repair. After a suitable house is provided for the teacher and nurse, I would recommend that the Department still rent this house as an office and living quarters for the agent when at Skidegate. It is very unsatisfactory to have to do all business in private houses, etc. at present.\n\nRegarding a permanent residence for the teacher and nurse, the Skidegate Council ask that their Trust fund be used for this purpose, and that they rent the house to the Department for Twenty Dollars ($20.00) per month, to be paid to the Treasurer of the Council each month. The Council would be responsible for the upkeep and repairs. This meets with the approval of the whole village. If the Department agrees to this, I would appreciate having an early reply, so that the house could be built before all the villagers scatter for the fishing about May.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary, Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJ. Hallett\nOttawa, February 10, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to a residence for the nurse and teacher at Skidegate. I note that temporary provision has been made. I regret that I cannot agree to the proposal that the Skidegate Band use their Trust Funds for the erection of a permanent residence. I shall try to secure an appropriation of Parliament for this purpose.\n\nWhen the teacher and nurse have a permanent residence, you should then write to the Department regarding an office and living quarters for the agent when at Skidegate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

She is an elderly lady, and seems rather eccentric. She refuses to share a room with any other person. She is at present living in the house which Miss Macrae and Mrs. Gladstone occupied. There is only one bedroom and medicines are also kept in the same room. The clergyman, Mr. Matthews does not care to board the teacher. When the new Nurse arrives, there will be the question of accommodation. There is, however, a suitable house in the village which can be purchased for $1200.00. This house is in good condition. Only one bedroom is completed, but another one could be finished off, and other work such as boarding in around the foundation, and a room finished as a dispensary, for approximately $50.00 for labour and material. This would give six rooms, which would accommodate both the Teacher and Nurse. I asked Messrs Mitchell and Currie, who built the Massett School, for an estimate on a suitable house for two people, and they gave the figure, $800.00. The house mentioned above, would also be large enough to accommodate an extra teacher when required. It is owned by an Indian by the name of James McKay, and is in a good location, close to the School. I would recommend that this house be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa 29th October, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say that the last voucher the Department received for rent of the Nurse's and Teacher's house at Skidegate was No 242 for the month of April, and it amounted to $10.00. It was paid on the 5th June by cheque No 1155 drawn against in favour of the Skidegate Council, care James McKay, Secretary, Skidegate Mission. Rental was paid for February and March.

I have been informed that they have not received payment. It has occurred to me that the amounts may have been placed to the credit of the Trust Fund for the band.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th ultimo, with reference to a residence for the teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School and the nurse. I note you recommend the purchase of a residence that is already built, near the school, at a price of $1200, and that it could be fitted up for both workers and with a room as dispensary, for approximately $250. You might let me have a detailed description of this house, with a small picture or two, so that the Department can give the question more intelligent consideration. I presume it is on the Indian reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nRev. James Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett,\nGraham Island,\nB. C.\nMasset, B.C.\nOct. 19th, 1928\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of Oct. 1st, I beg to say that I am forwarding the blue prints of the house at Skidegate, mentioned in my previous letter. The house is on the Indian Reserve, and was built in 1914. It practically follows the plan in every detail, except that there is no partition on the first floor between the living room and bedroom as shown in the plan. Also there is only one bedroom finished upstairs. The house is in good condition, and is painted outside and inside. I do not think the Department would be making a mistake in buying this house. There is a fair sized lot fenced in around the building.\n\nIf the Department decides to purchase the house, I would appreciate a wire, so as to give the party time to move out, and have the alterations made, in case a new Nurse should arrive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOctober 31, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nFor some time the Department has been renting a residence for the teacher at the Skidegate Indian Day School. When a nurse was appointed for this reserve, she lived with the teacher; but the arrangement was unsatisfactory, as the house was too small. In January of this year, the Indian Band requested the Department to use their Trust Funds for the erection of a residence for the teacher and the nurse and to allow the Band $20 per month rental. This suggestion was not approved, and the Department informed Indian Agent Gillett that we would try to secure an appropriation for the purpose of erecting a suitable residence for these workers.\n\nMiss Wright, the present school teacher, is no longer young and is a little eccentric, according to Mr. Gillett. She, apparently, refuses to share a room with any other person. Mr. Gillett recommends that we purchase a residence erected in 1914 on the reserve, which is for sale. The price is $1200 and, with another $250, it can be finished, decorated and prepared as a residence for the two workers and as a dispensary. Blue prints of this building have been forwarded and Mr. Orr and myself wish to recommend that purchase be made. Funds can be found at the present time from this year's appropriation.\n\nRussell Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 31, 1928.\n\nRev.
