I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies, and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nBLOOD RESERVE.\n\nI visited the Roman Catholic Blood School, which is situated on this Reserve. There are eleven Sisters in this Institution and between sixty and seventy children. As usual, I found the children in excellent shape - clean, well dressed and tidy. This was not a dress parade. The children are well fed and good work is being done here. This work, however, is being carried on under great disadvantages. The present school building is certainly unfit to carry on work in. However, the time is not far distant I hope, when they will enjoy a new building; and when it is built and operated, it will be a credit to the Indian Department. The work they are now doing under great disadvantages would be discouraging to most people. As it is, I found everything in the old building immaculate. They want to do a little brightening up of the interior of the classroom and livingroom, and asked to be allowed to have a little paint to do this work. I gave the Agent the necessary authority to purchase a small quantity of paint. The vouchers for this will pass through this office.\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask. April 17, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nI am sending to you under separate cover plans for a cow barn and horse barn which I propose building at the new Anglican School on the Blood Reserve, and for the Roman Catholic School on the same Reserve, which school is to be built in a year from now.\n\nI wish particularly to draw your attention to the construction of these buildings. The cattle barn is on the usual concrete foundation with proper footings. The walls have two thicknesses of shiplap with paper, as well as drop siding. It has a concrete floor throughout. The stanchions are of iron as well as the divisions between the stalls; in fact the building throughout is modern construction. The horse barn is built almost in the same way, except that the stalls are plank, the driveway is concrete and the mangers are wooden.\n\nIn addition to these two buildings there is a warehouse required at the Agency. This building is to be 48 ft. long and 24 ft. wide, heavy construction.\n\nI have received an offer to build the whole three buildings for $5500. In other words, we are getting the three buildings for one-third what it cost to put up one stable at Edmonton, or one-half what it cost to build one stable at Blackfoot. There is nothing cheap about these buildings. The construction is heavy. I just want you to see the plans before I start doing the work. I would either let a contract; or send a man up to take charge, and buy the material locally. If I let a contract, it would be necessary to have Blue Prints taken. This could be done here, as well as getting out a list of material.\n\nI am sending these plans, so that you can see what we are getting for our money, and I would ask you to kindly return them after you have examined them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nHon. Chas. Stewart,\nSuperintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 12, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith further reference to your letter to the Minister of April 17th, I beg to say that I discussed this matter with the Minister yesterday. I think he intends to reply to you direct with reference to the barn which you proposed to erect on the site chosen for the Roman Catholic school on the Blood Reserve to the effect that we cannot find funds for it this year.\n\nYou may proceed with the erection of the two barns for the new Anglican school. I note from your letter that you have received an offer \"to build the whole three buildings for $5,500.00.\" I presume you meant the three barns. If so, the two barns which you were authorized to erect will cost less than this amount and we will therefore be able to find funds for their construction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI have the honor to make application to the Department of Indian Affairs for the construction of a new Roman Catholic Residential School on the Blood Indian Reserve, Province of Alberta.\n\nMany reasons well known to the officials of the Department of Education urge me to make this request which I hope you will be able to grant. These reasons are as follows:\n\n1st. Our actual residential school was condemned sixteen years ago on account of the proximity of the river which in the spring time overflows and floods the buildings making the place unhealthy for the staff and pupils.\n\n2nd. Since the buildings were condemned no repairs of any account were made with the result that they are in a state of delapidation.\n\n3rd. The actual school built originally for fifty pupils is filled to capacity, yet there, on the Reserve many others who cannot be admitted for lack of space and accommodation (there are about 150 children of school age who are members of our Church.)\n\n4th. A new residential school has been erected for the\nChurch of England and our Indians claim the same privilege for their children.\n\n5th.

C. School with Father Ruaux.\n\nAfter going through my Treaty books & taking into consideration the improved living conditions & the better prospects for raising the children born on the Reserve, I have come to the conclusion that the school should be built to accommodate not less than 160 children & 24 members of the staff.\n\nA school such as this is not being built for today but for the years to come & it will be much better to anticipate the requirements than to build for the present & find that after five years or so the building will have to be added to.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwhile other Reserves were decreasing by half. For the last three years, there is even a manifest increase. They have given themselves to farming and success has crowned their efforts. They have more money, comfortable houses and instead of living in camps each one has his own farm. Morality has benefited by this change. Scrofula has almost entirely disappeared, the children are healthy and full of life. The Reverend Father has in the Reserve 70 catholic families. Let us suppose that each family has only two children between seven and eighteen, this would bring that number to 140; some families have even more. The Reverend Father has christianed to date 37 children, which shows that the birth rate is on the increase and therefore the future must be taken into account in the construction of the school. It is therefore the idea of the Reverend Father that the Department should build for about 175 children. If this number cannot be accommodated immediately there is a certainty that before long this number will be reached.\n\nHoping that you will give your kind consideration to the accompanying letter and the above remarks, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\nMr. R.

RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\nStand-Off, Alberta.\nFebruary 7th 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the plans of the Duck Lake, Sask. Residential School, which were sent here some time ago to Rev. Fr. Ruaux, Principal of the above School, for his consideration and suggestions, I beg to inform you that these plans are being returned to you under separate cover.\n\nHaving been at Duck Lake not only while the plans were being prepared, but also at different times during the construction of the building, I thought I was in a position to discuss this matter here with Rev. Fr. Ruaux. Consequently I have drawn sketches of the different floors according to the same size building as at Duck Lake; these sketches are not exact as to scale, but might prove sufficient to convey to you the trend of our suggestions and help you to draw up the new ones. These are included among the returned plans.\n\nThe main change is the location of the accommodation for the boys to the wing intended for the girls, and vice versa. Now, Dear Sir, allow me to submit the following detailed suggestions which I have gathered particularly after my last visit to Duck Lake a month ago, when the new building was about completed, and thus I was acquainted with some changes made.\n\nBASEMENT.\n\nRecreation-room walls should be plastered, instead of being left with rough brick; a coat of cement up to five feet high. Wash-rooms; walls to be painted. Washing-throughs: in boys and girls rooms, having taps on both sides, are not wide enough for convenient washing; should be 26 inches wide instead of 18 inches. Washing-through: on floor for boys fast, is not deep enough; though standard size, could be made deeper to order at the factory, viz., 8 inches deep, and thus avoid spilling. Dining-room & Recreation-room Floors should be painted with two coats of regular cement floor paint, in order to keep same clean; if not painted, stains cannot be removed from from the rough cement floor. This should apply also to the floors in the washrooms and more particularly to the floors of Toilets in both Recreation rooms. Toilets in girls Recreation-room to be reduced a little in size. Toilets (closets) for girls should all have doors. Windows in Washrooms and Toilets should have non-transparent panes of glass. Wire-Screens, heavy, for inside windows in Boys Recreation-room. Doors, to Washrooms, Lavatories, Boiler-room, Engine-room, Bakery, Dairy, Stores, and Laundry need not be of the same finished model, with panels and mouldings, as in the other rooms; Doors, strong, to be put, as marked, in both Recreation-rooms, opening to passage leading to Dining-room. (On the Duck Lake plan these were left open; which is most unpleasant).\nCoat-room (Boys): Have placed therein a toilet and a basin for use only of the workingmen, such as farmer, engineer, laborers, and other male-help, so as to keep the Toilet-room on the Ground Floor in a cleaner condition for the other staff and Visitors.\n\nRadiators in Basement, more particularly in the Dining-room, Recreation-rooms, Kitchen, etc., might, to advantage, be placed higher up to the ceiling.\n\nKitchen: floor to be covered with Battleship (cork) linoleum.\n\nLaundry: Rainwater from the roofs to be collected into an outside Cistern, whence to be pumped into a storage steel-tank in the Laundry, which raised high enough will supply this soft water to the Laundry tubs.\n\nManhole: small size, to be placed in line with the other machinery. All this Laundry Machinery to be supplied with steam from a small upright steam-boiler.\n\nStove: for heating flat-irons (for ironing linen).\n\nVentilator: large size, in wall behind Laundry Machinery.\n\nLocation changed for Dairy, Bakery & Stores; the largest room being for Bakery.\n\nPorches: to both Recreation rooms, to be somewhat larger or more extended, as they are to be the main exit for the pupils to the play-grounds; and there should be a strong door at the bottom, on the floor of the Recreation-room.\n\nCoal-Bin: large enough to hold two cars of coal.\n\nWall: already dug, would be placed conveniently in corner of Boiler-room, as marked, and with pump and gasoline engine.\n\nGROUND FLOOR:\n\nCorridors: These are rather dark, as there are no transoms over the doors to let in some light; transoms would also afford some ventilation into the individual rooms. If transoms are not to be put in, I would suggest that the upper pannel of the different rooms, except the toilet-rooms and stores, be a non-transparent glass.\n\nPainting: I would suggest that the walls in the corridors and also along the stairs be painted 4 ft. high, as the white plastered walls are liable to be stained or soiled soon and cannot be washed or cleaned.\n\nFloors: tar-paper between the shiplap floor and the hard-wood.\n\nToilets: on this floor, as well as on all the other floors, should not be set on a wooden floor; there is bound to be some spilling of water; the floor will gradually become saturated and cannot be washed out; disagreeable and harmful odors will be the consequence. Would suggest some kind of a finished, polished cement floor, and this more particularly in both Dormitories for the pupils.\n\nBath-tubs: on this floor and on the 1st Floor should be 6ft or at least 5ft\u00b2, for the staff, instead of 5ft.\n\nPharmacy: No bath-tub required; only the wash-basin and sink.\n\nStairway: private, for staff to Dining-room, to have an electric light, both way.\n\nTelephone: One in the office of the Principal, and the other in the Matron's office.\nCHAPEL.\n\nBack part, as shown raised with one step the whole width of the Chapel. Platform for the altar should have two steps; to of upper platform to be 10ft wide and 7ft deep.\n\nWith regard to the Chapel, may I suggest a flat roof instead of a pitched, shingle roof; it would be more in uniformity with the style of the whole building and would give it a better appearance. Several people have made the remark to that effect. I presume that the cost would not be any greater. In that case, the walls would have to be higher, allowing fifteen feet inside, and thus give a standing capacity in the Balcony of about seven feet, and thereby afford more seating capacity for choir. Also in that case the windows should be somewhat larger in height. The metallic ceiling, if not plastered, might be drawn up in large panels.\n\nIf the span of the roof over the Chapel, in that case, would require steel posts, four of these could be placed in such a way as to allow a passage of five feet wide in the centre of the Chapel.\n\nFIRST FLOOR.\n\nOn this floor, you will notice that it is desired to have the disposition of the two wings reversed from the Boys to the Girls. Also the Balconies have been added.\n\nSECOND FLOOR.\n\nThe room for staff in the Centre Dormitories may be reduced in size. Another room for staff has been added in each of the Dormitories in the wings. These are absolutely needed as we are very particular about the supervision in all Dormitories.\n\nIn the large Dormitories (wings), the slop-sinks are to be placed close to the steel posts, and lumber wash-stands to be built as marked; the same is being done at the Dusk Lake School.\n\nI would suggest that building paper be placed on the ceiling between the shiplap and the metallic ceiling in all the Dormitories, for saving the heat in winter.\n\nWould you specify that all iron or steel posts be finished off smoothly; I remarked that the ones at Dusk Lake came from the Factory in a very rough state, and unfit for painting.\n\nDo you not think that it would be more economical to have the platform and steps in front of the main Entrance, built in cement and brick posts, instead of with lumber; it would last longer and look a great deal better.\n\nEXCAVATION. I would suggest that the excavation be not made too deep, at least around the main building, so that not only the entire windows appear well above the ground, but that the excavated earth be used to bank up around the building, make it appear higher and thus, with a slope, water will easily run away from the foundations.\nThe white line of stone trimming on top of the building at Duck Lake, was increased by two inches in width, and I believe four inches would be better still.\n\nWould you not approve of another white stone line between the Ground Floor and First Floor? And on top of the walls on the wings would you not also approve of a little design similar to the one in the centre, but smaller, and thereby improve the appearance.\n\nI would also call your attention to a CORNER STONE or suitable plate with inscription:\n\nIMMACULATE CONCEPTION RES.SCHOOL. - 1925.\n\nFurniture: With regards to furniture, such as wash-stands, cupboards, tables, benches, clothes-closets, shelves, etc., etc., may I ask you to use the sketches that were sent to your office by Mr. Taillon, Inspector of works at Duck Lake.\n\nYou will notice that we have figured out the plans for accommodating 175 children; there is not the slightest doubt that in the near future we will have no difficulty in securing that number according to all calculations, and the dispositions of our Indian population on the Blood Reserve, and we feel sure that the Department will approve of this.\n\nI hope, Dear Sir, that I have not presumed too much in making all the above suggestions; I have acted with the idea of improving the usefulness of the building as well as aiding the interests of the Department, and with no idea whatever of extravagance. I trust therefore that you will deign to take the suggestions into consideration, and if I dare to express a preference, it would be with regards to the roof and the size of the Chapel.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA. Naevius, a.m.l.\nProcurator for\nThe Oblate Fathers.\n\nP.S. I understand that you have all the informations with regards to the line for sewerage, and the location for the septic tank.\nR.C. Indian Residential School,\nStand Off, Alta.\nFebr. 11-1925.\n\nArchitect Orr,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince writing to you the other day concerning the plans for the new school for the above institution here, I had occasion to visit the St Paul's new school nearby, and I take the liberty of writing you again on this matter.\n\nI noticed in the St Paul's school that the upper panel of the doors in the corridors had been replaced by Murrine Glass, which I have also suggested as an improvement on the Duck Lake plan; also that the walls in the corridors and stairways had been covered, 4 feet high, with Bur'ap, which is better than paint on the walls.\n\nIn the sketches submitted, I had placed the well in the corner of the Boiler-room. I believe now it would be better in the corner of the Lighting-room; if this room is too small, it could be made larger by removing the wall of the Laundry.- May we ask you for the same kind of pump as is installed at St Paul's School, which is giving great satisfaction.\n\nAs a consequence of changing the place of the well, the small upright steam-boiler could then be placed in the corner of the Boiler-room, which we had marked out for the well.\n\nI have been informed that the water in the well dug for the new school, contains a great deal of soda. Therefore I do hope that you will provide for the outside cement rain-water Cistern, the same as at Duck Lake, for the sake of the Boilers, Laundry, etc.- At Duck Lake, a steam-pipe has been run into this outside cistern, in case of frost.\n\nI beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

This arrangement is very suitable for Farm or Estate work, no permanent foundation being necessary.\n\nTANGYES LIMITED,\nCORNWALL WORKS, BIRMINGHAM.\nTangye \"V\" Type\nVertical Oil and Petrol Engines.\n\nTANGYE \"V\" Type Oil and Petrol Engines work on the well-known \"Four-to-one\" cycle; they are made from entirely new designs and patterns, and embody the best and latest features of this class of Engine. Special attention has been given to simplicity in the design of the working parts, so that the Engines may be safely entrusted to men unskilled in the use of machinery\u2014gardeners, farm labourers, etc.\u2014if ordinary care be exercised. The Engines are reliable and economical under full load or varying loads, being controlled by highly sensitive governors.\n\nThese Engines possess the following special features:\n\n- **Sensitive Governor**, on the \"Throttle\" system, controlling the speed of Engine, and the consumption of fuel.\n- **Magneto-Electric Ignition**, with Variable Timing Device.\n- No heating Lamp.\n- Steel Crankshaft running in ring-oiled bearings.\n- Splash Lubrication for internal working parts.\n- Oil groove around the Engine frame.\n- Machine-cut Gear Wheels, and Machined Cams.\n- Easily accessible for cleaning.\n- Highest efficiency and economy.\n\n**STARTING.** No heating lamp whatever is required for starting, or during the running of either the Oil or the Petrol Engine. The Oil Engine is started from cold by using a small quantity of petrol or benzoline, after which the fuel supply is changed over to paraffin, petroleum, or kerosene, etc.\n\n**FULL PARTICULARS AND PRICES ON APPLICATION.**\n\nREPRESENTATIVES\nTHE RENNIE ENGINEERING COMPANY\nWINNIPEG MANITOBA\nGENERAL SPECIFICATION (No. 2v)\nof Tangye \"V\" Type Vertical Oil Engine\nWITH \"THROTTLE\" GOVERNING.\n\nDESIGN. The Engine is of the most recent construction, with all our latest improvements introduced to internal-combustion Engines of this class. The general design gives great strength and rigidity, good general appearance, and extreme simplicity of working parts.\n\nENGINE FRAME. The Engine Frame is strong, and well adapted for hard work, and an oil groove is formed all round the lower portion. It is dust-proof, and is fitted with inspection doors, to enable the working parts to be easily examined.\n\nCYLINDER. The Cylinder Jacket, Liner, Combustion Chamber, and Exhaust Valve Box are cast in one piece, avoiding troublesome face joints and leaky water passages. The construction of the cylinder and the arrangement of the valves are such as to obtain the highest efficiency and economy, and to render them easily accessible. Ample space is provided for the free circulation of the cooling water around the walls and valve seats most exposed to the temperature of the explosions. The open end of the cylinder is carefully fitted into the bed and held in position by powerful bolts.\n\nMAGNETO-ELECTRIC IGNITION. The ignition of the charges is effected by a High-Tension Magneto-Electric apparatus, with Variable Timing Device.\n\nA very desirable feature in any Magneto-Electric Ignition Gear is a means for altering the position of the ignition point in the crank path while the Engine is running; such an arrangement is really requisite, as it enables the Engine to be started satisfactorily at starting, at \"light\" as well as at other loads, with a resultant economy in fuel consumption. In the case of many Engines on the market, the ignition gear supplied is not capable of being altered while the Engine is running.\n\nFUEL SUPPLY TANK. A galvanized-iron tank of ample capacity is provided for the fuel supply, with connections to the inlet valve on the Engine, and a small vessel for holding a supply of petrol to enable Engine to be started from cold.\n\nGOVERNOR. With the \"Throttle\" system of governing, a Spring-loaded Revolving Governor is provided, by means of which the fuel inlet valve is throttled so as to control the amount of the charge, with the result that there is a less impulse in the cylinder with the lighter loads than with the heavier ones.\n\nThe Governor is specially sensitive, and gives the fullest economy and steadiness under all conditions of working; the Engine only consuming fuel in proportion to the work being done, thereby avoiding waste.\n\nCRANKSHAFT. The Crankshaft is of selected mild steel, and runs in long adjustable white-metal bearings, with \"ring\" oilers.\n\nCONNECTING ROD. The Connecting Rod is of stamped mild steel, and has adjustable bearings at the large end.\nGeneral Specification\u2014(continued)\n\nCAM-SHAFT. The Cam-shaft is of steel, fitted with machined cams, and driven by machine-cut gear wheels.\n\nFLYWHEELS. The Engine is fitted with two Flywheels, machined on face and edges; a turned cast-iron driving pulley is also supplied with the Engines for General Purposes.\n\nLUBRICATION. The main bearings are provided with continuous \"ring\" oilers, running in an oil bath. The connecting rod, piston and cylinder liner are lubricated by \"splash\" lubrication, which maintains a surplus of oil over all the working parts, so that they are thoroughly and efficiently lubricated. This system of lubrication considerably reduces wear and tear, and requires less attention than sight-fed oil cups.\n\nACCESSORIES. With each Engine is provided:\n- A cast-iron exhaust chamber.\n- Main oil-supply tank.\n- Cleaning tools.\n- A set of spanners.\n- Foundation plan, with full instructions as to fixing and working.\n\nSPARES. The following Spare Parts are also provided:\n- One piston ring.\n- One spring of each size used on the Engine.\n\nTESTING. Each Engine is carefully tested before leaving the Works, both at \"no load\" and at the power specified in the Catalogue, to ensure satisfactory working and correct adjustment of all the parts. Any purchaser desiring to satisfy himself as to the power of his Engine must notify beforehand his intention of being present (or of sending someone on his behalf to be present) at this test; or a certificate of test may be had on application.\n\nMATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP. All materials used in the manufacture of our Oil Engines are of best quality only, and first-class workmanship is employed in their construction, erection and testing.\n\nPAINTING. The Engine is carefully painted in a first-class manner with enamel paint.\n\nGUARANTEE. In lieu of any warranty implied by law, TANGYES LIMITED expressly undertake to repair or supply new any part of the Engine which, in consequence of either faulty material or workmanship, may break show undue wear, or prove to be defective, within a period of twelve months (i.e., one year of ordinary working days of ten to twelve hours) from the date of invoice of the Engine, provided that such failure be not due to improper usage or neglect; that Tangye's Gas Engine Oil (which is specially prepared for use in their Engines) is only used for the lubrication of the cylinder; and that, if required, the defective part is forwarded without delay to TANGYES LIMITED, BIRMINGHAM, for examination. But the installation is supplied by TANGYES LIMITED on the distinct understanding that they shall not be held liable for losses of any kind or for consequential damages arising from stoppages that may be caused by such defect.\n\nRepairs or renewal parts supplied under this guarantee will be delivered free on rails to the customer's nearest Railway Station in Great Britain (Mainland), or F.O.B. Irish Port; while to the benefit of Colonial and Foreign customers such parts will be delivered F.O.B. English Port.\n\nTANGYES LIMITED,\nCORNWALL WORKS, BIRMINGHAM.\nTHE RENNIE ENGINEERING COMPANY\nENGINEERS AND CONTRACTORS\n\nWINNIPEG CANADA APRIL 30th, 1925\n\nF. H.

We trust this telegram reached you without delay. We regret that a mistake had been made, it being addressed to Victor G. Scott. This was not noticed until this morning.\n\nUp to time of writing we have had no reply to said night letter, and while we feel sure that you will approve of our suggestion, yet to avoid any exception that might be taken by any parties to our bid being made without the regular deposit, we are attaching our cheque for $9500.00, which, added to the $4,000.00 submitted with Sturgeon Landing bid, will make a total deposit for the Blood School of $13,500.00.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 14th advising us that you are transferring our deposit cheque on Sturgeon Landing to apply on Blood School.\n\nWith Progress Certificate No.8 for $4,462.90 and No.9 for $9,373.50 still outstanding on the Kamloops school, we have outstanding to our credit and unpaid the sum of $13,856.40. On account of making full deposit on the Blood school, as provided for in conditions of tender, we cannot arrange to be without payment on Kamloops for any length of time, and if we are awarded\u2014as we hope we may be\u2014the Blood school contract, will you kindly allow us to make it a condition that either payment on Kamloops is promptly made us, or that the tender deposit on the Blood school be returned to us, and the funds due us and unpaid on Kamloops, (or sufficient of them to make a ten percent deposit on our bid) be held as our final deposit.\n\nBy the above we mean that while we have met formal demand for contract deposit, we submit that the Department, having an equal amount to our credit under a contract unpaid, will be prepared to let this credit be our deposit. We trust this will meet with your approval.\n\nIf any message from you in reply to our nightletter or the 14th reaches us before Monday next, we will try to have it answered by wire to you before tenders are opened. We are taking most exceptional precautions and care to try and secure this work, and it is possible we may receive some news which may move us to revise our bid. If this is the case will you kindly accept any telegraph figures from us which reach you before the opening of tenders, to take the place of the figures named on the form of tender.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBungam Co.

This school cannot possibly be erected according to specifications for $111,000.00, and I consider it not in the interests of the Department to accept this tender. The next highest tender, namely, $117,277.00 is entirely regular, and is offered by a firm that in the past has done very excellent work under contract for this Department.

Brown, Winnipeg | Winnipeg | $111,000.00 |\n\nThe lowest of the above mentioned tenders, namely\u2014that of S. Brown, of Winnipeg, was not on the prescribed tender form and did not conform with the requirements contained therein. According to the estimate made by the Department of Indian Affairs, the cost of this building would be approximately $150,000, and it is considered that it could not be erected according to plans and specifications for less than the amount of the second lowest tender.\n\nIn these circumstances the undersigned has the honour to recommend, pursuant to sub-section 2 of section 36 of the Public Works Act, that the second lowest tender, namely\u2014that of Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, Regina, for $117,877.00, which is regular in every respect be accepted and the contract awarded accordingly.

When the air pump is needed the air pump runs; when the water pump is needed the water pump runs. No dead load. No extra power used. No extra wear on parts that are not working.\n\nEither pump can be shut down without interfering with the operation of the other. Particularly desirable at night when the condensation pump only is needed.\n\nChanges can be made to larger sizes at minimum cost, where there is a growing demand on the heating system.\n\nOn systems that now have a condensation pump, all that need be added is a Trane Air Line Vacuum Pump. In these cases, added to increased efficiency, there is also low first cost.\n\nThe Two-Motor Trane Return Line Special Vacuum Pump is described and illustrated in detail in Trane Bulletin 4. This bulletin also describes the complete line of Trane Duplex Pumps, Air Line Pumps, Single Motor Return Line Pumps, etc.\n\nFor condensation, booster, circulating and similar pumps, see Trane Bulletin 2.\n\nTHE TRANE COMPANY\n21-23 River Street\nTORONTO, CANADA\nTHE TRANE COMPANY\n\nTRANE\n\nPHONE MAIN 261\n\n31-23 RIVER STREET\n\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nMay 11th, 1925.\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Cole\n\nGEO/JK\nNovember 26th 1920\n\nRight Rev. J.T. McNally,\nBishop of Calgary\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have had a letter from the man who owns a section of land seven miles Southwest of Claresholm, and he is prepared to make a very good deal if he can sell this winter. As stated in my previous letter he owns 640 acres of land nearly all of which is tillable. There are 560 acres broken. There is a running stream on the land which could be used for irrigation. He has a good five roomed house, and a barn sixty feet long, which has stabling accommodation for 22 horses, together with loft which holds 60 tons of hay. In addition he has a cattle shed 200 ft long, chicken house, granary and some other small buildings.\n\nOver 500 acres of this place are fenced with woven wire, which is very expensive if bought now, and which makes the very best kind of fence, far better than barbed\nMostly all the improvements on this place would be suitable for the purpose which Mr. Graham has in view. He has also 50 tons of hay, 15 head of horses, 6 head of cattle, binder, seeder, plows, harrows, two mowers, rake, soil packer, hay stacker, two hay sweeps, and in fact everything needed for the proper cultivation of the place. My opinion is that if he were sure of an all cash deal, that he would sell everything he has got on the place, as above mentioned for $60.00 per acre.\n\nPerhaps you would be good enough to convey this information to Mr. Graham, and in the meantime I intend running out and making examination of the place next Monday, and will report to you on my return the exact details as I find them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLOUGHEED & TAYLOR LIMITED\n\nSupt. of Land Dept.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, February 8, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Right Reverend Bishop McNally, Indian Commissioner Graham, and myself had a conference in this matter this morning, and it was decided that Mr. Graham in company with His Lordship should visit this property some time in the month of March, and Mr. Graham would make a report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. S. G. I. A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nFebruary 15, 1921.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nHon. Sir James Lougheed.\n\nI beg to inclose herewith a letter from Mr. Jas. Ryan, Superintendent of Land Department, of Messrs. Lougheed & Taylor, Limited, Calgary, to the Rt. Rev. Bishop McNally, with reference to a section of land 7 miles southwest of Claresholm, which a client of theirs desires to dispose of to this department. In this connection, I would say that in December 1919, when the Rt. Rev. Bishop McNally was in Ottawa, we had a conversation with the then Superintendent General, with regard to the question of Indian education in Southern Alberta for the Blood and Peigan Indians. It was agreed that we should acquire a property in Southern Alberta, upon which an industrial school would be built for the use of the Blood and Peigan Indians, this to take the place of the present High River industrial school. This school building has fallen into a dilapidated condition, and is not worth repairing. The present situation is inconvenient, and not suitable for an effective institution of that kind.\n\nBishop McNally was here a few days ago, and, while in my office, gave me the inclosed letter. I think the Indian Commissioner should look over the property mentioned as soon as he can properly inspect it, and I have requested him to do so. When he reports, I shall place the matter before you.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. D. C. SCOTT -\n\nThe Minister wishes you to discuss with him the attached memorandum if possible before Mr. Graham returns to the West.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\nFebruary 21, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nWith reference to the inclosed letter from Mr. H.A. MacKie, M.P., asking for information for Rev. Father Nassens, Principal of the High River school, I beg to report that I have endeavoured to deal with this matter altogether through the hands of the Rt. Rev. Bishop McNally of Calgary, who has control of the schools in his diocese.\n\nI have formed the opinion that probably the religious order that runs the school would like to get independent action, and my impression is somewhat confirmed by this letter of Mr. MacKie's. Our policy is of course contingent upon our receiving grants from Parliament, and as yet the proposed arrangement is in embryo. Our present idea is to close the High River school, to sell the property, repurchase another, and later on erect a new building. You directed Mr. Graham this morning to examine land in the Claresholm district, but that is as far as the matter has gone.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nExcerpt:\n\nPersonal.\n\nCanadian National Railways.\nHotel System.\n\nThe Fort Garry,\nWinnipeg, Man., May 15, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have been down here for three days and have been very busy attending to various matters. I received your telegram regarding the Clarasholm property and I immediately wired Bishop McNally requesting him to notify Ryan of the Department's intention and last night received the following telegram from the Bishop:\n\n\"Ryan striving to secure best possible terms under new conditions probably under five dollars per acre extra.\"\n\nI hope that this does not mean that we will have to pay $4,000 dollars extra for this property. I should have thought that by paying cash outright, the owner would have been only too glad to accept the offer.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. M. Graham.\nPrivate.\n\nJune 16, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop McNally,\n\nI have just received a note from the Justice Department to say that the owner of the property at Claresholm now refuses to sell at the \"first price\" and requires $50.00 an acre for his property. I am communicating with Mr. Graham. I think we can hardly afford to meet his advance in price.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.Rev.J.T.McNally, D.D.,\nBishop of Calgary,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nExcerpt:\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, July 19, 1921.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nHon. Sir James Lougheed.\n\nRegarding the installation of baths and sanitary arrangements at the Roman Catholic school on the Blood reserve, concerning which His Lordship Bishop McNally spoke to the Minister, this is a very old building, almost beyond all usefulness for the purpose of a boarding school. Just at the present time, we are concluding the purchase of a lot near Claresholm, on which it is proposed to erect a school, to be used jointly for the Catholic children of the Blood and Peigan reserves. It is probable that, if funds are available, we will go ahead with this work next year, and, in view of this, it is not considered advisable to spend very much on the old school building, either by way of repairs or equipment. We will, however, make inquiries, and see if some bath tubs could be installed, which might be used when equipping the new school. We have not the data before us to enable us to decide that here.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 27, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Hinds,\n\nWith reference to the attached communication from Messrs. Major & Stacey-Judd, architects and engineers, Calgary and Edmonton, I would state that we have purchased a property for industrial school purposes near Claresholm, Alberta, but I am not in a position to state now at what time the erection of a building will be undertaken. We must first obtain an appropriation from Parliament to cover the cost.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMessrs. Major & Stacey-Judd asked to be given opportunity to tender\nCanadian Pacific Hotels\n\n28 June 1913\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI am pleased to arrange that something be done immediately regarding the Catholic School in the School reserve. My friend Bishop Murray is being placed in an awkward position so this Anglican school is being pushed forward. You ought to understand his effect on the minds of the Indians.\n\nI am in Ottawa for afternoon but will not see you as I have to do this and I must be back to do what I have to do. Bishop Murray is also very busy and I must keep him there.\n\nI am sure you know the understanding and hence this personal and unofficial undertaking here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I am very pleased in afternoon.\nMay 18, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the tenders received for the erection of the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nWe had estimated this building to cost about $130,000.00, and I am constrained not to recommend the lowest tender, which is not in the proper form. This school cannot possibly be erected according to specifications for $111,000.00, and I consider it not in the interests of the Department to accept this tender. The next highest tender, namely, $117,277.00 is entirely regular, and is offered by a firm that in the past has done very excellent work under contract for this Department. I think it, therefore, in the best interests of the project to recommend the acceptance of the Smith Bros. and Wilson tender.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 5, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, and in reply to say that the contents of the same have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

You will be interested to see on the opposite page that the inside of the body is free from rust and corrosion and that there is no accumulation of solid particles. The floor of the body is perfectly smooth; the bellows does not obstruct the inlet valve right at the trap body and the bellows are never clogged.\n\nThe bellows screws up tight in the body and has a one-piece plunger. And by making the body of brass instead of iron, no removable seat is necessary and absolute uniformity is secured. The bellows in Trane traps are, therefore, interchangeable. See Professor Wolf's tests on page 6.\n\nA study of curves below shows exactly what conditions exist in and around the bellows of a Trane trap under any operating conditions of the heating system. They show that the curve of the bellows in the traps follows the steam curve closely, except that it limits it by the fixed constant of 6.7 pounds. That is, the reserve power is always the same. It is balanced. It does not vary throughout the entire operating range. No matter what the pressure difference between the steam and the water at the point of closing is in proportion to it so that the difference is very slight, START, or BABY, or even very high low vacuums do not harm them. That is why they stand the various tests described on the next page.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBellows\nNumber of corrugations\u201414.\nComposition\u2014special formula brass.\nTemperature\u2014250\u00b0 F.\nDiameter\u20141/8\".\nNet length\u20141/4\".\nPermissible expansion of bellows\u20141/8\".\nPermissible compression of plunger tip\u20146.7 lbs. per square in. at the point of closing.\nPermissible expansion of plunger tip\u20146.7 lbs. per square in.\nReserve power\u20146.7 pounds per sq. in.\nPressure difference between inside and outside of bellows at the point of closing\u20146.7 lbs. constant throughout entire operating range.\nRecommended maximum operating range\u20141/2\" vacuum, 25 lbs. pressure.\nLife of bellows\u2014indeterminate.

Professor Wolf was in charge of the Chicago chapter of the National Association of Building Owners and the present tests were made with the same equipment that was used on the original tests and all conditions were paralleled.\n\nQuoting from Prof. Wolf's official report, note the method used for selecting the traps to be tested:\n\n\"The tests were made by connecting the traps to a radiator and subjecting them to various pressures and temperatures. The tests were made under conditions which would be encountered in actual use.\"\n\nThe first test was made for four hours; the second and third tests were for three hours. Pressure and vacuum were varied, respectively, as follows, 9\", 10\", 6\" and 0\" Hg.\n\nThroughout the tests the radiator delivered perfectly normal heat without any loss whatever.\n\nThe trap was at all times steam tight. It functioned perfectly throughout the tests.\n\nAt the end of his interesting report, Prof. Wolf said:\n\n\"We have here an example of the possibility of the Bellows Trap being used in the future. We believe that the Bellows Trap will prove to be the greatest advance in the field of radiator traps since the development of the automatic radiator valve.\"\n\nBlueprints of the exact test data, along with a copy of Prof. Wolf's report, will be gladly furnished to anyone upon request. Besides serving as a valuable reference book, these tests serve also as an excellent illustration of the Trane Bellows Radiator Trap.\n\n**The Mechanical Breakdown Tests \u2014 Permanence**\n\nTo answer questions that sometimes arise regarding the number of times a bellows will open and close before breaking we have at various times subjected our traps to tests with a machine that opens and closes them mechanically. In addition to these tests, over (20,000,000) complete operations have been made. We have found that the traps do not show signs of weakening, to say nothing of reaching the point where they would break. To keep the bellows would be required to give up a heating system that is reliable, and that's why the bellows are referred to as \"permanent.\" The number of operations the bellows will stand is not particularly remarkable, but the fact that the elastic limit of the Trane metal permits a movement of over 3000 times without failure between the full opening and closing.\n\n**The Trane Blow Tests \u2014 Sensitiveness**\n\nA cut-open Trane bellows trap is connected to an air line and subjected to varying pressures. After the trap has been allowed to warm up, the blow is applied, causing the bellows to expand and close the outlet. Now slowly emptying lightly on the blow, the trap is just enough to keep the bellows in actual contact with the pipe. The blow instantly causes the bellows to fully open the outlet. Stop blowing and the trap again closes.\n\nAll standard Trane radiator traps respond to this simple test for sensitiveness.\n\n**The University Tests \u2014 Durability**\n\nIn 1924 a large number of standard Trane traps were tested at the request and under the supervision of Ford Motor Co. engineers. The traps were subjected to a pressure of 75 pounds, and then the temperature was raised until the water vaporized. This was repeated at a steam pressure of 75 pounds. After that the traps were subjected to a vacuum of 25 inches. They were found to be functioning perfectly, showing no difference in leakage or in operating in any kind.\n\n**The One-Inch Trane Trap**\n\nAll Trane one-inch traps are furnished with special indicator plates, as shown in the accompanying diagram. The indicator plate is made of polished nickel trimmings. The tops are forged, no castings being used, parts giving the strength or close-fitting precision for this product.\n\nInternally there is no brome except the bellows, which is constructed of the special alloy needed for this purpose and are guaranteed no punchings used.\n\nThe Indicator plate on the cover is etched brass lettering in a luxurious black finish in the cover or with the polished nickel or similar plate offering an extremely neat contrast with the polished nickel that surrounds it.\n\nThe body is soldered, assuring full capacity through the valve. There is nothing to restrict the outlet; no possible seats or similar devices. The valve contains a non-clogging seat and the modification shown in the figure, permitting graduated action. There are no close clearances between the bellows and the seat, eliminating any chance for wear, and showing the value of liberal design.\n\nThe handle of the standard Trane Packless Radiator Valve is made of genuine bakelite, practically indestructible, finished in glossy black. It is tilted in a manner that makes it unusually easy to grasp, whether used with the lever type, solid arrangement, with extension handles, or with wood wheel when desired.\n\nThe stem and handle are uniform throughout the entire trap and each section is independently screwed to the valve body. Uniformly opened or closed due to anyone brushing against it. This uniform pressure is one of the exclusive patented features of the Trane Packless Radiator Valve.\n\nThese valves absolutely cannot stick and are not affected by high pressures. When used in connection with Trane Bellows Radiator Traps and Trane Vacuum Pumps for a Vacuum Heating Sys-\nTrane Quick and Float Vent Valves\n\nTRANE Vent Valves are extensively used for ventilating traps, pipe coils, indirect radiators, vento heaters, blast coils, pump tanks, discharge lines, and, in fact, wherever condensate and positive venting valves of large capacity are required.\n\nThe Quick and Float Vent Valves are designed with full \"T\" venting area to assure the quick and easy escape of air from the system. Their thermostatic member is the Trane bellows, similar to the bellows used in Trane radiator traps. Consequently, vent results on the bellows are far superior to those given by the traps, and equally applicable to the vent valve. The vent valves have all the same features of long life, great operating power, balanced pressure, wide opening range, etc. The venting area that is three to four times larger than that of the vent coil capacity is more than ample for all practical purposes, and one Trane vent frequently serves where two or more would ordinarily be required.\n\nAll Trane vent valves are equipped with a simple and highly efficient vacuum check. This is a light aluminum disc resting on a knife seat just above the venting port. It offers practically no resistance to the escape of air and at the same time prevents air from passing back into the system. This check is easily accessible for inspection by removing the knurled top cap.\n\nThe difference between these two valves is that the Quick Vent is designed for service where steam only is encountered. It closes against steam and vents air. The Float Vent, however, is designed to operate against either steam or water, or both, and vent air. When water is used, use a Float Vent.\n\nThe Quick Vent Valve weighs 2 pounds net; it is 2\u00be\" in diameter and 4\u00bd\" high overall.\n\nThe Float Vent Valve weighs 1\u00be pounds net; it is 4\u00bd\" in diameter and 7\u00bc\" high overall.\n\nBoth styles are made with rough body, polished all over, with highly polished trimmings.\n\nThe Float Vent is all tapped for \u00be\" connection outside and can be shipped tapped for \u00bc\" connection inside if desired.\n\nTrane vent valves are of the best workmanship and material throughout. They are carefully adjusted and tested at the factory and are fully guaranteed to do both construction and operation. Sizes, capacities, etc., have been given in details, as indicated by their weights and dimensions given above, and are standard equipment on all heating systems carrying the name of Trane.\nTrane Direct Return Traps\n\nBROKEN BOILERS AND TRANE DIRECT RETURN TRAPS ARE NEVER FOUND ON THE SAME JOB\n\nTHE Trane Direct Return Trap is primarily a safety device. Its function is to return water to the boiler under conditions that prevent condensation. The trap was placed on the market seven years ago as standard equipment in all Trane Radiator Trap Vapor Heating Systems. See page 12. The Trane trap sealing system is safe without one.\n\nPractically all devices on the market offered for this kind of service are complicated and expensive, so much so that they cannot be used on ordinary closed heating systems. They either have tilting tanks with a number of stuffing boxes, screws, etc., or a float on the inside of the tank operating through a stuffing box mechanism consisting of two or more valves on the outside of the tank.\n\nThe Trane Direct Return Trap does away with these complications. The mechanism is positive and dependable in operation. It is simple, compact, and efficient in construction, with no stuffing box, tilting tank, or other parts protruding on the outside of the tank, and is offered at a price that makes it possible to use a Trane Direct Return Trap on almost any installation without materially increasing the cost of the job and at the same time without making it complex or requiring the attention of a skilled mechanic.\n\nHow the Trane Direct Return Trap Operates\n\nOn any radiator trap heating system where the traps function properly and do not leak steam, it is easy to have two pressures on the supply line. One pressure will be on the supply side and the other will be on the return side. Without a Direct Return Trap this difference in pressure would not be enough to prevent the return of condensation by gravity and the loss of heat.\n\nConsider figure 1 in the outline drawing on the next page, in conjunction with the sectional view of the Direct Return Trap shown here. In this diagram there is indicated so that if there is steam generated in excess of requirements, steam will fill the boiler supply line and radiators up to the point A. This A represents the radiator traps. Most good radiator traps pass only air, water, and gases, it is easy to secure higher pressure in the boiler than in the traps.\n\nNotice in the figures that air is vented through a Float Vent Valve, C, and during the high pressure periods water of condensation will flow through the check valve, No. 3, into the Direct Return Trap, D. This Direct Return Trap is at the same pressure as the return line, 4, because it is connected through the vent opening in the top of the boiler into the return line. When the water will rise up into the body of the Direct Return Trap, lifting the float until it reaches the top, stopping the vent connection, stops the supply, E, and closes the vent connection. There will then be the same pressure in the Direct Return Trap as in the boiler. When the water has lowered, due to gravity, since the Direct Return Trap is 5 inches above the water line of the boiler back into the boiler through its second check valve. When the water has lowered to the bottom of the Direct Return Trap, the float slides down the guide rod, opening the vent mechanism to operate, closing the check valve and opening the vent connection so that the water in the returns will again flow into the Direct Return Trap, and the operation will again be repeated.\n\nThe Trane Direct Return Trap therefore makes Trane Vapor Heating Systems absolutely safe by providing a positive method of putting water back into the boiler regardless of how carelessly the plant is handled. The Direct Return Trap operates only when the pressure in the boiler is higher than needed to keep water from over a heating plant seeing that water is always returned to the boiler under any and all operating conditions.\n\nCapacities\n\nRated capacity of the No. 3 Direct Return Trap is 2000 sq. ft. of radiation at the No. 3 Trap, 4000 sq. ft. These capacities are based on a water level of 1 inch above the water line of the boiler. With the Trane Direct Return Trap, the speed at which the water rises into the boiler is dependent entirely upon gravity, so that the water level will rise to the water line. The ratings of Trane Direct Return traps when their water levels are below the water line are as follows:\n\n| Type | Height Above Water Line | Capacity |\n|------|-------------------------|----------|\n| No. 2 | 2\"                      | 1000     |\n| No. 3 | 2\"                      | 1000     |\n| No. 3 | 3\"                      | 1000     |\n| No. 3 | 4\"                      | 1000     |\n| No. 3 | 5\"                      | 1000     |\n\nTrane Direct Return Traps are especially designed for low pressure heating systems and are available for pressures up to 20 lbs. They are made with cast iron bodies and brass floats and vent connections are provided for range glass connections, which can be furnished if desired.\n\nMEASUREMENTS OF DIRECT RETURN TRAPS\n\nDiagram showing measurements of Direct Return Traps.\nTrane Heating Specialties\n\nTrane Damper Regulator\n\nThe damper regulator has been a much neglected part of modern vapor heating systems. In the past several years, heating systems that were designed before vapor was developed did not need dampers. They operated at constant pressure instead of constant temperature. Dampers were given \"free\" with the system, but they were considered a part of the system's accessories, and therefore there was no incentive on the part of the manufacturer to develop regulators as would have been done had the dampers been sold on a competitive basis.\n\nSince an ordinary steam damper regulator does not work on any vapor system, The Trane Company developed the Sensi-Stat Steam Regulator. This device has proven so effective that hardly no changes have been made in its design.\n\nThe body of the regulator is made of cast iron, finished with black paint. The diaphragm is made of rubber. The life of the diaphragm is practically unlimited because it is constantly wetted so that the rubber is constantly in water\u2014a preservative. This is not fat water; no water or steam from the boiler can come into contact with the diaphragm, pressure being transmitted indirectly.\n\nOperation of the regulator is simplified to the barest minimum. The arm is adjusted (by weight), as illustrated, that is adjusted to meet different requirements, and then locked in adjustment, and the bar may be calibrated to show the exact location for the arm to keep the heating system operating at any predetermined pressure.\n\nDue to the arrangement of forces the regulator has an 8 to 1 ratio, the end of the arm moving eight times as far as the plunger that actuates it. This gives the operator ample movement to open and close dampers and check dampers.\n\nRegulators are available in two sizes, the No. 1 Sensi-Stat, with a diaphragm 10 inches in diameter; and the No. 2 Sensi-Stat, effective, with a diaphragm 13 inches in diameter. Because of these large diaphragms an ounce change of boiler pressure will move the control rod and is sufficient to reverse the action of the drafts and check dampers.\n\nInstructions for installing and operating the regulator are packed in each crate.\n\nTrane Vapor-Vacuum Gauge\n\nTrane gauges are standard boiler equipment\u2014for testing both vapor and vacuum. They are finished with black paint and glass front. The dials are marked with black lettering. The scale is graduated in inches. The gauge is made of brass, with a vacuum connection so they do away with making pits for boilers, save difficult basements, and make possible the placing of radiation on the floor or walls of buildings where it is most efficient.\n\nIn saving the boiler pit alone, they pay for a good service for pits add considerable economy to the ordinary heating installation and boiler pits are hard to find and hard to clean. Furthermore efficiency is very apt to be reduced through dirt.\n\nAs a rule it costs but very little money in actual cost, to install a new condensation pump and the increased cost is more than offset by the greater efficiency and more dependable operation of the heating plant.\n\nA Trane Condensation Pump unit consists of a water storage tank, or receiving tank, a pump, a motor, and an automatic float switch to control operation. Pump and motor are direct connected and mounted on a base as shown in Figure 17. Once installed they operate automatically and require no attention other than periodic attention to see that the pump and motor bearings have sufficient oil.\n\nThese pumps are a development of long experience with, and an intimate knowledge of, exact conditions. They are also durable in construction, economical and efficient in operation, and made of materials which, in years, they have convincingly proven their exceptional fitness for dependable, long-term service.\n\nThe entire line of Trane Condensation, Circulating, Vacuum, and Pressure pumps are described fully in Trane Bulletin 50. Additional information and recommendations for special applications will gladly be given on request.\nThe Trane Radiator Trap System of Vapor Heating\n\nThe Trane Radiator Trap System of Vapor Heating is designed for buildings of all sizes. It can be adapted perfectly to the requirements of residences, apartments, schools, churches, hospitals, banks, greenhouses, factories, etc.\n\nThe boiler equipment includes the Trane Direct Fire Boiler Trap, Trane Damper Regulator, Trane Vacuum Pump, and Trane Vapor-Vacuum Gauge. Radiator equipment includes the Trane Pressureless Valve and a Trane Automatic Vent. Each radiator trap for each radiating unit is practically self-contained and is designed to operate on the principle that the amount of pressure it can maintain is determined by the comparatively high pressures of ten or even twenty pounds. The system is practically carefree and has a distinctly desirable feature that is not found in a vapor heating system, namely, that no air is vented into the rooms. The system is absolutely noiseless and does not affect the building.\n\nThe system is economical because it is so nearly automatic in operation. The instant the valve on one of the radiators senses the pressure in the boiler is increased, the valve opens on the sensing radiator, tending to close the draft and slow down the fire, thus saving coal. The instant extra warmth is needed, the valve opens on another radiator, allowing more steam to circulate through the building, and at such times there starts to rise from the water in the boiler it circulates freely. Thus the Trane System, practically at the press of a thumb, warms the entire building uniformly and quickly. A slight stirring of the fire in the boiler will transfer its warmth to the rooms almost before the operator can descend the stairs.\n\nThe Trane Vapor System has the feature of natural vaporization. It heats quickly but cools slowly. The Trane System is under vacuum, which means less air resistance, and therefore heat circulates more rapidly, and therefore heats the building more quickly. Also, when the system is shut off, the Trane Vacuum, water boils at lower temperatures, and therefore even when the fire goes down, steam vapor continues to go to the radiators where it will be slow to cool as compared to the rapidity with which it was heated.\n\nThe vacuum referred to here is the vacuum caused by the Trane Vacuum Pump. It is not created by a pump or other artificial means. It is an enchained vacuum system using Trane Vacuum Pumps, are practically self-acting.\n\nAll Trane Systems are fully guaranteed in every way. Additional details will gladly be sent upon request.\n\nA Typical Piping Layout for a Trane System of Vapor Heating\n\nThe layout above illustrates some of the basic engineering principles applied to the design of every Trane System, whether for residences or larger buildings of any kind. Note how the equally balanced circuits running each way from the boiler supply the large piping which illustrates the vapor made in the boiler and distributed to the radiators. The air and water return shown in the other piping runs in the same direction and is practically self-acting.\n\nWhen properly worked out this feature gives the same effect as though each radiator were placed at such a height that the air would be forced up by gravity through the Radiator Traps and return piping to a point near the boiler, where the air is removed by the Direct Return Trap.\n\nWhen fire is started in the boiler, the small amount of water soon becomes heated and the vapor rises through the Radiator Traps to the top of the radiators, displacing the air which is heavier than the vapor. The air, together with the water condensed in the traps, is removed automatically by gravity through the Radiator Traps and return piping to a point near the boiler, where the air is removed by the Direct Return Trap.\n\nAs the water in the boiler becomes hot, the vapor is condensed and the pressure in the boiler begins to rise. It is then that the sensitive vapor gauge indicates the pressure and opens the traps, preventing fuel waste and ensuring just the amount of pressure necessary for perfect comfort under all weather conditions.\nThe Trane System of Vacuum Heating\n\nFOR LARGE OR IRRREGULAR BUILDINGS AND BUILDINGS WITHOUT BASEMENTS\n\nThe Trane System of Vacuum Heating can be used to correctly heat any building, new or old, large or small. It is particularly adapted to large buildings, in central heating projects, and in greenhouse, schools, hospitals, etc., where there are special requirements to be provided for.\n\nA Typical Installation of a Trane Vacuum system in its simplest form would be similar to the one shown at the right. The boiler and a Trane Return Line Vacuum Pump would be installed instead of a Direct Return Trap. Other heating specialties would be the same, and the radiator specialties consist of the Trane Radiator Supply Valve and the 14-corrosion Trane Bellows Radiator Traps, excepting the Trane Radiator Trap System of Vapor Heating, without vents.\n\nTrane Vacuum Heating offers to large buildings every feature that Trane Vapor Heating gives to the smaller ones. It is, in a sense, Vapor heating with all flexibility and convenience, too irregular to be heated quickly, quietly, uniformly, and efficiently by it; and no heating device made today is more widely used than the most important method of heating.\n\nIn addition to the nature of steam temperature control, the Trane Vacuum system has advantages over other types of heating. It overcomes the effect of resistance of air in pipes and the action of gravity. For these reasons, the Trane Vacuum system and return lines can to a great extent be run where convenient rather than in accordance with an exact line of force, increased pipe lift, and other difficulties that cause trouble in an ordinary system and handled by Trane Vacuum with the least cost of labor.\n\nThe Trane Vacuum system is as simple if not simpler than a Trane Vapor system to operate.\n\nSteam Temperature Control\n\nOne of the special advantages of the Trane System of Vacuum Heating is the steam temperature control. This means that the steam throughout the building can be regulated from the boiler to the individual radiators in any way desired. This is especially desirable in schools, where the temperature varies but it is also highly desirable in many other places.\n\nThe Trane engineers, of course, tend to make the Trane Vacuum system efficient as well as practical. This is why the system of Vacuum Heating is the only system available in which both the heat source equipment and the vacuum holding equipment are all designed and built by Trane engineers. The three critical points on the system are the traps and the valves which hold the vacuum and maintain it. With these three points protected by Trane protection the system is safe. Trane and it carries a guarantee. We are confident of the satisfactory operation of the individual items but for their successful operation together.\n\nWe welcome an opportunity to supply full information on the Trane System of Vacuum Heating.\n\nTrane Engineering Service\n\nThe function of Trane Engineering Service is to cooperate with engineers, architects, and heating contractors on all matters pertaining to The Trane Systems of Vacuum Heating, the Trane System of Vapor Heating, Trane Heating Specialties and Trane Pumps. If any heating question or problem of pumps for the mechanical equipment of buildings confronts Trane Engineers, they have the experience records of years to guide them in making recommendations.\n\nProtected by TRANE at Every Point\n\nUNDIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY\n\nTRANE VACUUM PUMPS\n\nThe Complete Line of Trane Pumps is illustrated in Trane Bulletin No. 256.

As you well know, all DUNHAM products are not only completely manufactured in Canada, but are given a most thorough test in our plant here in Toronto, and we feel confident that you will see that due consideration is given for the use of the DUNHAM specialties in this Indian School at Cardston, Alta.\n\nAssuring you that we are always at your service,\n\nwe are\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy D.I.A.\n\n(Charge D.I.A.)\nOttawa, 9th July, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Walker:\n\nSince writing you on the 6th instant, I have learned that the Trane traps are assembled in Canada, but not manufactured here, and have accordingly wired the Indian Commissioner at Regina to notify the contractors that the Department cannot accept the Trane traps.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Walker,\nThe Dunham Co., Limited,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Gardner Smith with reference to the progress of the work on the new R.C. School on the Blood Reserve, who reports that the work of excavation is practically completed and most of the footing trenches are dug. A large quantity of material is also on the ground. He asks for instructions on one or two points and I telegraphed to you on the 4th instant as follow;-\n\n\"Principal new Blood School asks that additional space be provided for coal. This additional space was provided at St. Pauls. Will cost nothing extra if concrete is reduced in strength as was done at St. Pauls.\"\n\nAnother matter mentioned in his report was a request by the Rev. Principal to have a wash basin and toilet installed in the boys' cloak room in the basement, which could be used for the Engineer, Farmer and other male help, and would obviate the necessity of their using the conveniences on the floor above, which are intended for the teaching staff and visitors. I would recommend that the suggestion be followed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL, CARDSTON\n\nWe were very disappointed to find we were unable to secure on a competitive basis, the contract for the above mentioned school, and we have been trying since, to find from our own records, some reason for our figures being higher than our competitors. We gave the estimate special study and owing to the fact that we left our plant on the ground, we had a further incentive in our efforts to secure the work.\n\nThe tender we submitted was so very much lower than we would submit in ordinary times and too low in our opinion, for really profitable work.\n\nAs we understand the tenders for most public work at Ottawa are available to the citizens, may we ask you if you would let us have a list of the tenders submitted on this particular work, as we are especially anxious to know how we fared on the general run of bids.\n\nWe trust the information requested is such that you will be quite agreeable to furnish it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nEC/A.\n\nE.

Box 21,\nCardston, Alta. July 8, 1925.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- R.C. School: Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the lighting fixtures for this school, I have gone over the list submitted by the contractors. I have duly noted your desire to keep the cost of fixtures as near as possible to the allowance of $500.\n\nThe list of fixtures suggested by the contractors totals $1042.30 according to their quotation. They also submit a list of suggested additional lights and switches to cost $226.20, thus making a combined total of $1270.50.\n\nI think in some respects the contractors' list is unnecessarily expensive, particularly so in the number of ornate light fixtures included by them.\n\nWhen the question of lighting fixtures for St. Paul's School came up, I received a letter from Commissioner Graham, enclosing a list of fixtures considered suitable, with approximate prices attached, and I was instructed to follow that list in arranging for the fixtures.\n\nTaking the St. Paul's list as a guide, I have made out a list for this school, with prices in accordance with previous costs, and I respectfully submit it for your consideration.\n\nYou will see that the fixtures for outlets shown on the plans come to $565.55, and suggested additional lights, switches, night lights, plugs, etc., costing $324.50, making a combined total of $890.05. This is about $350.00 higher than the St. Paul's job cost, but this is a larger school, with many more outlets. It is $279.55 less than the cost of the lighting fixtures and suggested extras submitted by the contractors.\n\nThe prices I have mentioned for the various fixtures in the list I am submitting are not arbitrary; there may be a little fluctuation up and down, but it should average out about as I show.\n\nRegarding the contractors' suggestion of installing telephone desk sets, this seems unnecessary at present as there is no telephone service on the Reserve yet.\n\nWith regard to the suggested ventilator fan for the engine room, I do not consider this to be needed, as the engine room will have an outside window, and if we use an automatic plant there will not be very much fumes from the smaller battery that such a plant calls for.\n\nI note that the contractors suggest additional fire gong service to cost $71.50 extra. According to the specifications, (Clause 20, Page 60) \"An 8\" enclosed type vibrating gong shall be installed in corridor on each\nfloor and wired to operate from offices on ground floor, and one room on each of the other floors.\"\n\nThe contractors consider that, under this Clause, they are not required to install a fire-gong in either the basement or the 2nd floor, as no \"corridor\" is shown on the plans for these floors. In my own experience I have not placed fire-gongs in basements. In the case of the 2nd floor, I think that two gongs (6\" would do) should be installed, one for the boys and one for the girls, and it may be that the contractors might fairly claim an extra for these. I would suggest, therefore, that the 6\" gongs be installed on the ground floor and first floor, as specified, and an additional 6\" gong be placed in each of the two divisions of the 2nd floor. Presumably the contractors will be entitled to an extra for the two 6\" gongs on the 2nd floor. I shall await your ruling in this matter of fire-gongs before instructing the contractors.\n\nWith reference to the general wiring plan, the only fault I have noted so far is that the panel boxes are shown in passages instead of being placed in rooms not accessible to the pupils of the school, as called for in the Specifications. I will have this corrected, and will take pains to see that the Specifications are carried out, and the work done in accordance with the regulations of the Underwriters. I will deal directly with the contractors regarding the wiring plan, which I think you intend me to do.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n15th July, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Reserve, I beg to give you a list, herewith, of the amounts of the various tenders received for this building:\n\n$144,000.00\n136,400.00\n136,000.00\n129,788.00\n125,480.00\n124,200.00\n123,000.00\n117,277.00\n\nThe tender of Messrs.

This also includes the additional outlets asked for by the Reverend Principal.\n\nIt is not thought necessary to install telephone desk sets, or a ventilating fan in the engine room.\n\nWith reference to the fire gongs; you may authorize the contractor to place two six inch gongs on the second floor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[A.

MACKENZIE,\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReplying to your wire of July 8th, asking if Trane Traps are entirely manufactured in Canada; we wish to submit the following information.\n\nOur Traps are made in Canada with the exception of the Bellows Element, which is manufacture at our parent Factory in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The Bellows represents approximately 15% of the total cost of the Trap; so we can state definitely that the Trap is 85% Canadian made.\n\nAs was pointed out to you by the writer, and to Mr. Orr in our conversation yesterday (July 9th)\u2014the one and only reason why the Bellows are not manufactured in Canada, is because of the very expensive machinery required to produce this high class Element.\n\nWe might say however, that it is the intention of the Trane Company to make these Bellows in Canada as soon as the outlook for business warrants the substantial outlay required to commence operations.\n\nThe Trane Company have been selling their product in Canada for a good many years, but it was not until 1924 that any great endeavor was made to develop this business here. At that time it was definitely decided that it would be our earnest endeavor to have our goods 100% Canadian made the very moment that it was possible, and we think that you will agree that in view of the fact that our goods are now 85% Canadian Made after only a few months of operation, we have shown some evidence of our intentions.\nWe are very sorry that our Traps could not be approved for the Indian School, but we trust that you will keep us in mind on future work,\u2014and mention our product in your specifications.\n\nUnder separate cover we are forwarding you our bulletin #14, on our product for your information.\n\nWe wish to thank you for the very courteous hearing you gave the writer yesterday and trust that our product will receive your valuable consideration on future work, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE TRANE COMPANY\n\nJ.S.

Deputy D.I.A.\n\n(Charge D.I.A.)\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the water supply system at the new R.C. School on the Blood Reserve, I understand that it is your intention to erect a water tower similar to that installed at the St. Paul's School. If this is your intention I would be glad to know, as I think the work should be done while the contractors are on the ground. Last year this work was done a little late in the season, when it might just as well have been done in good building weather.\n\nI notice that the Inspector, Mr. Gardner Smith, has been communicating direct with the contractors on this matter, in fact has been giving them instructions as to how they should go about the work. This is contrary to my understanding with the Department and the Minister, and it seems to me an odd way of doing Government business. I would be glad to know if I have got to secure information in this way in order to carry on the work. The Minister informed me on more than one occasion that all matters pertaining to buildings would be dealt with by the Department through this office. I am not finding fault with Mr. Gardner Smith in the least; he should not be found fault with, but I certainly am finding fault with the Department for the way they are doing business and the position in which they have placed me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

School on the Blood Reserve. With regard to the water supply system for this building, I would be glad to have your recommendation as to the best type of water supply system to install.\n\nWith reference to your remarks regarding Mr. Gardiner Smith; I would say that he was instructed to send his reports on this work to the Department through your office, and I will again bring this matter to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Aug. 5, 1925.\n\nR.Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- R.C.School: Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr.Orr:\n\nYesterday our job was visited by Mr.D.D.Smith, head\nof the firm of Smith Bros. & Wilson, Ltd. the general contractors\nfor this building.\n\nWe had a frank discussion of many matters pertaining\nto the work, and prospective auxiliary services, and he again\nraised the point about plastering the interior surfaces of the\nexternal basement walls.\n\nYou will recall that I wired you sometime ago stating\nthe contractors did not propose to strap and metal-lath these\nconcrete surfaces, and I pointed out that if such were done it\nwould cause a jog, or offset, of about an inch at the top of these\nconcrete walls where the tile commences. I received a telegram in\nreply asking that the specifications be followed, said telegram\nbeing signed by Mr.Mackenzie.\n\nMr.Smith is very much averse to using metal lath and\nstrapping on these concrete surfaces. He claims that not only\nwould it be a waste of money, and an expense that was not figured,\nbut he thinks it would prove positively detrimental. He insists\nthat no dampness,or frost, will come through the 16\" of concrete\nin a heated basement, that he has never known it to do so even in\nthe severe Regina climate, and that it will never do so here. There\nwould be a splay in the basement walls at the top of the concrete\nwhere the tile commences, and that a crack would inevitably result\nat the union point of the two surfaces, and that looseness of the\nplaster would result. Also, he claims, the lower basement walls\nwould be much more substantial and proof against abuse, particularly\nin the play-rooms, if the plastering is done direct on the concrete.\n\nI promised Mr.Smith that I would write you fully on the\nsubject, passing on the arguments he has raised, and would await\nyour reply before insisting that strapping and metal lath be\nused in plastering on the concrete walls.\nI may say that after weighing the evidence I am inclined to concur in the contractors' view, and I think it improbable that any dampness or frost would come through to the inner surface of these walls, especially as only about 12\" of concrete wall comes above grade.\n\nThe contractors contend that the section drawing shows these walls to be 16\" concrete, and that if the intention had been to use strapping and metal lath, such treatment would have been indicated on the section, and that the concrete walls in such case should have been shown at least one inch less in order to have an even vertical surface for the basement plastering.\n\nI shall await further instructions from you on the subject, and shall order the work done in accordance with same.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nP.O. Box 21,\nCardston, Alta. July 23rd, 1925.\n\nR. Gueydon Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: R.C. School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nIn the basement heating plan of this building the size of boiler flue is shown as 34\" x 34\", which we are following. The same sheet indicates the main chimney to be 70' high. This is about 20' higher than is shown on the elevations. The contractors propose taking the elevations as their guide. The elevations show this chimney to be 53' above the footings, and the bakery chimney 49' above the footings, both finishing at same height. The heating plan referred to call for an unnecessarily high chimney. Will you please give a ruling as to the exact heights above footings that these chimneys must be.\n\nRegarding the storm windows for this job, they have arrived on the site and are the usual type of outside storm windows with sliding vents. The specifications (Page s 37 & 38) describe them in terms of outside sash, but it is mentioned that they are to be placed on \"inside of frame\". Am I right in assuming that this is a typographical mistake, and that your intention is to have them placed on the outside of the frames?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nBLOOD Agency\n\nDIARY FOR MONTH OF JULY 1925\n\n1 Dominion Day.

School on the Blood Reserve. In that letter I told you that I understood the matter had been left in the hands of Mr. Gardner Smith. Previous to writing this letter I had received one from Mr. Gardner Smith, saying that he had taken the matter of lighting fixtures up direct with you, that you had replied giving him the necessary authority, and he in turn took the matter up with me, asking if it met with my approval, and if it did the order would be placed. A most absurd situation. I understand from the Minister that all matters pertaining to repairs and charges in buildings are to be submitted through my office. Why does Gardner Smith write to me for my opinion after you have already given your approval?\n\nI have before me your letter of the 5th of August, in which you state that you have instructed Gardner Smith to send his reports on the work through me. I am not so much interested in his reports as I am in the expenditures that he asks the Department to incur. I would be glad to have some understanding as to how this matter is to be carried on in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nREGINA, SASK., Aug. 13th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am herewith forwarding a plan of the Water Tower for the R.C. School on the Blood Reserve. It is similar to the one built for St. Paul's last year.\n\nIf this meets with your approval, I will get tenders on same from Smith Brothers & Wilson, so it would be well to start to build the water tower as soon as possible, so as to have it finished before the cold weather sets in. The only change I have to suggest is that red wood be used instead of pine. It would be a little more expensive, but would give much better satisfaction. Smith Brothers & Wilson are now figuring on the cost of the tower.\n\nRegarding the pumping plant, I would make the following recommendations:\n\nWorking Head HOOSIER No. 1701, designed to operate at 30 strokes per minute.\nWorking Barrel 34\" x 30\", all brass.\nDrop pipe, 4\" diameter x 70' depth in well.\nPlugged and sealed.\nSucker Rods, Ash in 1 7/8\" forged couplings.\nCylinder to be placed 60' below pump head.\nDischarge Pipe in 3\".\nCapacity 1420 Am. gals. per hr. on 20\" stroke,\nWith all necessary valves, fittings, etc., completely equipped and installed.\n\nSmith Brothers & Wilson Limited, offer to install the above described plant for the sum of $672.00, exclusive of belting and line-shaft. I believe their quotation is slightly less than the similar plant cost at St. Paul's school. It would of course be driven by the engine that\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwould be procured for the electric generator and laundry machine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: R.C. School: Blood Reserve.\n\nI had a call yesterday from Rev. Father Rudaw, Principal and Rev. Father Lebris, Parish Priest of Lethbridge and they requested me to bring to your kind attention several additions to the plan of this building that they are desirous of having provided. I shall take the requests in the order in which they were made.\n\nFirst\u2014They are anxious to have a standpipe in boilerroom for fire protection. They also suggest that the standpipe be carried up into the chapel. This protection should not prove expensive, as connection could readily be made with the water main in basement. This seems a reasonable request, and has been done elsewhere, under my supervision. A boiler-room is perhaps the greatest source of fire hazard, and the standpipes provided in the specifications for the main building is insufficient to give fire protection in the areas referred to.\n\nSecondly\u2014The Rev. Principal would like rear balconies installed similar to what was provided for the school at Duck Lake. These are for the use of the Sisters, and for apprentices. I spent some time with them studying the plan of this school, and I came to the conclusion that there would be serious architectural difficulties in building similar balconies here on account of the position the fire escape will occupy where attached to this building, and which could cut up the balconies in such a way as would render them almost useless for the purpose intended. As our fire-escapes are probably now made, it would be a big expense to alter them, or turn them in other directions.\n\nAn alternative would be to build the balconies at the rear of the wings, giving access to them from the first floor. The Rev. Principal says the balconies would be even more satisfactory if placed there, instead of in the rear centre of the building as was done at Duck Lake. By referring to the last floor plan of this building you may be able to follow better. In the boys' wing, you will observe, there are three rear windows. The centre window could be displaced by a glass door from Nurse's Room, giving access to the proposed balcony; and the window thus displaced could be placed in the wall of Infirmary to give more light there. In the girls' wing there are three windows in the Dormitory, and one of these could be similarly displaced by a door giving access to the other balcony, or if considered necessary to obtain sufficient light the displaced window could be placed in what is shown as a solid wall. The question naturally arises as to whether or not the proposed balconies might throw too much shadow on the windows of the class-rooms below, but I think if the undersides of the balconies were painted white to better reflect the light, there should not be a serious objection in this respect. Also, if thought advisable, the balconies could be placed with the floor of same one or two steps higher than the adjoining floor-level, so as to give more clearance to the classroom windows below.\n\nThere is ample space at the rear of these wings for balconies similar to what was provided at Duck Lake, and there are no serious architectural difficulties that I can foresee in placing them there. No doubt the contractors will have their cost data on the others, and should be able to give you an immediate quotation in the event of the Principal's request commanding itself to you. It is important however, that an early decision be arrived at, in order that the necessary openings be made in the brickwork as the building goes up, and so that the extra doors and frames may be ordered.\nThirdly\u2014The Rev. Principal wishes a wash basin to be placed in one of the vestries. I understand Mr. Faunt has on hand a number of wash basins brought from the Dumbo School, and perhaps one of them might be used to lessen the expense.\n\nFourthly\u2014The Rev. Principal requests that a wash basin be placed in the Principal's bedroom. I have just received a quotation of $158.00 from the contractors for this proposal, as per their letter, which I am enclosing.\n\nFifthly\u2014The Reverend Principal is desirous of having a stairway provided for the choir gallery in Chapel, similar to what was built at Duck Lake. He points out that the Sisters and others who may be in the choir gallery, under the present plan, would have a long walk through the school in order to come to the altar for Communion, and then a long round-about trip back again. He says it is essential that this be avoided, and that a small stairway from the gallery to the Chapel floor be provided.\n\nI promised the Reverend Fathers that I would promptly bring their requests to your attention, and would be guided by your instructions in all these matters.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"E. Gardner Smith\"\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nI am attaching herewith copy of a letter which I have just received from E. Cardier-Smith, Inspector of Construction on the R.C. school, Blood Reserve, dealing with several requests made by Father Rubux, Principal of the School:\n\nDealing with the first request\u2014to have a standpipe in the boiler-room for fire protection, also suggesting that the standpipe be carried up into the chapel, with saddles and fire-hose in both boiler-room and chapel; I would recommend that this request be granted, as I think it is advisable to have this extra fire protection.\n\nSecond\u2014regarding rear balconies, I have nothing to say on this matter, and will leave it entirely in the hands of the Department.\n\nThird\u2014Wash basin to be placed in the Vestry\u2014I do not think this is necessary.\n\nFourth\u2014The Reverend Principal requests that a wash-basin be placed in the Principal's bedroom. The cost estimated by Smith Brothers & Wilson is $158.00. Their explanation is that there is a considerable distance to carry the water, which makes the cost seem high. I would recommend this expenditure.\n\nFifth\u2014Having a stairway provided for the choir gallery in the chapel. I would recommend this stairway.\n\nTo save time I would think it would be well to get Smith Bros. & Wilson to go on with this work on a ten per cent basis on the actual cost. Please advise me as to what portion of this work is to be gone on with, at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

I would be pleased to have your authority to purchase the other equipment. I will, of course, make inquiries and ascertain whether this stuff is really needed or not, and if I find that the school can get along without all the equipment asked for, such articles will be eliminated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

Under this procedure I have sent him plans and specifications of proposed auxiliary services which will be required, as instructed by you in your letter of June 4th.\n\nThe only instances which I can recall in which I have referred matters to Ottaws direct, instead of to Mr. Graham, are instances in which the Architect's interpretation of certain technical points was required, and in doing so I was simply observing Clause 16, Page 8 of the General Specifications for this School.\n\nMight I ask that you kindly write me, pointing out in what respect you consider I have been remiss in observing your instructions? A frank communication on the subject would be greatly appreciated, and should enable me to conform more fully to the letter and spirit of the Department's rulings.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nREGINA BANK SEPT 18TH 1925\n\nSECRETARY INDIAN DEPT 644\n\nOTTAWA ONT.\n\nREFERENCE SWAN'S DISPOSAL WORKS BLOODY B C SCHOOL I RECOMMEND THAT SERVICES BE GIVEN SMITH BROTHERS AND WILSON AT COST PLUS TEN PERCENT PLEASE WRITE AUTHORITY\n\nW G BARBER\n\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER\nOttawa, Sept. 2, 1925.\n\nW.

DIA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Reverend Principal of the new R.C. School on the Blood Reserve, and the Sister Superior of the same institution were in my office on Saturday and requested that a change be made in the front entrance of the new school. They had just returned from Duck Lake, and they asked that the entrance on their school be made the same as on the new Duck Lake School. After looking into the plans I quite agree that a change would be a great advantage and would save the Department money sooner or later.\n\nThe Principal and Sister Superior point out that there is no possible place for the Sisters to sit out in the summer evenings, as there is nothing but a doorstep and small verandah. They ask that a verandah with a balcony over the top be arranged, so that they could convert one of the upstairs windows into a door leading out onto the balcony. It would not be necessary to have a roof over this balcony above the verandah.\n\nI have taken the matter up with Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson and they have given me an approximate figure of between $300.00 and $400.00 to do the work. It would not exceed $400.00. I would strongly recommend that this be done. Kindly advise me by wire, as the contractor would like to know at the earliest possible date if the change is to be made.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

F. MacKenzie,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that I am told that the plumbing specifications provide for no Hot Water Circulating Line. Its omission would mean a considerable waste of water, owing to the fact that when hot water faucets are turned on, the water would have to run for some time before hot water would reach the fixture. This waste would occur at every fixture in the building, and in the aggregate would mean a serious waste, and for the distant fixtures the water would seldom come really hot. A hot water circulating line going back to the heating boilers, and jacket heater, would insure hot water reaching the fixtures at once when the faucets are turned on. To get the full efficiency from the suggested hot water circulating line it should be covered like a steam main with air cell covering. The contractors have quoted a price as follows:\n\n\"To install hot water circulating line, and cover hot water mains and risers to the point where branches are taken off for the fixtures, with 2\" air cell covering for the sum of $418.00. If 1\" air cell covering is used it would cost $434.50.\" You will remember that it was necessary to install such a system in the Edmonton School and I was told that the plumbing is not efficient without a hot water circulating line.\n\nNo range boiler is provided in the kitchen in this school. In the summer months it will be necessary to depend on the jacket heater for hot water. If a range boiler were provided there would always be a generous supply of hot water on hand heated by the kitchen fire, and only on special occasions such as laundry day, would it be necessary to fire the jacket heater. The Contractors offer to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nInstall an 80 gal. range boiler, with all connections for $145.00.\n\nThe specifications do not provide for the covering of the 300 gal. hot water storage tank. To conserve the heat in this tank it is usual to cover it with 1\" air cell blocks, and this would cost $125.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that it was necessary to install Double Doors between the Corridor and one class room at the new R.O. School on the Blood Reserve. A similar change was authorized at the Duck Lake School. This is necessary in order to provide a Concert Hall for the pupils, which, of course, is needed. The cost of this change will not be very great. It will be done on an actual cost, plus 10% basis.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. M.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe-Wage Schedule, R.C.School, Cardston.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th inst., with reference to a complaint from the Electrical Workers' Union of Regina, in which it is alleged that the electrical sub-contractor is not complying with the Fair Wage Clause inserted in the specifications.\n\nIn reply I would say that the electrical sub-contractors, and his helpers, are now absent from the job, having gone to Onion Lake to complete the electrical work at an Indian school being erected there, and pending his return, I am unable to ascertain what rate of wages he and his helpers have been receiving. They are not on the pay-roll of the general contractors. However, in the meantime I will communicate with the electrical contractors' Regina office, and will write the Department again as soon as I can obtain the information desired.\n\nI may say that early in the performance of this contract I wrote the general contractors an official letter advising them that the Department would expect them to comply with the Fair Wage Schedule of the specifications.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nThere is very much to report in connection with the building, as you have the Building Inspector's reports on the progress of the work. The building is now all closed in, roof on, etc., and is ready for plastering, but at the time I was there the work was held up on account of having no gravel or sand for the plaster. The Foreman advised me that unless the weather changed very soon he would probably have to close down. As the matter stands now, it is impossible to get material out. He stated that he had eight carloads of material in Cardston which he had to make arrangements to have stored. He also informed me that he probably would have a hard time getting started again if he had to close down, as a lot of his men were from outside points, and they would not likely come back again if they once left the job. Mr. Gardner Smith advised me that he had found the work performed by Smith Bros. & Wilson, on the whole, very satisfactory.\n| ARTICLES                        | Cockshutt Ploy Company | Massey-Harris Company |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1-20' Dbl.

I must admit that it is a poor sample of work so much so that upon Rev. Fr. Rusur's representations, Commissioner Graham was obliged to admit that the building would rather serve the purpose of a granary than that of a barn and told the Rev. Principal to give the latter a new destination. I would therefore recommend the building of a suitable barn (after having taken the advice of the Principal) and other necessary outbuildings.\n\nJoseph Henry, O.S.F.\nJ. B.

Potts & Miller, Limited, plumbing contractors of this City, representing plumbing at the R.C. School on the Blood Reserve. The bill calls for about 60 hours time of a man, and $24.00 additional. This is for supplying water to test the heating boilers in the new school.\n\nI do not understand why we should be called upon to pay this account, and I took the matter up with Messrs. Potts & Miller, who inform me that a similar bill was presented for work at the Anglican School on the Blood Reserve, and had been paid by the Department. Personally I cannot recommend the payment of an account for work of this nature, but if this charge was met at one point, no doubt it will have to be paid in this instance also.\n\nKindly advise me what action you wish to take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

We did put up a small barn at this school for horses, but when I visited the institution I found that the location of this building was altogether too far away to be used as a barn, and I suggested to the Principal that it could be used as an implement shed. However, it is just possible that before next spring we may decide to move this barn to another point, but in any case $5000.00 will be needed to erect a cow barn, implement shed and henhouse.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Thanking you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\n[Signature]\n\nL/B.\nEncs. 2.\nSir:\n\nMr. Gardner Smith, Inspector of Construction at the new R.C. School on the Blood Reserve draws attention to one or two matters of extra expenditure, authority for which I would like to secure from the Department.\n\nMr. Gardner Smith points out that the hot-water storage tank provided in the specifications will be heated by live steam from the heating-boilers during the heating season. There should be a \"hot-water temperature control\" attached to this storage tank in order to prevent excessively hot water from passing through the hot-water lines in the building. If it is omitted there will be times when live steam will come through when the faucets are opened, with danger of scalding the attendants. Also, there will be continuous trouble from leaking taps owing to the steam destroying the washers. At St. Paul's school asked for authority to install a temperature-control attachment, but it was refused at the time, and they are having the trouble that I have indicated. A \"Powers' Automatic Temperature Control\" costs about $120.00 installed, and by its use the temperature of the water in the storage tank can be prevented from exceeding a pre-determined temperature. It works on the thermostat principle, and automatically shuts off the steam when the required temperature of the water is reached, and admits the steam again as the temperature falls. I would recommend that this Automatic Temperature Control be provided.\n\nA small pump and storage tank should be placed in the laundry for the purpose of drawing a supply of soft water from the large concrete cistern outside. The contractors were asked to quote, and give a figure of $390.00. Mr. Gardner Smith, however, has received quotations for pumps from Bruce Robinson Distributors, Ltd., of Calgary and McAuley-Bell & Morse of Calgary. The Bruce Robinson Distributors pump will cost installed $315.00; it operates automatically, controlling the flow of water. The other pump quoted on by McAuley-Bell and Morse is a Hoosier Horizontal pump the cost of which installed would be $145.00. It however lacks the automatic features of the other and would occupy more floor space. I would recommend the installation of the automatic pump.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\npump at the cost of $315.00.

De McLennan,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir:\n\nThe Inspector of Construction at Cardston, Mr. E. Gardner Smith, reports that the new R.C. School has reached the stage for the performing of interior work, and there are one or two things which should be attended to. Burlap has to be placed in the corridors and stairways in accordance with the specifications on page fifty, but no mention is made of a rail or mold to be placed along the top of it, and the contractors do not propose to supply anything. The Burlap should not be left without some wood finish, and a plain bull-nosed strip or mold two or three inches wide would answer the purpose. Will you please advise me as to this.\n\nThe Principal asks if he may be furnished with a school bell similar to the one purchased for the St. Paul's School, which cost $63.80 delivered. This I would recommend, and shall be glad to receive authority.\n\nThe water tower is nearing completion and I should like to be advised if the Department desires to have it anchored. While this precaution may not be absolutely necessary, the element of safety against any possibility of damage from cyclonic winds, which are frequent in that district, might justify the expense. Messrs. Cland & Scott, contractors, offered to place four concrete anchors five feet long at a distance of 75 ft. from the corners of the tower, each with about 100 ft. of 5/8\" wire cable, with turnbuckles for tightening etc.,\n\ncomplete\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncomplete for $160.00.

These exclusive features of design, material and construction are reasons why Berghman performance is guaranteed. You will find them nowhere else.\n\n1. The Berghman abrasive stone is the finest grinding element for skate steel which long experiment and careful trial could produce. It combines a maximum of action with a minimum of pressure. Note its generous size\u2014accurately determined to give hollow ground edge of most effective arc. Length chosen to properly distribute wear on the abrasive, and make uneven grinding impossible.\n\n2. Adjustable: Does not fit hit or miss, quickly adjusted to any type skate, then fits exactly and firmly so that it cannot easily be misused to produce an untrue edge.\n\n3. Renewable: To get fresh cylindrical surface abrasive is easily released and rotated. When full of steel, remove and clean in kerosene. When all worn out replace with new stone.\n\n4. Long Life: With proper stone the Berghman is good for twenty-five first-class grindings. The sharpener will last a lifetime.\n\n5. Compact and Handsome: The Berghman looks like the quality product that it is. Made of 18 g. steel. Standard finishes: OX-handsome dull gloss black japanned, set off by nickel bolt and thumb nut. XXX all nickel. Other finishes quoted on request.\n\nHow to Use the Berghman Sharpener\n\nThe illustration shows a good handy way to use the sharpener. Just hold the skate on the knee and run the sharpener up and down the length of the skate evenly. A moderate amount of pressure\u2014a half dozen strokes, squeeze top stones together, releasing grip of sides on abrasive stone, and rotate skate with hand and fingers of other hand. (See illustration.)\n\nThe guide flanges should not be set tight enough to cause severe friction on sides of skate blade.\n\nInstead of placing skate on knee, some prefer to hold skate with end bearing down solidly at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees.

Gardner Smith referred to the advisability of providing protection against fire hazard over the boiler breeching which passes about 23\" below the laminated wood ceiling of the boiler-room. He suggests doing so by means of strapping, wire-lathing and plastering the ceiling with asbestos and cement plaster at a cost of approximately $35.00, and I have authorized this expenditure which I trust you will approve of.\n\nThe Principal of the school asks to be provided with a 75\" Single Roll Flat Work Ironer, and I shall be glad if the Department will advise me if this extra laundry equipment will be allowed, the cost of which as quoted by Messrs. Stanley Brock Limited will be approximately $907.00, but about $43.00 less than this if the Ironer can be ordered in time to be included in a carload from Toronto to Cardston via Calgary. I would point out that a 100\" Ironer was supplied at St. Paul's School.\n\nThe plans do not provide for the placing of a communion rail in the Chapel.

Regarding the Communion rail in the Chapel it will be necessary for the Church authorities to provide this furnishing.\n\nYou may authorise the providing of a suitable burlap ship, and also a bell for the school.\n\nWith reference to the water tower it would be advisable to have it properly anchored.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

School on the Blood Reserve have been brought to my attention by Mr. E. Gardner Smith. One is the non-provision of burlap in the passages; the specifications calling for burlap only on the walls of the corridors and stairways. I think burlap should be furnished for the passages to the Chapel and Choir Gallery, and in the halls on the second floor at the head of the stairways. This will necessitate an extra 233 feet, which at 35\u00a2 per lineal foot for supplying, fixing and painting, quoted by the sub-contractor, will entail an extra expenditure of $78.05 exclusive of the General Contractor usual 10%.\n\nThe other omission is providing for painting the concrete base in those rooms in the basement in which concrete floor paint is called for, altogether 856 feet of base are thus involved which will cost 4\u00a2 per foot to give it two coats of concrete floor paint, a total expenditure of $34.24.

Smith Bros. & Wilson is $170.00 for tables with copper covering and gutter, and an alternative price of $146.00 for tables with zinc covering and gutter. The prices include painting of exposed wood, three coats, but does not include any plumbing work. I have not got a figure on this but it will be done at a reasonable price, as the plumbers are now in the building.

Both systems will operate satisfactorily the laundry machinery, but the cost of installing motors is approximately $600 more than the line shaft.\n\nIn the case of the Duck Lake School motors were allowed for the laundry machinery at the request of the Reverend Principal and Mr. Graham. Will you please indicate if this extra expenditure can be authorized. Mr. Graham has asked that if you approve of this that he would like the authority wired to him, as the contractors are ready to go on with the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nJ. D.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nCanada Life Building,\nC I T Y\n\nRe - R.C. Indian School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs there has been a considerable amount of controversy between your Inspector, Mr. E. Gardner Smith, and ourselves with reference to the Coal Bin, we are explaining our position to you in this matter.\n\nIn the first place, on July 11th last we received an order which read as follows: \"Enlarge coal bin to the same size and type as the one at St. Paul's school, with reinforced slab roof, with two rings and covers for receiving the coal. Exact size of enlarged coal bin will be given in a separate letter. Means of payment will also be separately explained.\" But we have nothing further in our files to show what the means of payment would be, so that we had no way of counteracting the idea that we were going to put all the concrete in the building 4-to-1. It developed later that Mr. E. Gardner Smith expected us to offset largely the cost of this addition by a saving in cement.\n\nAt the time we received the order, we already had the coal chutes ordered and on the site, and the smaller coal room excavated, and the surplus earth piled all around, and we had to do the balance of the excavation in a more or less disorganized manner.\n\nOn December 5th we submitted our cost for additional work on the coal room, which amounted to $683.65. This price did not include the additional work on the Chimney, and we were to give the Department credit for cement saved due to the change from 4-to-1 to 5-to-1. The main difficulty arises over how much cement we saved. At the date the order was forwarded, we had a large amount of footings and walls run, but this can easily be estimated. The main difficulty is that we do not consider that the specification for the footings or the rough concrete of the basement floors calls for a 4-to-1 mixture. At the same time we realize that no particular mix was called for, and in estimating this school we actually figured on a 6-to-1 concrete, which is quite usual for footings and the rough concrete for a basement floor, and we think that most contractors reading the specifications would have figured on a similar basis, as it would be strong enough for the work and would make a good job. On the other hand, it is quite usual to put walls in stronger than footings, and we certainly figured on the walls being a 6-to-1 mix if gravel was used. We realize that the Department may have a different understanding than ourselves regarding this matter, but the fact remains that in making up our cost we only figured on putting a good grade of concrete in the basement floors and footings, consistent with the work we usually turn out; and if we give the Department credit for a saving in cement on the footings and rough concrete floors, we shall be giving them a credit for something which we never charged them for in the first place. As far as the walls are concerned, we expect and always expected to allow the Department a credit equal to approximately 1 sack of cement per cubic yard of all the concrete poured into the walls after the date of the order; and as the basement and approximately half of the main building walls\nwere run prior to the order, we consider there has been approximately 160 cubic yards of concrete run in walls on which a saving in cement could be expected.\n\nWe have no complaint to make as to Mr. Smith's attitude, because we believe that he is interpreting the specifications to the best interests of the Department which he represents; but there certainly is room for another interpretation because a careful perusal of the specifications will show that Clause #7, page 16, \"Footings\", and clause #12, page 17, \"Concrete Floors\", leave the question of mix open; whereas clause #9, page 16, \"Walls\", clearly defines the proportions for this part of the work, and it simply boils down to a question of whether we were justified in figuring the footings and rough concrete under the basement floors of a good standard mix, or whether we should have figured them the same proportion as the walls.\n\nIn considering this matter, we do not think a comparison should be made between this and the coal room at St. Paul's, as in the latter case the contractors had the opportunity of saving right from the start, and further they may have made arrangements to put the concrete down even more, and without being informed on all the particulars of the matter, it would be impossible to compare them on a fair basis.\n\nWe think this explanation covers all the trouble involved, and will enable you to make a decision. At the same time, we wish to express our regret that it has been necessary to bring the matter to your attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON LTD.\nPer Geo. Johns\nP.O. Box 21,\nCardston, Jan. 30/26\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe - R.C.School: Blood Reserve\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to the change in cement proportion in the concrete for this building, which was authorized by you on the occasion of your visit here on July 11th, it was plainly stated that this saving in cement was to be applied towards paying for the cost of the enlarged coal-bin.\n\nThere has been an interchange of statements and letters between the contractors and me on this feature of the work with regard to the cost of the enlarged coal-bin, and also the cost of building the enlarged chimney from the heating boilers. I have accepted the contractors' figures for the chimney, and I think we are in agreement regarding quantities of cement used throughout, but in one important particular we have not been able to agree. I take the view that the change in cement proportion applies to footings, walls and sub-floors which were placed subsequent to July 11th. In the cement specification of 1 to 4, no authority can be found for interpreting this in any other way than for all concrete\u2014at least that is my view. Mr. Johns takes the view that only on walls does the specification of 1 to 4 apply, and he does not admit that the Department is entitled to any saving in the change in mix to 1 to 5 except on walls.\n\nNothing can be gained by further correspondence between the contractors and me on this feature of the work; it is now a question of a ruling as to whether my interpretation of the specification is right, or whether Mr. Johns' interpretation is right. I do not wish to make an arbitrary decision without first consulting you, so am enclosing copies of recent correspondence with the contractors on the subject for your information, and it is possible that you may wish to hear their statement of their case before issuing instructions to me in the matter.\n\nI have no wish other than to deal fairly with the contractors, with whom I have had harmonious relations throughout the work, and I think it is simply an honest difference of opinion in our respective readings of the specifications.\n\nI am withholding an overdue Certificate on extra work until I receive your ruling on this matter in which the contractors and I hold divergent views.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) H.Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nI am enclosing herewith copies of two letters; one from Mr. Gardner Smith, Inspector of Construction, R.C.School, Blood Reserve, dated January 30th, and the other from Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, contractors for the school. These letters are dealing with the subject of the cement proportion in the concrete for the school, etc.\n\nYou will note the Inspector claims that the Department should get credit for cement that was not used in the construction of the walls, footings, etc. of the building. On the other hand, the contractors claim that they were not called upon to put in cement in the proportion that Mr. Smith thinks they should have, viz:- 4 to 1. Mr. Smith is labouring under the impression that by changing the mixture from 4 to 1 to 5 - 1 in the walls and having the contractors make an allowance for not having put this 4 - 1 mixture in the footings, sufficient would have been saved to pay for the enlargement of the coal bin at the school. This is his opinion which is passed on by me to the Department. I would be glad to have your ruling in the matter, i.e.- whether the Department expected that a 4 to 1 mixture was to be used in the footings and flooring of the basement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFeb. 30, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the new Blind River Catholic School, I beg to say that the Department will expect the contractors to put in concrete of a four to one mixture for footings and walls, but consider that a six to one mixture will be satisfactory for the floors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. Wilson,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to my letter of November 30th, in connection with cut buildings for the new R.C. Indian residential School on the Blood Reserve. It has just occurred to me that the Department might wish to purchase, out of this year's appropriation, the material for the construction of these buildings, and if so I should be glad to know, as I could have them built any time after the end of next month, but the material could be delivered and charged against this year's appropriation if there is a balance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M.

I have to inform you, in reply, that this year's appropriation is completely assigned and it will not be possible to authorize any purchase of materials in this connection at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The man who they have appointed as attendant on this plant is certainly not qualified for the looking after of this equipment. We do not mean that our plant is so complicated that it needs a qualified engineer to look after it, but in this case he is a man that has never had any connection whatever or experience with gasoline engines and, therefore, not in a position to readily put right any small or minor troubles which are always cropping up with a gasoline engine. We want to see these plants giving satisfaction, and we certainly are going to give all the service possible which we can, but if the different organizations which are looking after these plants will not place a man who has had some experience in charge, they cannot expect to get results with any equipment.\"\n\nYou will notice from the contents of their letter that they state that the man in charge of the lighting plant is not competent to look after same. If this lighting plant and other mechanical equipment about the building is to be properly operated it is necessary that a man fully qualified be put in charge.\n\nI am sending a copy of the Lister Company's letter to Mr. Fount.\n\nRev.

The man referred to is not Mr. Wilson, but the engineer who has recently been engaged at the new R.C. School. When Lister's man was here and overhauled our Plant I particularly asked him for an expression of opinion regarding Mr. Wilson's qualifications and he informed me, that despite his (Mr. Wilson) lack of electrical knowledge, he was a far better man than the one engaged at the R.C. School. You will also note that the letter has reference to a \"5 and 6 K.W. plants\"; we have a six K.W., but not a three K.W. plant. The Indian agent has received a copy of the letter and he in turn agrees that the imputation is to the Roman School and not St. Paul's.

C. School for dumping outfit at new school. School not yet turned over to Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nMr. E. Gardner Smith reports from Cardston that the kitchen flue in the chimney at the R.C. School will not draw properly when the wind is in a certain quarter, that in fact the smoke will sometimes return and blow out into the rooms below, a condition which is not only extremely unpleasant, but interrupts the work of the institution.\n\nMr. Gardner Smith attributes the trouble to the proximity of the large flat-roof area where the wind blowing around this area inside of the coping walls seems to create a contrary draft.\n\nHe suggests as a remedy the raising of the chimney, and to be quite safe recommends adding six feet. He has procured a tender for raising the chimney four feet at a price of $115.00, and raising it six feet at a price of $145.00.\n\nIn view of Mr. Gardner Smith's report I would recommend that action be taken to raise the chimney, and if authority is granted competitive prices for the work would be procured.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.

Faunt Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nCARDSTON, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nRegarding your inquiries concerning the qualifications of Mr. Harvey Cline, the engineer at the above school, I would say that so far he seems to be handling the heating and lighting plants satisfactorily.\n\nI believe his principal experience has been with steam boilers rather than with electric plants. His qualifications for looking after the heating boilers, and the high pressure laundry boiler, are satisfactory to the Provincial Boiler Inspector, who was here last month, and who expressed his satisfaction in this respect.\n\nThe Lister-Bruston Power and Lighting Plant is new to the engineer, and he does not claim to be an expert on electric generating apparatus. However, he had the advantage of being here when the plant was being installed, and received instructions at first hand from Lister's mechanic. Since then he has been in full charge of the plant, and appears to be carefully following the directions he received, and so far no trouble has been experienced. He seems a very steady and careful operator, and I can see no reason why he should not be allowed to continue looking after the electric plant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction\nSir,\n\nR. C. School.\n\nWith regard to your enquiry regarding qualifications of Mr. Cline, I got in touch with Mr. Gardner Smith the building Inspector & beg to enclose his report.\n\nI myself have been in quarantine for four weeks now on account of my family having Scarlet Fever & am not able therefore to make you a report first hand.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo: Messrs.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nRe- R.C.School; Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith the account of Messrs Potts & Miller, Ltd. in connection with work additional to the contract at the R.C.School here.\n\nThe large bill for time \"Attending to Pump\" which charge for time alone comes to $93.75, was the result of the well choking with quick-sand. It took several days to test out this well, and get the quick-sand forced out, and also we lowered the well-piping and cylinder an additional 40' in order to make a nearer pull on the sand that was choking the well. I am glad to say that in the end we overcame the obstruction, and now the water comes freely, in seemingly unlimited quantity (over 1500 gals. per hour) and is now practically clear.\n\nThe bills of Bell & Morris are for additional pump rods, etc., that we ordered for lowering the cylinder. As Potts and Miller have not paid these bills, both Mr. Faunt and I thought that they are not entitled to the 10% commission ($3.95) and I have deleted it from their bill. All the other charges are in order.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward herewith and recommend for payment, the Regina vouchers as shown at the foot, for material and labour in connection with the automatic temperature control and pump at the Roman Catholic School, Blood Reserve.\n\nMessrs. Potts & Miller were subcontractors for the plumbing etc. I have also attached from Mr. B. Gardner Smith, the Inspector of Construction, his letter of explanation showing how the expense was incurred.\n\nDepartment authority was given by wire on December 11th, 1925.\n\nVoucher No. 3776 Bell & Morris, Calgary, Alta.\nInvoice dated Feb. 9th. 12.86\n\nBell & Morris, Calgary, Alta.\nInvoice dated Feb. 10th. 26.80 $39.66\n\nVoucher No. 3777 Potts & Miller, Regina, Sask.\nInvoice dated Feb. 27th. 151.75\n\nPotts & Miller, Regina, Sask.\nInvoice dated Feb. 27th. 86.08 $236.83\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 31, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to refer to your 402-11A of the 20th instant, in which you ask what the Department proposes to do with regard to stabling at the Blood Indian Residential School. I regret that there is not sufficient information on our files to intelligently decide this question. I should be pleased to learn what outbuildings you erected at this school last year and what was the expenditure in this connection. The Department is unable to determine from your vouchers what materials and what labour were for the St. Paul's School and what for the Blood, R. G. You might add to your answering letter your recommendation concerning what buildings should be erected at the Blood School. I have already your estimate of $5,000 for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 9th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to outbuildings for the new R.C. Residential School on the Blood Reserve. I note you state that you have not sufficient information on your files to enable you to intelligently decide what is to be done with regard to buildings at this institution.\n\nI would say that only one stable was built at this school. This is a horse barn and if you will refer to my letter of the 30th November last, you will see that I suggested using this building as an implement shed, owing to the distance at which it was situated from the main school building, and an implement shed had to be provided in any event. What is required in addition to this building is a cow barn to accommodate 20 head of cows, and having two calf pens and a feed compartment. This should be a building somewhat similar to the one which we erected at the St. Paul's School, or perhaps a few feet larger. A horse barn to hold ten head of horses is required, also a pigsty and a henhouse. They should also have a shed to house wagons, binders and other large implements in addition to the building above mentioned.\n\nI may say\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI may say that in mentioning an amount of $5000.00 for these buildings I did not figure on a pigsty, nor on the stanchions for the cow barn, which latter item will cost in the neighborhood of $500.00. I think, however, that $6000.00 will provide everything that is required there in the way of buildings.\n\nMy reason for bringing this matter to your attention at this time is that Mr. Henry George, who has done all our work as Foreman for the last two years is now at the R.C. School putting in shelving, etc., and he would be ready to go right ahead with the outbuildings while he is there. We should buy the lumber in carload lots, and this will have to be ordered some little time ahead. This, of course, is the most economical way to build, as it eliminates contractors profits.\n\nKindly advise me as soon as possible so that we can go ahead with this work at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Messrs.

You will observe I have included the 10% hold-back maintained throughout the job.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, a complete Statement of the entire work, including all extras, and am also including invoices, vouchers and time-sheets which have been rendered to me by the contractors. For some of the minor items of extras, the contractors stated that they were unable to furnish time-sheets as the work so overlapped with other work, but in all cases where time-sheets are missing, I have checked up the charges closely, and the amounts charged are not excessive.\n\nMuch the largest extra work done on a percentage basis is the Sewage Disposal Works, and I am sending complete time-sheets and invoices for this.\n\nI think the accounts I am sending you are sufficiently vouched, but if there are any items on which you desire further information, I shall be pleased to give further particulars at your request.\n\nThe contract has, on the whole, been well performed, and I think the Department has received good value for the amount expended. I am told by the contractors that it has not been a profitable contract for them.\n\nI have had communications from both the Indian Dep't and the Dep't of Labour with reference to a workman's complaint that he had been underpaid. Under these circumstances would it not be advisable to retain a certain sum from the final Certificate in case the contractors' explanations are not acceptable to the Gov't? It is possible that other workmen are awaiting the outcome of the investigation.

Smith Bros. & Wilson, Regina.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPro Manager.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. E. Gardner Smith with reference to the tar and gravel roof of the new R. C. School. He reports that a slight leakage was noticed on the 30th of March, which, on investigation, was found to be a result of the buckling of the roof in one or two places, allowing the water from melting snow to find its way through into the dormitory below. Mr. Gardner Smith arranged with Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson to have the roof repaired and although they did this and to the satisfaction of the Inspector, they insisted that the damage was caused through no fault of their's.\n\nThis buckling Mr. Gardner Smith attributes to the effect of the wind, which in that locality blows with extreme force and often for days at a time, causing a suction which tends to draw and buckle the roofing thus causing it to crack where the buckling takes place through which water finds its way. He suggests as a remedy against a recurrence of the trouble, which under present conditions he claims is inevitable, the following treatment:\n\nSweep off loose gravel into piles, then make a heavy pouring (not just a swabbing) of hot pitch. While the pitch is hot, spread a heavy covering of fine and coarse gravel. The pitch must be of sufficient depth to make a bed into which a large quantity of stone can sink and become embedded. In this way the necessary weight can be secured to hold the roofing down and prevent the action of the wind.\n\nIf the Department wish to give consideration to the suggestion of Mr. E. Gardner Smith and will so advise me, I will direct him to procure prices for the work indicated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Commissioner\nMay 19, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th I would ask you to please submit to the Department a price for adding extra weight to the roof of the new Blood River Catholic School, as suggested by Mr. E.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nRe- R.C.School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI enclose herewith an a/c for $97.30 rendered by\nR.A.Lister & Co. (Canada) Ltd. and I must confess I am\nsomewhat puzzled to know what to do about it.\n\nWhen the Lister plant arrived at the Cardston\nStation, towards the end of the school contract, there was\nnobody to take delivery of it. The general contractors'\nlocal Supt. Mr. Turton, would have nothing to do with it,\nseemingly feeling aggrieved because his firm were not\ninstalling it. I therefore wired the Lister Co. telling them\nthe plant had arrived at the station. That is as far as my\nresponsibility went.\n\nI received a reply stating that their man would start\nshortly to set up the plant. I told Mr. Turton of it, and\nhe made no objections to the man coming then. However, when\nLister's man did arrive he stated that he would require five\nfull days in order to install the plant, and that the\ntemporary pumping plant would have to be dismantled and\nno water could be pumped during the interval. Mr. Turton\ninsisted that he could not do without water for so long a\ntime, and in consequence Lister's man was not permitted to\ndo his work then, but had to make a second trip when it suited\nMr. Turton to have him come. The accompanying bill for $97.30\nis Lister's charge for their man's first trip.\n\nNot knowing just what disposition should be made\nof this account, I thought I had best write you a letter of\nexplanation, and send you the account, to be dealt with as you\nthink right.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E. Gardner Smith,\nInspector of Construction.\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LIMITED.\n\nRegina, Sask, May 3rd, 1926.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nC I T Y.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe R. C. School, Blood Reserve.\n\nWith reference to your enquiry from us for the reasons for a charge made by Lister & Co. for extra travelling expenses to install pumping plant at the above school, would say we have made enquiries from the Superintendent we had on the job, Mr. A. Turton. He informs us your Inspector, Mr. Gardner Smith, told him the plant had arrived and he had wired Lister & Co., to that effect, and also to send a man along to install same. At the time Mr. Smith told Mr. Turton this, the man was supposed to be on his way to Dardiston. At that time, neither Mr. Smith nor Mr. Turton had any plan or information as to where this particular part of the plant was to be installed.\n\nOn the arrival of the man, it was found that he would have to install his machinery right where our pump was situated, which would mean our pump would have to be disconnected, and no water would be available for about five days. As we were right in the midst of laying concrete floors, it would have meant our shutting down the work and releasing the labor for that number of days. This, of course, was not to be expected from us, consequently the man went back right away and did not come again until he was notified there was nothing to interrupt him proceeding with his installation.\n\nOf course, you fully understand we had nothing whatever to do with the supplying or installing of the plant furnished by Lister & Co., this not being in our contract. We have questioned Mr. Turton very carefully and there is no doubt in our mind as to the truthfulness of his statement. Therefore we cannot accept any liability for any expenses in connection with this account, it being perfectly clear to us that Lister & Co. acted entirely on the instructions from your representative on the job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nPer.(Sgd) D.D. Smith,\nVice-President.\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo in regard to the account for $97.30 rendered by R. A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Limited, I enclose a copy of a letter received from Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson Limited, contractors.\n\nIf you have any further comments to make with reference to the subject of this account of Lister & Company I shall be glad if you will write me. I may say of course, that I am in sympathy with the contractors in objecting to their pump being dismantled and disconnected at a time when they required water service, and it seems to me that there was a lack of foresight in not previously ascertaining what space was available for the plant which Lister and Company were to install, before they sent their expert to make the installation. However, I think I should have a further report from you before submitting the account to Ottawa, as it is one which the Department will, no doubt, demur at paying, if it could have been avoided by making mutually satisfactory arrangements before the Lister Company man arrived on the ground.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd)\n\nW.

It will only take the matter of 24 hours for the concrete to settle hard enough for to put the bases for the plants down and then the work can go on in the usual manner on installing the plants. Once the work of installing is finished the concrete will be hard enough for the plants to operate.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nwe are,\n\nYours very truly,\nR.A.

School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., with letter enclosed from Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, Ltd., contractors, on the subject of responsibility for Lister's charge of \u00a397.50.\n\nThe contractor's statement is inaccurate in saying that, in my wire to Listers telling them their plant had arrived, I had asked them to send their man. I merely notified them of the arrival of their plant at the station, and my reason for doing so was because the contractors' superintendent would have nothing to do with it as his firm were not installing the electric plant, and because storage charges were mounting up. I enclose a copy of my telegram to Listers.\n\nI enclose letters received from Listers, in which they acknowledge the plan of the machinery room which I had sent them. In this letter (Nov. 26th) 24 hours was mentioned as the time it would take to set their engine bases, and Mr. Turton was prepared to shut down for the 24 hours mentioned, but thought power for the pump would then be available from one of the Lister engines. Lister's expert did not arrive until eight days after I sent the telegram, and there was ample time for Mr. Turton to stop him from coming had he thought it necessary.\n\nLister's man arrived on the 16th December, and then we were informed for the first time that he would require five full days to set up his plant, and that the temporary pumping plant would be in his way and would have to come down. Mr. Turton could not do without water for so long a time, and in consequence Lister's man had to make a second trip.\n\nMy responsibility was just in the matter of sending the telegram, and that was simply an act of courtesy. Mr. Turton would undoubtedly have stopped Lister's man from coming so soon had he not gathered from Lister's letter (which I had shown him) that there would only be 24 hours' interruption to the pumping service, but he could not agree to shutting down for five days.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E. Gardner Smith,\nInspector of Construction.\nDear Sirs:-\n\nI have had referred to me, your account No. 9631 dated the 15th of March, covering the expenditures incurred by your representative when setting up the plant purchased from you, at the R.C. Residential School on the Blood Reserve, Alta., amounting to $97.30. In forwarding this, Mr. E. Gardner Smith, the representative of the Department, states that he notified your firm by telegram that the plant had arrived at destination, the receipt of which you acknowledged stating that a man was leaving at once to look after the installation. Your expert, however, did not arrive until eight days after the receipt by you of this telegram. Prior to this, on the 26th of November 1925, you advised Mr. Gardner Smith that you had received a copy of the proposed layout of the engine room and that 24 hours would be sufficient for the concrete bed to settle hard enough to put down the bases for the plant which seemed to indicate that any interruption, if such were necessary, of the water supply which the General Contractors were making use of, would be but brief. I understand, however, that when your man arrived, he stated that he would require five full days to install the plant and that the temporary pumping plant would have to be dismantled. This, of course, precluded the use of water by the General Contractors for a period of time which would have seriously inconvenienced them and they objected to the inconvenience. Your man, therefore, withdrew but returned later, and I understand that the account to which I have referred, covers the expenses he incurred on the occasion of his second visit.\n\nI should be glad if you could offer me a reason why, in view of the resulting circumstances, arrangements could not have been made to prepare the Government's Inspector and the General Contractors for any inconvenience which would have resulted during the installation of the plant. Arrangements, I think, could have been made by letter which would have obviated this.\n\nMessrs. R.A. Lister & Co.

If your floor is 6\" or more this will be quite satisfactory. It will not be necessary for to place any foundation bolts on as the fasten down bolts will be leaded in by our mechanic.\n\nWe note that you are at a loss to know how the work can be done satisfactory within a setting plan and might say that all that is necessary will be to lay a concrete portion for the plants to set on in the proper location. When our man arrives he will then run his piping while the concrete is setting ready to put the plants in. 24 hours will be sufficient for the concrete to harden enough to place the base only of the plants in, once he has his pipe layed the concrete can all be done and the pipes will then be buried in the concrete instead of showing over the top of the floor. We are awaiting on word from Mr. Wylie to send a man forward or if you will send us a wire that the plants are there we will have a man go forward at once.

A few words might be in order in explaining this whole situation as we do not think you have had the proper information.\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of the letter which we wrote to Mr. E. Gardner Smith on December 4th, 1925 which was in reply to letter from him asking about the floor for the plant. You will notice in the last paragraph of the letter we said we were waiting on word from Mr. Wylie to tell us to send a man forward or if Mr. Smith would send us a wire that the plants were there ready, we would have a man go forward at once. He sent us a wire, a copy of which we are enclosing, on December 6th, stating \"Your power and Lighting Plant arrived Cardston Station on fourth\" from which we could not do otherwise than interpret that everything was ready for installation. When our man arrived at Cardston there was a gas engine and pumping equipment in the engine room used for supplying water to the general contractor. This equipment was directly in the road where the plants were to be set and when our man intimated that they would have to be removed the general contractor's foreman would not here of it at all, he actually refused to have any interruption at this point. Our man therefore could not do otherwise than withdraw from the job owing to the buildings not being ready for the installation. While our man was there he availed himself of the opportunity of going over the other plants on the reserve and looking them over and then returned to Winnipeg.\nUnder the circumstances we feel it is only fair that this expense should be paid for and would appreciate an expression of your views on same.\n\nYours very truly,\nR.A.

Gardner Smith did not take the proper precautions to see that everything was in readiness for the representative of the R.A. Lister Co. to install the plant. The latter had indicated by a plan, the site that would be occupied by the plant which they were to install and as a temporary pump had been installed on this site by the General Contractors for the purpose of maintaining a water supply, I am of the opinion that Mr. Gardner Smith should have taken cognizance of this and discussed with the Contractors when they could dispense with this temporary pumping plant. Definite arrangements could then have been made with the R.A. Lister Co., and a time set when their man could do the work required of him without interruption. What actually transpired, the correspondence will show and I think that the R.A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Ltd., are entitled to payment but that the extra expenditure would not have been necessary had Mr. Gardner Smith exercised proper foresight.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Flett, storage tank $7.00\n\nThe expenditure in reference to the storage tank was incurred under the advice of the Lister company, who explained that the Delco pumping system for the laundry would not be feasible for working in connection with their automatic plant unless provided with a storage tank, the provision of which would allow the drawing of soft water in small quantities without unnecessarily taxing both the pump and the automatic plant. Mr. Gardner Smith pointed this out to me and after consultation with the Lister company's expert, I authorized the purchase of the tank. The quotation he gave me was $80.00 but he now explains that this was to include certain connections which, however, were made by the plumbing sub-contractors which has proportionately reduced the original estimated cost to the amount now represented by the voucher in question.\n\nI also enclose Blood Agency voucher No. 8659, together with the freight receipts recorded thereon, representing work performed by the Alberta Battery Co.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have received through Inspector M. Christianson, a requisition from the Principal of the R.C. School on the Blood Reserve, to be provided with the undermentioned articles:\n\n1 laundry stove\n2 bag trucks\n1 cultivator\n1 disc\n1 wagon box\n2 typewriters\n26 toilet paper racks\nBattleship Linoleum to cover kitchen floor 28' x 19' and scullery floor 9' x 18'.\n\nI am prepared to recommend the purchase of one laundry stove and one bag truck; the purchase of a cultivator can, I think, be deferred until next year.\n\nMr. T. Faunt reported last September that the School has disc harrows which are in fairly good condition; a disc may be needed but I must make further enquiries. A wagon complete with box etc., has already been purchased and I do not think another wagon box should be needed. I cannot recommend the purchase of typewriters, other schools are not provided with them and I do not think we should create a precedent. Both the kitchen and scullery floors are of concrete and I can see no necessity why they should be covered and I therefore cannot recommend the purchase of Battleship Linoleum. If the Department wish to supply toilet paper racks, these can be bought but they should be of the simplest type.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

School; Blood Reserve.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith invoices in triplicate from Mr. F.W. Flett for work and materials supplied at the above school.\n\nThe Invoice for $15.00 is for making and installing two gal. iron covers for the cooling tanks of the Lister power and lighting plant. These tanks come open, without tops, and when the engine has run for a time, the tanks discharge steam into the room, which dampens everything within reach. To overcome this, the covers were made, and connected to a vent which discharges the steam outside of the building.\n\nThe Invoice for $17.30 is for placing new leather cup-washers in the working barrel of the pump cylinder. Owing to so much sand coming at first with the water, the original leathers were soon destroyed, and only a small quantity of water could be raised, but after providing the new leathers the trouble was overcome. The water is now coming fairly clear, and I do not anticipate much more damage from sand in the water. The original leathers were worn out before the School was occupied.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd) E. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction\n\nW. M.

Gardner Smith that he has received an Estimate from Mr. F.W. Flett, Cardston of $1200.00 to re-coat the gravel and pitch roof of the new Blood R.C.School. Mr. Gardner Smith in submitting the quotation states as follows,-\n\n\"At first glance this seems a high price, but there are 118.07 squares to this roof, and there should be about 80 lbs. of pitch applied per square, which would call for about 5 tons of pitch. Also there would be several yards of screened gravel in addition to the gravel at present on the roof. The price quoted works out at about $10.00 per square for labour and materials. Mr. Flett is the only competent roofer I know of in the Cardston district. Roofing work of this kind should be done during the warm summer months, and before the heavy fall winds return. Mr. Flett has tar kettles, and other equipment, and is an experienced roofer.\"\n\nI shall be glad, in due course, to receive the Department's instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It does not vary very much from your specification excepting that it is Douglas Fir instead of Redwood.\n\nOur price for this complete installation is the sum of Five Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty-five Dollars ($5655.00).

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending/a request concerning the steam boiler supplied us by the Indian Department for our laundry machineries which is very much too small. It does not hold any reserve of steam with the result that the Engineer cannot leave it more than five minutes without danger and also it has not the power required to run all the machineries at the same time. Mr. Christianson, and Gardner Smith when here a little over a week ago suggested to me to apply for another boiler at least twice the size of the one we have, stating that ours could be used in any one of the new Schools actually in construction on Peigan Reserve, and directed me to take this matter with you before it would be too late.\n\nHoping Dear Sir that this request will meet with your approval.\n\nI remain Sincerely yours,\n\nE.

Ruaux, O.M.I.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., OCTOBER 16TH, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose for your information, a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the St. Mary's R.C. Residential School on the Blood Reserve, with reference to the inadequacy of the steam boiler at present in use at the school. I shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOct. 25, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant enclosing a letter from the Rev. Principal of the St. Mary's R.C. School on the Blood Reserve, I beg to say that the steam boiler installed for use in connection with the laundry machinery in this building is size specified and recommended by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., the firm manufacturing the laundry machinery, and as this boiler is only intended to supply live steam for the purpose of sterilizing the clothes while in the washer, and for heating the drying tumbler, it should be large enough to meet these requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegim., Sask.\nSir:\n\nEarlier in the month the Indian Agent at the Blood wrote me, after consultation with the Principal of the St. Mary's R.C. School, asking for authority to lay a water line to the horse barn and water trough at the St. Mary's R.C. School, stating that the cost of the work including both material and labour, would be about $287.00, but that if the School did the trenching the cost of material and laying would be about $110.00.\n\nAs Inspector M. Christianson was proceeding to the reserve, he was requested to look into the situation and advise me whether such an expenditure was necessary. I have just heard from him stating that it is and asking for authority to proceed with the work. As digging should commence before the ground is frozen I shall be glad if the Department will telegraph me whether the expenditure may be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.M.

School; Blood Reserve.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., in which you mention that the Department requires a written explanation from me regarding Mr. F.W. Flett's account of $67.80 for the installing of a Flat Work Ironer last May at the above school.\n\nIn looking over my file I do not see any authority from the Department to me in this regard, and I presume the order to Mr. Flett came from the former Indian Agent, Mr. Faunt.\n\nThis Ironer was purchased by the Department after the completion of the building contract, and as Mr. Flett was the only man obtainable locally, competent to do steam fitting, he was the logical man to engage. I saw the machine in operation after Mr. Flett had finished his work, and it was working well.\n\nWhen at your Agency some time ago I went over Mr. Flett's bill, and found his charges in order. As the heating at this school is a Dunham system, Mr. Flett installed a Dunham trap, for which he charged $32.50. This was required for air elimination and equalization, and is the principal item on his bill. The other fittings charged are what are ordinarily required for connection to the high pressure steam boiler, and his charge for labour is not excessive.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMay 10 To connecting up Iremer in Laundry.\n\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Dunham Bucket Trap                | 1        | $32.50     | $32.50      |\n| 1/2\" galv. ells                   | 7        | $1.75      | $12.25      |\n| Nipples                           | 8        | $1.20      | $9.60       |\n| Unions                            | 2        | $1.00      | $2.00       |\n| Tee                               | 1        | $0.30      | $0.30       |\n| Plug                              | 1        | $0.05      | $0.05       |\n| Gate valve                        | 1        | $2.00      | $2.00       |\n| 3/4\" ells                         | 3        | $0.75      | $2.25       |\n| Nipples                           | 2        | $0.30      | $0.60       |\n| Union                             | 1        | $0.40      | $0.40       |\n| 13 1/2 ft. 3/4\" B pipe           | 15       | $2.02      | $30.30      |\n| 10 ft. 1/2\" Galv. pipe            | 15       | $1.50      | $22.50      |\n| Hanger iron                       | 4        | $0.50      | $2.00       |\n| Air cell pipe covering 3/4\"       | 12 ft.   | $3.12      | $37.44      |\n| Air cell pipe covering 1/2\"       | 9 ft.    | $2.16      | $19.44      |\n| Asbestos                          | 5 lbs    | $0.25      | $1.25       |\n| Labor 9 hrs.                      |          | $11.25     |             |\n| Certified correct Charges         |          | $67.80     |             |\n\nTotal: $56.27\n\nCertified correct Charges fair and just.

Indian Residential School, the matter of fire escapes at that institution and they appear to be concerned because there is no direct access to the fire escapes from the girls' and boys' dormitories and that in case of fire, they would have to pass at the heads of the main staircases and argue that if there was a fire in the vicinity of the staircases, the children would not be able to get out that way. As a remedy, they suggest that a fire escape be placed in both the dormitories, the exit to which will be through the window of the staff room.\n\nI do not see that the objections are well taken or that there is any necessity for the placing of fire escapes as suggested. The staircases in this school are of steel construction and, therefore, are fireproof, and if the children are properly drilled and taught what to do in case of a fire, the existing fire escapes are, in my opinion, sufficient. I should like, however, to receive an expression of opinion from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDec. 20, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the fire escape at the St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve, I agree that it is unnecessary to place additional fire escapes on this building. You are quite right in your statement that the stair cases are of fire proof construction. However, I think it would be advisable to place doors at the top of the stair case on the dormitory floor, in order to prevent smoke from entering the passage through which the pupils have to pass in order to reach the fire escape, as you know there are a lot of mishaps from fire gas to the dense amount of smoke.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the question of fire protection at the St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve. I note your suggestion to place doors at the top of the stair cases on the dormitory floor in order to prevent smoke from entering the passage through which the pupils would have to pass in order to reach the fire escapes. If you wish this change made, I will arrange for it, but it has occurred to me that these might take up too much space and darken the passage.\n\nPlease advise me further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nTo the suggestion contained in Department letter of the 20th of December last, to place doors at the top of the staircase on the dormitory floor of St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve, I replied on the 27th idem, pointing out certain objections, but do not appear to have received any answer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFeb. 7, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st ultimo, with further reference to the placing of doors at the top of the stair case in the St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve, I beg to say that these doors should be provided as instructed in my letter of the 20th of December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing, Ass't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Department No. 103-2-5 of the 7th instant, I have ascertained that the condition at St. Mary's School is the same on the girls' as on the boys' side and, therefore, doors should be placed at the top of both stair cases. This the Agent has ascertained will involve an expenditure of $215.00 and if this is agreeable to the Department, please advise me and I will have the work proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Flett, Esq., Cardston, Alta., for repairing frozen steam pipes to water tank at St. Mary's R.C. School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated Emergent expenditure arising out of the freezing of the steam pipes mentioned. (This accident has also happened at St. Paul's School)\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, May 6, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nIn your estimates for the current fiscal year you included a hogpen at an estimated cost of $855, and an implement shed ($750) for the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School. Items were placed in the Estimates in this connection, and I have now to authorise you to arrange for the erection. Please be guided by general instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 6th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRoman Catholic Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta, June 3rd, 1929.\n\nHonorable D.C. Scott, Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nIn my Estimates for this year 1929, I made application for the building of a separate residence, which would be the home of the school teacher who intends to get married in July or August. No accommodation for married couples exists in the School, which makes it very inconvenient and oblige us to employ only single men. Mr. Coady has been teaching for two years and is giving me and the Department full satisfaction and I would like very much to keep him. The reason of this letter is for me to know if the residence has been granted and is going to be build this Summer; I address it to you directly for this information, as Mr. Coady makes it a point for staying at the School or looking for another position.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nE. Riaux, O.M.I., Principal\nOttawa, June 29, 1914\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nJune 8, 1929.\n\nDear Father Ruaux:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to a separate residence for a school teacher at the Blood Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that there is no appropriation for this building. Could you not satisfy Mr. Coady by letting him have two of the staff rooms?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. E. Ruaux, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston,\nAlta.\nRoman Catholic Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta, June 12th, 1928\n\nHonorable D.C. Scott, Deputy Minister,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th inst. stating that no provision has been made for a separate residence for the School Teacher at the Blood Indian School. I cannot help expressing my disappointment. I had mentioned the matter to you about a year ago, when we met at St. Albert, and considering the fact that it is so difficult to secure a man that will take a real interest in the Indians, Mr. Coady will not accept to live in the School, and in fact it would be very inconvenient for him and for the rest of the Staff. I am informed that appropriation has been voted to build a pig sty and an implement shed for our School this Summer. Could it not be possible to have a residence erected in the place of these other buildings, which would wait for another year. The house may be a little more expensive, but the Department could stand the difference; otherwise, I would be obliged myself to build a separate residence, although my means are very inadequate. Hoping that you will take this matter into consideration, I remain Honorable Sir.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nE. Riaux, O.M.T. Principal\nOttawa, June 19, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to a separate residence for a school teacher at the Blood Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham has already been authorized to erect a hogpen and an implement shed, and the Department proposes to proceed with the work. I regret there are no funds for the residence you request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. E. Buann, O. M.

I do not know if there has been any correspondence with the Department about this or not, but the latest information I have is that Father Ruaux is building a house and in all probability he will ask the Department to pay for it. I do not approve of this plan, as I think we should have control over the buildings that are put up. I am told that the Rev. Father made application for this house and was told that there was nothing in the Estimates to provide for it.\nM. Blood R.C.

Limited, Calgary Alta., for Remains for Blood R.C. School lighting plant engine.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. Antimata dated 1929-1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nOttawa, November 8th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe medical officer, in a report on his recent inspection of the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School, states that the pupils do not get a sufficient supply of butter and milk. As you are aware, milk is an important article of diet, especially for the younger pupils, and the Department has requested you to see that as generous a supply of milk as possible is furnished each day for the pupils' use. It is also important that butter be provided, if possible, at each meal.\n\nThe medical officer states that the boys' lavatory is not in a very sanitary condition. The floors are wet with seeping down from some of the closets and there is a foul odor in the adjacent playroom. I have to request you to give this matter your attention and take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and have the boys' lavatory placed in a sanitary condition.\n\nA copy of this communication is being forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. E. Busby, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:-\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. J. E. Pugh, Indian Agent at the Blood Agency, drawing attention to the necessity of having some repairs effected to the steam pipes which lead to the outside water tank at the St. Paul's School. Last February some temporary repairs to the frozen pipes were undertaken, and the amount involved was covered by Agency Voucher No. 9737, forwarded to the Department on the 21st March. The Agent explains that it will be necessary to take off most of the insulation and replace several lengths of pipe which were temporarily welded last winter, and while he states it is not possible to obtain an estimate on the work until the insulation is removed, he expresses the opinion that the cost may be in the neighborhood of $250.00. I shall be glad if the Department will give the necessary authority to have the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOct. 11, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the repairs required to the steam pipes leading to the water tank at the St. Paul's School, I beg to say that the Department approves of having this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Maclean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\nSir:\n\nOn the 11th October last the department gave authority to repair steam pipes leading to the water tank at the St. Paul's School. I passed this authority on to the Agent who now informs me that he was in error in making a request to incur this expenditure at the St. Paul's School, as he should have referred to the St. Mary's School. I have no doubt, therefore, that the authority can be transferred, and I am instructing the Agent to carry out the repairs at the latter institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nAuthority is requested to purchase four door linings for the Pascal boiler at the St. Mary's R.C. school on the Blood Reserve. These are sold by weight and I have no information as to the probable cost, but it would not be excessive. If the Department will authorize the purchase, I will instruct the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A R.C. of the 30th ultimo, requesting authority to purchase four door linings for the Pascal boiler at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of the door linings required for the use of the boilers at the above school. A certified account, in duplicate, covering the expenditure should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nBar:-\n\nThe Inspector reports that two inside doors are required in the boys' playroom at the R. C. Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve. The door leading out of the playroom faces west and the bottom is on ground level or between 4 and 5 feet above the basement floor. This makes a continual draught in the room and is unhealthy for the boys. The Inspector states that the cost of putting inside doors at the bottom of the stairs would not be great, but the services of a carpenter would be required. Kindly advise me if authority may be granted to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A R.C. of the 9th instant, relative to the inspector's report that two inside doors are required in the boys' playroom at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have these doors installed, engaging the services of a carpenter to do the work. Please keep all costs as low as possible, forwarding a certified account in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK. December 6th, 1929.\n\nInspector Christianson's report on schools in Blood Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that on my recent inspection of the Blood Agency I also visited the two boarding schools on the reserve.\n\nST. MARY'S R. C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe number of children in residence was 108 and 3 were absent, which makes a total of 111. The Principal stated there were about 15 children on the reserve of school age who had not been entered on the roll yet as the parents refused to bring them in. Ways and means of bringing these children in were discussed with the Principal, and the Agent intends to take steps to see that they are placed in the school so as to begin in the January quarter. I also spent a little time in each classroom and found that the grades taught were from 1 to 7.\n\nI wish to state that I was well impressed with the senior teacher, Mr. Cote. From all reports he is an excellent teacher and has a fine influence over the boys.\n\nThe school throughout was spotlessly clean and well kept. The same applies to the outside buildings. The buildings, furniture, and machinery are all receiving the best of care and attention.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nST. MARY'S R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nLast fall the Principal built a new house for Mr. Cote, the teacher, at a cost of approximately $4,000.00, and he expects to be re-imbursed by the Department. Therefore, this amount was placed in the Estimates.\n\nIt was also brought to my attention that water was continually draining into the sub-basement. This is used as a storehouse for fruit, canned goods, etc., but is below the basement proper and cannot be drained into the sewer. The existing condition is not very good as there is a smell from the stagnant water. The basement is continually being pumped out, but it is always damp. It will be a difficult undertaking to drain the basement as the drain would have to run out to the coulee, which is a considerable distance from the school, and levels etc. would have to be taken.\n\nThere is also the matter of doors in the playroom which I will take up in a special letter.\n\nThis school had a very good crop last summer - 3,000 bus. of wheat, 2,500 bus. of oats, 860 bus. of barley, 600 bus. of potatoes, and a lot of other vegetables. They have a nice herd of cattle, raise pigs, and also keep a lot of chickens. The school now supply their own requirements in the way of beef and pork. From 16 to 20 cows are milked, and the children are receiving all the milk they require. Eleven hundred pounds of butter were packed during the summer for the use of the children this winter.\n\nThe children looked well and were well clothed, and I am pleased to be able to report that,\n\nas far as\nST. MARY'S R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nas far as the health of the children is concerned, they look 100% better than they did two years ago.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Dec. 11th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the two Indian Boarding Schools in the Blood Agency which were recently visited by Inspector Christianson.\n\nYou will note that the Principal of the R.C. School informed the Inspector that there were about 15 children of the Catholic faith and of school age on the reserve who were not attending school. This matter was discussed and the Agent will see that these children are brought in the first of the year. The building is reported to be clean and in first-class shape. Something should be done next summer to remedy the difficulty which is experienced with water draining into the basement. You will note that the school had a good crop, which will help out with the finances.\n\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School is apparently in good shape. There are also 15 or 20 children of school age on the reserve who should be in attendance at this school. The interior of the building is reported to be in good shape. They appear to have an ample supply of milk and for this I think the Principal should be commended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files,\n(SO-10, Volume 6543, File 720-5, part 3)\nOttawa, December 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your 402-11 of the 11th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on his inspection of the two residential schools on the Blood Reserve. The Department is pleased to note that the general conditions at both these schools are satisfactory.\n\nRelative to the Indian children of school age on the Reserve who are not attending school, the Agent should take the necessary steps to see that all these children are placed in a residential school of the faith to which they belong provided there is accommodation for them. He should take this matter up with the parents and, if they refuse to send their children, steps might be taken under Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nRe St Mary's Ind.Res.School, Cardston.\n\nI beg to refer to your letter No 103-2-5, dated June the 8th 1929, and the reply of Rev.Father E.Ruax, Principal, dated June the 12th 1929. This is in connection with the erection of a cottage for a married teacher. And as the matter at the time was considered very urgent and in the interests of the School, Rev. Father Ruax proceeded with the building last Fall.\n\nNow I take the liberty of submitting this matter again to your consideration, with the object of obtaining a refund of the moneys invested in that building. Although I acknowledge that this was done without your formal approval, nevertheless this question was thoroughly examined and discussed by us, and for the best interests of the School and the Department it was conceded that the cottage should be erected.\n\nThe teacher, Mr.Coady, had been teaching at St Mary's School for three years and a half, and during that period had given entire satisfaction to the pupils, to the Indian parents, to the Agent and to the Inspectors. You will agree with me how difficult it is to secure and keep, for a number of years, a real competent teacher on an Indian Reserve. Mr.Coady, about to be married, would not remain on the staff unless he were given convenient quarters, and rooms for him and his wife could not conveniently be set apart in the School building.\n\nI understand that a cottage, costing $4500.00, had been built by the Department at St Paul's School, Cardston, for the Farm Instructor whose wife is also a teacher.\n\nRev.Father Ruax, the Principal, before undertaking the construction of this cottage for the teacher, submitted the whole matter to Mr.Pugh, the Indian Agent, making him acquainted with all the details of the contract and the cost. Naturally the Indian Agent could not authorize the undertaking, as this belongs entirely to jurisdiction of your Department. Nevertheless Mr.Pugh, residing near the School, was in a position to ascertain the nature of the construction and can now warrant that there was no extravagance and\nthat we got full value for the $3799.00 spent on this cottage.\n\nI herewith forward copy of the Contract and all the receipted Invoices of work and material paid on this cottage, so that your Department may satisfy itself how the expenses were incurred. I understand that Inspector Mr. Christianson is also well acquainted with the facts and is in a position to report on same.\n\nMoreover, Honorable Sir, you are aware that when the Oblate Fathers took over the management of the new Schools both at the Bloods and the Piegan they were faced with very serious sacrifices regarding the finances. We realize that we are to cooperate with the Department in the respective Indian Institutions. But in the present instance we feel that we should not be called upon to bear this heavy disbursement for an important and necessary improvement at the St Mary's School. It is true that in this particular case we have proceeded without your formal approval, but we had concluded that your authorisation was only delayed and postponed for the time being.\n\nWe are fully convinced that you will now favorably take up this matter and see your way to refund to the Oblate Fathers the sum of $3799.00, which we have expended on a cottage which is a credit to the Department and to the School.\n\nTherefore I hope that you will succeed even to include this item of expenditure for the present Fiscal year 1929-1930.\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nApril 2, 1930.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the cottage for a married teacher at the Blood Indian Residential School. When Father Rusur requested this building, I was unable to give favourable consideration. I note that he proceeded with its erection last fall and that you are now seeking reimbursement.\n\nBefore funds are available for improvements, it is necessary to have the items included in our Estimates, and I regret that no provision has been made to satisfy your request. The Department can hardly be expected to provide funds for buildings at these schools when we have no control over their erection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nHonorable Duncan C. Scott,\nIndian Superintendent General.\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April the 2nd with reference to the cottage for a married teacher at the Blood Indian Residential School. I understand perfectly well that the item should have been previously included in your Estimates and the customary authorisation should have been obtained.\n\nIf the erection of this cottage was nevertheless proceeded with, it was not in any spirit of contravention with the rules of the Department; but as I stated in my letter we were prompted only by the conviction that it was for the greater interest of the pupils under very pressing conditions.\n\nAlthough you had no direct control over the erection of this cottage, I have no doubt that you can see by the documents I sent that great care was taken by the Principal as regards plans, specifications and estimate; and also copies of all invoices were secured. The Indian Agent of the Blood Reserve is certainly in a position to ascertain that the building is worth every cent of the amount paid for it.\n\nTherefore, Honorable Sir, I beg of you to reconsider this matter, and if reimbursement cannot be made through the past fiscal year's grant or Supplementary Estimates, I wish you would be kind enough to include the amount in your Estimates for 1930-1931.\n\nHoping, Honorable Sir, that you will yet see your way to give me a favorable reply, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nOttawa, April 16, 1930.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 8th instant, concerning the cottage for a married teacher of the Blood Indian Residential School. I have to state, in reply, that the question of reimbursement is receiving consideration and that a note has been made for a future estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langelois, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, May 6, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 408-4A of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the opportunity to secure power for our buildings on the Blood Reserve. As far as the Department is aware at the present time, no other buildings require an electric lighting plant, and, as there are no funds this fiscal year for the purpose of effecting the changes, no action need be taken now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

I wrote and told the Reverend Father last spring that there were no funds for this purpose, and I am now in receipt of a letter from him making an appeal to be allowed to put this power in himself from his own funds at once if the Department will later refund the amount paid. Personally, I think it is too bad when the power line runs so close to the school that we cannot make use of it. I shall be glad to receive the sanction of the Department allowing the Reverend Father to install the lighting from his own funds. When the Department has funds available to pay for the cost of this, I shall be glad also to have the power installed at the Agency. This would cost about $700.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection made last week at the St. Mary's Roman Catholic School on the Blood Reserve. I might say that I did not inspect the class rooms, as I intend to leave as much of the inside work as I possibly can for the winter months.\n\nI went through the building, and around the grounds, and went into the general management of the institution. This school has gone into farming and cattle-raising quite extensively. At the present time the following acreage is under cultivation: Wheat - 200 acres; Oats - 65 acres; barley - 60 acres; green feed - 40 acres; potatoes 6 acres; garden - 4 acres; and they are summerfallowing about 120 acres, making a total of approximately 500 acres. The crop looked exceptionally well, and no doubt the work on the land is being well performed, as Brother Tom, the Farming Instructor, is an excellent farmer. It will therefore be seen that that part of the work is being properly attended to.\n\nThe school owns 205 head of cattle, and 25 head of work horses. The average number of cows milked during the year,...\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nduring the year is from 15 to 20. They also keep 400 chickens and between 70 and 100 pigs. All the hams and bacon required for the school are cured on the premises. No cream, butter or eggs are sold, but are used at the school, and all the beef required is slaughtered at the school. Thirty head of cattle were put through the slaughter house last year. The children are obviously very well fed, and with the splendid garden, they receive a great variety of food as well.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 136 children in residence and only one pupil to be discharged during the holidays. There are, however, quite a few to be discharged during the coming winter.\n\nThe staff at the school consists of 15 sisters, a Principal, Assistant Principal, one male teacher, an engineer, farming instructor, and two labourers, or a staff of 22 in all. There are three class rooms in the school, one being taught by Mr. Cote, who has been there for a number of years, and the other two by the sisters. I might say that I was in the senior boys' room, which is taught by Mr. Cote, who, I consider, is a very competent teacher and has a good manner of handling the Indian boys, both in and out of the classroom.\n\nThe staff have put forth quite an effort to beautify the ground surrounding the school by planting trees and shrubs, &c., and a great improvement has been brought about. However, in this respect, it does not compare with the Roman Catholic School on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nThe buildings are all in a good state of repair with the exception of the flooring in the cow stable.\n\nThis will......\nThis will have to be replaced. They have also had considerable trouble with water coming into the sub-cellar in the school, and the cement floor is all broken up. The Principal informed me that he had requisitioned for the cement for the last four years, but it had never been supplied. This I am taking up with the Department in a separate letter.\n\nAnother matter which I wish to bring to your attention is that where the top of the outer wall is finished with a cement block, set in about two inches from the outside brick, the two inch thickness is faced with cement. This cement facing is gradually falling off, thus allowing the rain to get through the cement block and through the walls. The cement falling is very dangerous for the children and others around the school. I do not know whether I have made myself clear, but if the Department do not understand what I mean, I shall endeavour to explain it more clearly in a special letter. I do not wish to make any recommendation in connection with repairing this, as in my opinion it would be futile to replace the cement facing, unless we found a more satisfactory method of doing it, as it would only fall off again in time. A well qualified man in that line should be consulted, or our architect at Ottawa might have some suggestions to offer in the matter. I only wish to impress upon the Department that some steps should be taken to deal with this, and if there is anything further I can do in the matter to procure information for the Department, I shall be glad to do so.\n\nFrom my observations of this institution, I consider that the children are being well looked after.\n\nThey are......\nThey are well clothed and receive an abundance of food, and receive excellent care in every way.\n\nDuring the winter months I shall inspect the class rooms for my own satisfaction, to show the children that I am taking an interest in their welfare, and I will also go fully into the other fields of endeavour of the staff.\n\nIn connection with the outside work the boys of course work on the farm and in the garden, help with the stock raising, &c., and in that way get a fair education in general farm work. During the holidays the girls do the milking, but the rest of the time this work is done by the boys.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nAlberta Inspectorate\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that while on the Blood Reserve the Principal of the St. Mary's R. C. School took up with me the matter of procuring some cement. As I pointed out in my report, the floor of the cow stable needs to be replaced; the cement is all broken up and needs replacing. There is also the matter of the floor in the sub-cellar in the school. This needs replacing as well, and the same applies to the root cellar. He has at present a temporary one, which he intends to rebuild.\n\nHe informs me that for the last four years he has requisitioned for 400 bags of cement which has never been allowed. He is now asking for this cement which will cost in the neighbourhood of $1.00 per sack. If there are any funds available, I would ask that at least some of this cement be authorized to be purchased, as it is required.\n\nThe staff will do the work: All the Principal is asking for is that the Department pay for the cement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, July 21, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson reports that 300 or 400 bags of cement are required to replace the floor of the new barn, the sub-cellar of the school and the root cellar at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School. $350 can be allowed for this purpose, and, if you concur that this work is necessary, you may arrange the purchase of the cement, after securing competitive prices from indicated sources. It is understood that the staff and older pupils will do all the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nJ. H.

School in the water situation and the pump began sucking air with little or no water. I, therefore, called Mr. Flett of Cardston, and had this pump pulled and found that the leather and brass chamber had worn badly, and of necessity I had these replaced. This seems to have been some of the trouble, but I am advised that this well should be re-bored to clear out sand etc.\n\nAccount for this work is being submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.S. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that while at the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Residential School on the Blood Reserve, it was brought to my attention that the cook stove was not very satisfactory as it was getting badly burnt out. They got it from another school where it had been in use for a matter of eight years, and they have had it for seven years.\n\nThey can get along with it for the present, but it may have to be replaced next year. I therefore thought it best to bring this matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\nCALGARY, ALTA.... December 2nd, 1932.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 139 children in residence. I spent considerable time in each of the three classrooms, which are lovely bright rooms and the furniture, which is all in first class shape, is nicely arranged.\n\nThe Senior class is taught by Mr. Cote who has been at the school for a number of years, and is an exceptionally good teacher. The other two classrooms are taught by the sisters. As the Public School Inspector inspects the classroom work, I shall not go into detail in this regard. Mr. Bremner was expected there shortly to make his annual inspection. I might say, however, that the work performed in these classrooms seemed to be quite satisfactory, and I am sure the children are making fair progress.\n\nHEALTH:\n\nThe health of the children at the school is good. I must say that there has been a great improvement in the appearance of the children during the last few.....\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nST. MARY'S (Continued),\u2014\n\nlast few years. I remember Doctor Stone visiting this school with me two or three years ago and at that time he remarked that he was not satisfied with the appearance of the children. This could not be said now, as the children, from a layman's point of view, are in perfect health. This is partly due to the fact that the school is now better off financially than when it was first opened, and they operate quite a farm, raise their own beef, and have an abundance of cream, milk, butter, eggs, &c., and as the children are better fed, their health has naturally improved.\n\nBUILDING:\n\nThe interior of the building is in splendid shape. The Department are aware that wherever the Sisters of Charity are in charge of a school, it is always kept perfectly clean and in good condition at all times.\n\nThe furniture in every room looks just as good as the day it was purchased, as they are continually polishing and varnishing it to preserve it.\n\nOne thing that needs attention is the matter of floors in the recreation rooms: They are cement, and were not properly finished off, and become very dusty. Aside from this, everything is in A-1 shape.\n\nMACHINERY:\n\nThe boilers in the engine room are in good shape. The rest of the equipment is all run by electricity as the school is hooked up on the Calgary Power Company's electric transmission lines.\nST. MARY'S (Continued).\u2014\n\nTEACHING OF CHILDREN OTHER THAN CLASSROOM WORK:\n\nThe girls are taught general household work, including cooking, &c., and they also assist in making articles of clothing which are, for the most part, made at the school. The older boys, under the supervision of Brother Tom, do all the outside work.\n\nBoth the boys and girls, therefore, are taught the practical method of performing work that they are likely to have to do upon leaving school, and graduates of this school are well fitted for taking up their duties in household work and farming.\n\nOUTBUILDINGS:\n\nThe outbuildings are all in splendid shape, as floors that were broken last summer when I was at the school have been repaired. A new outbuilding has also been erected by the Principal at a cost of about $500.00. There is a root cellar under the building and the building itself is for the purpose of storing grain. One end is partitioned off for a repair shop.\n\nFARMING:\n\nThe school harvested a fair crop this year, and although the farm at the school was well operated, the yield just averaged about the same as the Indians' crop. The amount harvested was 2300 bushels of wheat, 1400 bushels of oats, 800 bushels of barley, 700 bushels of potatoes and a quantity of other garden truck. Eighty tons of green feed were put up and 160 acres of land were summerfallowed.\n\nThe school...\nST. MARY'S Continued,\u2014\n\nThe school has 203 head of cattle and 27 head of horses, 35 pigs and 200 chickens. They were milking 16 cows which were giving about 10 pails of milk per day. This is all given to the children. Sixteen hundred (1600) pounds of butter were packed during the summer holidays which is also being used in feeding the children.\n\nSTAFF:\n\nThe staff consists of the Principal, Assistant Principal, one lay brother, one engineer, two labourers, one male teacher and fifteen sisters.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nIn conclusion I wish to state that in my opinion this institution is well managed in every respect and the children are well fed and well clothed and receive the best of treatment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, December 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A., R.C., of the 2nd instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that the work at this school is being conducted satisfactorily; that the health of the children is good and that the buildings are kept in a satisfactory condition. It is noted, also, that this institution was found to be well managed in every respect; that the children are well clothed and receiving good treatment.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the same date, regarding the condition of the cook stove, I have to say that our funds this year are extremely limited. If it is possible to carry on with the present stove, consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase of a new one next year. A request for this equipment might be forwarded the beginning of next fiscal year, when full particulars should be given as to the type of stove required and its approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, August 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your telegram of the 27th instant, regarding the well at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School, I have to confirm the following night letter to you of the 28th instant:\n\n\"May incur expenditure not exceeding four hundred dollars, making repairs and cleaning well, Blood School. Keep costs low as possible.\"\n\nI enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure of $400.00 for the purpose of lifting the casing, cleaning out the well, and placing it in a satisfactory condition. I would request that you keep all costs as low as possible. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. Please state, on each copy of the accounts, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 906.\n\nIn connection with the damage to the pump, I would request that you forward a further report, stating if same occurred through carelessness on the part of a member of the staff. You should state, also, whether this school has a member on the staff who is qualified to look after the equipment. The Department is frequently called upon to provide expenditure in the repairing of equipment, owing to carelessness in handling. If this school has not a member on the staff with the necessary qualifications to handle all equipment, the management should arrange to engage a qualified man. The Department will be pleased to hear from you, at your convenience, regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. E.

Indian Residential School, together with Encumbrance Requisition No. 906 for $400.00 to cover the cost of cleaning etc.\n\nIn this connection I wish to make my report on the matter.\n\nThe failure of the well and pump was in no way due to negligence, but to a collection of very coarse sand that had accumulated in the bottom of the well, of which there was about 15 feet, a sample of which I am mailing under separate cover. A certain amount of this sand would lift into the brass working barrel, and when this was removed by the well drilling rig, it was found that the brass barrel had worn to within 1/16 of an inch, and as a result it would not hold the leathers in the valve and would reverse them and render the pump useless. I, therefore, had to order a new working barrel with valves, and this has been put in and the pump is now working satisfactorily.\n\nThe supply of water to this well may of course be affected by the series of dry seasons, and there is not the continuous supply of water that existed four or five years ago, and if we have continuing dry seasons, it might be advisable to drop the pump down a further 40 feet into the well, and prevent the sucking of air which takes place when the pump is run for a long spell. I have advised that the pump be used more often and not so long in one run, and this will carry them along nicely. There is a great improvement since cleaning out the well and putting in the new barrel.\n\nThe cost of this work will be, approximately, as follows:\n\nWell cleaning, including the lifting of the pump casing, rods etc., and putting the pump in shape, which included taking the pump out and making a temporary repair and putting in again that some water could be got to run on while cleaning the well and waiting for the brass barrel, which had to come from Winnipeg. The charge for bringing in the rig, 80 miles, and setting up etc., with labour on pump, is $150.00, Voucher No. 199, in favour of J. Maughan, 605 - 11th Street South, Lethbridge. The account for the brass barrel will be about $55.00 and express of $4.20, which accounts are not yet to hand. I spent a lot of time on the job myself in order to satisfy the Department that the job was done to satisfaction, and to see the conditions.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhile we were working on this well, the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School advised me that their pump had broken on September 1st, and the children in school. I went to the school to find that they were also out of water and found that the rods had broken off in the bottom of the well and the leather in the valves reversed and worn. I, therefore, deemed it advisable to pull this pump, and accordingly got the driller to set there at a cost of $75.00 to draw the pump and clean this well out, which was done. We found about six feet of a shale of a fine grade in this well, but the brass barrel in good shape. The rods were repaired by Weston Bros. of Cardston. That well is now working in good shape. I did find, however, that in this well, the pump sits fairly well up, is a 4\" pipe pump, and the well casing is as shown in the log, reduced, and therefore the pump cannot be lowered. I would suggest that when next this well is worked on, that a 3\" pump pipe be used and then lowered into the well casing.\n\nAs with the Blood School, I put in a lot of time at the Anglican School, and the cost of this work will be $75.00 for well rig and work, and a charge for repairs to rod and help in getting the rods out etc., to get a supply of water, pending the cleaning of the well.\n\nBoth schools rendered assistance in the work, particularly the Blood R.C. School, as the work is heavy, and the expense was kept down in this respect using only two on the well rig, and I may say that by careful planning, the two jobs have been done under the cost I estimated, and as a consequence of the break down at St. Paul's School, I did that job without wiring the Department for authority, as it appeared an absolute necessity to satisfy myself and the schools that an efficient water supply be maintained from all points of view. I trust the Department will concur in my actions in the matter.\n\nThe total cost of both jobs will not exceed $350.00, and the Department may be assured that the work was done economically, and that the water supply is sufficient at both schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

Ashdown Hardware Co., Limited, Calgary, Alta., for Working barrel for pump at Blood R.C. School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Allot. 2, E.R.No. 906 dated August 29th, 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nCALGARY, ALTA., November 3rd, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer the Department to their letter dated December 9th, 1932, No. 193-2-5, in connection with a kitchen range for the St. Mary's R. C. Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve. In the last paragraph of your letter you state that a request for this equipment might be forwarded the beginning of the next fiscal year. I gave this information to Mr. Pugh, the Agent, but have heard nothing further until now. He writes stating that the old kitchen range is practically out of commission and asks me to take the matter up with the Department.\n\nWhat is required is a large hotel range, Gurney preferred. The Hall Hardware Company of Calgary are the Alberta agents for the Gurney Stove Company. They installed a range at the Morley Indian Residential School last year at a cost of $335.00. The one required for the Blood School, however, would be a little larger in size, and the approximate cost of this would be from $450.00 to $475.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A R.C. of the third instant, with reference to the supplying of a kitchen range for the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nOur funds are extremely limited and, to a large extent, have been assigned. It is necessary to have a reserve for unforeseen expenditures which may occur at the residential schools. At the present time, therefore, we are not aware if it will be possible to provide a stove. If you will forward a further request towards the end of January, next, the Department will be in a position to decide if funds are available for this purpose. I regret being unable to make a decision at this time. In the meantime, it is hoped that the school can carry on with the present equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston,\nJanuary 2nd 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask for an Encumbrance Requisition to cover the cost of retubing the High Pressure Boiler at the Blood R.C. School, Blood Agency, at a cost of $50.00.\n\nIn this connection I wish to state that on the Engineer firing up last Tuesday for washing in the Laundry, it was found that a bad leak had come in from the Flue tubes. The Boiler was examined after being taken down and found to have the majority of the tubes pitted and leaking. This is due to wear and the peculiar properties in the water at all our Institutions here, and is no way due to neglect of any kind.\n\nI would therefore respectfully ask for this authority as soon as possible in order that I may complete the work, and put the Laundry in working order.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario,\nOttawa, January 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11 R.C. of the 2nd instant, regarding the retubing of the high pressure boiler at the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School and requesting that authority be granted for an expenditure of $80 in carrying out this work.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur the expenditure required in having this boiler retubed. A blanket encumbrance requisition has been obtained here, authorizing the expenditure to the above amount. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. You should state, on each copy of the account, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of R.R. No. 1146. This account should reach the Department before the end of March, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E.

Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve with a kitchen range. I was instructed by the Department to take this matter up again during January. I would therefore like to know at your convenience whether any funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlbert Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A. R.C. of the 9th instant, regarding the supplying of a kitchen range for use at the Blood R C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that funds are available in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year to supply this equipment. It is noted, in your letter of November 3rd, last, that you estimate the cost would be from $450 to $475 for a range of the type required. You may arrange for the purchase, locally, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of a range of the size and type required. It is noted that the Hall Hardware Company, of Calgary, Alberta's agents for the Gurney Stove Company, installed a range at the Morley Indian Residential School last year, at a cost of $335. You should obtain the lowest possible quotation for supplying the range, f. o. b. the school.\n\nA blanket encumbrance has been obtained here covering the expenditure required. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the range. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The account should reach the Department before the end of the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., January 30th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 103-2-5 of the 17th instant authorizing the purchase of a range for the Blood R. C. School.\n\nI have gone into this matter thoroughly and find that the most suitable range for the school would be the Gurney Oxford, three ovens, and this would cost $475 F. O. B. Cardston, whereas the McLary heavy duty range costs about $650. It now develops that the pipes on the present range are only 6-inch and the new range has 12-inch pipe. A water front is also required and the hot water tank will have to be moved. The stove pipes will cost about $1 each and the elbows $1.50, while the water front will cost $15. It will not take many stove pipes and only one or two elbows will be required. The cost of moving the tank will also be small.\n\nAs the above expense is over and above the amount authorized, I am not ordering the stove until the extra cost is authorized. I shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 3, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A. R.C. of the 30th ultimo, regarding the purchase of a range for use at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be satisfactory to supply a Gurney Oxford range, with three ovens. It is noted the cost will be $475; F. O. B. Cardston. You may arrange, also, for the purchase of the quantity of pipes and elbows of the size required and a water front. The expenditure in connection with the supplying of the pipe, elbows, water front, and the moving of the tank - all over and above the cost of the range - will be covered here by a blanket encumbrance.\n\nI would request that you arrange for the early purchase and installation of the range and forward the account, as requested in official letter of the 17th ultimo, to reach the Department before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Firstly that of getting in and eventually had to take in through the kitchen window, and I had Weston come out and take out the frame and window, and coupled with this, we found that the chimney flue was only 9\u00bd\" square, and to get into the flue there was a 15\" wall through which the stove pipe passed into the flue. The flue was a double affair, so I had Weston cut through the wall and open up into the other flue, and went in with a square thimble, which Flett made at a cost of $2.25. Weston's labour will be $5.00.\n\nUnder the circumstances I had no other alternative in getting these two jobs done.\n\nThe range is all set up and was in good shape, and by getting into the two flues we have an exit from the 12\" round pipe into an oblong thimble 17x7\u00bd\", which I think will be satisfactory. Would you inquire of Mr. Hall as to this. The range when fired appeared to draw well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., March 9th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith Voucher No. 397, amounting to $195.80, in favour of The Hall Hardware Co., Calgary, Alta., for a kitchen range supplied for the Blood R.C. Residential School, together with Voucher No. 398, amounting to $2.25, in favour of F.W. Flett, Cardston, Alta., for making a flue pipe for above range, and Voucher No. 399, amounting to $5.00, in favour of Ralph Weston, Cardston, Alta., for labour setting up this range, together with copy of my letter to Mr. Inspector Christianson in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA... April 30th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of St. Mary's Indian Residential School in the Blood Agency made on my recent visit to that reserve. While there I went over the entire building, inside and out, and was pleased to note that the school building itself is in an exceptionally good state of repair; practically as good as when they moved into it some 9 or 10 years ago. About all that is required at the present time is a little painting in the corridors and one or two rooms on the first floor. If the school were given about 25 gallons of paint and some oil, they would do the work themselves and I think this would be in the interest of economy as it will be put to good use.\n\nThe furniture in the school is also in splendid condition, and has certainly been well preserved by the Sisters. New linoleum had been\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nput in as floor-covering downstairs at a cost of approximately $250.00. This was paid for by the school management.\n\nThe outside buildings are all in pretty fair shape as far as it is possible for the staff to keep them, but owing to the very high winds there, considerable damage has been done to doors, shingles, &c., and they require a great deal of repairing to put them in proper shape. I would estimate that it would take a carpenter about a month to do the necessary work on these outbuildings, and if this is not soon done they will be in much worse condition later on. Once the shingles start to blow off and the wind gets in under them and the paper, it does not take long for a whole roof to be ruined. In my opinion it would be money well spent to attend to this matter right away. Very little material is required, and the expenditure would be principally for labour.\n\nThe bake oven needs replacing. It is badly burnt out and I am informed it was never of very much use as it was much too small. What is required is a 200-loaf bake oven.\nThe school is also experiencing difficulty with the water tower\u2014It leaks like a sieve and whether it can be repaired sufficiently to be of use it is hard to say. It would have to be all re-corked with okum, and it is possible that while this is being done some new places might open up. I did not climb up into the tower to look over the tank; This is something that would require a younger man than I; and I would suggest that we get Mr. Weston of Cardston to see what really can be done to the tank. Some action will certainly have to be taken immediately as it is getting worse all the time.\n\nFARMING:\n\nAs the Department are aware, this school operates a large farm, although the Principal informed me that he was not putting in as much wheat this year as last as he was sowing some of the farm land to green feed. Their farming operations were a failure last year on account of the drought, and they even had to purchase some potatoes during the winter. They raised a lot of garden truck.\n\nThey have about 200 head of cattle and hogs and a number of horses\u2014all they require\u2014and chickens, geese, turkeys, &c. All the beef and pork used by the school is produced there.\nHEALTH:\n\nThe children appeared to be receiving the best of care and all looked very healthy. There were 153 in residence at the time of my visit and they all seemed very happy.\n\nThey get all the milk they can drink and as butter is made at the school they receive either fat or butter with their meals. The Department will realize that where a school raises a good garden, has some crop and raises all the beef and pork required, the children are naturally well fed. This is the case at this school and I was very well pleased with the appearance of the children.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nThe boys do all the outside work under the able direction of Brother Thom, who is an excellent Farming Instructor.\n\nThe girls also receive a splendid training in the way of sewing, washing, cooking and other household duties, and if they do not make good use of the knowledge of housekeeping which they receive at school, it is not the fault of the Staff.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nWhen I left the school I said good-bye to Sister St. Patrick who informed me that she was leaving next\nmonth for the East. Sister St. Patrick is about 65 years of age now and has spent about 35 years on the Blood and Peigan Reserves. She was Matron of our hospital on two different occasions and also has been Matron of the Blood School for a great number of years. It is with regret that I said good-bye to this Sister; she has rendered faithful service both at the school and in the hospital, and I have always found her work of the highest order. She has given the best part of her life in trying to make something of the Indian children under her care. I know she would appreciate very much a letter from the Department as she seemed to be quite sure that once she got down to the mother house she would be kept there owing to her age and that her labours in the field would be terminated.\n\nThe other members of the staff at the school seem to be rendering good service. There has been little change in the personnel since my last inspection.\n\nTrusting the above report will be of interest to you,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to my report on the St. Mary's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve, and would make the following recommendations which were all set out in my report:\n\n1.- That the water tank which is leaking be repaired immediately, but not being sure whether or not it can be repaired satisfactorily, would suggest having Mr. Weston of Cardston, who has done a great deal of work for our Department, give us a report on this.\n\n2.- That the Department hire a carpenter for a period of approximately a month to repair shingles, &c., on the barns and other outside buildings which have been damaged by the prevailing high winds.\n\n3.- That the school be furnished with 25 gallons of paint and some linseed oil. This can be bought from one of the paint companies here wholesale, and shipped out to the school. This is required for the interior of the building, and the staff will do the work during their summer holidays.\n\n4.- That when funds are available the school be furnished with a bake oven, size 200 loaves, as the old one has passed its usefulness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMay 14, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Baskard,\n\nSome minor repairs are required to the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School. Will you please give me the name of a competent carpenter in Cardston who may be employed for this work?\n\nA thorough examination is also required of the tank which supplies water for the school. Inspector Christiansen has recommended that Mr. Foster of Cardston, who has done similar work on different occasions for the department be employed. Will you please advise if this will be satisfactory?\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOttawa, May 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the Blood Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the water tank and your suggestion that a carpenter be hired to repair the shingles, the Department will write you further within the next week or 10 days.\n\nYou may purchase 25 gallons of paint and some linseed oil, which is required for interior painting. It is noted that the school staff will do the work, without cost to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the bake oven, you might again bring this matter to our attention about the first of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nM. Christiansen, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMay 29th, 1934.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 14th instant, your file No. 103-2-5, Mr. Ralph Weston, of Cardston, is available for the repair work required at the Blood Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, and also for the examination of the tank from which the school is supplied with water.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJune 6, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to the St. Mary's Indian Residential School on the Blood Indian Reserve, I beg to say that you may arrange to employ Mr. Ralph Weston of Cardston to make the necessary repairs to the water tank. He may also be engaged to repair the shingles on the roofs, etc., which have been damaged by prevailing high winds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Christenson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., June 22nd, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 103-2-5 of the 6th instant in connection with repairs to the water tower and also shingles on barns and other outbuildings at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School in the Blood Agency. I have had an estimate made of this work and the material will cost as follows: For the water tower - $23.35\nOther material - - 58.35\nLabour - 15 10-hr. days, 2 men at 50\u00a2 per hour - - 150.00\n\nTOTAL - -$233.70\n\nI trust this is satisfactory to the Department and I have authorized Mr. Pugh to go on with the work, Mr. Weston of Cardston to perform the labour with a helper. The vouchers will be forwarded direct from the Blood Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Agencies,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1934.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 402-11A R. C. of the 22nd ultimo, in connection with repairs to the water tower and shingles on the barns and other outbuildings at the Blood Indian Residential School. It is noted that the necessary expenditure will amount to $233.70.\n\nPlease notify Mr. Pugh that, when forwarding accounts in connection with the above, he should quote R. R. No. #612 as authority for the expenditures that are made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., July 6th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your Letter No. 103-2-5 of the 3rd inst. in connection with repairs at St. Mary's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve and the estimate that I gave amounted to $235.70. I suppose this will cover the cost of everything, but I just wish to point out to the Department that in work of this nature some unforeseen expenditure might come up which would increase the cost by a few dollars. Just the other day the Agent brought to my attention that a few extra sacks of cement were required for the walls of the bathroom where the plaster has fallen off from the brickwork. I have instructed the Agent to keep the cost as near as possible to the amount mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

There is enough depth that they could be taken out and rebent, they are hanging on the roof and are useless as a protection, thirty feet of flushing having disappeared entirely.\n\nThe felt flushings due to this exposure are dried out and perishinig. These should be reinforced with Saturated Membrane, laid in strips of twelve inches width, the membrane to be embedded in E.L.S. a plastic cement.\n\nThe loose gravel should then be brushed off and the entire roof should be coated with Blacastic a penetrating resaturating agent that will revitalize the felts, giving them new life. At the same time all broken places be reinforced with Saturated Waterproofing Membrane.\n\n605 feet of metal to be replaced and caulked.\n30 feet of metal flushing to be renewed.\n605 feet of felt flushing to be reinforced 12 in. wide.\n\nMaterial necessary:\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 2 rolls Saturated Waterproofing Membrane | $12.00   | $24.00     |\n| 200 lbs.

These are extremely dangerous and in some cases the writer lifted them on to the roof, unless this is attended to immediately the entire coping will have to be removed and replaced. There are twenty stones which will have to be replaced as they are beyond repair.\n\nI would recommend that all loose stones be re-embedded and that the remainder be coated with Tremco 101 Plastic Damproofing in light grey. This would stop the penetration of moisture and the consequent splitting due to frost.\n\nMaterial necessary:\n\n20 gal. 101 Damproofing $3.30 $66.00\nEstimated labor cost 25.00\n\nAll facing joints must be caulked with Quanox 707 Caulking Compound, Stone color, gun consistency.\n\nMaterial necessary:\n\n2 Gal.

While there Mr. Hingley their representative looked over some other matters in connection with the school that require attention. I am attaching hereto lists of what is required.\n\nNo. 1 is for coping stones around the top of the building. I have reported on this matter previously, probably three or four years ago that something should be done to remedy this as some of the stones had already fallen off where others were loose and I would recommend that this be attended to.\n\nNo. 2 is an estimate regarding flushing on school roofs and cost of repair.\n\nNo. 3 is with reference to resaturating and revitalizing main roof on school. I do not know whether No. 3 would have to be gone on with at the present time but Nos. 1 and 2 should receive the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Weston of Cardston, amounting to $197.00, for day labour performed in general repairs to the Blood Indian R.C. Residential School. The amount exceeds my original estimate, but the condition of the boys' shower room and the boys' lavatory was drawn to my attention, and in the case of shower rooms, I advised Mr. Christianson. The lavatory was in such a condition below the basins that the plaster was all dotted and I instructed Mr. Weston to patch this up, and this latter work was not included in the original estimate. I may say that the work on the tower has stopped the leaking and the tank is now full and holding the water in good shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

Our funds will not permit of a further expenditure, and the account which you recently submitted is returned, as it is considered that it can be paid by the Principal, from school funds.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. McGookin,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ.

Forms shall be made and a concrete mix consisting of 1 part cement, 2 parts clean coarse sand and 2 parts gravel or coarse aggregate shall be poured and tamped.\n\nWhere necessary stones shall be refaced, the surface being first washed with a 5% solution of Huriatic acid followed by a wash of clear cold water. A slurry or bonding coat shall be brushed on previous to application of facing coat, which shall be applied just before bonding coat is completely dry.\n\nThe remaining stones shall be coated one eighth of an inch with 101 Plastic Damproofing which will prevent the infiltration of moisture and the consequent expansion due to frost.\n\nAll joints shall be tuckpointed with Caulking Compound, all corners of parapet walls to be repaired and rebuilt where necessary.\n\nMetal flashing shall be removed and an 18\" strip of membrane be embedded to reinforce felts. Metal flashing renewed where necessary and balance replaced securely, the flashing joint to be securely cemented.\n\nEstimated cost of labor by Ralph Weston, $200.00. Material $40.00\n\nThe school will haul the gravel and give any assist-\n\nThe roofs of Chapel and Laundry are disintegrating in a similar manner. There is 330 feet of Coping.

The material necessary was ordered from the Tresco Company of Edmonton, which amounted to $142.00, and was shipped to Cardston, and is now stored at the school.\n\nI received a letter some time ago from Mr. Pugh advising me that in his opinion not sufficient had been allowed for labor, and that he would be glad if I would come down to the reserve for the purpose of looking into the matter of the roof and the coping stones. I went down there Monday and spent most of yesterday at the school. I got in touch with Mr. Weston who has done a lot of work for us on this reserve and who I know to be an Al workman and thoroughly competent in every respect, and Mr. Pugh the agent was also there, and the matter was thoroughly gone into and a means of repairing the Coping stones and flashings discussed.\n\nTo give the Department a better idea as to the state of the Coping stones than I could explain in this letter I am herewith attaching some snapshots of the building which shows where in some places the Coping stones are absolutely loose and can be lifted off. A considerable number of the corner stones have been lifted out on account of the fact that they were not safe, and a great deal of the facing has either been pulled or dropped off.\n\nThe Department will realize I am sure, that with the Coping stones loose it is very dangerous for the children playing around outside the school. The Department will also see that by the Coping stones being loose that water would get in under the coping stone and run down between the brick and the plaster, and a heavy rain, which we may sometime get, would play havoc with the building.\n\nThe metal flashing on the roof is very light material and only has a 1/8 turn on it, then pushed under the Coping stone and plastered here and there. It has pulled away from the wall in many places and rain and snow gets between the wall and the flashing and leaks through the roof. This would have to be repaired at the same time.\nSuggested Specification for Repairs on St. Mary's Indian School, Roof, Parapets & Copings.\n\n27 of these stones to be removed. Forms shall be made and a concrete mix consisting of 1 part cement, 2 parts clean coarse sand and 2 parts gravel or coarse aggregate shall be poured and tamped.\n\nWhere necessary stones shall be refaced, the surface being first washed with a 5% solution of Muriatic acid followed by a wash of clear cold water. A slurry or bonding coat shall be brushed on previous to application of facing coat, which shall be applied just before bonding coat is completely dry.\n\nThe remaining stones shall be coated one eighth of an inch with 101 Plastic Damproofing which will prevent the infiltration of moisture and the consequent expansion due to frost.\n\nAll joints shall be tuckpointed with Caulking Compound, all corners of parapet walls to be repaired and rebuilt where necessary.\n\nMetal flashing shall be removed and an 18\" strip of membrane be embedded to reinforce felts. Metal flashing renewed where necessary and balance replaced securely, the flashing joint to be securely cemented.\n\nEstimated cost of labor by Ralph Weston, $200.00. Material $40.00\n\nEmployees of the school will haul the gravel and give any assistance possible.\n\nThe Copings on Chapel and Laundry are disintegrating in a similar manner. There is 330 feet of Coping. If this is attended to now the cost would be - Labor $20.00. Material $35.00.

A.\nOttawa, October 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 15th instant, regarding repairs required to the coping stones and flashing on the roofs at the Blood (St. Mary's) R.C. Indian Residential School. In this connection I regret that your No. 402-11A of the 12th ultimo was inadvertently overlooked.\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned repairs, I have to confirm night letter to you of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"May incur expenditure mentioned, your letter twelfth ultimo, repairing coping stones and flashing, roof, main building, chapel and laundry, St. Mary's School. Work may be performed by Ralph Weston. Writing.\"\n\nThe work in repairing the coping stones and metal flashing should be carried out in accordance with the suggested specifications forwarded in your letter above referred to. Either you or the local Agent should arrange for the purchase, from firms on the approved list, of the materials required, and Mr. Ralph Weston may be engaged to carry out the labour. You will be in a position to decide whether he should do the work at the price stated by you, viz.: $200, for labour, or be paid at the rate per hour as allowed for similar work in the locality.\n\nBesides the repairs to the coping stones and flashing on the roof of the main building, the roof over the chapel and laundry should also be repaired and placed in good condition.\n\nThe Department notes that the cost of the repairs to the roof on the main building will be approximately $200 for labour and $40 for material, and for the repairs to the back part of the building, approximately $55 - a total of $295. It is noted, further, that there is an unexpended balance of approximately $60 from the last authority for repairs to this school. An encumbrance is being obtained, authorizing a further amount of $245.00 to complete the repairs mentioned. When the work is completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. The work should be performed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christiansen, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, October 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A R.C., of the 10th instant, regarding the supplying of a new inside barrel for the washer in the laundry at the Blood (St. Mary's) R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection the Department considers that, if the wood in the barrel of this machine was in good condition when it was installed, it should have lasted for a longer period. No doubt, water is left in the washer, which causes the wood to become water-logged and rot.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has authorized considerable expenditure for repairs at this school during the present fiscal year. No further funds have been provided in our Appropriation, and I regret that we will be unable to authorize the expenditure required in supplying a new inside barrel for this washer. If the repairs to the washer are urgent, the school authorities will have to provide the expense from per capita or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

We were, however, short of covering for eight stones on the low portion of the kitchen roof, and as this is not bad, it has been left, having no compound or plastic to cover.

P. Phelan, Esq.,\nC/o Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your recent letter, I beg to say that you may arrange for repairing the floors of the boys' playroom at the Blood Indian Residential School. It is noted that this work can be done at a cost of $321.00.\n\nYou may also have the water tower painted, etc., at a cost of $170.00.\n\nPurchases should be made from firms on the approved list.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that on a recent inspection for monthly report purposes at the Blood R.C. School, the first since their very bad epidemic of measles, that a number of troubles in the plant were brought to my attention, and I now wish to ask for authority to incur the following expenditures.\n\n(1) Jacket Heater for Hot Water System. This has cracked, due to corrosion and sand in the system, and will have to be replaced. This was renewed three years ago, and is a trouble we have at both schools in the same manner; scaley water under heat and eventual corrosion then a splitting of the jacket. I believe that, in view of the fact that renewal of these cost about $130.00, it would be in the interests of economy to have some competent authority on water softeners give the Department a candid report as to their ability in the softening process to cut down the scaling of boiler heaters etc. An analysis could be made of the water at both schools to this end. I shall be glad of authority to make this replacement at the approximate cost mentioned.\n\n(2) Water Front Gurney Oxford \"G\" Semi-Kitchen Range. This was found to be cracked and useless, and requires replacement at a cost of approximately, $20.00, the cost of the front being $16.00 and the installation around $5.00. In this case sand in the system was responsible, and as a result of my tracing this trouble, I have made arrangements to permit the children to go to their homes for four or five days, drain the water tower tank and thoroughly clean this out or sand, wherein I believe some of the trouble arises. I did not think it advisable to leave the children in school, with the water supply cut down to a minimum.\n\n(3) Boilers, main. The fire door linings I found were burnt out and broken and will have to be replaced, otherwise the doors will begin to warp. I am not aware as yet of the cost of these. The weight of these is about 40 lbs. each and four of them will total 160 lbs. at an approximate cost of 30 to 35\u00a2 per lb.\n\n(4) Return and Steam Pipes to the Water Tower. In this case I called in the local plumber, as we found a leak in this piping, and on close examination a plug was found to be badly fitted and leaking and the drip pipes split, and it will be necessary to replace these to put this in good shape. As this was an emergency, I took the steps noted above. The cost will be kept as low as possible.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSeveral of the features noted were to some extent due to the severe storm of last week, when 15\u00b0 below zero weather came on overnight, at a time least expedited, and then it was found that by putting up the steam into the tower suddenly to prevent freezing that condensation set and freezing.\n\nI should be glad if the Department will Nigh Letter their authority for these repairs before further cold weather sets in, and I trust that you concur in my involving certain necessary expenditure before obtaining authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 14th, 1935.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your 402-11 R.C. of the 7th instant, I beg to confirm the following night letter sent you today:-\n\n\"Reference your letter seventh instant Department approves expenditures for jacket heater, water front, boilers and steam pipes to water tower Blood Residential School\"\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the expenditure necessary will be, approximately, $108., plus the cost of the services of the plumber for repairing the steam pipes to the water tower. The accounts for these repairs should be forwarded at the same time, in order that the Department can secure an encumbrance requisition when they arrive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

School that the radiators in the water tower are all (four in number) frozen. Three of these have not been in use for some time, one only being in operation, which I think will carry sufficient heat for the tank. I would suggest, and I think it can be carried out, that all four radiators be taken down, and as they are in sections, we can find enough sections to build up one large radiator, which will suffice. This would entail labour only, with possibly some pipe, unions and nipples. I have discussed this with Mr. Inspector Christianson and he concurs in this suggestion. I have not obtained an estimate of this work, but it should not exceed $50.00 for labour and $20.00 for material. I would, therefore, respectfully seek authority to carry out this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, March 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 402-11 R.C. of the 13th instant, regarding the radiators in the water tower of the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School. It is noted that three of the radiators have become frozen and have not been in use for some time and that there is only one in operation.\n\nThe Department will approve of your suggestion, that all four radiators in the water tower be taken down and utilized in rebuilding one large radiator, which, you state, would be sufficient for heating purposes. You may therefore arrange for the labour in having this work carried out and for the purchase of any pipe, unions and nipples that may be required. It is noted that the labour will not exceed $50.00 and the materials required, $20.00.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the labour and materials. Regarding the labour, you should state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your 408-11 R.C. of the 27th ultimo, the Department regrets that the water towers at the St. Paul's C. E. and the Blood R. C. Indian Residential Schools were not painted during the last fiscal year. Funds were available for that purpose. However, it is noted from your letter that the material for both schools is now on hand and you may arrange for the necessary work. It is further noted that the cost of the labour will be $111.00 at each school.\n\nThere are certain funds available for repairs at each of these schools in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37 and the Department will write you further about this matter next month. It should be understood, however, that the amount being authorized in this letter for painting the towers will have to be taken out of the amount provided for repairs and improvements in the current year's appropriation. Our funds are so limited that it will not be possible to consider allowing any amount over and above the appropriation.\n\nWhen submitting accounts for the labour in painting the water towers, a separate voucher should be submitted for each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The cost of such installation as quoted by Mr Flette is $160.00. This is submitted for the Department's consideration.\n\nI should be glad to have authorization of the work recommended as soon as possible, and I regret that I have been unable to quote the figures on these various matters earlier.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\nAugust 14th 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 103-2-5, of June 16th last, with reference to the current year's appropriation for repairs and maintenance at the Blood Indian RC Residential School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that I have consulted with the Rev. Father Devio, acting in the absence of the Principal, and the following repairs etc. are requested and recommended, under the heading of miscellaneous repairs.\n\nExtension on kitchen chimney, ten feet. Cost $90.00\nThis is requested as the kitchen range installed last year has smoked badly with the prevailing West wind due no doubt to the flue in this range being 12\" as against the old one of 8\", and to install we had to open two chimney flues of 8\" to accommodate the 12\" flue. It will be necessary to take down the outside iron chimney stack to do this work, and rebuild the extension to the present stack. The cost is an estimated price inclusive of labor and material, given by Mr. Flett of Cardston.\n\nCupboards three in number. Cost $100.00\nTwo of these under the stair cases going down to the basement on each side of the building to the playrooms, boys and girls respectively. The Acting Principal requests these to accommodate brooms, etc., and also states that they find these spaces under the stairs used in an objectionable way by the children, and two cupboards placed in these positions would prevent this and serve a useful purpose.\n\nThe other cupboard is asked for in the boys' playroom to put in clothing that they work in etc., and similar to one installed in the girls' playroom. The cost is an estimate provided by Mr. Weston of Cardston, and is inclusive of labor and material.\n\nPainting of outside front porch. Cost $31.10.\nWhite paint 0-8-3 gallons at $3 per gall. 9.00\nGrey paint floor 3 \" \" $3 \" \" 9.00\nTurpentine 1 gallon \" $1.10 \" 1.10\nLabor, Indian, 4 days at 3.00 per day. 12.00\n\nExterior Decorating. Paint to the value of $155.31 was purchased after consultation with Mr. Inspector Christianson, the school staff to do the labor.\n\nFencing playground. The amount allowed will provide two sides on the road allowances with woven wire fence, which has been purchased. Some posts and perhaps two by four lumber may be required, not to exceed the amount allowed of $200.00.\n\nOne other item was brought to my attention, that of providing a blackboard of 16' by 4' for the junior girls' class room. There is one in this room but it is flanked by windows and consequently hard on the pupils' eyes. The cost of this may be obtained more readily by the Department. I would recommend this blackboard be provided.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nContd.\nEX'D.\n\n402-11RC\n\nOttawa, August 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enumerating the repairs requested by the Acting Principal of the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $90.00 in extending the kitchen chimney. This amount should include labour and material.\n\nThe Department will approve, also, of an expenditure of approximately $100.00 for installing three cupboards - two of these under the staircases going down to the basement on each side of the building to the playrooms and one in the boys' playroom, for work clothing, etc.\n\nYou may also incur an expenditure of approximately $35.00 for supplying the material and labour in painting the outside front porch. It is noted that the paint for the interior decorating has been purchased, also materials to fence the playground. The total cost of the material and labour in fencing the playground should not exceed the sum of $200.00.\n\nThe blackboard for the junior girls' classroom will be ordered from here.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the supplying of foot baths for the girls' washrooms, as no funds are available for the purpose.\n\nAfter all the above authorized work has been completed at this school, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials and accounts, in triplicate, for the labour employed. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H.

No children being in school this month. At the St Paul's Anglican School, paint was provided for the school and the labor of painting being done by the staff. Brick work pointing was done on all the windows, doors and coping stones on the roof. Roof painting was not carried out, the matter being placed before the Department regarding the labor entailed in the work. At the Blood R.C. school, their repairs were looked over and the matter referred to the department, and the work necessary and authorized is now being proceeded with. Crops at both schools was very poor, averaging about 4 bushels to the acre. The potato crops were also useless and they will be faced with purchases in both flour and potatoes.\n\nJ. E.

Weston of Cardston, Alta.\n\nThese vouchers cover the painting of the water towers at the St. Mary's R.C., and St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential Schools, Blood Agency.\n\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in this work, and the explanation covering this transaction is as follows:\n\nThe tender on this work was submitted by Mr. Hingly of Calgary in 1935, and work was commenced in November of that year, but not concluded on account of bad weather, particularly winds, and the work was delayed till this Spring. Mr. Hingly then delegated Mr. R. Weston to conclude this work, and in doing so it entailed labour costs over the estimate, and at the St. Paul's School, it entailed extra material.\n\nThe matter was referred to the Department on March 27th last, letter No. 402-11R.C., and a reply was received, No. 103-1-5 of April 2nd last. The original material, which Tremco supplied through Mr. Hingly, was paid for in Voucher No. 272, of October 11th, 1935, leaving an amount of $222.00 for labour for both towers. The estimate in labour was insufficient and this has been exceeded by $69.75, while the material extra required amounted to $51.43, a total in excess of the amount estimated of $121.18. Mr. Weston has endeavoured to have Mr. Hingly absorb some of this, without avail, and in discussing the matter with Mr. Weston, who as stated concluded this work for Mr. Hingly of Calgary, I find that Mr. Weston is out of pocket in many respects on the work, it being extremely difficult work, and occupied four men for the most part, the use of scaffolding and block and tackle gear to ensure safety. Workmen's compensation fees also having to be paid. The cheque for tower paint in Voucher No. 272, of October 11th, 1935, was $101.00.\n\nI regret that this circumstance arose, and every effort was made by myself to offset this additional charge arising. Mr. Hingly has now left the Tremco Manufacturing Co. employ, and it seems impossible to hold him to his tender on this work. I would respectfully ask the Department to give consideration to Mr. Weston's account, who completed the work for Mr. Hingly, and to whom the vouchers should be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

The accounts show, in the case of the Blood School, that 70 hours' extra labour was performed by Mr. Hingley; and, at the St. Paul's School, 23 hours*. It will be necessary, if Mr. Hingley was paid by Mr. Weston, to obtain his receipt and forward same to the Department.

Flett, Plumber of Cardston. In this connection I wish to state that the account represents the repairing of the steam pipe line leading to the water tower at the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt was found after completion of the radiator work in the tank tower, that the steam line was split in the piping for over 15 feet and had to be renewed, as it was impossible to raise any steam to the tower. As this line is an encased line, it was an expensive repair job, but one of necessity, and with the expectancy of cold weather, I instructed Mr. Flett to make the necessary repair. The cause is not known of this splitting of the pipe line, and being a covered pipe cannot be discerned until steam is raised to the tank line, consequently it had not been noticed during the Summer, since shutting off the plant last Spring. A leak was noticed last Winter, but not to interfere at that time, I regret not obtaining authority, but lateness of the season compelled me to have the work done to prevent further damage, and trust the Department will concur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

We hope nevertheless that you will give this matter your consideration if the estimates are not already voted.\n\nThe capacity of this mixer should be approximately 1\u00bd bag of flour.\n\nThe power service is 60 cycle, single phase & 220 volts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSt. Mary's R.C. School\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nSir:-\n\nI beg to state, with reference to Departmental letter 103-2-5 of November 5th last, with reference to Voucher No. 861, in favour of R.Weston of Cardston, Alta., that I have now been able, after a delay due to Mr. Hingley's absence at the coast, to procure the contract and receipts for certain monies paid by Weston to Hingley for work performed in November, 1935, on the Blood R.O.School water tower. These amounts are A.Hingley $15.12, R.Hingley $15.12. The labour was part only of the 70 hours, and Mr. Hingley then turned all the work over to Mr. Weston, who completed the Blood R.O.School tower, and then the St. Paul's Anglican School tower. Mr. Hingley has no further claim in this work, other than for the amounts which the attached receipts call for, his own and his son's, a total of $20.24.\n\nThe scaffolding material was supplied by Mr. Weston, and therefore no received accounts are attached. The material was all 2x10 planking, and was checked personally.\n\nThe tenders are attached and it will be noted are jointly Mr. Hingley and Mr. Weston as agreed in the first instance. I may say that Mr. Christianson is quite conversant with this matter, and the file could have his perusal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nRALPH WESTON\n\nCONTRACTOR and BUILDER\n\nJOBBERING and REPAIR WORK\nFrames, Screens, Store Front, Cabinet Work, Etc.\n\nCardston, Alta., March 29th 1937\n\nM.

School truck.\n\nIn this connection I wish to ask if the Department will consider paying this account from Band funds, it being considered a proper charge to that account.\n\nI may say in connection with the use of this truck, that it was used on loan to haul out the seed wheat and oats from Cardston to the respective Farm Instructor's premises, in April, and unfortunately road conditions became bad, and the grain had to be hauled, and the Indian teams were not in shape, being for the majority thin and unable to haul loads over the roads in bad condition. To hire this work done by truck would have cost an average of 15\u00a2 per bushel.\n\nThe Department's concurrence will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.E.

C. Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the time the Estimates were being prepared last Fall, reports were received regarding the necessity for fencing; painting; and improving the washing and bathing facilities at this school. The sum of approximately $1,000 has been provided for repairs and improvements at this school. Please consult the Principal and forward me a detailed statement regarding the manner in which you consider this money should be expended.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR. A.

Tender price by I.H.Pilling,\non three buildings, labour only $197.00\nTotal $367.05\n\nThe foregoing work of painting consists of\nthe horse barn, cow barn and the storage house, which is\ncombined with the work shop. The cost of painting and labour\nis arrived at on the following basis:- Tender for labour\nonly by I.H.Pilling and the paint on tender from the whole-\nsale house of G.F.Stephens & Co., Ltd., Calgary. The whole\nset of outside buildings require painting, and this will be\na start for this year, and the remaining buildings will be\nplaced on next year's estimates.\n\nI should be glad to be advised as soon as\npossible in order that the work may be completed before\nthe end of this month.\n\nI would recommend the exchange in the boilers\nas an economical way of providing this school with a boiler\nof bigger steam capacity for their laundry, and the boiler\nsuggested is in good shape. The high pressure boiler now in\nuse will be turned over to the Mormon Church President, if\nthe sanction is given by the Department. I would point out\nthat a new boiler of a 20 h.p. capacity would cost around\n$300.00. If the change is approved, might I ask that authority\nfor this change be made by wire, as both parties are anxious\nto make the change over as soon as possible.\n\nI trust this estimate is drawn up for you in the\nright manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., August 4th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your file No. 103-2-5 of the 24th instant, with reference to repairs and improvements at the Blood R.C.

The amount of approximately $1000.00 is noted, and in consultation with the Principal, the following is requested and recommended.\n\nPurchase of a larger high pressure boiler for the laundry system. The present 6 h.p. one in use being considered inadequate, requiring washing for almost three days a week. The present boiler can be traded for a 20 h.p. boiler that has been located at the Latter Day Saints Temple in Cardston, and the difference in value being $50.00, plus an inspection fee of the following, license $5.00, mileage for Inspector $10.56 (3.32 miles at 8\u00a2) and one day labour $10.00, a cost of $25.56.

A labour charge may arise for fittings to boiler, which will not exceed $15.00.

School.\n\nPlease let me have full explanations regarding the reasons for the sale and the condition of the boiler; also if you secured offers from people other than the man to whom you sold it. All this information is required in view of the fact that before any Government property can be sold, the approval of the Salvage Officer has to be obtained. As the boiler in question has already been disposed of, we will require very complete information in order that we can obtain confirmation of the sale from the Salvage Officer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Indian Residential School, Blood Indian Agency, Cardston, Alta.  \n**Condition:** Fair. Tubes leaking under pressure top plate. Crown plate slightly warped, fuse leak, no fittings except injector.  \n**Reasons of Sale:** Larger capacity installed, and in need of repairs before change made.\n\n**Offers on tenders:** E.J.Wood, for Alberta Temple, Latter Day Saints, in trade for larger capacity, later rejected for size, after installation. Offer made by B.J.Wood of $20.00 and accepted. Valuation of $25.00 asked. Verbal offer of same bid as B.J.Wood made by Hutterite Colony, but later withdrawn.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., January 11th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 103-2-5, of the 30th December, 1937, with reference to the sale of a small high pressure boiler for the sum of $20.00. In reply I wish to state that the boiler sold was the one which it was intended to trade, but as stated in my letter of the 5th of November last, File No. 402-11 R.C., the Alberta Temple found that it was not suited for their purpose, and had made other arrangements, we had the boiler left on our hands. President E.J. Wood, however, took steps to assist me in disposing of the boiler in question, and it was sold to B.J. Wood of Cardston.\n\nThe reason of sale was that it was too small for the school purpose, and its condition was fair. It was stripped of all fittings which were used on the boiler from the Alberta Temple, except for the injector. The Hutterite Colony offered us the same money in a casual offer, but later thought it not worth the money, so that when Mr. Wood made the offer of $20.00 I accepted. I asked $25.00, but this was refused. I am attaching separate sheet for your convenience for the Salvage Department, and I regret that I did not take more precaution, knowing full well the channel through which such sales must go, but in view of the manner of this transaction, I thought that my procedure would be in order, especially so, after referring the matter to the Branch and receiving no contrary instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.A.

It is impossible for them to reach the fire escape provided for the top dormitories, and in case of fire their only way of escape would be to run down the flight of stairs through the smoke and then go to the centre door; this is more than could be asked of small children in case of fire.\n\nTherefore, I shall be very much obliged if you will kindly submit the matter to the Department of Indian Affairs as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\n[Stamp]\nExtract from report of Indian Agent Pugh regarding the Blood Residential School for the month of January, 1938.\n\nHEALTH, SANITATION, Etc.\n\nFire drill, escapes and protection ..... Yes. Letter attached re fire escape for junior children.\n\n(Sgd.) J. E. Pugh\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your report for the month of January regarding the Blood Residential School and have particularly noted the following statement in the letter of the Principal:\n\n\"I beg to refer to your serious consideration the fact that in this St. Mary's School no safe exit have been provided for the small children's dormitories located on the second floor of this building.

In official letter of July 24, 1937 you were advised regarding the amount available for repairs and improvements at the Blood School and you replied in a letter dated August but made no mention of the fire escapes. In view of this the Department is at a loss to understand why this matter has been overlooked if it is as urgent as the letter of the Principal would indicate.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nPlease let me have a complete report regarding the fire escapes at the Blood School and if you consider the present fire escapes should be extended please give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., February 22nd, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your file No. 103-2-5 of the 9th instant, with reference to the matter of fire escapes, Blood Indian R.C. School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that this matter came up when I made my monthly inspection of this school, and as is my custom, I ask if fire drill is being kept up, and the Rev. Father Levern and Assistant Principal, Rev. Father Charbon, mentioned this subject matter, and I requested their statement in writing.\n\nThis, I may say, was the first time that the matter of the safety of the children on the second floor was brought to my attention, and was not mentioned last August, when dealing with the repairs etc. under estimates provision.\n\nI interviewed the Fathers on the 15th, I also visited the school, the Fathers being absent on the reserve, and on the latter date I checked over the fire escape provision made, and I am enclosing rough sketches showing the lay out of escapes, and the outside connections to windows and doors of the building respectively for the three floors. From this it will be noted that the top floor exit is by doors, 2nd floor by windows. This latter is the one point of issue, and it is noted that the exit here is by windows on both ends of the building. The windows are the customary sash window, sliding upwards for a half sash length, and I note that outside there are storm windows on, with hook catches on the inside. In front of the window (as per the attached rough sketch, No. 1 & 2) is a radiator and the distance from floor to window ledge is 33\u00bd\", and this could be improved upon with some expense, by replacing the window with a hinged door of the full length of window opening so that the passage out to the fire escape (which has a landing at both points) could be made without crawling through the bottom half of the window. This would apply to both sides of the building. I would also suggest that steps be provided in front of the radiator to overcome the 33\u00bd\" from floor to window sill. I measured the distance from the doors of both dormitories across the corridor, and on the north, this distance is only 50 feet; on the south 50 feet, across a corridor and past the stair cases that lead up and down to the other floors, and if the provision made as outlined above are made, the exits in my opinion would be very good. Estimates are given for these changes.\n\nThe escapes themselves are good, and are as follows:- The escapes on the south end of the building goes from top floor to ground floor, with extension to ground.\n\nR.A. HOEY, ESQ.,\nSUPT. OF WELFARE & TRAINING,\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH,\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOn the north end, from top to ground floor and on to roof of laundry. There is no provision for the 12' drop off from this roof to ground, and separate estimate is given for an extension similar to south end.\n\nI am enclosing rough sketches, showing the various points entailed in this report, as the best means of conveying to you the situation.\n\nI do not think there is urgency in this, and it is my opinion that it could well be charged to the appropriation, if any, for 1938-1939, and the work, if authorized, done early in the Spring.\n\nThe sketches enclosed are as follows:\nNo. 1. West view of fire escapes outside building.\nNo. 2. Sketch and size of window exit and floor plan north end fire exit. Inside.\nNo. 3. Sketch and size of window exit and floor plan south end fire exit. Inside.\n\nCost. Making doors for replacing windows and steps for two exits, $81.85, including material and labour. Making extension steps, weighted, laundry roof to ground, $86.50, including material and labour.\n\nEstimate given by Mr. T. Weston of Cardston, approved list.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the fire escapes at the Blood Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter you may arrange immediately for making doors to replace the windows at the top of each fire escape, also steps for the two exits. It is noted that this work, including material and labour, will cost $31.65.\n\nOwing to lack of funds it is not possible to provide the other expenditure of $86.50 at the present time. I also note from your letter that you do not consider this latter work urgent. You might bring it to our attention early in April when the funds for the new fiscal year will be available and the matter will then receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the three vouchers which you recently submitted. On the account attached to voucher 501 and also on that attached to voucher 502 there are two items for labour, one for $26.25 and the other for $15.75. The exact dates on which the plumber and helper were employed should be shown on the account. On the account attached to voucher 503 there are also two items for labour, one for $23.75 and the other for $14.25. This account also should show the exact dates on which the plumber and helper were employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to thank you for your circular letter of the 10th inst., No. 150-65, and to tell you that we will do our best to follow your good advice. Now, in that circular, you say that any Principal who is not satisfied with the fire escape & fire prevention facilities should report to the Department; this gives me a good occasion to let you know that there is not one fire extinguisher nor any fire axe in this school house. It was one of the first things that I remarked when I was appointed to take charge of this school, and I am still wondering what may be the reason of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nThe following letter has just been received from the Principal of the Blood Residential School:\n\n\"I beg to thank you for your circular letter of the 10th inst., No. 150-65, and to tell you that we will do our best to follow your good advice.

J. K. Levern of Gardston, Alta., should have been forwarded to you directly.\n\nWe trust you will find them in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nof Canada, Limited,\n\nM. D. Maxwell,\nAssistant Manager.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., May 5th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that I have just been called to the Blood R.C. School of this Agency to find that the high pressure boiler there has sprung about 12 tubes in the top crown plate, while one tube has split.\n\nOn looking over this job, I am of the opinion that it will be necessary to renew all the tubes, and with this in view I have obtained the cost of this repair job from the only boiler people in Lethbridge or vicinity, the Lethbridge Iron Works, and the following is quoted by this firm:\n\n50 tubes, measuring 3' 4\u00bd\" long, a total of approximately 170 feet of 2\" tube at $0.75 per foot, $127.50, and labour costs at Lethbridge, 50 flues @ 1.50 per flue, $75.00, with an inspection fee of $5.00, a total of $207.50.\n\nThis boiler does about three days a week washing, and our water is bad for corrosion, and at inspection last Fall, under 300# water pressure, no sign of leak disclosed itself.

These were ordered through Mr. Flett of Cardston (approved list) and will be put into the well as soon as possible. Leathers had to be changed in the well.\n\nJ. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the month of May 1938.\n\nAs arranged with the Department the High Pressure boiler at the Blood R.C. school was re-tubed this month at Lethbridge, and is now installed again in satisfactory condition.\n\nJ. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am returning your voucher No. 645 in order to obtain some additional information.\n\nYou will note that in addition to the inspection fee we are requested to pay for the services of the inspector at the rate of $14.00 a day plus mileage.\n\nThe last account received for inspection of these boilers was forwarded from your office under cover of your voucher No. 901 of October 31, 1936. This only requested payment of fees and no charge was made either for services or mileage.\n\nPossibly the regulations are changed and the Provincial Government requires payment for the services of the inspector. Even so the charge of $14.00 a day seems rather high.\n\nI would appreciate receiving your explanation in the matter and at the same time you can return the voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your file No. 103-2-5, of the 16th instant, with reference to Voucher No. 645, for boiler inspection services.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that this service covered the inspection of the high pressure boiler received for use at the Blood R.C. School.\n\nThe regulations call for inspection of new-fired boilers before use, and as the work was done in Lethbridge, at the Iron Works, it became a special inspection under Section 17 of the Boiler Act, 1929, Chapter 73.\n\nThe rate of wages is as stated $14.00 per diem, with mileage at eight cents per mile.\n\nAuthority was given in telegram dated May 10th, 1938, and inspection followed, hence the special charge. Fee will not be charged on this boiler again this year. It is, therefore, recommended that payment be made of this voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

E. Pugh, Indian Agent, Cardston, which is self-explanatory.\n\nUpon receipt of same I made enquiries from the Butchers and Packers Supplies, Ltd., Calgary, reprices on a one-bag (100 pounds) -size machine: On July 24 I received their reply which reads, in part:\n\n\"In response to your enquiry for prices on Dough Mixers we are pleased to quote:\n\n'Fig. 2898 - one bag Super Dough Mixer,\nwith our new model patented Mixing Arm\nand bowl cleats and with 60 cycle, 3\nphase Motor, direct connected: $410.00,\n60 cycles, single phase motor, direct\nconnected: $420.00,\n\nThese one bag Super Mixers are quoted ex-\nclusive of cover.

On the back of this will be found a description of same.\n\nOn August 3rd I wrote the principal asking him to come to Calgary at as early a date as possible to discuss the matter with me, and if possible view the machine: He called on me this A.M. and whilst he did not see the machine, as the company do not stock same here, Rev. Charron says he is satisfied it will meet his requirements, and he is most anxious that same be supplied, as he claims he cannot do without same any longer.\n\nI strongly recommend that this machine be supplied and that the order be placed by the Department direct, as by doing so I am of the opinion that they can get a discount. Shipment is to be made to Cardston, Alta.\n\nThe motor required is a SINGLE PHASE. The School is on the Calgary Power Line.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nIn discussing the matter with the Principal, he stated that in view of the fact that an amount of $395.00 only had been placed in the Estimates, he would be prepared to pay the difference, if the Department so desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nOttawa, September 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEX'D.\n\nOn August 28, last, a requisition was sent forward from this Branch to the Purchasing Division, asking for the purchase of a dough mixer, at an estimated cost of $420.00, for use at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nI am this morning in receipt of a protest from the office of the Minister in respect to the purchase of this equipment. The officials are anxious to know if this dough mixer is being purchased to replace one already in use or if a dough mixer is being installed for the first time. In view of the war conditions now confronting us, we are carefully reviewing all such purchases, in the hope that by careful scrutiny we can reduce expenditures. The purchase of equipment such as this for residential schools has been brought up and reviewed by this Branch from time to time during the last two or three years. I am personally of the opinion that pupils in attendance at our residential schools should be encouraged, not only to bake bread, but to do a great deal of useful work, the accomplishment of which will train them for life on the reserves. It is just possible, however, that the mixing of dough for an institution as large as the Blood R. C. school might take up more of the students' time than could easily be spared from other duties.\n\nI should like you to go into this matter very fully with the Principal and let us have a comprehensive report on the matter. This report should serve as a guide not only in respect to this particular purchase but in respect to similar purchases at other residential schools. I feel confident the officials at the office of the Minister will be guided largely by your recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E.

School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 103-2-5 dated September 12th, 1939.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. L.A. 518\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of September 8, file 29418-15-2A, authorizing local purchase of a bungalow heater for use at the Blood R.C. residential school. I attach account covering the cost of this heater and I should appreciate your issuing purchase order so that it may be paid. The coding will be 750-76-12-415.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 103-2-5 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the purchase of a dough mixer at an approximate cost of $420.00 for the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that I have gone into this matter at this school and find the following conditions exist:\n\nQuantity of loaves baked per diem, 120 to 135\nflour used approximately 175 lbs.\nLabour used to do the mixing, a baker paid by the school authorities.\nSize of bake room, 10 feet wide by 22 feet long.\noven in the above room, 7 x 7, with three feet clearance back wall, 18\" on side wall.\nBread racks occupy one wall for steaming out, and then stored in cellar under school building, which is a damp location.\n\nThe bake room could not be used for hand mixing of dough by girls, aged 14 to 16 years, being small and baking temperature of 200\u00b0 in room. Sisters have been used and also big boys and was found harmful to both.\n\nProvision for teaching girls baking in all aspects is made classes being held in kitchen proper to teach baking in family size.\n\nThe Principal informs me that at the LeBret School, similar conditions for teaching girls baking are provided there. School staff and children number approximately 167 persons.\n\nThe dough mixer will be a new acquisition to this school. All dough mixing being done by hand previously.\n\nPrincipal would be satisfied with mixer of approximately 100 to 150 lb. flour size.\n\nIf mixer not provided, conditions for this work being carried out by girls would necessarily have to be improved by alterations to bakery room, and space does not readily permit of this.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn view of the fact that this school does carry out the desires of the Department, that the girls learn home cooking, and that the school population is large, requiring amounts of breed quoted, it is recommended that a mixer of the size suggested be provided.\n\nMonthly inspection reports on girls' classes of bakery can provide check on the Department's desires being carried out, and insistence upon such classes being one of the subjects reported upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.H. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 25, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nPURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI desire to refer to our requisition of October 21 for a dough mixer for the St. Mary's (Blood) R.C. Residential School. For your information, I enclose a copy of a letter just received from Indian Agent Pugh.\n\nIn view of the information contained in this letter, I recommend the purchase of a dough mixer. You will note that the Principal will be satisfied with a mixer of approximately 100 to 150 pounds flour capacity.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nHOYT HARDWARE LIMITED\nWHOLESALE AND RETAIL\n608-609 THIRD AVENUE SOUTH\nLETHBRIDGE, ALBERTA\nSeptember 5, 1938\n\nSOLD TO\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nJ.

Up to the present date the only recommendations that we have received from the Indian Agent are for expenditures of $30.00 for flooring and $24.00 for the purchase of an iron ladder for the fire escape. We have a small amount of money still available for repairs and improvements at this school if they are required and the Rev. Principal should forward his request in this regard through the office of Indian Agent Pugh.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.C.

School, the condition of the floor in the boys' playroom was brought to my attention.\n\nThis I found to be cracked and a section in the centre of the floor bulged and the concrete broken.\n\nI have had Mr. Ralph Weston, local contractor, check this over and he has advised that the cracks can be filled but the broken concrete will have to be dug out and relaid with cement. He also advises that the heaving of this floor is caused by the weight of the building not being evenly distributed.\n\nMr. Weston estimates the cost of repairing this floor at $25.00, and that the repairs will last for at least two years.\n\nAn item of $100.00 was included in the estimates 1941-42 for replacing this floor, and I would recommend that the repairs be attended to now and the replacing be left out of the estimates.\n\nIf this repair is authorized, I would request that this work be executed during the Christmas week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAnthony M.

Mines & Resources.\nBlood Indian Agency\nCardston\nDecember 29th 1940.\n\nI beg to make the following report on the water situation both the Blood R.C. School and the St Paul's Residential School, which necessitated the sending of a Night Lettergram dated December 29th 1940 as follows:\n\n\"Blood School deep well blocked by sand, no water, St Paul's School pumping sand with water, Recommend Rig clean both wells, Approximate cost cleaning both wells and emergency repairs, three hundred and fifty dollars. Will keep cost at minimum, Urgent.\"\n\nOn Saturday December 28th I was called to the R.C. School by Father Charron regarding no water, at the School and found the pump functioning but a very small flow of water at the start when pumping and after a few minutes it completely stopped, as new leathers had been put on the upper cylinder, it was certain that the trouble was the rise of sand in the well, or a breakage in the lower barrel, this could not be ascertained without the lifting of the pump and the pulling of the piping and cylinders. I went to Lethbridge and interviewed Joe Maughan Well Driller, and the price of $100.00 per well was made, to cover both Schools, the balance of amount quoted is to cover the possibility of the Lower Brass Barrels at both places, being replaced. There is also the prospect of the pump piping in place, have to be repaired or replaced.\n\nThe price of $100.00 per school covers the lifting of the pump casing rods etc., the cleaning of the well, and replacing of the pump and casing.\n\nI would draw your attention to the letter of the 18th September 1935 from Mr Puch which covers the technical points of the trouble which seems to have recurred again after 6 years of use.\n\nI will make every effort to keep the expense as low as possible, and will advise the Department immediately the work has been done as to the ultimate findings, as regards a normal flow of water for both schools in the future.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of mines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nClerk in Charge\nBlood Indian Agency\nCardston\nJanuary 5th 1941\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise further to my Air Mail letter File 402-11R.C. of the 29th of December, that after pulling the pump and cleaning out 18 feet of sand and going to the bottom of the originally drilled well the following situation has arisen.\n\nAfter replacing the brass bearing and checking all other parts, and setting up the pump, it was found that there was practically no water. The flow being 3 gallons of water in 4 minutes, as this will hardly supply the staff requirements, I advised Father Charron to advise the parents to keep the children at home until a normal supply of water is procured.\n\nBy today (Sunday) the upper floors of the School are without water, also the tank is now down to a depth of two feet of water, and the water supply diminishing rapidly.\n\nMr J Maughan is returning Monday and intends to extend the pump cylinder down 60 feet to see if we can strike the flow at that level, the bottom of the cylinder piping is now at a level of 106 feet, and the extension of 60 feet will bring the working barrel to 166 feet, if this does not bring a sufficient supply Mr Maughan is agreeable to try and lower the well a few feet to try and bring the stream back to normal. The success of this is doubtful and consequently I would greatly appreciate the Departments suggestion and advice to further action on this well. It will be a considerable expense to drill deeper in this well, and with this in mind may I be allowed to suggest that the advice of a member of the Waters Branch as the reason for the sudden stoppage before any further expense is assumed. The water supply of this well although pumping sand with the water has given a fair supply of water up till the sudden stoppage.\n\nI would like to state that there is no fear of the heating system, being cut off as this water is supplied from a soft water cistern, which I am informed will take the heating through till Spring.\n\nMay I have your answer to this letter by return Air Mail.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\nAnthony M Millan\nClerk In Charge.\nBlood Indian Agency\nCardston\nJanuary 5th 1940\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that since writing my letter of today's date Mr. R.A. Charbon has been in communication with Mr. Schmidt Inspector of Indian Affairs, Calgary, and he recommends if no water is available after test at lower level that I request authority to drill deeper to the extent of 50 feet if necessary. As water is absolutely necessary, and the school truck is now hauling drinking water from the agency may I have your reply to the above suggestion by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nClerge in charge\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nRNA267 11 COLLECT NM\n\nCARDSTON ALTA\n\nSECRETARY INDIAN AFFAIRS\nBRANCH DEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA\n\nRE: OUR LETTER FIFTH OPERATIONS UNSUCCESSFUL NO WATER\nWAITING INSTRUCTIONS\n\nA MACMILLAN CLERK IN CHARGE\n\n[Handwritten signatures]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, January 13, 1941.\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nChief, Training Bureau,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWith reference to your inquiry about the water supply for the Indian school on the Blood Indian Reserve located on section 18, Township 4, Range 25, west of 4th Meridian, I looked up the geological condition and the information we had from the nearest wells.\n\nThe school is located in an area underlain by the Willow Creek formation. This formation is usually very shaly with few beds of fine-grained sand. Judging from the fact that the reports show that coarse sand came into the well when it was cleaned I am inclined to believe that the water supply occurs in the formation below the Willow Creek on the St. Mary's formation. If this is the case there is a good chance that other water-bearing sands occur below the sand in which the present supply is obtained. To reach new sands it would be necessary to drill possibly a hundred feet deeper.\n\nThe chances are that the stoppage of the present supply is due to cavings of soft clay shale into the empty space left by the sand which has been withdrawn by pumping during the life of the well. If this is true it would be possible to obtain an adequate supply by drilling in a new location to the same horizon as that of the present well.\nIf the present well is deepened or a new well drilled the water-bearing sand should be properly screened to prevent the sand from flowing into the well. A metal screen will probably do although a gravel screen would give the best results.\n\nIf you should deepen the well or drill a new well you should have the driller keep samples of the rock he passes through in drilling. If there is any question about deeper drilling we will be better able to advise you as to what should be done if we have samples of the rock to identify the formation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.T.D. Wickenden,\nOfficer in Charge,\nWater Supply & Boring Section,\nGeological Survey.\nSir:\n\nReport St Mary's R.C. School well at Blood Agency.\n\nReference Mr A McMillan, clerk in charge, letter No 403-11 R.C., dated December 29th, and January 5th, I beg to report that this P.M. I have called at the School with Mr McMillan, and interviewed Mr J.P. Maughan of Lethbridge Alta, also Mr V C Sill of Macleod Alta, who states he operated the machine when this well was sunk in May 1924.\n\nThe following is a brief history of the well, 5 5/8 inch inserted joint steel casing was used, No written Log of the formation traversed was kept. From memory Mr Sill says \"the first hundred feet was clay and boulders, the next 90 feet was sandy clay formation; After the first 100 feet the casing had to be put in as drilling proceeded, because the formation would not hold (stand up). The casing drove in very tough the deeper we went the tougher it got to put it down, and we had to bind it in. The last 8 or 9 feet was pure sandstone with 1 or 2 feet of coarse sand & gravel. Water rose to within 20 feet of the surface. No screen was put in the bottom of the well.\n\n106 Feet of pump pipe was put in with a 30\" X 31 working barrel or pump cylinder, at the bottom, this worked nicely the water supply was plentiful.\"\n\nThe School staff say that the pump always brought up sand.\n\nIn September 1933 the well was cleaned, some 12 to 15 feet of sand was taken out of it, at the lower part of the casing, a new working barrel or cylinder was put in, the old one being worn out by pumping sand; See Agent Pugh's letter of September 18th 1933, the water again coming up to 22 feet from its surface.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nRev Father Charron who has been in charge since May 1937, states that the pump has been lifting sand continuously, and states that he has had to replace the leathers quite often, several times a year. About three weeks ago he noticed the water supply diminishing, he again changed the leathers but got no results, a few days later the flow was only about 1 gallon per minute for a few minutes, at a time.\n\nOn Thursday January 2nd 1941 Mr J P Maughan brought his outfit to the pump and cleaned the some 18 feet of sand out of the casing, he checked the working barrel carefully, put it back in but got no better results, about 3 gallons in four minutes.\n\nOn January 6th he again cleaned out about 4 feet of sand which had again accumulated in the bottom of the casing. There was no improvement in the flow of water, again the pump was taken out and some 22 feet of sand and mud had come up in the casing. He is now unable to stop sand and mud from coming up, and the water supply is not improving.\n\nIn conversation Mr Maughan stated that he thought that by lowering a five inch casing inside the present six inch one, and drilling the well deeper, that there was a chance of cutting the mud and sand that was heavy, and get a good flow of water in the lime strata or shale. Of course he cannot guarantee that this will be successful. If this is not successful we shall have chance of salvaging the casing (5\") If successful it will mean the purchase of new pump and piping of a smaller size.\n\nMy recommendation is that the Dominion Water Power Bureau be asked to take care of the work.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nC.P.Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMR C P SCHMIDT  \nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES  \nCALGARY ALTA\n\nREFERENCE YOUR LETTER NINTH INSTANT ADVISE AT ONCE COST PER FOOT OF DEEPENING WELL BLOOD SCHOOL ALSO PROBABLE ADDITIONAL DEPTH REQUIRED\n\nR A HOEY.\n\nPhoned to: 28  \nTime: 4:57 PM\n\nIndian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nRe Blood R.J.

Blanchfield, which reads:\n\n\"REFERENCE YOUR LETTER 9TH INSTANT ADVISE AT ONCE COST PER FOOT OF DEEPERING WELL BLOOD SCHOOL ALSO PROBABLE ADDITIONAL DEPTH REQUIRED.\"\n\nI beg to report that Mr. McMillan, Acting Agent, Rev. Father Charron and myself, have this day discussed the matter with Mr. J. Maughan who has submitted the following prices.\n\nLabor. Putting in new 5\" casing inside the old 6\" casing, 200 feet, labor $38.00\n\nDeepening well, $2.50 per foot, approximately 50 feet $125.00\n\nInstalling new working barrel and pipes (smaller size) $25.00\n\nMaterial. Cost of 250 feet 5\" inside diameter casing, inserted joints, at $1.10 per foot $275.00\n\nNew pump pipe, 2\" galvanized, @ 78\u00a2 per foot, approximately 150 feet $117.00\n\nNew 3\" x 30\" working barrel with ball valves, approximately $50.00\n\nWooden pump rods, 150 feet at 30\u00a2 $45.00\n\nTotal $375.00\n\nIf when deepening the well, sandstone is struck and this is followed by sand, gravel or mud, it will be necessary to reduce the casing to 4\" casing from the point where the sand stone was struck.\n\nThere is the possibility of the present well having some obstruction from the sides of the present casing making it impossible to put the 5\" casing down to the bottom.\n\nShould the deepening of this well be a failure, and it has to be abandoned, Mr. Maughan states that he is satisfied he can salvage the new 5\" casing put down. However, he will not guarantee this. He will not quote a figure for the labor salvaging this 5\" pipe, if it comes up easy there will be no charge, if it requires special equipment he may make a small charge per diem.\n\nIf authority is granted to proceed with the work, I would ask that Mr. McMillan be advised, and that he be instructed where he is to purchase the material, which he will order at once and advise Mr. Maughan by phone immediately it arrives. If water is not found after the additional 50' has been drilled, Mr. McMillan will inform the Department by wire.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIf it becomes necessary to sink a new well, I would suggest that this be a 6 5/8\" casing so that if trouble is met when drilling and the casing cannot be lowered any deeper a 5\" casing can be dropped in and drilling continued.\n\nMr. Maughan's price for drilling a new well will be $1.50 per foot. The cost of 6 5/8\" casing is approximately the same, $1.50. In addition to this there will be the expense of changing etc., water pipe connections, also a new motor as the one now being used operates the laundry equipment.\n\nThe present well is located in the North west corner of what is called the power room at the end of the laundry. A new well would have to be sunk outside the building.\n\nAs mentioned in Mr. McMillan's letter of the 5th instant, the pupils have returned to their homes on the reserve.\n\nI am leaving tomorrow for the Peigan Agency at Brocket and expect to return to Calgary on Saturday next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

He suggested, of course, that in the event of our digging a new well and finding water immediate arrangements be made for screening the well to prevent the sand from flowing into it.\n\nI also phoned Dr. Hume but he informed me that he had never visited the Blood Reserve nor had he done any work in the immediate vicinity of the Blood School.\n\nMr. Jackson further stated in my interview with him on January 16 that following the advice given by Dr. Wickenden and Dr. Hume it would be in order to issue instructions to Inspector Schmidt and that materials required could be purchased by Inspector Schmidt from firms on the approved list.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMR C P SCHMIDT  \nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES  \nCALGARY ALTA\n\nAFTER CONSIDERING YOUR LETTER FOURTEENTH INSTANT AND CONSULTING EXPERTS BELIEVE IT ADVISABLE TO DIG NEW WELL - STOP - EXPERTS CONSIDER IT LIKELY THAT WATER CAN BE SECURED AT THE TWO HUNDRED FOOT LEVEL WITHIN ANY REASONABLE DISTANCE OF THE PRESENT WELL - STOP - AIR MAIL LETTER IS GOING FORWARD\n\nR A HOEY\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Crerar,\nMinister, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonorable and Dear Sirs\u2014\n\nI wish to bring to your attention an emergency which demands immediate action on the part of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOn the Blood Indian Reserve, in the southern part of this province, St. Mary's R. C. Indian Reserve School, Cardston, has been without a water supply since January 4th last. At that date, the well which has supplied the school for the past 24 years was closed by the Department, reported dry, and recommendation for deepening or for the drilling of a new well was sent in. Although three reports and two night letters have been forwarded to Ottawa through the local Indian Agent and the Inspector of Indian Affairs, no response has been forthcoming.\n\nThe condition has wrought great hardship in the institution. Finding it impossible to convey water from the town of Cardston fifteen miles across a winter prairie, 145 children have been sent to their homes, many of them to homes in which conditions of starvation exist. The work of the school has been disrupted, and several weeks have been lost. The Department's authorization would solve the difficulty, but no one can explain the delay in granting it.\n\nI regret that I have to bother you with this matter, but the situation is far more serious than may appear to the Department. May I respectfully ask you to have it investigated immediately so that the excellent work, which the Indian Department has conducted through this school, may be resumed without further delay.\n\nThanking you and with my personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrancis P.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a letter which I have sent today to the Honorable Mr. Crerar concerning a serious situation existing at St. Mary's R.C. Indian Reserve School on the Blood Reserve, Alberta. The letter explains the matter. May I ask your good co-operation in bringing to an immediate solution this situation which has hampered tremendously the work of the school.\n\nAssuring you of my appreciation of anything you may do to remove the difficulty,\n\nI am\n\nYours cordially,\n\nFrancis P.

FETTERLY OR SOME OTHER OFFICIAL OF DOMINION WATER POWER BUREAU AND REV-BREND CHARRON PRINCIPAL BE PUT IN CHARGE OF NEW WELL FOR BLOOD R.C. SCHOOL STOP WRITING\"\n\nMr. Schmidt says that the connection of the new well with the high water tank outside the building, and the purchase and installation of a new electric motor for pumping, are matters involving technical points, and should only be decided by expert and experienced men, which is the reason why he asks that an official of the Dominion Water Power Bureau take charge, in co-operation with Rev. P.A. Charron, Principal of the School.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Schmidt says that the selection of the proper screen is a matter of great importance, as \"any kind\" of a screen will not do. If mud, silt or fine sand is found in the water, a special size of mesh is required; therefore he suggests that the same procedure as was followed at Blue Quills School in 1898, be followed here: i.e., that a sample of the mud, sand or silt be sent to the manufacturer of the screen, to determine the size required. (Mr. Fetterly informs me that the screen for Blue Quills was purchased from Crane's Ltd., Calgary, who procured it through E. E. Johnson Inc., St. Paul, Minn., it being a \"Cook\" screen. Crane's Ltd. advise that in ordering a screen, the capacity of the pump, size of casing, depth of well and a sample of the sand (a pound or two), should be given).\n\nMay we be advised, please, as to what action the Department take in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Carroll, D.D., Bishop of Calgary, dated Jan. 22nd, in this same matter, which would seem to be one requiring IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.\n\nWith a draft reply to Bishop Carroll for the Minister's signature, please also furnish a report for the Minister's information.\n\nEncl.

In this telegram the clerk stated that the well was blocked by sand and would require cleaning and emergency repairs. The clerk was authorized, by telegram, dated December 30, to proceed with the repairs that he might find necessary.\n\nIn a telegram dated January 21, 1941, the clerk reported: \"Operations at well unsuccessful; no water; awaiting instructions\".\n\nImmediately following receipt of this letter, the desirability of providing an adequate water supply at the Blood School was discussed by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch with the officer in charge of the Water Supply and Boring Section of the Geological Survey Division of this Department. After the matter had been thoroughly discussed and an expression of opinion secured from the Well Boring Division, a telegram dated January 17, 1941, was sent to Inspector Schmidt, asking him to proceed with the construction of a new well at\n\nthe Blood -\n\nRight Reverend Francis P. Carroll, D.D.,\nBishop of Calgary,\n210 Seven A Street, N.W.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nthe Blood School. It is just possible, however, that Inspector Schmidt was ill and confined to bed at this date and consequently not in a position to carry out the instructions sent forward to him. His clerk, in a radiogram dated Calgary, January 31, states:\n\n\"Mr. Schmidt in bed with Grippe. He asks that some other official of Dominion Water Power Bureau and the Principal of the School be put in charge of constructing new well at Blood School\".\n\nInspector Schmidt's clerk was instructed in a telegram dated January 24, to communicate with Reverend Father Charron, Principal of the School, and authorize him to proceed immediately with the construction of a well.\n\nI must express regret at the delay that has occurred in the construction of this well. In view of all the circumstances, however, I cannot see how this delay could have been avoided. It is altogether likely that by this date the well is at least partly constructed and it is my hope that an adequate supply of water will be available at the institution, immediately following the completion of the work now in progress.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJan. 25/47\nOttawa, January 25, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Water Supply, St. Mary's School,\nBlood Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nIn response to the request contained in Mr. Pratt's memorandum of January 24, 1941, I am sending forward herewith a letter, for the signature of the Minister, addressed to Right Reverend Francis P. Carroll, Bishop of Calgary.\n\nThere is little that I can add to the information supplied in the letter addressed to the Bishop. The delay in the construction of this well, it would appear, was due to the belief on the part of the clerk in charge that an adequate water supply could be secured by cleaning out the old well and to the period of time necessary to discuss the desirability of boring a new well with the official in charge of the Water Power Bureau. When this official was interviewed by Mr. Phelan, he naturally took the position that a certain amount of time would be required to make a thorough study of the geological character of the land on the reserve, the water levels, etc. When the matter was referred to Mr. Jackson, he suggested that the desirability of boring this well should also be discussed with Mr. Hume, of the Geological Survey Division. When interviewed, he intimated that he had done no work in this particular section of the Dominion and was consequently not in a position to express an opinion in respect to the matter.\n\nIt is a matter of extreme regret that the Principal in charge of this School should find it necessary -\nnecessary to return 145 pupils to their homes at this particular season of the year. The desirability of having emergent work of this character undertaken by the Inspector, employing experienced well drillers thoroughly familiar with local conditions, might be carefully reviewed. It is the only method I can think of that would enable us to avoid delay when such emergencies arise from time to time.\n\nDirector.\n\nJan. 25/41\n\nRAH\nOttawa, January 27, 1941\n\nDear Mr. Fairbairn:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your telegram of January 25, in which you intimated that the St. Mary's School, at the Blood Reserve, has been without water for a period of 2 weeks.\n\nYou will be glad to learn that Mr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Alberta, was instructed, in a telegram dated January 17, 1941, to proceed with the construction of a new well at the Blood School. I have just learned, however, that Inspector Schmidt was ill and confined to bed when the telegram reached him and consequently not in a position to proceed with the work. In a telegram dated January 24, the clerk of the agency was authorized to communicate with the Principal of the School and to proceed immediately with the construction of the well. It is altogether likely that the work is well under way by this date and that an adequate supply of water will be available at the institution in the course of a few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. E.

It was our opinion that the instructions issued to you in official telegram of January 17 were very definite and explicit. The matter was further discussed in an air mail letter addressed to you, also on January 17.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why you did not issue instructions to the Principal to proceed immediately with the actual work of construction. The information with respect to the best type of pump and the selection of a proper screen are matters that surely could have been taken up with the experts or with the Department, later.\n\nIt is my understanding that Mr. Fetterly's office is in the Federal Building at Calgary. In view of this fact, I am anxious to know why you did not find it convenient to consult him with respect to the pump and the screens and in this way secure his advice and guidance. It is noted that in your letter of January 21 you suggest that a sample of the mud, sand or silt be sent to the manufacturer of the screen to determine the size required. This appears to me to be a reasonable suggestion and one that might be acted upon by an inspector on his own initiative.\n\nI am sending forward, for your information, a summary of the steps that have been taken to supply water at the Blood School. When you have read this summary you will feel convinced, as I have become convinced, that this is a striking illustration of how public business should not be conducted, and certainly an illustration of how public business should not be conducted in a period as critical -\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nENCL.\ncritical as the one in which we find ourselves at the moment. It seems to me that unless our officials in the field, and particularly our inspectors, are prepared to assume more responsibility in these matters, there is going to be nothing but trouble ahead for all of us.\n\nI have been asked to prepare a full statement of this case for the Director and for the Minister, but before doing so I am anxious to have from you a full explanation as to why in your judgment this delay has taken place and why the Principal of the School, in this inclement weather, was compelled to send 145 pupils back to their homes because of our failure to provide the institution with water.

I received a call by telephone from Mr. J.P. Schmidt Inspector of Indian Agencies Calgary, advising me that he had returned to the Office, after being under the Doctor's care for a week, asking me to come to Calgary along with Father Charron of the Blood School Cardston, and Mr. Joe Maughan well Driller Lethbridge. I left the Agency along with the above parties and arrived at the Calgary Office at 11 o'clock on the morning of the 28th January. During the 28th and 29th of January we went into all the details regarding the drilling of a new well, and the following are the prices received regarding the drilling of the new well which is now in progress, with a detail of work considered to complete the project.\n\nDRILLING OF WELL\n\nAs mentioned in previous correspondence the price quoted by Mr. Joe Maughan for drilling of $1.50 per foot was agreed to. The casing caused considerable time to decide on as the 6-7/8 casing previously mentioned in recent letters was not procurable, and the price of this casing if it had been possible to get it had increased to about $2.00 per foot owing to war price increase. After considerable time had been spent 6\" Line Casing was located at the price of $1.82 per foot F.O.B. Calgary, the moving of this piping from Calgary to Macleod was taken care of by the firm supplying the casing, and will be included on their account when received; it was also found necessary to have a shoe made to force the casing down the well, and 2 extra collars to connect short lengths of pipe needed when the well is at the lower levels. The shoe costs $20.00, and the extra collars $1.75 each, and will all be included in the Account from Wilkinson & McLean of Calgary who received the contract.\n\nThe question of a Gravel Screen was taken up, and it was found that this would have to be made by A.G. Cooke of Lawrenceburg Indiana U.S.A., Mr. Maughan wrote to him at the Calgary Office advising him to be prepared to make the necessary screen when samples from the bottom of the well had been taken out and shipped to him by express from Coutts, so as to save any delay, the cost of this screen is unknown at present until the screen has been made; Mr. Maughan has undertaken to have this come to him and he will release same from the Customs, and the cost of the screen will appear on his account when sent in.\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources\nOttawa\nDRILLING OF WELL (contd)\n\nThere will also be a charge of approximately $50.00 by Mr. Vaughan for the placing of the screen in the bottom of the well when completed, owing to the necessity of raising the casing to sink the screen in place. Attention has been paid to the Department's request for samples and sacks have been obtained and samples have been kept of the soil formation in the well and will be forwarded to Ottawa as requested. The purchase of a Working Barrel cylinder will be reported on under Cost of changing water pipe connections.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF PIT.\n\nIf drilling is successful and water in sufficient quantities is available, there will then be the digging of the pit and the enclosing of the pit with concrete walls, this pit will connect with the present Boiler Room of the School. This will cause the digging out of a pit 12' X 12' or 12' X 9' where the well is drilled, the cutting of a doorway from the Boiler Room to the pit through a 16\" concrete wall, enclosing of the pit with concrete walls, laying of a concrete floor, and the building of a reinforced concrete roof with a manhole in centre to allow of the pulling of the pump when necessary. The manhole to be covered with a zinc top to stop any leakage into pit. Gravel for this work has to be hauled a distance of 25 miles. This estimate from a local contractor R. Weston, Cardston, is complete for this work and amounts to the sum of $300.00, with an addition of $10.00 if the pit is extended from 12'x9' to 12'x12'.\n\nCONNECTING PIPES.\n\nThis item covers the cutting of pipes and connecting pump to the main water line which runs to the water tower, the installation of all valves and check valves and laying of drain pipe to run any overflow to the nearest trap. $50.00 of this estimate covers the purchase and attaching a new Working Barrel Cylinder to the pump, and is done on the advice of Mr. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Branch, and Mr. Vaughan who recommend against the putting in of the old Working Barrel, into a new well. The present working barrel has been in the well since 1932 and may at any time perforate as the brass is badly worn. This article has also to be purchased in the United States, but will be taken care of by the local plumber at the price quoted. I might state that in previous correspondence the price of $50.00 was quoted but this price was taken from the cost of a working barrel purchased in 1932, this work has been placed in the hands of Mr. Flett of Cardston at the quotation of $185.00.\n\nMOTOR ATTACHMENTS & MOTOR.\n\nPrices on this work were taken on both the Single Phase and the three phase system of lighting connections. As the prices received showed the single phase motor quoted at almost double the price of the Three phase motor, and the single phase motor very difficult to procure, it was decided to do any purchasing on the basis of the Three Phase. This involved the changing of the single phase now in use from the Calgary Power Co to a three phase system, however when visiting the Calgary Power Co in regard to the change, we were advise that this change would not cost the Department any expense the Power Co making the necessary change, and adding a monthly service charge extra to the Blood School of $2.00 per month which was agreed to by Father Charron. As will be seen by the quotations enclosed, the prices received from the Canadian Firms.\nMotor & Motor attachments.\n\nCanadian Firms, Canadian Westinghouse & General Electric, were the same, and as the Wilkinson & McClean quoted on a motor the name of which was not mentioned, although slightly less we understood repairs would be hard to get for it, it was decided to pace this work with Cardston Motors who were the only party to make a bid for the installation, and who would use the Canadian Westinghouse Motor. This bid amounts to the sum of $1627.44 covering the purchase of Motor, switches, and installation.\n\nBelting.\n\nThe purchase of a pulley and belting V Type I have been advised will be approximately $75.00, however the Cardston Motors are making enquiries as to whether the pulley wanted is available, and will inform me as soon as possible. If this letter has not been mailed by the time I receive, I will quote the exact price when received. This will be installed by the Cardston Motors of Cardston.\n\nAPPROXIMATE COST OF WELL (as known) on basis of 240 feet.

At the present time the Driller is down 150 feet, and I will make a further report if water is not located around the 200 foot level.\n\nI trust the Department will acquiesce in the action taken up to the present time.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nAnthony M.

However when the well was checked we found that only a foot of sand was in the bottom of the well, so samples of the sand formation were immediately taken, and Father Charron air mailed them from Browning Montana so as to expedite the return of the screen from Indiana. I went to Lethbridge to arrange for the immediate release of same when the screen arrived in Lethbridge, we are satisfied that the flow of water is the best they have had at the school, and hope that with the screen installed that this will give a very satisfactory well. It is our intention when when completing the well to put the pump tubing and piping to the bottom of the well, so as to keep the Screen from filling up with sand. No extra work as the digging of the pit and the installing of the motors will be done until the screen has been installed and the well tested on 24 hour run.\n\nI will advise further when the screen has been put in place and the test made.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nBlood Indian Agency\nCardston, Feb. 3rd 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith Report for the month of January 1941, together with copy of Diary for the same month.\n\nSchools:\n\nConsiderable time has been put in at the Blood School in connection with the well at this School.

Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just received your last letter and thank you for the interest you are taking in this question. I realize the seriousness of this question and hope that the decision to be taken will be the proper one.\n\nI wish likewise to thank you for the prompt and thorough attention given to the problem of water at the Cardston School. They have found water at 200 feet that rose to about 20 feet from the surface. I trust this will turn out well.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. [Last name]\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your No. 103-2-5 of the 28th ultimo, re the Blood R.C. School well. I must first ask to be excused for not having replied sooner; I beg to say that the reason for this was that I was confined to my home, and for the greater part of the time to my bed, being quite sick. I returned to the office on the 13th instant, feeling better, but still somewhat weak and subject to head-aches.\n\nI can appreciate your feeling disturbed when receiving letters from outsiders which led you to think that there was unnecessary delay in starting drilling on the new well; taking everything into consideration from this end, however, I do not think there was any undue delay.\n\nI was sick in bed when the contents of your letter of the 17th ultimo, received at this office on the 20th, were made known to me. \u2014 May I be allowed to remark that I was in doubt as to whether this was an authority to proceed with the sinking of a new well, as it also asked what the cost of other work in connection with a new well would be. \u2014 I immediately asked Miss Blanchfield to write and wire the Department asking that someone from the Dominion Water and Power Bureau be put in charge of the well. A reply to this was received by wire on the 24th ultimo; Father Charron was informed at once, and work on the new well (drilling) was commenced on Monday, January 27th.\n\nI asked Rev. Father Charron, Mr. A. McMillan, Clerk in Charge, and Mr. Maughan, the well driller, to come to Calgary on the 28th ultimo, which they did.\n\nThe 6 5/8\" casing recommended by Mr. Maughan, which was to cost $1.50 per foot, could not be procured; (this size is not now manufactured). I therefore ordered full 6\" lined pipe, at a cost of $1.88 per foot; also a new shoe \u2014 $20.00; and extra collars at $1.75 each. These were sent out immediately.\n\nWe also discussed and obtained prices on a new electric motor to operate the pump; also the excavating, &c., of a pit to house same. These matters were reported to the Department by Mr. McMillan, at my request.\n\nMr. P.A. Fetterly of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau was with us on the 28th ultimo, and gave us some pointers on certain matters. I had tried to contact him several times: before; twice before going to the Blood Reserve on the 9th of January, and again after my return; but was unsuccessful, as he was out of the city.\n\nAs regards the pupils having been sent back to their homes: This was done before I was informed that the water supply at the school had failed; and I think it was the proper thing.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nO T T A W A .\nthing to do, as it would have been most risky and unsafe to keep them in the building without a proper water supply, in case of fire. Also, should the sewers have become blocked, and sickness broken out, we would have been in a terrible predicament. -- As regards the weather having been inclement, I do not wish to contradict anyone; However, I must say that according to old residents of Southern Alberta, the winter of 1940-41 has so far been the mildest ever known to them, and so far has been without a storm or blizzard.\n\nI trust the above explanation will satisfy the Director and yourself, and that you will agree that there was no undue delay and everything was done to expedite the sinking of the new well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nSir:-\n\nBlood R.C. School Well\n\nI beg to advise further to my letter of the 7th inst., the following is a complete report to date of the work done on this well.\n\nAfter striking a good flow of water at the depth of 206', and testing the flow for 6 hours after which the pump rods broke, after they had been fixed and pumping started over again, it was found that a large quantity of sand was passing through the pump and increasing all the time. The sand turned out to be quick sand and although the sample had been sent to Cooke Boren Co Indians to have a screen made it was felt that unless the large flow of sand could be controlled the screen when installed would gradually fill up and clog the screen.\n\nWhile awaiting the delivery of the screen numerous tests were made to see if the well had cleared of the sand and on February 14th after consultation with Father Charron we decided to drill the well deeper to try and locate water in the Limestone; this was done and the well was lowered to 245 feet, and we have now a fine flow of water without showing of sand. The well screen has arrived in Lethbridge and will be installed tomorrow, if the well shows no sign of sand, and the flow after the test is satisfactory, every effort will be made to have the pit dug and the pump room fixed up, pipe connections made and the motor installed, with as little delay as possible.\n\nI understand Father Charron intends to reopen School as soon as possible, and as connections are being temporary made to the Tower he hopes to have the children back in school at the end of this week.\n\nIn authorizing the deepening of the well I did this for the benefit of trying to fulfill the Department's request to expedite the finding of water for this School, and trust you will concur in the extra drilling authorized.\n\nA further report along with the vouchers will be forwarded on completion of this well.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nAnthony McNally\n\nSecretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 25, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant reporting on the work done in connection with the new well at the Blood Residential School. It is noted that this well has been drilled to a depth of 245' and that there is apparently no sign of sand. Your action in deepening the well is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The drilling has been completed, gravel screen and pump have been installed, and the concreteing of the pit started and will be finished by March 7th, when the plumbing and motors will be installed. I am forwarding with this letter vouchers to cover drilling and expenses incurred in placing screen in the bottom of well, as follows.\n\n**Drilling Installing Pump & Screen**\n\nTotal depth of the well is 245 feet at $1.50 per foot amounting to $367.50. Well Test of 24 Hours at $1.50 made at the 205 foot mark $30.00. This test proving that the water was coming through quick sand, and was filling the well with sand, this caused the deepening of the well to 245 feet where water was located in sand stone. At the 245 foot mark a test of 12 Hours was made at $1.50 per foot making $18.00. This was followed by the installation of the gravel screen after which the test was renewed for another 12 Hours at $1.50 costing $18.00. The installation of the screen cost $40.00 this account having been arranged for with the well driller while discussing the new well in Calgary. The 25 feet of casing supplied by Mr. Maughan was 5\" inside diameter to assist in putting in the screen, and replaces the piping charged by Wilkinson & Mclean from whom we received a credit note, and was threaded to suit gravel screen. The small items charged on this account took care of the necessary repairs needed to put casing in shape, and welding and pipe hook to lower screen into well, machining and threading plug to fit connections from wooden rod to cylinder these items paid by Mr. Maughan total $7.25 for which receipts are attached, making the total of $322.50. The well driller during tests lowered the pump four times and pulled it three times without charge. The working barrel shipped from Indiana will be reported on when plumbing connections are made and Mr. Flett's account is sent forward.\n\n**Gravel Screen**\n\nThis screen was ordered from A D Cooke Lawrenceburg Indiana, was shipped C.O.D. to Mr. Maughan and the accounts enclosed with voucher will show the different items to make the total value of the screen as purchased in the U.S.A., as $108.45. These are made up as follows:\n- C.P. Express $2.59\n- Value of screen $92.15\n- Premium on Canadian funds $10.14\n- C.O.D. Charges 17 cents making a total of $108.45. The entry for Home Consumption sheet shows Duty $26.00, Tar Exchange tax $10.50, Sales Tax $10.48 and charge of broker to handle release $1.50 Total $48.50 making a total cost of $153.95. This is payable to Mr. J P Maughan without commission on his part. A sketch of the installation of the Screen is attached it being put in, in 4 and 6 foot lengths.\nCasing\n\nThis Voucher made out to Wilkinson & McLean covers:\n1 only shoe $25.00, 241 feet of 6\" Standard pipe at $1.8193 per foot amounting to $438.75, 4 extra 6\" Black recessed couplings at $7.58 each amounting to $30.32. The balance of account is Cartage from Calgary covered by receipt from Freightways amounting to $15.60 or a total cost of $504.67 less a credit note of $31.84 for 17\u00bd feet at $1.8193 returned, making Wilkinson and McLean account $472.83.\n\nThe excavation of the pit is completed and concrete is being poured, as soon as this is completed, the plumbing connections will be made and the motors installed. A further report will go forward to cover the completion of this work along with the Vouchers covering the accounts.\n\nFor the information of the Department I wish to advise that on the completion of drilling of the new well, Father Charbon in conjunction with his Church Authorities asked Mr. Laughlin to place a 4\" casing in the old well and try and drill deeper, this was done and the well carried to a depth of 215 feet, where they introduced a 3\" casing inside diameter and went down to a dept of 245 feet, where they got supply of water, this cost the School Authorities around $700.00, but giving a very small hole to get the water through, however this will always give this School a surplus well to fall back on if the new well at any time had to be shut down. This is for the Departments information only, no expense being incurred against us.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAnthony M.

I am forwarding with this report Vouchers covering the excavation of the new pump house and the work in completing the Pump Room, the work in connection with the plumbing and supplying of working barrel and the installation of the Motors.\n\nConstruction of Pump House.\n\nThe voucher covering this work with Tender attached, is made out on the basis of making the Pump room 12' X 12', instead of 18' X 9', the difference being covered by an extra charge of $10.00 as shown in the original estimate. Total $310.00\n\nConnecting Pipes and Water Barrel.\n\nThis Voucher covers the installing of Pump on new base, and the connections changed to the tower, the installation of all valves and check valves, and laying of drain pipe to run any overflow into trap. The Working Barrel Cylinder for this well is the only item in the whole estimate which has run over. This was caused by the following, Mr Flett on being asked for an estimate quoted $85.00 the price quoted him by an Edmonton firm, who intended to purchase in eastern Canada. Owing to the inability to get same this was ordered from Indiana U.S.A. and as this party had no Brass Barrels or any Barrel 36\" they supplied a brass lined Working Barrel 48\" and this Barrel on its arrival in Cardston cost $100.00. This Changes Mr Fletts account from $185.00 to $285.00, this is the only change from the original estimates to be made. Total Account $285.00\n\nMotor Attachment and Motor.\n\nThis Voucher covers the installation of the Motors, supplying pulleys and installation, and is now finished. Total Cost $232.84.\n\nThis concludes the expenses in connection with the above well, and I might say that a very nice job has been made of the work done, and I am informed by Father Charron that he is very well satisfied with the work as done. The well is now giving a very strong flow of water, and I am satisfied is going to give this School excellent service for a long time to come.\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\nAnthony M.

He advised me that through some misunderstanding he has just received an account from the Plumber Mr Frank Flett for 100 Gwanzied Pipe (106 Feet) 100 Feet Octagonal Pump rod, amounting to $168.46. This was charged to Father Charron but was in connection with the well drilled in January and February of this year, and was done by the Driller and Father Charron when it was found necessary to sink the water barrel, and change the pump rod to new rods, this seems to have been held by Mr Flett from February 14th and billed Father Charron on July 17th which he received on his arrival home from the East.\n\nThis was never brought to my attention at the time although it was the wish of the Department at the time to have new material put in the well, and Father Charron has now asked me to request that he be allowed to pay this account out of the sum allowed in the Estimates, as quoted above, the balance of the $400.00 he wishes to rebuild the coping on the top of the School, I will get an estimate on this and advise further,\n\nMay I have the Authority of the Department to Voucher for the Flett Account out of this amount, so that this delayed bill may be cleaned up.\n\nYour Obedient servant\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 27, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant and note the misunderstanding re the galvanized pipe for the well at the Blood Residential School.

McMillan,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nExtract from Inspector Schmidt's report on the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School dated February 10, 1942.\n\nMAIN BUILDING\n\nAs usual, I found this very clean and tidy. The dormitories are spotless and well aired.\n\nThe coping -- cement blocks -- on top of the brick walls, is becoming loose. The filling between the blocks is crumbling, and allows the rain and snow to penetrate. This water runs down the walls, and affects the inside plaster, which is becoming stained, and in some places loosening from the lath. There is now a danger of considerable damage being done to the inside walls, more so to the upper part (corners). I was told that some seven or eight years ago these joints were filled with Tremco; if so, this does not appear to be the remedy for the trouble. It might be necessary to remove all the coping blocks, build forms, and run fresh concrete to make a solid piece all around the top of the walls; or perhaps the present coping blocks could be covered over with some sort of asphalt mixture or compound, which would make it air- and water-tight. I am asking the Principal to call on the District Resident Architect at Calgary and discuss the matter with him on his next visit to the City.\n\nThe cement floor in the boys' playroom is again cracking: The crack runs at an angle from the S.E. corner of the room, across to the centre of the outside (North) wall. I am told this cracked some years ago, when it was patched with cement. It is now cracking again, and the concrete is chipping and crumbling for several inches on each side of the crack. There is something peculiar about this crack, which angles across the room, and which appears to have heaved a bit. It might be that there is a soft, wet spot, or a vein of water passing at this particular place. The floor needs to be repaired immediately, as there is danger of the boys tripping in this crack.\nwhile playing. I have asked that this matter be attended to without delay.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThis is sufficient for all present needs. The top of the large kitchen range is badly warped, and that part immediately over the fire box is badly burned. I suggested to the Principal and the Agent, that they make enquiries at the closest foundry -- Lethbridge or Calgary -- re having a new top made; or write to the manufacturers and make enquiries. I stated that I would mention this in my report.\nOttawa,\nMarch 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your report of February 10 on your inspection of the Blood Residential School. I note your statement that the cement floor in the boys' playroom must be repaired immediately. If this work can be done at a reasonable figure and completed before the end of March you may issue the necessary instructions.\n\nIf a top for the kitchen range can be secured locally you may purchase it provided, of course, that the account can be forwarded here before the end of March.\n\nI note that you have directed the Principal to call on the District Architect at Calgary with reference to the coping on top of the brick walls at the school. No doubt you will report later what repairs are necessary and their cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.F.

Weston\nI would recommend that if funds are available that a contract be made with Mr. R. Weston for this amount. If there is any difficulty authorising the completion of this work may I be advised immediately, as we are now going ahead with the funds available to complete as much as can be done within the amount allowed; that is $231.54. May I have your assistance in placing this matter before the Department.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nAnthony McMillan\nActing Indian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to advise on receipt of your letter 402-11A R.C., of the 13th inst that on Sunday March 15th in conjunction with Rev P.A. Charren and Mr Weston of Cardston we discussed the repairing of the coping around the wall of the St Mary's R.C. School.\n\nAs Rev P.A. Charren while in Calgary interviewed Mr E.T. Brown District Resident Architect regarding the work, and he advised that a cement coping be run around the walls, on the same basis as the small repair done some years ago when the coping on the South west corner was blown off during a high wind, and which gave complete satisfaction.\n\nAs the sum available is $231.54 out of this year's estimate of $400.00 will not complete this work, and as a considerable portion of the expense in doing this work will be taken up in building a scaffold to be able to do the work I would request and recommend that if funds are available that this work be completed at the present time while we are using the available monies as authorized. The complete statement of Mr Weston showing equipment and material and labor is attached amounting to $665.00 of which $231.54 is available and would request that authority be granted to complete this work at an added cost of $633.46. This amount is shown on his statement, but Mr Weston has agreed to accept a contract of $800.00 to complete this work.\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esqr\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n507 Public Building\nCalgary.\nSir:\n\nReference my letter, even file number, of the 7th ultimo, addressed to Rev. P.A. Charron, Principal of St. Mary's Indian Residential School, re repairs to coping blocks on top of the walls of the School building, the Department have written me as follows:\n\n\"I note that you have directed the Principal to call on the District Architect at Calgary with reference to the coping on top of the brick walls at the school. No doubt you will report later what repairs are necessary and their cost.\"\n\nRev. Father Charron was in this office today and informed me that he has discussed the matter with Mr. E.T. Brown, District Resident Architect. Father Charron will discuss this matter with you, and I would ask you to immediately prepare a statement, as detailed as possible, of the cost of doing these repairs. Let me have this statement, together with your covering letter, in DUPLICATE.\n\nI understand you have an unexpended balance of $275.00 from the $400.00 allowed for repairs at this School for this fiscal year; If this is not sufficient to cover the whole cost, you might ask the Department, in your covering letter, if they would grant the balance required to complete the repairs fully, and thereby complete the job this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nR. McMillan, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCARDSTON, Alta.\n\nCopy given to Father Charron.\nSir:\n\nReference your letter No. 103-2-5 of the 2nd instant, re coping stones on the Blood Indian Residential School, (R.O. - St. Mary's): I beg to report that on the 16th instant, Rev. P.A. Charron, the Principal, called on the District Resident Architect, Mr. E.T. Brown, here in Calgary. He then mentioned the matter to me, when I wrote to Mr. A. McMillen, the Acting Indian Agent, copy of which letter I am attaching hereto.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. McMillen, attached to which is a statement from Mr. R. Weston of Cardston, giving the cost of completing the job of removing the loose coping stones now on top of the walls, and replacing same with one solid piece of concrete.\n\nThe replacing of these coping stones will have to be done sometime soon; otherwise the inside walls (plaster) will be damaged.\n\nMr. McMillen is asking for an immediate reply: I should be pleased to receive a copy of same for my file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

School, I am now in\nreceipt of a Circular letter from the Department asking\nthat Fire Drills and more care be given to Fire Prevention\nin our Schools. I would therefore ask that you recommend\nthe following changes in order to provide adequate exit for\nthe Boy's overflow Dormitory, in order to correct this I\nwould make the following changes:-\n\n1. Transform the double window in stairway leading from the\nFirst Floor to the Second Floor, into a glassed double door.\n2. Build a Steel platform leading away from this door and\nresting on the outside Porch.\n3. From this Platform run a Steel ladder to the ground.\n4. Reverse the last flight of present Fire Escape in order\nto remove the danger of escape from Laundry roof and the\njump of 14 Ft. to be made before reaching the ground and\nsafety. This would lead to the new Fire Escape.\n\nI would like to do this work at my own expense as soon\nas authority is received.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSIGNED:- Rev. P.A. Charron.\nPRINCIPAL.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta,\n30th March, 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that while on a recent visit to the R.C. (St. Mary's) Indian Residential School, the Principal, Father Charren took me over to the North wing of the School to show me certain improvements which he wishes to make at his own expense.\n\nIn looking at requested changes, I noted that at present that the Fire Escape on the Boy's side (North Wing), finishes on the Roof of the Kitchen\u2014the most likely place for a fire to start\u2014and that the remaining distance from the Kitchen Roof to the ground (Fourteen Feet) is without the benefit of a Ladder to enable anyone to reach the ground.\n\nThe changes, as shown on the Plan enclosed, will reverse the present Fire Escape to a double door on the 1st floor where at present there is a window; this will leave an Exit from the 1st Floor to the Fire Escape, from this point Father Charren intends to place a sliding Fire Escape to the ground.\n\nI am enclosing the letter received with plans of the proposed changes and would recommend that the changes be permitted as the work will be done without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAnthony M.

The question of their rights on the School property has been taken up under separate letter. Authority has been granted the Principal of St Mary's School to make certain changes on the present firescape, this is being done at the School expense.\n\nThe work on the new church at St Mary's School is going forward rapidly, this being done by Father Charbon and members of his church, and will be an asset to the School Buildings.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nA/c Indian Agent.\nSt. Mary's R.C.

Howe, Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nGentleman:\n\nUpon the recommendation & insistence of two school inspectors, we feel obliged to divide the class-room for Junior boys and girls, on account of the great number of pupils in Grade III and of the activities of the new program of studies. For this we would need additional desks and we would be very thankful if the department would supply a teacher's desk and twelve desks for the pupils. Desks required for the work are \"The C.O.& S.F.Co.Ltd No 3.\n\nWith the expression of our gratitude for what has already been done and anticipating your help for the supply, I am\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nRev.

We have reviewed our files and the Inspectors' reports that we have do not contain any recommendation regarding the establishment of another classroom. I will discuss the matter with Mr. Doucet when he returns to the office.\n\nIn future it would be appreciated if you would forward your requests through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

He states that two Inspectors have recommended such action, but the Inspectors' reports on this school do not indicate any such recommendation. It has occurred to me that you could easily visit the Blood School while en route to the Pagan Reserve and, if it is possible for you to do this, you can discuss the matter of another classroom with the Principal and report on your return to Ottawa. Our reports indicate that there are already four classrooms in this building, and I presume that in addition to this there will be the vocational training class.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Residential School.\n\nTo date we have spent $231.54 in the erection of a Hoist & Scaffold, with the balance going to the Coping as far as the monies were available.\n\nThe Coping on the South wing is now completed and the Hoist & Scaffold is still in place awaiting authority to proceed with and complete this work.\n\nIn your letter, File No. 103-2-5 of March 24th, 1942, you advised that nothing further for a month or six weeks and as it is now June and very heavy rains have fallen, and with the prospect of a rainy season to come, possible damage to the Building will be caused through leaks in the Coping.\n\nThe Hoist which has been left in place - to save future expense - is in the position of being dangerous if our usual high winds come during the Summer months, slight damage has already been caused to windows by the Hoist during one high wind-storm.\n\nMay I have the Department's instructions regarding the completion of this work, at present with the sum of $231.54 paid out to Mr. Weston on a Contract of $800.00, it will be necessary to have $568.46 to complete this contract.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to further repairs to the coping around the Blood Indian Residential School.\n\nI note your statement that it will require $662.66 to complete all the work. Unfortunately we are unable to provide this amount. Our estimates had been prepared several months before we received your letter of March 15 and consequently we have only provided an amount of $450.00 for repairs and improvements at this school during the current fiscal year. This amount is available and authority is granted for an expenditure of $450.00 for additional repairs to the Blood School. This is the total amount that we can allow.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As you well remember we visited the church basement and found that it would be an ideal location for manual training, providing the present wood ceiling is made fireproof. Moreover the old shop is too small & unsuitable for that work, something must be done. If the government is willing to pay for the material I would be anxious to go ahead with the work. All I need is about 3,200 ft. of \"gyprock\" and I will do this work with the boys. Would you be so kind as to look into this, knowing that I am only too willing to go ahead if I get this help. If you remember, we thought that $300.00 would do the job.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nRev. P.A. Charron\nPrincipal\nSt. Mary's R.C.

RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, BLOOD RESERVE CARDSTON.\n\nRe Hot Water Storage Tank for the St Mary's R.C. School we can furnish this tank size 12 feet by three feet six shell to be 5/16\" plate with heating coil installed, and all necessary connections as shown on sketch, for the sum of Three Hundred and eighty nine dollars, $389.00 F.O.B. School.\n\nFor taking out the old tank, and installing the new tank we quote one Hundred and Thirty five dollars, $135.00.\n\nF.W.Flett\nI beg to advise further to the remarks I made in my report under the Reading of Schools in the January Monthly report regarding the temporary repairs at the Hot Water Tank at the St Mary's R C School.\n\nI have visited this School at the end of February and found that the Tank was again leaking from corrosion, with a large number of places showing corrosion. I interviewed Mr Flett The Plumber, and requested him to give me a tender in four copies of the cost of a new tank and the installation of same.\n\nIn my opinion it would be very foolish to keep welding this tank, as it is very expensive to have a welding machine come out this distance, and it would seem that the tank is ready to leak at more than half a dozen places.\n\nI am enclosing Mr Fletts tender along with a sketch of the Tank, and would advise that installation charges which may seem high, include the removal through a treble window removing concrete Million for the taking out of the old tank and the taking in the new.\n\nMay I be advised if the Department are prepared to authorize this.\n\nAnthony M.

With the above in mind, I am returning the attached account unpaid and I trust that both the Principal of the Blood School and the Principal of the St. Paul's School will reimburse the C.P.R.\n\nR.A.

This was placed in the hands of Ralph Weston who made a temporary exit to save the backing up of the sewer into the Baths and Toilets of the School.\n\nHe is now cleaning out the Cesspool which from the information he has now given me shows that this blockage has been slowly blocking up for the past ten years, and all pipes and bells in the cesspool are corroded and covered with a heavy layer of dark soil formed by the bacteria. The cesspool which is 75 yards from the School Buildings had backed up so that the sewage leaving the toilets would come back through the bath tubs, and vice versa, with the children just returned from their holidays this was a very dangerous state for the sewage system to be in, and I called on Mr Weston to make the necessary clean out of the system.\n\nI called there today again before writing this letter, and am advised that Mr Weston has sunk a shaft behind the main cesspool so that at any time in future the cesspool which runs 12 feet under ground can be relieved without unnecessary cost. The sum of $225.00 has been named as the cost of the complete clearance of the sewage system. As this is a very miserable work I feel that the amount of cost is quite feasible.\n\nI trust that you will concur in the action I have taken.\n\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\n402-11RC\n\nOttawa, September 22, 1943.\n\nMr. A.

I have been wondering if it would not be possible to persuade the men in charge of these schools to make periodical inspections of the cesspools and thus avoid a condition such as the one described in your communication. In any event, there is nothing we can do at this date other than to authorize the repairs now under way. It is our hope that the cost will be kept down to the lowest possible figure.\n\nR. A.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to state that an item covering the Flooring of the Dining Room at the Blood R.C. School, this agency, was included in Estimates 1945-46, Sheet #76691B, Page II, Repairs to Buildings, Education.\n\nThis item suggested replacing Concrete Floor in Main Dining Room with Hardwood Floor, at cost of Material $1,000.00 - Labour $650.00.\n\nThis Floor has been examined again this Spring, and it is in a very bad condition, has large cracks running in all directions, and slabs have sunk, leaving uneven surfaces with consequent cracks, and is considered unhealthy for a Dining Room, being subject to Dust and Dirt gathering in the cracks caused by settlement.\n\nTo the writer it would appear that the solution lies in one of two methods to re-condition this Floor.\n\n1. Terrazzo covering: To do this it would be necessary to break down the present concrete and use this as a base filling, cover this with new cement mixture, and finish in Terrazzo finish.\n\n2. Re-cover present floor of concrete, with Dry Kiln Spruce lumber, first cementing all cracks, and covering the lumber floor with Battleship Linoleum.\n\nDetails of cost have not been gone into, but the matter is submitted in order that the Department may instruct us in the matter of Funds allowable for this particular school.\n\nJ. H. Hugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 28, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Blood (R.C.) Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above-mentioned school is located approximately 6 miles from Cardston, Alberta. The Indian Agent reports that the concrete floor in the main dining-room is in very bad condition and has large cracks running in all directions. The slabs have sunk, leaving uneven surfaces, and the floor is considered unhealthy for a dining-room, being subject to dust and dirt gathering in the cracks. The Indian Agent considers that either one of the following methods should be used to recondition this floor:\n\n1. Terrazzo covering - To do this it would be necessary to break down the present concrete and use this as a base filling, cover this with new cement mixture and finish in terrazzo finish.\n\n2. Re-cover present floor of concrete, with Dry Kiln Spruce lumber, first cementing all cracks, and covering the lumber floor with Battleship linoleum.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would have one of your officers visit this school and let us know the best way to handle the matter.\n\nActing Director.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE 30th, 1945, ON BLOOD INDIAN AGENCY\n\nWELFARE AND TRAINING.\n\nSCHOOLS. Both schools well attended during the quarter except for truants. The services of the RCMP used in some instances for the return of pupils who either ran away or did not return from week-end holidays.\n\nThe matter of the above truancy is now being dealt with on instructions from the Branch, and the contents of the Provincial School Inspector's Report being passed on to the respective Principals for their comments.\n\nA number of pupils were hospitalized during the quarter at the Indian Hospital and returned to their respective schools on recovering.\n\nQuarantine was placed on both schools during the month June due to an outbreak of measles, nine cases were reported from the St. Paul's Anglican School, none from the Blood R.C. School.\n\nPremises at both schools are in fairly good shape, and improvements made at both schools without cost to the Department from appropriations. Painting of several buildings at The Blood R.C. School has been carried out, and are quite attractive, using white for walls and red for roofs.\n\nThe painting of the barns and house at the St. Paul's School has been completed, this was delayed due to bad weather.\n\nThe High Pressure Laundry Boiler was the subject of special letter seeking authority for repairs by the Lethbridge Laundry. Due to labour shortage, this work cannot be carried out till after the 9th of July, when this company will have a boiler man available.\n\nThe Motor at this school, used for pumping and laundry was sent into Lethbridge for repairs, and is now in use again. Further study of the plant at this school is being made, with a view to eliminating the costs of repair, and will be submitted to the Branch when compiled.\n\nJ.E.

Walker with which he forwarded a report including data on subsoil conditions at the above, prepared by Assistant Engineer, N.E. Willett, of our Banff office.\n\nThis report deals exhaustively with tests made to ascertain the moisture content of the soil and the source and direction of water seepage below the basement floor.\n\nAn analysis of the report would indicate that the movement of ground water is from the north of the building where a natural water course, now filled in, is located, and over which a skating rink has been erected some 240 feet distant. Furthermore, the clay soil dries quickly and becomes extremely porous, allowing surface water to seep below the foundations and floors, where it finds no outlet, with consequent flooding of the basement and damage to the floor. It would seem, therefore, that water enters the building from the north and northeast, as test samples show the subsoil to the south to be dry and the natural drainage slope being southeast from the buildings.\n\nMr. Walker recommends that an 8\" tile drain be laid 8 feet below grade along the north and part of the east side of the building for a distance of 305 feet, thence 332 feet at a falling gradient to an existing drain, and that no repair work be done to the basement floors for at least six months after completion of the drain, or until the subsoil has attained a sufficient moisture stability to warrant such repairs.\n\nFrom a study of the data to hand, we concur in the above recommendation. The estimated cost of the foregoing drainage work, with supervision and incidentals, is $2000.00.\n\nIt is suggested that the matter be submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch for their consideration.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

We submitted the matter to the Purchasing Branch and they feel that 2\u00bd yards is extremely long. Is this the correct length for the blinds required? If not, please let me have the necessary information. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend P. A. Charron, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\nSt. Mary's R.C. Residential School\nUNDER DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nCardston, Alberta Nov. 2 1945\n\nMr. Philip Phelan:\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe your letter of the 29th of Oct. and file 103-2-5 re window blinds, I have checked the length of these windows and find that the length of 3 1/2 yds by three feet is correct. These blinds are to be used in the dormitories and cover the window and the transom at the same time. This accounts for the extra length.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. P.A. Charron\nMemorandum:\n\nAugust 22, 1945.\n\nRe: Blood Indian Residential School\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nAs stated to you verbally by our Architect, Mr. Walker was requested to arrange for an inspection and report on the concrete floor slab of the main dining room at the above school, and in this connection we are now in receipt of an interim report prepared by Mr. Willett of our Banff office, in which he deals with this matter which may be briefly summarized as follows:\n\nThe concrete floor slabs of the entire basement have heaved, cracking the concrete and leaving an uneven surface. Furthermore, alkali water seeping through the cracks has caused the concrete to deteriorate and crumble along these openings. It is noted in the report that some years ago the concrete floor of a recreation room was removed and relaid on 1/2\" of gravel. This floor has since heaved and cracked. It is felt that water infiltrates from some outside source into the building below the floor causing the clay sub-soil on which the slab is directly laid, to expand and contract alternately.\n\nMr. Walker advises that further investigation to determine the source of the water entering the building below the basement floor, is now in progress, and in his covering letter, advances the opinion that no new flooring would be effective or permanent until or unless the ingress of water into the sub-soil under the building has been stopped, either by drainage or by a removal of the source of the seepage flow.\n\nMr. Walker states that when the report on his complete investigation is forwarded, it will be accompanied by estimates of cost for such work as is deemed essential for the restoration of the basement floors.\n\nIn view of these facts, it is considered advisable to await a full report on the cause and source of water infiltration, before a study of assembled data be made and proposals to remedy the trouble are prepared.\n\nT. S. Mills\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 9th, 1945.\n\nAttention Mr. Phelan\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Blood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta\n\nPursuant to our telephone conversation of this morning, I am enclosing herewith copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated August 22nd, 1945, for your information.\n\nJ. M. Wardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 15, 1945.\n\nDear Father Charron:\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet returned to the Department he informed me that he had an opportunity of discussing with you the drainage work that the Surveys and Engineering Branch have decided to carry out at the Blood School. Mr. Doucet was under the impression that you thought this work might be unnecessary. The matter was therefore taken up with the Surveys and Engineering Branch again upon Mr. Doucet's return, and I enclose, for your information, a copy of a memorandum which we have just received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nReverend P.A. Charron, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\nSt. Mary's R.C. Residential School\nUNDER DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nRev. P.A. Charron\nPrincipal\n\nCardston, Alberta\n\nwe can go ahead and lay the rest off the floor without any gravel fill and think that we can get away with it. We will have cracks even if there is an outside drain.\n\nI have been told that Mr. Whillet has recommended that we wait at least one year before we lay another floor. This, in my opinion is not necessary and the work done in the recreation hall fully proves my statement.\n\nI wish to thank you for the interest that you have shown in this matter.\n\nI remain yours very sincerely\n\nRev. P.A. Charron,\nO.M.I.\nPrincipal\nSt. Mary's R.C. Residential School\nUNDER DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nCardston, Alberta Nov. 20th, 1945\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nOttawa Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant (re my discussion with Mr. Doucet) re drainage work now being done at the Blood R.C. School by the surveys and engineering branch. I must thank you for the memorandum included as it has clarified things a bit. I had mentioned to Mr. Doucet that I could not see why so much money was being spent outside the building and so little inside, while the same result could have been obtained by placing a gravel fill under the floor. I could not understand why that was not being tried as I had tried it with wonderful results. I have read the memorandum with attention and I was most surprised to find there the following statement, I quote: \"It is noted in the report that some years ago the concrete floor of the recreation room was removed and relaid on 12 ins of gravel. This floor has since heaved and cracked.\" Now this statement is grossly incorrect. In the first place, some 12 years ago the floor in the boys recreation room was broken up, removed and a new one was laid on the gumbo underground. This floor is five ins. thick and has no reinforced deformed steel rods. In the course of time it has heaved and cracked, but the main crack always developed at the very same spot. It was repaired twice and the situation grew worse. So during the summer holiday of 1943 I personally undertook to repair this floor and make a job of it, if it could be done. I went to work and broke a concrete strip clear across the floor, and following the main crack, I then dug the gumbo out to a dept of 18 ins or more and filled this up with rocks and gravel. Mr. Weston then came and laid the cement floor. I tested this piece of cement flooring this morning and tested it and we have found it in perfect shape; while the other part of the floor which has no fill at all, and never had any, is heaving and cracking. It is most interesting to note that the part which I have repaired and which has been standing up for two years of testing, had previously been repaired twice at considerable expense to the government. Mr. Whillet then told me that he misunderstood me and should have spent more time with me in the building.\n\nThe work on the trench is now under way, and should be continued, as it may be of some value on the long run, but we must not think that\nOttawa, November 14th, 1945.\n\nDear Father Charron:\n\nI have taken up the question of the basement floors in your school with the Engineering Branch here. I quote a paragraph from their memorandum:\n\n\"The concrete floor slabs of the entire basement have heaved, cracking the concrete and leaving an uneven surface. Furthermore, alkali water seeping through the cracks has caused the concrete to deteriorate and crumble along these openings. It is noted in the report that some years ago the concrete floor of a recreation room was removed and relaid on 12\" of gravel. This floor has since heaved and cracked. It is felt that water infiltrates from some outside source into the building below the floor causing the clay sub-soil on which the slab is directly laid, to expand and contract alternately.\"\n\nYou will remember the conversation we had re the plan to correcting the difficulty. I would like to have your comments on the above quotation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nRev. P.A.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to state that some time ago, a Bungalow Hot Water Heater \"Triumph-Mogul\" #32, made by the Dominion Radiator & Boiler Co. Ltd., was purchased for the Blood R.C. School, and it is found that the Dome for the top of this Heater was not provided.\n\nAs it is now desired to put this Heater in use it will be necessary to provide the Dome. It is thought that the cost of the Dome will not exceed $50.00, and it is therefore suggested that Local Purchase be made from Mr. F.W. Flett, Plumber of CARDSTON, Alta.,\n\nMay the necessary authority be granted, please.\n\nJ. E.

Pugh, Indian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n11th instant, the Department approves an expend-\niture of $50.00 to purchase a dome for the water\nheater at the Blood Residential School. It is\nnoted that the cost of this will not exceed $50.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDecember 19, 1945.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe P.C. 6020 of 17/10/45.\n\nAdvice has been received from your Lethbridge office that they have substituted for the #127-3-2 machines, two model 15-85 reversible stitch machines with #404 cabinets and metal legs at $57.56 each, increasing the net cost by $35.84.\n\nIt will be in order for your Lethbridge office to invoice accordingly for the two sewing machines supplied, but we suggest that, in future, your agents advise this office before making substitutions of equipment specified.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nSinger Sewing Machine Co.,\nCentral Agency, 424 Portage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDecember 19, 1945.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe P.O. 6020 of 17/10/45.\n\nAdvice has been received from your Lethbridge office that they have substituted for the #127-3-2 machines, two model 15-88 reversible stitch machines with #404 cabinets and metal legs at $57.55 each, increasing the net cost by $35.64.\n\nIt will be in order for your Lethbridge office to invoice accordingly for the two sewing machines supplied, but we suggest that, in future, your agents advise this office before making substitutions of equipment specified.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nSinger Sewing Machine Co.,\nCentral Agency, 424 Portage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDecember 12, 1945.\n\nRe: Blood (R.C.) Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nIn connection with the memorandum dated November 28th last, bearing your notation of December 1st, and the attached letter of November 30th from the Principal of the above school, comment is furnished as follows:\n\nThe Principal's letter indicates his opinion, that by placing 18 inches of broken stone over the clay sub-soil of the basement, before a new slab is laid, heaving of the basement floors could have been prevented without undertaking the sub-soil drainage system now under construction.\n\nMr. Willett of our Banff office, who carried out the inspection, stated that numerous soil moisture tests showed conclusively that moisture penetrating the sub-soil beneath the basement floor was forming a clay of gumbo consistency, unstable as a bearing soil. The resulting volume changes and swelling pressures due to the addition of moisture to the clay has caused a general heaving of the floor slabs.\n\nIt is to prevent the addition of water to this clay sub-soil, and to stabilize the moisture content that the exterior drainage line is being constructed. Once the sub-soil is stabilized as to moisture content, by the new drainage line, a new reinforced concrete slab laid on 6 inches of broken stone should be a permanent solution of the problem. To cover the entire area below the slab with an 18 inch fill of broken stone would, no doubt, temporarily alleviate the condition of heaving but would not permanently remedy the situation.\n\nWe trust that this presentation of our analysis of the requirements will be satisfactory, both to Indian Affairs Branch and to the Principal.\n\nT. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nMr. Hoey  \nRe: Blood (R.C.) Indian Residential School,  \nCardston, Alberta.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of November 28th last enclosing copy of a letter from the Principal of the Blood Indian Residential School relative to work being undertaken in connection with heaved and cracked basement floors in that school.\n\nThis letter has been referred to our Engineering and Construction Service and for your information I enclose copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, dated December 12th, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThe views expressed by Mr. Mills are concurred in that the sub-soil drainage system now under construction is necessary. The sub-soil must first be stabilized as to moisture generally before a permanently satisfactory concrete floor can be laid.\n\nJ.M. Wardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 26th December, 1945.\n\nDear Father Charron:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of November 20th with reference to drainage work now being done at the Blood Indian Residential School. A copy of your letter was forwarded to the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of memorandum just received from that Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend P.A. Charron, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\nmatter is being dealt with by special letter.\n\nData has also been obtained regarding the pumping arrangements at this school, and this also will be dealt with by letter.\n\nDuring the quarter ending, some 15 pupils of the Blood RC School and 6 of the St. Paul's School were hospitalized, and returned to their respective schools. These children were sent to hospital for varying reasons, minor accidents and ill health, none of which were serious.\n\nCorrespondence was entered into with the Branch, regarding a pupil of the Blood RC School, requesting permission at the Father's request, to place this pupil in the Minapore Orphanage School. The contents of the Dept. reply was given to Shade, and I am now informed that the child is in attendance at that school and Shade is desirous of re-opening the correspondence in the matter of grant for this child.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nGENERAL ADMINISTRATION:\n\nMr. Willetts, Parks Branch Engineer visited the Agency in regard to the condition of floors at the Blood R.C. School, and he was taken over the place, and his resultant report has now been received.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Blood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nOur Banff office has advised that work in connection with subsurface drainage at the above, has been completed at a cost of approximately $1700.00, including travelling and supervision expenses.\n\nThis is a reduction of approximately $1000.00 on the revised cost of the work as estimated by Mr. Willett when it appeared it would be necessary to pay Indian labour at the rate of 70 cents per hour.\n\nMr. Willett has reported that he was able to obtain Indian labour at 60 cents per hour, and was also able to secure the use of a ditching machine, thereby greatly reducing the time and cost involved in the operations.\n\nHe concludes his report by recommending an inspection of the work in the spring, at which time he suggests it may be advisable to embed the drain outlet in a concrete block for permanent protection against winter movement. This item could be handled as a maintenance item with the Indian Agent, and would not be important enough to involve the transfer of funds.\n\nUnder the circumstances it should be possible to return approximately $1000.00 to the Indian Affairs Branch in the near future for application to other commitments.\n\n(Sgd.)

Plourde, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to state that the Principal of the Blood R.C. School, this Reserve, has approached the writer with a view to obtaining a new Deep Well Ejector Pump, stating that the old Pump & Jack now in use, and which has been in operation since the building of the School in 1925, is obsolete and worn out.\n\nI viewed the Pump & Jack, and found that the Gears driving this Jack were worn to the point that they slip gears with consequent slippage to the Pump, and is, as a result, not pumping the quantity of water required to meet all requirements.\n\nThe Principal has obtained from the Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd., CALGARY, Alta., prices in the type of installation he requires or believes satisfactory for this School, this letter being attached herewith, together with the data sheet on the suggested installation.\n\nI have interviewed the Fairbanks-Morse representative and their Carleton Agent, J. Woslyng, Esq., and placed before them the requirements which are as follows:\n\n- Depth of Well: 246 Feet.\n- Distance Well to Tower: 150 Horizontal Feet\n- Capacity of Tank: 40,000 Gallons.\n- Depth of Pump Cylinder in well casing: 105 Feet.\n- Size of Cylinder: 3 inches.\n- Casting: 6 Do.\n- Water Main to Tower: 2\" Pipe - Discharged through same Pipe to Service.\n\nType of Pump requested:\n\nModel #5007 D P.\nFairbanks-Morse Deep Well Double Pipe System Pump, with 5 HP Motor - 3 Phase - 60 Cycle - 220 Volts.\nPrice quoted: $856.70 - F.O.B. Calgary, Alta.\n\nFreight approximately $12.00.\nInstallation by J. Woslyng: $25.00, this would cover setting Pump-Head and Ejector union on casing, making new bearing bolt holes, or leading same and making all electric connections to switches now in use and which would serve the new installation.\n\nThis subject matter is respectfully submitted for consideration and is worthy of such in view of the present equipment being worn and obsolete and in use for 20 years, and is recommended.\n\nMay we ask for the return to Rev.

Father Charron of this School, and had Mr. F. Flett of CARDSTON, Alta., submit a Tender on the work as outlined by the Principal.\n\nFrom the information I had, it appears that the School now requests individual toilets on both the Boys' and Girls' side of the School. At present the Toilets are in batteries, and the flushing from one common tank, this tends to leave a very distinct aroma in the Playrooms on both sides adjacent to the Toilets.\n\nMr. F. W.

H. Smolson of our Banff office, has been received. We have analyzed this report which may be summarized as follows:\n\nThe 8 inch tile drain installed to intercept ground water previously entering the building beneath the basement floors, has proved to be efficient, observation showing an appreciable flow of water being discharged from the outlet.\n\nThe purpose of the 8 inch drain to assist in the stabilization of the soil moisture content below the basement floors, has been largely achieved. The soil moisture content based on a series of tests made June 7th last, now shows a practically uniform condition to a depth of 6 feet.\n\nThe satisfactory functioning of the drain should prevent the inflow of further water into the sub-soil under the floors and as this sub-soil is a heavy clay, the moisture content from now on should change very little especially under the floors, and floors constructed as later specified herein, should be permanently satisfactory.\n\nThe areas with floors to which attention should be given are tabulated as follows:\n\n| Room               | Area-Sq.Ft. | Floor |\n|--------------------|-------------|-------|\n| Girls Recreation   | 1280        | 1280  |\n| Girls Wash Room    | 505         | 505   |\n| Above              | 65          | 65    |\n| Main Dining Room   | 1750        | 1750  |\n| Hallway            | 170         | 170   |\n| Bedroom            | 290         | 290   |\n| Toilet             | 115         | 115   |\n| Boys Wash Room     | 455         | 455   |\n| Boys Recreation    | 1570        | 1570  |\n| Boys Toilet        | 115         | 115   |\n| Hallway            | 42          | 42    |\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n| Room       | Area-Sq.Ft. | Condition of Present Floor |\n|------------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| Hallway    | 118         | 118                        |\n| Laundry    | 904         | 904                        |\n| Dairy Room | 116         | 114                        |\n| Shop       | 158         |                            |\n\n7569 sq. ft.\n\nIn carrying out construction of new floors in the school, the following specification should be followed:\n\nThe existing floors should be entirely removed and soil excavated to a depth of 17 inches below the present floor level, and all surplus soil and debris removed from the building.\n\nThe new floor should be a 4 inch concrete slab of a mix consisting of one part Portland cement, two parts fine aggregate and three parts coarse aggregate not over \u00bd inches in size. Steel reinforcement should be 6 inch by 6 inch by \u00bc inch wire mesh laid 1 inch below top of slab. A \u00bd inch finish consisting of one part Portland cement to two parts coarse sand mixed with a minimum of water, should be applied to the slab as soon as practicable after it has been laid.\n\nThree lines of 4 inch tile drain should be laid lengthwise of the building to empty into the existing 8 inch drain outside of the building. These lines should be laid by tile scoop and embedded into the clay at the bottom of the floor excavation with the invert of the tile approximately 17 inches below grade. One line of tile should go longitudinally through the centre of the main building or in a south to north direction; one tile should be run parallel to the centre tile on each side of the building, and 5 feet from the wall footings. These three tile lines should be joined outside the building to enter the existing 8 inch tile drain through an 8 inch tee.\n\nIt is estimated that to carry out the above work, costs would be approximately as follows:\n\n- Poor Floors ............. $5550 sq. ft. at $0.60 .... $3,330.00\n- Fair Floors ............. 1519 sq. ft. at $0.60 .... $911.40\n\nMr. Snalson recommends that floors indicated as \"Poor\", should be laid during the school holiday season.\n\nT.S. Mills\nChief Engineer.\n\nP.S. After excavation and removal of soil to a depth of 17 inches, broken stone is to be filled in to a depth of 13 inches before 4-inch concrete slab is laid.\n\n15/7/46\n\nJ.A.P. J.A.P.\nMr. Hoey,\nFor your information,\nplease\n\nJuly 9, 1946.\n\nNo: Sub-cellar Drainage,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your marginal notation dated May 20th last, on the memorandum of May 7th from the Director of Indian Affairs, we are now in receipt of a report prepared by Mr. Snellen of our Banff office.\n\nThe report states that, at present, water is siphoned from a circular hole approximately 8' in diameter and 3' deep, in the earthen floor of the sub-cellar by means of a small 1\" wash tub drainer into a soil pipe connected with the sewer system of the building.\n\nHe recommends that the following installation be carried out:\n\n(a) That two 8\" x 30\" sewer tiles be set vertically on a prepared gravel bottom and packed with gravel on the outside, giving a sump 8'-0\" in diameter by 5'-0\" high.\n\n(b) That this sump be covered with a tight wooden cover on which would be installed a Canadian Fairbanks-Morse National Automatic Electric Sump Pump with 110 Volt, 60 Cycle, A.C. Motor.\n\n(c) That the pump be installed to discharge into the soil pipe running across the ceiling of the sub-cellar through some 50 lineal feet of 1\u00bd\" galvanized iron pipe with one 90 degree and one 45 degree - 1\u00bd\" elbows.\n\n(d) That this pump be connected to the electrical system of the building by 50 lineal feet of suitable rubber covered cable.\n\nThe estimated cost of the installation including all materials and labour, as well as supervision and contingencies, would be in the neighborhood of $100.00.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nWe concur with Mr. Snolson's recommendation except that it is considered advisable to provide \u00bd\" galvanized iron conduit for the protection of the rubber covered cable from dampness. This installation could be carried out independently if materials are available or might be carried out in conjunction with new basement floor slab construction if the latter is approved.\n\nT. S.

You are aware, from recent correspondence, that we are endeavouring to secure new toilets at an approximate cost of $1,355.00. In the current year's appropriation we included an amount of $1,200.00 for repairs and improvements at this school. The purchase of the toilets will exceed that amount. Under these circumstances I doubt if we will be able to provide the funds for the floors. However, we will consider the matter again when we know the cost of the repairs to the water tower at the St. Paul's School. The Surveys and Engineering Branch was requested on June 25 to have one of the officials of that Branch visit the school and I understand he will reach there shortly, if he has not already done so.\n\nBernard F.

The operation of both schools have gone along smoothly during the quarter. A slight epidemic of influenza of a mild type struck the Blood R.C. School the latter part of the quarter with many of the children being laid up for a few days. Weather conditions prevented the carrying out of roof repairs to the St. Paul's School authorized before the end of the quarter.\n\nThe operation of the Blood R.C. School was hampered considerably by the condition of the half mile of road between the Agency and this school, due to heavy drifted snow in January and February and then in March to melting snow and frost coming out of the ground and deep mud. This was reported by special letter through the office of the Inspector and authority sought to have this old road gravelled.\n\nM.

MacLeod, Clerk in Charge,\nIndian Agency, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the basement floors in\nthe Blood Residential School, I enclose for your\ninformation a copy of a memorandum dated July 25th,\n1947, from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, also\na copy of a memorandum dated July 10th, 1946.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would inter-\nview the principal of the Blood School and let me\nknow at what cost you can replace the present floors.\nWe only included an amount of $2,000, in the current\nyear's appropriation for the work.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nBuildings urgently needed for the Blood Indian reserve and available from R.C.A.F. camps adjacent to the Reserve\n\nLocated at No. 7 S.F.T.S., MacLeod, Alta.\n\nBuilding No. 38 - formerly Link Trainer Building.\n\nThis building is needed at the Blood R.C. Residential School as an additional classroom building.\n\nThis is a frame building, in very good condition, with storm windows and completed shingled on the outside. The inside contains four good-sized classrooms, each 25' x 36', a large cloakroom for each classroom, a principal's office and very adequate washrooms & furnace room. The ceiling is finished in Ten-Test, the walls are lined with 3-ply veneer in very good condition, and the whole building is floored with tempered masonite. All plumbing and electrical fixtures, as well as all heating apparatus are still intact. This building was used as classrooms during the war and is ideal for the need on the Blood reserve. It can be moved without dismantling; it is built in the form of an H, with two classrooms on either side and would be moved in three pieces very easily.\n\nBuilding No. 28 - formerly W.D. Recreation Centre.\n\nThis building is badly needed as a COMMUNITY HALL for the Blood Indians and to be situated on their reserve.\n\nThis is a frame building, 70' x 30', with a lean-to 70' x 12' built as one building. It is ideal as a community hall - as that it what it was built for. It has the one large hall - 70 x 30 - floored with hardwood and lined with ten-test and is complete with kitchen, cloakrooms and bathrooms. It is also complete with electrical fixtures and wiring, plumbing and heating. This building can be moved intact, by a competent mover, without trouble. The building also has a good overhead ventilation system, which is very important for any Indian community hall.\n\nLocated at PEARCE AIRPORT, Pearce, Alberta.\n\nBuilding No. 12 - formerly Link Trainer Building.\n\nThis building is needed for additional classroom space at the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nIt is similar in every way to the Link Trainer building at MacLeod, only that this building has four classrooms, each size 18 - 24, and all on one side of the building. This building is 74 feet long and 30 feet wide and complete with electrical wiring (although the fixtures are gone) plumbing and heating. There are four cloakrooms, two offices, large washroom and heating room. It is ideal for the purpose intended and could be moved intact.\n\n(sgd.) R. D. Hogan,\nSuperintendent.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta,\nDecember 2, 1947.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq., Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alta.\n\nCircular Letter No. 204\n\nThe writer, in company with the Principal of\nthe St. Mary's R.C. School has today made an extensive survey\nof buildings of R.C.A.F. camps in this area and has located\nthree ideal buildings to fill two great needs on this reserve.\n\nAs you know, this reserve has over 200 children\nthat cannot be educated for lack of accommodation; we have the\nstaff, the land and everything but the buildings. During the\nlast war the Link trainer was used extensively to train pilots -\nfor this purpose classrooms were needed and so they were\npromptly erected. We must now train Indians, and these same\nclassrooms are ideal for the purpose. If you were building\nclassrooms on the reserve they could not be made better for\nthe purpose. There is one Link trainer building at MacLeod\nAirport, a distance of 35 miles away, and there is one at\nPeace - ten miles further south. These buildings are in\nwonderful condition and if moved to the sites of the two\nschools on this reserve would solve the accommodation problem\nas far as education is concerned. The principals and myself\nare very enthused over this and sincerely hope that these\nbuildings can be allocated to this reserve and steps immediately\ntaken to move them this winter, so that they can be moved\nacross the ice on the river.\n\nAt the same time I have located an ideal building\nto serve as a Blood Indian Community Hall - a need that is almost\nas great as accommodation for school children. The Bloods have\nno meeting place, no place for Homemakers' Clubs to gather, or\nfor any other gathering and if the old W.D. Recreation Centre,\nas described on the attached sheet, could be also allocated\nto this reserve, to be moved to a central location near the\npower line, it would fill a great need. The building is ideal\nfor the purpose, could be easily moved and is complete with\nkitchen washrooms and cloakrooms and is in very good condition.\nIt is hoped that immediate action can be taken on all three\nbuildings.\n\n(sgd.) R. D. Kagan,\nSuperintendent.\nR. A. Hoey, M.S.O.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttached hereto you will find copy of a letter from Mr. R. D. Ragan, Superintendent of the Blood Indian Agency, in answer to a circular letter which was sent out from this office about surplus government buildings, and particularly regarding certain buildings located at the R.C.A.F. Training Center near Macleod.\n\nMr. Ragan has suggested, as you will note, that two Link Trainer buildings from the Macleod and Pearce stations be moved on to the Blood Reserve as additional class rooms at the two residential schools. I recently inspected these buildings, and I am satisfied they would answer the purpose very well for some years, if they were not dismantled and set up again.\n\nMr. Ragan had an experienced contractor, Mr. Kaufman, who has moved similar buildings from these stations for the P.F.R.A. and other concerns, examine them. This gentleman states that he could move them in the winter time across the river.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the only time he could move them is during the winter months, as they are too large to cross ordinary bridges and must be taken over when the ice is strong.\n\nIf these buildings are still available, and it was agreed that it was good business to move them to the schools, the cost is a proper charge against Education Vote, is it not? I recommend that they be secured, if available, and moved as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding Building #2, formerly W.D. Recreation Center, Macleod, it was my suggestion that such building be located, if at all possible, for a community hall. The Bloods have no hall, and this is very badly needed not only as a social center, but also for business meetings. The Band fund is small, and it is our belief that the cost of moving this building would be a fair charge against Welfare Account. All other expenses could and would be, I am sure, borne by the Indians themselves.\n\nIf authority was given to move it, it could be moved intact and placed on a suitable site near the Agency headquarters.\nCareful consideration has been given to the moving of all of these buildings during the winter months, across the river, before submitting the request that they be requisitioned. It is hoped they are still available, and that you will agree that they are a valuable asset to the Blood Reserve and will act promptly to try to secure them.\n\nG. H.

H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nNovember 6th, 1947.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wrote you in September, suggesting that part of the R.C.A.F. Training Center at Macleod, Alberta, would make an excellent residential school. You replied to that letter on the 23rd and stated that there was no authority in the Act at present for the operation of non-sectarian residential schools.\n\nAt that time there was little I could say in answer to that, because the buildings and their location were such that it did not appear to me to be good business to try to use them in any other location.\n\nThe schools on the Blood Reserve are some thirty miles to the south of this point and a river lies between them and the airport site. It would not be economical to tear them down and build them up again, and it would be impossible to move them over the river. Most of the buildings are too big to move with the type of equipment that is available.\n\nDespite the fact that there is not yet any authority for a non-sectarian school, I approached a missionary of the R.C. church and asked what might be the objection of his church to the establishment of one. He stated that the pupils of the R.C. faith must get certain definite religious education, but that this could be given at a time that would not break into the usual school routine. Since there are many buildings to choose from in this center, accommodation could be easily supplied to the churches that desire local representatives.\n\nAs to staff, I believe I can find an excellent principal for such a school. If salaries were equal to that of provincial schools, there will be applicants as the type of school and location would have some attraction.\n\nIt is to be admitted that the whole does appear difficult under existing conditions and maybe the effort to establish a non-sectarian school is not warranted. I would, however, hate to see the idea dropped.\n\nFrom another source, the suggestion was made that two residential schools be established here (a P. C. and an Anglican), to take all the children from the Peigan Reserve and the surplus children from the Blood Reserve. I think this is worth consideration.\n\nThe schools on the Peigan Reserve are anything but attractive and are not large enough. The\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.\n\nR. C. School has been trying to locate water for years and has not yet succeeded. Both schools are built on the bald-headed prairie where the wind is terrific, and the staff and pupils are not very happy. During a large part of the year it is difficult to get to them and the cost of transportation from railroad is considerable. Furthermore, the Anglicans have great difficulty in retaining staff.\n\nThe training center is of one storey construction and is situated right opposite the town of Macleod. It was originally erected for temporary use and the construction is more or less temporary. It is our surmise, however, that the buildings would remain in reasonably good condition for at least ten years and therefore more than sufficient in the center to meet all requirements for two complete institutions. As stated in my former letter, power, gas and water are already on the spot.\n\nAdvice was received here that the center has now been taken over by the Surplus Property Division, War Assets Corporation. Any information as to how the buildings are to be disposed of can be secured from the Lands & Buildings Department, War Assets Corporation, 4095 St. Catherine St. W., Montreal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

Our Regional Supervisor for Alberta, Mr. G. H. Gooderham, is now ascertaining the cost of moving these buildings and upon hearing further from him we will advise you as to our plans with regard to buildings 28 and 38 at Macleod and building No. 12 at Pearce.\n\nWe have also received a further request for the recreation hall which is building No. 18. Could we please be advised as to the price of this particular building. In closing may I express my appreciation for your prompt attention to our letters of the past with regard to these buildings.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nReverend Fr. P. Charron, the principal of St. Mary's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve, has received a fairly large sum of money from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate missionary fund, which it is his purpose to use in the erection of a gymnasium for the use of his school children.\n\nIt has long been estimated that a building of this nature is quite essential for the education of the Indian children of that reserve. The broken up winter makes it quite impossible to have a skating rink and other winter sports enjoyed by nearly all our residential schools. For long weeks at a time, the children are forced to spend their recreation hours in recreation rooms considered too small for the purpose.\n\nMoreover, the space allowed in the school for recreational purposes is so small that it is very difficult to train the children in sports and health activities. Discipline for both boys and girls becomes a serious problem and cannot be directed along character building lines.\n\nMuch emphasis is now being placed on the general health of the population of this reserve, and we consider that our school children are deprived of the necessary protection when forced to remain long periods in crowded and poorly ventilated recreation halls. This gymnasium and recreation centre will therefore fill a long needed want in this respect.\n\nWith a gymnasium most of these obstacles will disappear as such activities as basket-ball, indoor tennis and badminton will be a source of enjoyment beneficial to all the children of the school. It is also hoped that in time bowling alleys will be provided and that the young men and women of\nthe reserve will be attracted to take a keener interest in sports with subsequent beneficial results from both an educational and moral point of view. Moreover, the members of the Blood Reserve participate in sporting events the major part of which requires training in a gymnasium, and they all feel that they should have such a centre to enable them to meet and compete with children of other schools and localities.\n\nIf the principal is able to secure the recreational gymnasium of the R.C.A.F. establishment at McLeod, the construction of this recreation centre will become relatively easy. If not, he will use the ordinary building methods, and hopes to have the building completed a year from next September.\n\nHoping that you will give this project your sanction,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nYour letter of January 20th addressed to Mr. Hoey has been referred to me.\n\nThis week I had the pleasure of a visit from Reverend Father Charron, Principal of the Blood School and I informed him regarding the action which the Department is taking with reference to securing a building which Father Charron desires. Negotiations in connection with the building are proceeding satisfactorily and I believe that Father Charron is satisfied with the action that we are taking.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.
