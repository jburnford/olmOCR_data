The Principal has neglected to indicate the dates of absence. Pupil # 656 was placed in Nanaimo Hospital during the quarter; however, the Principal has neglected to indicate the date.\n\nPupil # 664 was discharged to attend Tsartlip School. The Principal has claimed 25 days grant but has neglected to indicate the date the pupil left the school.\n\nFor pupil # 666 the Principal has claimed 92 days grant as indicated in the Remarks Column. This pupil was truant. If the pupil was truant for even one day the Principal should not have claimed grant for that day.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise the dates the above-mentioned children left the school or the period of their absences and instruct the Principal that on future Quarterly Returns this information must be indicated in the Remarks Column of the Return otherwise, it will be necessary to delay payment of the Per Capita Grant until this information is obtained.\nPlease advise the Principal that we have allowed 122 days grant for pupil # 677 and 107 days for pupil # 0645. These are the children for whom no applications for admission were received and for whom grant was claimed on the September Quarterly Return.

They have a splendid manual training equipment, but no instructor. Mr. Cairns suggests a Government manual training instructor to travel among the 5 or 6 residential schools on the mainland.\n\nE. T. F.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF W. E. DITCHBURN,\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER, VICTORIA, B. C. (P.O.BOX 666)\ndated January 25, 1929.\n\nOriginal on 600224.\n\nKuper Island School ------ The Principal stated that while he had a fair supply of tools purchased by the Department in 1915, six of the eight benches supplied them had been taken away for use at the Nanaimo Day School Manual Training room, and others would have to be supplied. He also informed me that the services of a manual training instructor from Ladysmith could be obtained, if necessary, but some arrangement would have to be made with regard to transporting him to and from the school each week. It may be possible that an addition to the staff will be made of a competent carpenter.\nFebruary 7, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 600224, Commissioner Ditchburn was authorized, on February 6th, to purchase manual training equipment as follows for this school. The correspondence indicates that it may be necessary to engage a special organizer and the work will be commenced as soon as arrangements can be made for instructors at the various schools. Mr. Ditchburn is making enquiries regarding this phase of the work, also.\n\nKuper Island Indian Residential School\n\n- 6 Single benches.\n- 8 Bench screws.\n- 8 Individual sets tools.\n- 8 Drawing sets.\n- Material.\n\nThe estimated cost is $269.36.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6457, file 885-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Description                  | Quantity | Rate  | Total |\n|------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 14 PCS. 2X10-16' NO. 2 CLR&BTR FIR S4S | 374      | $65.00 | $24,31 |\n| 6 \" 2X6-12\" DO               | 72       | $60.00 | $4,32  |\n| 8 \" 2X8-14\" DO               | 56       |       | $3.36  |\n| 2 \" 3X6-12\" DO               | 36       |       | $2.16  |\n| IX6 NO. 2 CLR&BTR FIR S4S     | 150      | $57.00 | $8.55  |\n| IX8 DO                       | 150      | $60.00 | $9.00  |\n| IX10 DO                      | 150      |       | $3.48  |\n| IX12 DO                      |          |       |       |\n\nTotal: $63.78\n**DUPLICATE**\n\n**MANUAL TRAINING - SPECIAL VOTE**\n\nFiscal Year 1928-29\n\nVoucher No. 204-A\n\nVote No.\n\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nOffice of Indian Commissioner for Cowichan Agency\n\nTo The Victoria Lumber & Manufacturing Co.

If this phase of our educational programme can be made more effective, it will greatly benefit the Indians of the Province. Most residential schools have a workshop or other space that can be used for vocational training. If steps to improve the workshop facilities should be taken at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, please cooperate with Mr. Indian Agent Lomas with a view to making a recommendation to the Department.\n\nA thorough course in carpentry is the present aim. To this end, Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn has been authorized to supply benches and tools and there has been directed to you a text on manual training, job sheets in woodworking and a publication on how to work with tools and wood. Further, you have been authorized to present to Mr. Indian Agent Lomas reasonable accounts for materials with which to work.\n\nThe Department is desirous of having a qualified instructor for this work at all schools where this special training is being undertaken. Some schools have on the staff an officer who is well qualified for the activity and who can be released from other duties for the manual training classes. I understand there are summer courses for instructors in manual training in Vancouver and Victoria. Other Indian schools are so situated that they can secure the services of instructors from municipal schools. In this case, classes are held two or three times per week. The Department would like to know what arrangements you have made, or can make, for this important work. Do not hesitate to enlist the cooperation of Mr. Indian Agent Lomas, if the Department can be of any assistance.\n\nAt a later date, it is hoped to extend the vocational training to include gas engines and other machinery; and, whenever you believe this additional course should be given at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, you will please inform the Department. A copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Lomas for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guerts, S. M.

McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your favor of 14th inst. No 152-0-11\nwould say that I have a competent carpenter on the staff who, in the\nlast three years put an addition to the boiler room and build a\nnew pig sty and a new house for the lighting plant. Arrangements are\nbeing made to have him follow the summer course for instructors in\nmanual training.\n\nWith regard to the workshop facilities I think that the special\nroom set apart for this purpose in the present building is really too\nsmall for the size of benches we were requested to put up according\nto a proposed plan.\n\nI expect a visit from Mr. Indian Agent Lomas. This matter will be\ntalked over with him, and some suggestions made, with the view of,\nsooner or later, including gas and other machinery in the vocational\ntraining.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 26, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of May 30th, which was in reply to my communication of May 14th, regarding manual and vocational training for boys at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. Benches and tools have been supplied, and the Department wishes to learn if you need any help in the matter of materials with which to work. There has also been directed to you manual training texts and job sheets. The Department would be grateful for a report on this activity generally, with recommendations how this service can be improved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guerts, S. M. M.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKuper Island,\nvia Chemainus,\nB. C.\nhave asked repeatedly for $30.00 which I have not been able to give so far. Now with this additional work which requires another man it is impossible to manage, with the actual grant.\n\nIn view then of these present conditions I humbly ask the Department kindly to consider the grant we were getting so far and to increase it in such a way as to make it possible to put the whole system on the above proposed basis with one man more, and a fair salary for the work that is done.\n\nBy doing this the Department takes away a great deal of my present worries and will always be assured of the devotedness of\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\n1924-0 - Sechelt 170\nAgamiih 160\nKuper Isl 170\nAlberni 160\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your favored of 26th ultimo No 152-0-11 re manual training; benches were made last summer at the school, some tools were supplied; and according to instructions of Mr Ditchburn material to work with was bought to the amount of about $50.00.\n\nThe work is started under the direction of Mr Wiseman, member of the staff; class in the evening between 5-6; and during the regular work hours 6 boys in turn do necessary and practical work under the supervision of the instructor. Just now they are putting shingles on the barn; later on they will put new floors in the play-halls.\n\nRe improving the present service this is very difficult under prevailing conditions. First of all, owing to the location of the school it is impossible to get an instructor from surrounding public schools for a few days a week. Then again by affecting to the work a member of the staff much of his time is taken up and many important improvements and necessary repairs are being put off for weeks and months.\n\nNow if I am allowed to make a suggestion I would say that there should be one man more on the staff i.e.: one instructor for man training and gen.carpentry work: improvements and repairs. one mechanic for all machinery, boats and pipe system. one for farm and stock. one for all odd jobs in and around the house: bakery, furnace, garden etc. one for general discipline when pupils neither in class nor trade, asst.principal, on half day salary. - With this arrangement more time could be given to the pupils for their training, and proper care could be taken of things which begin to require more and more as the buildings are getting older.\n\nBut this can absolutely not be done with our present grant. Up till last spring I was about able to manage things by very careful administration. But since then many things seem to be making it more and more difficult every day: This summer I have been paying for meat as much as 28cts per pound by the quarter. Then 6 sisters who were getting $25.00 per month\nhave asked repeatedly for $50.00 which I have not been able to give so far. Now with this additional work which requires another man it is impossible to manage, with the actual grant.\n\nIn view then of these present conditions I humbly ask the Department kindly to consider the grant we were getting so far and to increase it in such a way as to make it possible to put the whole system on the above proposed basis with one man more, and a fair salary for the work that is done.\n\nBy doing this the Department takes away a great deal of my present worries and will always be assured of the devotedness of\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\n1929-0 - Beckett 170\nAgamich 160\nKuper Isl 170\nAlberni 160\nOttawa, October 25, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the manual training activity at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. I regret that it is impossible to increase the per capita grant, as it would disturb the schedule of payments to schools of the same kind. The Department would like to help you in this important work, and, if you will add a man to the staff, the Department will give a grant of $50 per month for his salary. There would then be, in addition to the Reverend Sisters,\n\nThe Reverend Principal,\nThe Assistant Principal,\nA Boys' Disciplinarian,\nA Handy man,\nA Farmer,\nA Mechanic,\nA Manual Training Instructor.\n\nPlease let me know if you can take advantage of this offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In view then of getting a few of these most\nnecessary sets and two or three more elaborate tools for the instructor\nI hereby apply for a grant of $100.00 one hundred dollars.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 15, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to manual training instruction at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. I note that an instructor was appointed on January first, and the Department will allow $60 per month towards his salary, payable once every quarter, if you will forward a voucher, in favour of the school management, for the service. As our funds are exhausted at the present time, I have to request that the first voucher will not be forwarded until the first of April.\n\nI have also to authorize you to expend $100 for instructor's tools. Please do not make the purchase for a few weeks, so that the account will not reach us before the month of April.

Special and, as not more than $12,000 is being used for Education this year, I wish to recommend that $800 be allowed for the purpose.\n\nDuring the next and the following years, Father Geurts hopes to provide a lathe, a drill and other equipment. Some of it will be purchased by the School, but they will also want help from time to time. This ought to prove a very useful training for the older boys.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nFather Guerts, Principal of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, visited the Department some two weeks ago. He is desirous of erecting a utility building, approximately 20' x 40', in the centre of which will be a machine room and at the ends a blacksmith shop and a repair shop. The basement will be used for storing wood, etc. Father Guerts promised that he would be responsible for the erection of such a building if the Department would provide approximately $500 for materials. Will you please inform him that his request is granted and that he may purchase the materials without delay. The accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded through your office. Father Guerts is receiving a copy of this letter direct for his information. It is understood that the accounts will be paid from B. C. Special Vote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

FREIGHT........... .72\nOttawa, 23rd December, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I may say the Department desires to thank you for drawing attention to the payment of $110.56 made to you recently by official cheque No 5953, as seemingly you received $13.02 in excess of the amount due.\n\nI enclose the voucher received at the Department upon which payment was made. It is No 560, and as you will observe it is certified by the Principal of the Kuper Island Indian School, and by Mr Graham, Indian Agent. It would appear, however, that the charge of $13.02 made in the first invoice (dated 23rd October) is duplicated in the third invoice dated 31st October (See entry Invoice No 1022593, which number appears also on the first invoice mentioned.)\n\nIt seems advisable to point out also that Invoice No 1030506 is referred to twice in accounts dated 31st Oct., although different amounts are charged. Explanation in this connection is desired.\n\nWhen you have examined the Voucher kindly return it to the Department with refund of the amount over paid.\n\nThe account for 72\u00a2 freight prepaid is attached to the voucher form and also account of $1.35 for freight. These accounts were covered by the cheque for $110.56 which you received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nMarshall-Wells B.C.

W.E. Ditchburn, Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLet me remind you of a short interview we had with Dr. Scott, the Deputy Minister, in your office at Victoria on Wednesday, August 19th, regarding the question of providing necessary equipment for carrying on the third year work of instruction in the Motor Mechanics class at Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nThe equipment required by the instructor, and which should be in place within the next four weeks, is a Deisel or semi-Deisel engine; an automatic electric light motor system for a medium sized fishing launch; and a few tools. The Deisel engine we thought would cost between $500.00 and $600.00. Mr. Edwards found one, a used engine, which would answer all purposes of instruction, much cheaper.\n\n1 Scandia 7 horsepower, semi-Deisel engine, 1 cylinder, 2 cycle, equipped with direct reversal and also with reverse clutch. It is a used engine and has been running for eight months. It is in good running order, complete with extra parts $200.00\n\n1 Matthews automatic electric light motor system, model H, 32 volt, 400 watt. This is in splendid condition and good working order 150.00\n\n1 hand drill and drills 12.50\n\n1 vise, 4\" 10.65\n\n1 solder copper and solder 2.45\n\n1 12\" Crescent wrench 2.75\n\n1 8\" Crescent wrench 1.65\n\n1 14\" pipe wrench 2.55\n\n2 tanks for engine test purposes, complete with fittings 15.00\n\n1 blackboard (present one is worn out) 15.00\n\nEstimated freight 10.00\n\n$422.55\nBoth Mr. Edwards and I have been to Vancouver and looked over a number of engines, used and new. The new ones are out of the question at the present time. We could have obtained a used Deisel engine, 20 horsepower, for $500.00 but came across this semi-Deisel. The principles involved in the working of the Deisel and the semi-Deisel are exactly the same, and the price of the 7 horsepower semi-Deisel is such a saving that we are justified in recommending its purchase.\n\nThe small electric light plant for a fishing boat is part of the Motor Mechanics third Year course and it is infinitely better to learn its operation in gas boats than to continue the use of unsafe coal oil lamps which many Indians use.\n\nWhile not an expert, I have personally seen and examined the engine and the lighting plant recommended by Mr. Edwards and feel satisfied we could not do better. They are good value.\n\nThe above, with what was supplied the Motor Mechanics Department last year furnishes sufficient equipment for instructional purposes in the first, second and third years course.\n\nAt the interview to which I referred, I carried away the impression and was encouraged to believe that, when needed, this material would be provided by the Department from a fund you have for such purposes.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending a grant of $425.00 be allowed for the material, tools and equipment as above outlined.\n\nLet me thank you for the interest you have taken in the past in this enterprise of teaching Indian youths, who will most of them be fishermen owning their own motor boats for fishing, how to run their engines and make their own repairs. Such training is certainly essential to their happiness and prosperity. To my mind the success of this branch of technical training warrants further development.\n\nThanking you for your continued interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H.

Raley, principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, in connection with some additional equipment he asked be supplied with for his manual training instruction room for third year pupils.\n\nWhen I was at Coqualeetza school during the later part of May, Mr. Edwards, the manual training instructor, and Mr. Raley spoke to me about obtaining a second-hand Deisel engine in order that the pupils might receive instructions on the operation of this class of internal combustion engine. I informed both Mr. Raley and Mr. Edwards that when they notified me as to just what the cost would be I would then take up the question with yourself.\n\nYou will remember that when you were in Victoria in August, Mr. Raley called at this office and the matter was then discussed, and if I remember correctly you asked him to supply information as to what he proposes getting and what the cost of the same would be. This information is fully contained in Mr. Raley's letter and as the requisition is within reason, I would recommend that he be given authority to expend $425.00 on the equipment and tools mentioned in the list contained in his letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Wiseman, who is about 40 years of age, was trained as carpenter in an Industrial School in the East, and as such has spent over 10 years in Kuper Island.\n\nIn the course of the year about 30 pupils have been receiving manual training instructions, each pupil one half day a week.\n\nBesides this general course 6 pupils have been receiving special training in carpentry. In the manual training shop the pupils have made useful things for in and around the house, such as ladders, step-ladders, tables, benches, desks etc. The carpenters have to their credit an addition to our gym 35/40, with a complete gymnastic outfit; some of the things had been previously supplied by the Department, others are home-made.\n\nIn the past year 5 tons of cement has been used for all kind of improvements and 6 boys have been taught how to mix this properly. They also were taught how to make forms for general building purposes and for more artistic work.\n\nRe gas boats, the bigger boys take turns, at least twice a week, in running a boat, for the regular trips we have to make to Ogemminus.\n\nFinally 4 boys take turns in the bakery under the direction of a man in charge.\n\nThe girls too are properly prepared for their future life, by competent sisters both in the kitchen & sewing room. Pupils over 14 take regular turns in the kitchen where they are taught gen. cooking and baking bread, cakes etc.\n\nIn the laundry the bulk of the washing is done by machine; but besides this every wash day there is always some hand washing and hand ironing.\n\nIn the sewing room the girls do all the darning and mending. The older more advanced girls learn machine sewing. They make all their own dresses and also the shirts of the boys. In fancy needle work and crochet they compete most favorably with the whites as has been proved by the many exhibition prices.\nAll the pupils are keenly interested in this kind of work. The best articles produced, sent to the local exhibition, have given a real name to the school. The Indians are proud of their children and their work. And sometimes you hear the whites express the wish to have a school like Kuper for their children.\n\nThe results more than justify the expenditure.\n\nPrincipal.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nCowichan Agency\n\nTo: Rev.

Geurts, for Manual Training Instructor, Kuper Island Indian Residential School, Dec, quarter, 1934.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nVocational Training:\n\nThere is little to add to previous reports on the Vocational Training given at Kuper Island.\n\nThe girls make all their clothes with the exception of underwear. Of course all mending, darning, sewing, is taught with great care by the Sisters in charge. The Boys' shirts are made by the Girls and the Singer sewing machines are in constant use. There are only two good Singer machines and one Singer Tailor Machine supplied during the past few years which are of much use now. The other machines are quite worn out. In view of the very good work being done and the large quantity of clothes made up here, I would strongly recommend the supply of ONE NEW TAILOR SINGER MACHINE at the present time. I have in mind letters received from the Department in the past with regard to the number of machines thought to be necessary in these schools, but am of the opinion that another heavy machine is badly needed here.\n\nThe work in Manual Training is still under the charge of Brother E. Wiseman. I inspected the Manual Training Shop, though there were no boys working there at the time. The work done during the year appears to be much the same as has been reported on previously. The M.T. Class under guidance reshingled the roof of the Gymnasium Building. The Department supplied the shingles. The work looks as if it had been very well carried out. While inspecting the M.T. Shop, I noticed that the shavings had been swept under the benches which are against the walls. This is a very bad arrangement. It is very untidy, and a spark might cause a fire. I asked the Principal to see that the shavings after a day's work be swept up before the boys left and that these shavings be placed in a box or barrel kept for this purpose. They could then be taken to the Boiler Room and used to light fires, etc., or just burned if not wanted. I would suggest that if the Department were writing to the Principal my suggestion be endorsed and instructions given that the M.T. Shop be kept clear of saw dust and shavings when the boys are not working there.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Kuper Island Indian Residential School on January 29th and 30th, last.\n\nThe Inspector reports that, while inspecting the manual training shop, he noticed that the shavings had been swept under the benches, which are against the wall.\n\nThe Department considers this a bad arrangement owing to the fact that a spark might cause a fire.

This report indicates that vocational instruction in your school was very effectively organized when you wrote this particular report.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to supply me with information, indicating just what progress has been made by the students who took this course of instruction, after their departure from school. I should also like to have from you an expression of opinion as to the attitude of the students to this work and also the attitude of the Indian parents. The Minister of the Department expressed the view in Parliament, a few days ago, that our courses of study should become gradually and steadily more vocational in character. In seeking this information from you, I am simply making an attempt to carry out the policy the Minister has in mind. Any additional suggestions you may care to offer would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Jos.

Morris to the position of Manual Training Instructor at the above-mentioned school. The Principal, the Reverend Father Camirand, is prepared to employ this applicant and requests that the Department make a grant towards his salary.\n\nThis applicant has had no formal course for instruction in this work. He has, however, considerable practical experience and is prepared to assist in the organization and supervision of games. He has also had experience in handling boys and it is, therefore, recommended that the grant towards his salary be set at $100.00 per month, in accordance with the new grant schedule.\n\nW.S.

Morris, has resigned.\n\nAttached is an application from the Principal for the appointment of Brother Wiseman as Manual Training Instructor. Inspector Davey has had an opportunity to see some of Brother Wiseman's work and he appears to be a capable craftsman. Unfortunately, due to a rheumatic condition he is unable to take the boys for sports. He also has a pronounced French accent and his English is none too good. The Inspector feels however that Mr. Wiseman would make a satisfactory substitute in the manual training shop for the remainder of the current academic year and I would recommend that he be classified in the lowest bracket for salary purposes.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n25th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

It is felt that although the cost of the planer and motor will be approximately $500.00, according to quotations received, this expenditure would be recovered through the use of salvaged material. The supplying of power tools to this residential school is justified in that there is an opportunity for graduate pupils to make use of this type of equipment when they leave school. On the reserve adjoining the school property an Indian has established a boatbuilding business in which he makes use of power equipment of this type.\n\nIt is recommended that the purchase of the above items be authorized, with the exception of the sewing machines with which the school appears to be adequately supplied.\n\nIt is considered that this expenditure is a legitimate charge against the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nA letter recently received here from the Principal of the above school, stated that he was submitting requisitions for Manual Training shop equipment and sewing machines, as discussed with Mr. Davey during his last visit.\n\nI may say that this is the first intimation I've had about the Planer, and no mention was made of anything like it last year, when the Estimates were being prepared. I think the Reverend Principal has misunderstood, but in case the Department will buy this for him, without it being included in the Estimates, I will send it forward, anyway. Should it not be in order now, I will appreciate its return so that I may hold it until the Estimates are being prepared for next year.\n\nThe two sewing machines asked for are badly needed, I understand, as their present machines (eight of them) are not in good repair and insufficient for the school's requirements.\n\nIf in order, I would recommend approval of all the equipment asked for, as it is impossible to get an instructor to go to that school to work without equipment. The planer would save a lot of money in the price of lumber, as well as good training for the boys.\n\nR. H. MOORE,\nSuperintendent,\nCowichan Agency.\n\nRHM: LS\nEncls.11.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island B.C.\n\nApril 28/49\n\nPLANNER\n\nThis item would occasion considerable savings for the reason that old material could be salvaged and turned in for good use in the shop; also because rough lumber is always available at low cost and could be planed in the shop in sizes to suit the purpose.\n\nIt is this requirement of lumber in small widths or sizes that bring up the cost of lumber for cabinet work.\n\nAs there is a prospect of having to tear down old buildings, much of the lumber salvaged could thus be used for various projects.\n\nA 3 H.P. motor would be required to operate this planer.\n\nRev.

There is little therein to sustain the view that in shop work he is a practical man with experience as a skilled worker which is the basic requirement for classification in Grade 1. It is noted that Mr. Carsen is only twenty-six and that for the five years preceding this application has been engaged in occupations unlikely to maintain or develop any skills he may have acquired during his earlier and comparatively brief experience in woodworking trades.\n\nIt is considered, therefore, that his qualifications to conduct the manual training course are inadequate and appointment as a manual training instructor cannot, accordingly, be approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6457, file 885-11, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nYour File 885-11 (E3)\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor\nKuper Island Residential School\n\nI attach herewith a letter from the Reverend Principal of the above-mentioned School, concerning the employment of a Manual Training Instructor.\n\nIt will be noted that Father Camirand requests the re-employment of Brother Wiseman, who was formerly employed in the capacity of Manual Training Instructor at the Kuper Island School.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department approve the Reverend Father's request.\n\nW.S.

Box 70\nVancouver B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of 22nd instant,(Z-II-2) stating the Department are not prepared to make a grant towards the salary of Mr. John Carlsen, whose appointment as Manual Training Instructor at this school was recommended by Inspector Davey. I presume this is due to the fact that Mr. Carlsen could not produce a certificate for woodwork, and I can well see that this is very much required. It is however the intention of Mr. Carlsen to obtain this as soon as possible through a correspondence course if possible. He tells me he has had training in woodwork in an Institution for deaf and dumb in Vancouver and later taught woodwork there.\n\nI beg to state that otherwise Mr. Carlsen is most qualified in handling boys on the playground and elsewhere and is well liked by the boys. An all-around athlete and capable of coaching any line of sports, he would be the right man for this school, considering that his defect of hearing which does not handicap him to much extent with his hearing aid, makes that he is satisfied to isolate himself on an island, having no desire to associate with others outside, which makes it most convenient in a place like this. If he could better his position as a woodworker and obtain the certificate required, I feel some consideration should be extended him, for it is no easy matter to find a good playground supervisor who is also a good shop instructor and willing to live on an island.\n\nTherefore may I kindly ask if the Department will consider maintaining the Instructor we have had these past years, Brother Wiseman, an experienced carpenter, at the salary granted for the term ending June last, and this for the next three months, during which time Mr. Carlsen will endeavor to obtain a certificate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Morrow, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs instructed by the authorities of the Methodist Church, I beg leave to apply, through you as Indian Agent to the Department of Indian Affairs to grant that the two Boarding Schools at Fort Simpson, known as the Crosby Girls Home and the Port Simpson Boys Home, be combined into an Industrial Institute with all the larger powers and privileges pertaining thereto and thus the better enable it to meet the needs of the very large school population of Port Simpson and the surrounding territory.\n\nIn support of this request I most respectfully present the following reasons for your consideration and that of the Department.\n\n1. Port Simpson as a town has the largest Indian population in British Columbia, numbering between 700 and 800.\n\n2. It is the acknowledged centre of the Queen Charlotte Island Indians E.G. Skidegate and Massett and of the Nass River Indians, E.G. Kincolith, Greenville etc., aggregating in all about 2300 Indians.\n\n3. In these communities there are scores of large boys and young men as in Port Simpson who need the advantages of just such trades as are taught in an Industrial Institute and which are not now afforded them.\n\n4. The Indian Population are keenly alive to this need and feel the urgent necessity of having this Institute established in their midst. This need they have felt for years past and have been constantly clamoring for such an Institute and are earnestly asking for it now.\n\n5. The above mentioned Government Boarding Schools are well equipped, well patronized and doing excellent work, but their efficiency would be immensely increased and the needs of the situation would be very much more completely met were they unified and expanded into an Industrial Institute. It would also be in harmony with the fitness of things that the largest Indian Community of British Columbia should receive this recognition of its needs when so many smaller places have so long been thus favored by the Indian Department.\n\nTrusting that this petition on behalf of the Indians as well as the Department will receive most earnest and favorable consideration both from you and the Department,\n\nI remain most respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, February 14th, 1905.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter, dated the 7th instant from Mr. Agent Morrow of the North West Coast Agency, covering an application of the 1st of the present month made to him by the Reverend R. Whittington, Vancouver, B. C., Superintendent of Methodist missions in British Columbia, for the unification into an Industrial school of the Boys' and Girls' Boarding schools at Port Simpson. As is known to the Department these two institutions are quite separate and distinct although both are located in the Port Simpson village. The reasons assigned by Dr. Whittington for wishing to bring about the change are, in the main correct, as stated by the Agent, and if sufficient agricultural land can be secured in the vicinity to give effect to the proposal I see no objection to the carrying out of the scheme, provided the arrangement suggested meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose you an application from Rev Dr Whittington, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Missions in British Columbia, to have the two boarding schools at Port Simpson, the \"Crosby Girls Home\", and the \"Port Simpson Boys home\", combined into one Industrial school.\n\nIn support of his request under clauses (1) (2) (3) (4) and (5) he gives his reasons for desiring the change. I cannot agree with the arguments advanced by Dr Whittington in clause (2) viz that Port Simpson is the acknowledged centre of Queen Charlotte Island, and Naas River Indians, as these Indians have their own reserve, villages and homes, and at present frequent Port Simpson even for trading purposes very little, compared with what they did in olden times, as they now congregate at the salmon fishing centres, the Naas and Skeena rivers, and return to their homes when the fishing season is over.\n\nWith reference to last part of clause (3) I may also add, that a number of Naas River and Massett Indian boys attend the Metlakatla Industrial school.\n\nWith these exceptions the Doctor's arguments are good, and correct in every particular and if the Department entertain this question and decide to establish another Industrial school in the Agency,\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent.\nVictoria, B.C.\nI beg to strongly recommend that the proposal made by Dr Whittington be acted on, as the material for an Industrial school, viewed from every standpoint, is to be found at Port Simpson, and no doubt rests in my mind that same could be easily filled with Indian boys and girls. In fact, the institutions located there have more applications than they can accept. Further, an industrial school conducted under the direction of competent trades instructors, is no doubt the education that is required by Indians, and Port Simpson certainly is an excellent point for the establishment of such.\n\nDr Whittington informs me he is going to Ottawa to lay the matter before the Department, and he will be able to inform the Department on all points, and lay his proposals before the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and if his proposal is favourably considered by them, and it is decided to establish another Industrial school in the Agency, I certainly have no hesitation in stating that Port Simpson is the proper place to establish same.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 14th instant covering an application from the Rev. R. Whittington, Superintendent of Methodist Missions in British Columbia for the unification into an Industrial School of the boys and girls boarding schools at Fort Simpson together with a letter from Mr. Agent Morrow on this application.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not favourable to increasing the number of Industrial Schools in British Columbia for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.W.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI hope that our application for an Industrial Institute at Port Simpson will be the next to be honored with the Department's consent. It would have a splendid effect on the largest Indian Community in British Columbia, which cannot understand why they should be discriminated against for that is how they regard it.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you very much for your favor of the 7th inst.; for the sanction to acquire the Annie Jim Lot, and also for the hope of an additional grant for the Fort Simpson Day School. As the original grant for this school lapses on the 30th of June and the time is getting short for getting out the material for the new plan of which the Dept. evidently approves I am going ahead on my own responsibility lest everything should lapse. As soon as you can give me any further assurance with regard to this item it will relieve my anxiety and greatly oblige me.\n\nAs to the $1500 grant for the Coqualeetza your earliest convenience will greatly facilitate matters as the house is suffering in its present incomplete state. I may say that my name has been added to the Committee of Management of this home and I hope that in future that things will move in proper order and in harmony with the Dept.\n\nI hope that our application for an Industrial Institute at Fort Simpson will be the next to be honored with the Department's consent. It would have a splendid effect on the largest Indian Community in British Columbia, which cannot understand why they should be discriminated against for that is how they regard it.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR. Whittington.\nVancouver, March 18th, 1905.\n\nHon. Mr. Sloan,\n\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Sloan,\n\nI am given to understand that the R.Cs. are pushing for Industrial Institutes at North Vancouver and Kuper Island. I think that you have right of way for me with reference to the Port Simpson Industrial Institute at Port Simpson. I am writing by this mail to Mr. Macpherson and to Ralph Smith where these other desired Institutes are located and I have no doubt that they will agree with you that Port Simpson should have the first consideration.\n\nThe R.Cs. have already five Institutes in the province whilst we have only one and our work is in no sense secondary to theirs to say the least of it.\n\nIt is not my object to press either the Government unduly in this matter, but the effect would be exceedingly bad if we were set aside whilst these others get everything they ask for.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. Whittington\nVancouver, March 20th, 1905.\n\nHon. R. G. Macpherson,\n\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Macpherson,\n\nSince my return I have heard that the R. Cs. are pressing for Institutes at Kuper Island and North Vancouver. I feel that application for Port Simpson should have right of way and I have written to Messers Smith and Sloan the members concerned along with you in this matter to see to it that we are the first to have consent. I do not wish to be understood as pressing any of you or the Government too closely or of interfering with other churches where you all are the best judges, but I feel that we should have the first consideration for the effect would be very bad in the north and for our church if it were demonstrated that the others could get what they wanted and we could get nothing although the reasonableness of our claim has not been controverted. The R. Cs. already have five Institutes in this province and we have only one and yet our work is in no sense inferior to theirs.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR. Whitteupton.\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose a communication from the Rev. Dr. Whittington re his request for consideration for the Fort Simpson Industrial Institute.\n\nI trust that you will be able to give the Rev. Doctor a satisfactory assurance that you intend to deal with this matter at a very early date.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

R. Whittington, Superintendent of Methodist Missions in B.C., regarding certain applications made by him to the Department for grants for the establishment of an industrial school at Port Simpson and assistance towards the erection of a Principal's dwelling at Coqualeetsa Institute, and to the reverend gentleman's remarks relative to applications which have been submitted to the Department by the Roman Catholics for additional aid to their schools, I beg to say that the Department is not making any increase this year to the Roman Catholic schools or establishing any new institutions for them.\n\nOn the 16th March last, Mr. Supt. Vowell forwarded a letter from Mr. Agent Robertson covering an application from the Principal of Kuper Island Industrial school for an additional allowance for 25 pupils at that institution. Mr. Vowell was informed that the Department could not entertain this application favorably at present.\n\nIn February last Mr. MacPherson, M.P., left a petition with the Department from the Chiefs of the Squamish tribe for the conversion of the Squamish\nboarding school into an industrial institute, and on\nthe 13th of that month, Mr MacPherson was advised that\nthe Department could not comply with this request\nas it considered it inadvisable to increase the num-\nber of industrial schools in B.C. at present. Mr\nMacPherson replied on the 22nd Feb., that he was very\nsorry for the stand taken by the Department in this\ninstance and he would like very much if it would take\nthe matter up and ask the Agent for a report. In com-\npliance with this request, Mr Vowell was written to,\nbut up to the present no reply has been received.\n\nAs I understand the situation in B.C., it is\nnot the Department's intention to increase the number\nof industrial schools in that province at present.\nIf it is ever thought advisable to add to their num-\nber, the Methodists would be fairly entitled to con-\nsideration, as out of a total population of 25,234, they\nhave 3,130 adherents with one industrial school,\nwhile the Church of England with 4,017 have three\nindustrial schools and the Roman Catholics five for\n11,555 members of their church, making nine industrial\nschools in all. In addition to the industrial schools\nthere are eight boarding schools and thirty day\nschools in operation. The eight boarding schools are\nequally divided between the Methodists, Roman Catholics,\nChurch of England and Presbyterians, two to each.\n\nWhen Dr Whittington was in Ottawa last\nwinter he discussed the claims of his church with you\nin my presence and it was decided that he should re-\nceive a sufficient grant to complete the Port Simp-\nson day school building and that the question of con-\ntributing towards the erection of the Principal's\nresidence at Coqualeetza, although decided against on\nseveral occasions, would be again considered when the Supplementary Estimates were being dealt with. I may state that $1500.00 is placed in this estimate for this school.\n\nThe question of converting the Port Simpson boarding school into an industrial school was also referred to and I understood him to say that he was willing to let it remain in abeyance for the present.\n\nI consider it unwise to make any changes in the existing schools until a definite school policy has been decided upon.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 936-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, 3rd April, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing a communication addressed to you by Rev.

R. Whittington D.D., Superintendent of Methodist Indian Missions in B.C., at the frequent urgent request of the Indians of this Northern Coast, has recently presented a request to the Department to have the two Indian Boarding Schools converted into an Industrial School, that our Native young people may thereby be taught the useful trades so much needed among them on this Northern Coast. Unfortunately the granting of Mr. Whittington's request is being delayed. We are told that the present policy of the Department is not to establish more Industrial Schools in B.C., but we earnestly hope that to meet the necessities of the over 1,000 Indians at our comparatively adjacent to Port Simpson, this will be made a necessary exception.\n\nEnclosed I am forwarding an urgent petition praying for the granting of this request as early as possible, beginning with the coming fiscal year (July) that we may be ready for effective work by the first of Sept. when our people return from the Salmon Fishing.\n\nThe accompanying petition has been signed by the white citizens of Port Simpson (Cootes), nearly all of whom are...\nThere is also as you will see, a signed endorser by the Hudson's Bay Company Council\u2014another by the Chiefs of the Tsimshian Nation, and still another signed by our best friend Mr. at Port Simpson. They speak for themselves and I need say no more, but I am sure Sir, that if the Department were here, and could see for themselves the absolute necessity of our young people being taught the useful trades, the petition would immediately be granted.\n\nCommitting all to your most favorable consideration and trusting for an early and an affirmative reply,\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nJohn Greenfield,\nPresident Minister.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 9th May, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the petitions hereunder from residents of Port Simpson and Chiefs and Councillors of the Port Simpson Band for the amalgamation of the Boys and Girls Boarding schools at that place into an industrial school, transmitted to the Department by Rev. Mr. Grenfell, resident Methodist minister at that place, I beg to say that Rev. Mr. Whittington, Superintendent of Methodist Missions in B.C., submitted a similar proposition to the Department a few months ago personally and again by letter of the 18th March last, when he was informed that the Department regretted that it did not at present see its way clear to meet his wishes in this direction, and Mr. Macpherson M.P. and Mr. Sloan, M.P., who had written the Department in behalf of Dr. Whittington's project, were similarly informed.\n\nDr. Whittington in support of his application claims that Port Simpson is the largest Indian centre in B.C., and the town has an Indian population of 703 all of whom are Methodists, who have Indian adherents in the North-West Coast Agency to the number of 204. He claims that there are scores of large boys and young men in this district (including Port Simpson) who need the advantages of just such trades as are taught in an industrial institute, and which are not now afforded them. He says that the\nIndian population feel the urgent necessity of having this institution established in their midst.\n\nI think he has reserved his principal reason for the last. It is that the largest Indian community in B.C. should receive recognition when so many smaller places have so long been thus favored by the Indian Department.\n\nWith regard to the needs of Port Simpson which is the principal settlement in this Agency, I may say that there were 157 children of school age at this place. There are three schools now in operation at this point; the Day school with an enrollment of 62 last quarter; the Girls Home with 45 and the Boys Home with 24 pupils, making a total of 131 children attending school, which is not a bad showing for Indians. I doubt if this showing can be equaled in many white settlements.\n\nThe Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church established the Girls school (which is called the Crosby Home) nearly thirty years ago and put up expensive buildings costing the Society from $8000.00 to $10,000 with accommodation for about 50 resident pupils. This school was conducted solely at the cost of the Society until the year 1892 when a grant for 20 pupils at $60 per capita was made by the Government. This number has now been increased to 35 and the school is still conducted by the above named Society, which works independently of the Methodist Missionary Society, which is carrying on the Boys Home and the Day School.\n\nThe Boys Home was established in 1888 under the auspices of the Methodist Church and it only\nreceived the Departmental grant of $60 per cap. for 10 pupils on the 1st July 1902, and last year this was increased to 20.\n\nA new day school building is under construction at Port Simpson, which will accommodate all the children in the town and the Department has agreed to pay the cost of the materials used in its erection which will amount to about $1900.00.\n\nAt present all the Indians in this Agency make their living by fishing and hunting, chiefly fishing. They make good wages and are much better off than the usual run of Indians, and I fail to see what special benefit the establishment of an Industrial school would be to them, as their present occupation affords them ample means of subsistence, and any trades instruction they might receive in such a school would never enable them to compete with white mechanics.\n\nThe whole object of the petition, as I see it, is to obtain more money. The per capita allowance to boarding schools in B.C. is only $60 per head, while the grant to Industrial schools is $130.00 for each pupil. Of course the increased grant would be a great relief to the Women's Association and the Methodist Missionary Society, which are now taxed to keep to keep the two institutions in operation with only $60.00 a head.\n\nThere are 9 Industrial schools in operation in B.C., and the Methodists have control of only one, the Roman Catholics having 5 and the Ch. of England three. The census returns show that out of a population of 25,234 Indians, the Methodists have 3,130 adherents as against 11,556 Roman Catholics and 4,017 Anglicans in the Province. The Presbyterians\nhave only 303, and the religious belief of the 3500 nomadic Indians is not given. Basing their claim on the census, the Methodists would be entitled to more industrial schools if it were the policy of the Department to increase their number. It is for the Department to decide whether the Industrial school offers sufficient superior advantages over the other class of schools to justify it in establishing more.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 17th, 1905.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nWith reference to the enclosed letters and petition regarding the conversion of the Port Simpson Boarding Schools for boys and girls into an industrial school, I beg leave to enclose herewith a detailed memorandum from the head of the Schools Branch.

I am amazed at the progress made since I came to Canada in 1868, and especially during the vigorous administration of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and his Cabinet. A gentleman of large experience promised some years ago that the next few years will see wonderful developments on this northern coast of B.C in mines and forests\u2014 and I can hardly believe it.\n\nWill you permit me to call your attention to the petition which you so kindly early laid before the Department last year, for the transforming of the two Indian Boarding Schools here into an Industrial Institute, so urgently needed in this place. We are all confident that our representative is not only willing but able to bring this to pass.\n\nWith kind regards and many wishes for a very agreeable successful session.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

The application is evidently made with the view to obtaining the increased grant paid to an industrial school. The boarding schools in British Columbia only get $60 per capita, while the industrial schools get at the rate of $130.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to your own memorandum to the Minister, of May 17, last, in which you stated that you certainly think that the Department should go slowly in the matter of establishing industrial schools.\nOttawa, April 6, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the letter addressed to you on the 4th inst., respecting the petition of the Rev.

February 16th, 1918.\n\nTo the Government of Canada, & the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada\u2014\n\nWe the undersigned male members of the Port Simpson band of Indians, humbly present our petition for the erection of an Industrial School on the Port Simpson Reserve.\n\nWe would bring forward for your consideration a few of the reasons why we think our petition should be granted.\n\n1. This is the largest Indian village in all of northern British Columbia, having a population of over 700 Indian people.\n\n2. We have had a Boarding School for boys for a great number of years, which has been closed recently, because the buildings were no longer suitable for the purpose. This School was always supplied to its capacity with boys.\n\n3. We now have a Boarding School for girls, under the management of the Nomans Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, with accommodation for 40 girls. This School is full, & girls on a waiting list. We feel strongly that our boys should receive an equal training with our girls.\n\n4. No other School on the Coast or in the Interior can adequately minister to our needs, & we have in Port Simpson & tributary Indian villages, enough children to supply such an Institute.\n\n5. Because we are within 25 miles of Prince Rupert,\u2014the Western terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway,\u2014this village should be an outstanding one, of which the residents, the Government, & the Church can be justly proud, & to which we can welcome tourists & others, & show them the adequate provision that has been made for the advancement of the younger generation of Indians.\n\n6. The labor conditions yearly becoming more acute, insist that our young people should be more thoroughly equipped to take their just position in the development of this Northern country.\n1. The Chiefs & adult males of the Fort Simpson Band of Indians, this day, in meeting assembled, unanimously agreed to set aside six acres of the Reserve, for the use of such an Institution, the Government to select the site of such school.\n\n2. Our Reserved lands are not suitable for the pursuit of agriculture, so that the training provided at the Coqualeetza Institute in farming, is in great measure lost on our boys. A similar Institute, if built at Hazelton, would be open to like objection. We require, here on the Coast, an Industrial Institute where training can be given in engineering, mechanics, boat building, carpentry, etc.\n\n3. There is a Hospital adjoining the Reserve, so that the pupils could have close medical supervision, and hospital care when necessary.\n\n4. While the soil here is not as productive as that of the interior, it is well suited to the growing of various produce. Freight rates on the Steamer from the Southern Cities, are quite reasonable, so that the expense of operating an Institute would probably be no greater here than in the interior. The question, primarily, is not one of land, but of the education of children, & we believe that our children would be best served by a coast Institution.\n\n5. If conditions remain as at present, the girls graduating from the Girls' Hose, will not find the boys of the village, with inferior training, congenial, & the tendency will be away from marriage, with the attending dangers of a nearby Coast city.\n\n6. The Government & Church know, by past experience, that a boys' Hose can be successfully maintained at this place, & we feel a school should be reopened here, before other Institutes are undertaken elsewhere.\n\nHenry L.

J. H. Arnup, B.A., Assistant Secretary of the Foreign Department of the Methodist Church of Canada, Dr. J. C. Spencer, Dr. R. W. Large, Captain Wm. Oliver & Rev. George W. Dean, of Mission Ship \"Thomas Crosby\".\n\nAddress of Joseph Bradley.\n\nMr. Chairman, Friends of the village & Chiefs.-\n\nWe thank God & the King. We are thankful to God for sparing Rev. Mr. Arnup to come and meet with us\nin Port Simpson. I have the pleasure of asking him what authority he has. You remember this world is all a great race. It is many years past since the Tsimsheans started to run a race against two countries\u2014the Japanese & Chinese. The Japanese are ahead of us\u2014here we are behind. We are thankful to the Government for sending us teachers to train our children. We greet every skilful worker. First Ministers were sent amongst us and also Schools, and we have always wished our children to have more education. We are standing still while the Japanese are distancing us in the race. We are asking for a long time for an Industrial School. I have travelled considerably, and have seen various countries and schools, and I would like to know why we haven't one here? I saw one at Tacoma which was excellent. Why cannot we have as good a one as the Americans?\n\nAddress of Matthew Johnston.\n\nI wish to speak to you about the School. When Mr. Ferrier was here last he said the Government was going to build an Industrial School here\u2014a better one than the one at Chilliwack. I would like to ask Mr. Arnup what kind of a School the Government intends building here?\n\nWhen Mr. Ferrier came he wanted a block of\nland for the School. The second time he came he wanted six acres. It was not our fault at that time that the School was not built,\u2014Mr. Ferrier changed the amount of land he required. He told us that the building would be of brick, concrete and woodwork.\n\nWe want a good school. We will give the six acres for a good school, as Mr. Ferrier has asked, and we would like to have the school right away. We have plenty of Indian carpenters here to help put up the school, so that white carpenters will not be required. We also have a blacksmith shop.\n\nI am glad to meet you, Mr. Arnup, with a smiling face. We smile back at you. Mr. Raley did his best to have the school while he was here, and now I think Doctor Spencer should be well pleased.\n\nAddress of Moses Johnston.\n\nMr. Chairman. I wish to return thanks, on behalf of the audience, for the privilege of talking with Rev. Mr. Arnup of the Missionary Society, for sending the Gospel all over the country. We now can tell what is right and what is wrong. These last few days our thoughts have been fixed on the new School, which we have long talked about. It is the earnest wish, Mr. Arnup, of the village, that you will tell us whether\nthis school has been passed over to some other place, or how it now stands. I believe, Mr. Arnup, that this will bring the question to a conclusion. If you will answer this, we can then go on to further discussion, if it has not been passed over to another village. We thank you for your kind attention.\n\nAddress of Rev. J. H. Arnup, B.A.\n\nMr. Chairman and members of this meeting,\n\nI do not need to tell the men how glad I am to be among them. If I did not wish to be among them, I would not have come so far to meet them. It has been my wish to visit the Coast ever since I entered the employ of the Missionary Society. When Rev. Dr. Chown and Rev. Mr. Farrell were here, I wished to come, but was prevented. About a year ago I hoped to come, but was disappointed. So you can understand why, when I did come, I had a wide smile on my face. I am not used to smiling on people I do not wish to see. Also, since I came, the Missionaries and the people have all smiled on me.\n\nYou wish me to talk about the matter of the School which has brought us together. My interest in this question is all the greater because for a number of years I taught school myself. The people who neglect\nthe education of the children are like those who in the spring time neglect to cultivate their garden, and in the fall find nothing has grown. I was glad to hear you thank the Government and the Church for the schools you have. It is well for us to remember that we first had the Missionary,- afterwards the schools, which at first were supplied and paid for by the Church. Now the schools given by the Government for the people are assisted by the counsel of Mr. Ferrier, who waits upon the Government each year and makes suggestions re the better assistance to the Indian schools. All the Missionary Officials are in favour of Port Simpson having a School. Mr. Ferrier has advocated it for years. Dr. Wrench and Mr. Raley have both told me they thought Port Simpson should have an Industrial School. Dr. Spencer and Dr. Large have told me they thought there should be a school here. This is the position of our Church.\n\nThe Government is also concerned in this question. Mr. Ferrier first brought it to the attention of the Government when he first asked the people for the small piece of land. The Government thought,- and I think they were right,- that a small piece of land was not sufficient for the kind of school they wanted to build. After discussion, the Government promised to build the school if more land was granted. Mr. Ferrier came and asked for six acres, but the people voted\nagainst it. It was a great disappointment to Mr. Ferrier and the Missionary Society. Mr. Ferrier had to go back to the Government and say, the people would not give the land. This was after the plans had been partly drawn and the money granted. The plans had to stop, and the money used for other purposes.\n\nYou ask me if this school has been passed over for another place, and I will tell you exactly what I think. We needed two or three schools in British Columbia. Mr. Ferrier thought the Port Simpson school should be built first, and that is why he asked the Government for it. When he was unable to get the land for the Port Simpson School, he asked the Government to go on with one of the other schools.\n\nAs you know, for many years we have had land at Hazelton, which Dr. Crosby got for school purposes. Mr. Ferrier thought the Port Simpson school should first be built, but when he failed here, he asked for the school at Hazelton. The Government said they would go on with it, and if the war had not broken out the school at Hazelton would have been started. But the war called for so much expenditure that all building of schools was left until after the war. So far as I know, it was not intended that the school at Hazelton should minister to the children at Port Simpson. In that way it is true to say that the Simpson school has not been passed\nover for another place. After the war when the Government starts again to build schools for us, they will have this record.\n\n1.- A school which they planned for Port Simpson, but which was stopped because of not having lands available.\n\n2.- The school at Hazelton for which they had land. I do not know which of these two schools the Government will go ahead with first. They will not build both at once. It is your business as a people's Counsel to show the Government why they should go ahead with the school at Port Simpson. You have taken the first step in passing unanimously yesterday at your meeting a resolution to grant the land. I think you should restate this in a resolution from this meeting and that copies should be sent to Mr. Ferrier, the Government, and the Missionary Society. I think also you should draw up a petition setting out the reasons why you think the first school built, would be built here. In dealing with the Government and the Church, the people who show the best reasons, will get their request granted. No one can state your needs better than yourselves and the Missionaries with you.\n\nI do not know what action the Government will take and therefore I cannot state which school will be built first, but I can promise that I will tell what I\nhave seen and heard of the needs here, to the Missionary Board.\n\nOne has asked me what authority I have. If that means what authority I have to do, I haven't any. My position is to get the facts for the Missionary Board, and explain to them as their representative these facts so that they will know what to do. That is why I have come here. And when I go back and tell them how you have smiled on me and about this meeting they will feel better than they did when word came that the people of Port Simpson would not grant the site for a school.\n\nI am sorry for having spoken so long, but I wish to place the matter clearly before you.\n\nI thank the Chairman, Interpreter, Chiefs and people for the careful hearing they have given me.\n\nAddress of Joseph Bradley.\n\nThe Gospel came to Port Simpson first, and therefore we should have first consideration. This is the best place for the following reasons:\n\nThis is a centre, and the tributary places would send children here,- as they look to Port Simpson for leadership. I think we should have a petition drawn up and signed, so that Mr. Arnup may have a copy for the Board.\nWe have granted the six acres on the understanding it is to be an Industrial School that will be built.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWilliam Musgrave,-\n\nI move first that we vote in the presence of Mr. Arnup on this question of a school and the granting of the six acres of land.\n\nJoseph Ryan,-\n\nI second the resolution that we are willing to give the six acres of land desired, and that we want an Industrial School built by the Government at Port Simpson.\n\nChairman Henry Nelson,-\n\nVote on this granting of the six acres of land for school\n\nPassed unanimously by a standing vote.\n\nVote as to the desiring of an Industrial School at Port Simpson to be built first.\n\nPassed unanimously by a standing vote.\n\nMoved by Charles Wesley, seconded by Joseph Ryan, that the Government can have the six acres anywhere they desire, as long as they build the school on it.\n\nPassed unanimously by standing vote.\nI declare the above to be a true report of the proceedings of the meeting.\n\nRichard W. Large,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 5, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo enclosing a copy of a petition from the Fort Simpson Band of Indians asking for the erection of an industrial school on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will be taken up with the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. G.

Macdonald, B.A.\nSECONDED BY Rev. J. H. Macdonald, B.A.\n\nWHEREAS it has been apparent since the closing of the BOYS' BOARDING SCHOOL at Fort Simpson, B.C., by the Department of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church of Canada, that no provision exists in Northern British Columbia and north of Alert Bay for the residential school accommodation of Indian boys for whom a boarding school education would be preferable to that of an Indian day school;\n\nand whereas it is probable that considerably over 100 boys could be secured for enrolment if such facilities were available;\n\nand WHEREAS the Crosby Girls' Boarding School at Fort Simpson, having accommodation for an enrolment of 40 grant earning pupils in residence while there is always a larger number seeking admission, and the building is old, poorly lit and insufficiently ventilated;\n\nand WHEREAS Indian boys are being sent over 500 miles to the south to attend boarding schools, often contrary to the wishes of parents who would wish to see them in a school nearer home;\n\nand WHEREAS it is deemed to be in the best interests of Indian education in these parts to have a larger building or buildings for the accommodation of about 150 or 200 pupils of both sexes, either under one roof or separately as may be most desirable;\n\nand WHEREAS a desirable site for such a building can be located either within or outside the Fort Simpson Indian Reserve:\n\nBE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that this meeting of the Fort Simpson District representatives of the Methodist Church of Canada go on record as being favourable to the establishment of such an institution; and that notice of the resolution be sent to: The Women's Missionary Society, Toronto;\nThe Supt of Indian Education (Mr. Ferrier);\nThe Deputy Superintendent Gen.of Indian Affairs,\nThe Indian Agent and\nC.W. Peck, V.C., M.P.\n\nCarried unanimously.\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the attached resolution I herewith enclose such resolution for your perusal.\n\nThe District Meeting is in urgent hope of speedy action in this matter and I therefore beg leave to heartily commend this to your very favourable consideration.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSecretary.\nNovember 30, 1919.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with regard to the establishment of an Indian boarding school at Fort Simpson. I am fully in sympathy with the spirit which actuated the District Meeting in this matter, and I greatly appreciate the devoted interest which the Methodist Church has shown with regard to Indian education. I regret, however, to inform you that I am unable to see any present prospect of undertaking the erection of such a boarding school.\n\nWe are of course prepared to keep up our present establishment for Indian education throughout the country, and to support our schools to the fullest extent that our parliamentary appropriation will allow, but the erection of new school buildings, which would involve such a large initial expenditure at this time, owing to the high cost of material and rates of wages, will have to be carefully considered in connection with the present financial situation.\n\nThe present need for public economy places stringent limitations upon our expenditure, which, as you will readily understand, are very difficult, and in some cases, impossible to surmount. I regret that I am unable to give you more encouragement in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.H. Nuttall,\nPastor,\nFirst Methodist Church,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nRESOLUTION\n\nMOVED BY Rev. J.H. Hewitt, B.A.\n\nSECND BY Rev. A.M. Mitchell, B.A.\n\nWHEREAS it has been apparent since the closing of the BOYS' BOARDING SCHOOL at Fort Simpson, B.C., by the Department of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church of Canada, that no provision exists in both British Columbia and north of Alert Bay for the residential school accommodation of Indian boys for whom a boarding school education would be preferable to that of an Indian day school;\n\nand WHEREAS it is probable that considerably over 100 boys could be secured for enrolment if such facilities were available;\n\nand WHEREAS the Crosby Girls' Boarding School at Fort Simpson, having accommodation for an enrolment of 40 grant earning pupils in residence, while there is always a larger number seeking admission, and the building is poorly lit and insufficiently ventilated;\n\nand WHEREAS Indian boys are being sent over 500 miles to the south to attend boarding schools, often unwillingly, to the aversion of parents who would wish to see them in a school nearer home;\n\nand WHEREAS it is deemed to be in the best interests of Indian education in these parts to have a larger building or buildings for the accommodation of about 150 or 200 pupils of both sexes, either under one roof or separately as may be most desirable;\n\nand WHEREAS a desirable site for such a building can be located either within or outside the Fort Simpson Indian Reserve:\n\nBE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that this meeting of the Fort Simpson District representatives of the Methodist Church of Canada go on record as being favourable to the establishment of such an institution; and that copies of the resolution be sent to: The Women's Missionary Society, Toronto, The Supt of Indian Education (Mr. Perrier), The Deputy Superintendent Gen.of Indian Affairs, The Indian Agent and C.E.

There are a good many reasons why a school of this kind should be outside the reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 5, 1919.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a resolution passed at a recent meeting of the Port Simpson district representatives of the Methodist Church, regarding the establishment of a boarding school at Port Simpson.\n\nA copy of this resolution was recently forwarded direct to the Department by Rev. Mr. Nuttall, who was informed that there was no present prospect for the establishment of such a school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C.

Perry, Indian Agent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOn behalf of the people of Fert Simpson, we are petitioning for a school such as will educate the children of this and surrounding villages. (By this we mean boys & girls)\n\nWe believe that it met the policies of the Govt. and that it is met for the welfare of the community, that we still remain illiterate.\n\nWe may mention here, that the younger generation, at the present time, are more or less illiterate and that more progress was made by the older generation, (whose ages range from 35 to 40 yrs.) and the younger generation have not attained the same standards as the older.\n\nThis through no fault of their own, the main fault being, \"There are no boarding schools in this vicinity, at which they can attend. The nearest school, being at Sardis, which has many drawbacks, to discourage pupils from here. One of the chief drawbacks being, \"To acclimatize the students from the north to a different locality. Many have returned only to become invalids, so that it seems useless to try and educate a student, in surroundings in which it is difficult for them to maintain their proper health.\n\nWith suitable Industrial School, one that teach, students, occupations that are suitable for his or her surroundings or locality; will be, for bettering of the country and will turn out a citizen that will be able to meet the requirements of this competitive age.\n\nThat Fert Simpson, being the central Village in Northern B.C., and serves as head-quarters for the surrounding Tribes would be the best place to build such a school.\n\nThe people of Fert Simpson remember that when this subject of a school, was placed before them, they rejected the idea at that time, without considering the injury they were inflicting on the community, and further, the people that rejected the proposal could hardly be called representatives of the people as the majority of the people were away, at their spring fishing.\n\nThey regret that these proposals were turned down at that time and in asking that the school be reconsidered, they will not place any difficulty in the matter of selecting a site.\n\nWe further believe, that if a good Industrial School be built here, it will in the near future help to create industry which will be a benefit to the country and the natives.\n\nAnother reason, a day school is unsuccessful, is (this reason may safely cover all villages of the north) The occupation of the parents of all or the largest majority of the natives, is such that they must leave their homes with their families at from eight to ten months every year, making it impossible for the children to attend school.\nThere is only one solution, that is, to build a suitable Industrial School such as will keep the students at school the whole year round. Thus leaving the parents without excuse to educate their children.\n\nThanking you for this opportunity of placing before your official notice and hoping that you will place this before the proper authorities at Ottawa.\n\nWe are humbly\n\nyour petitioners,\n\n.................. .................. ..................\nHudoword\nR.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed find a petition from the people of Port Simpson, signed on their behalf by about one hundred of their leading men. This petition as you will see requests the Government to build them a large industrial school for the education of both boys and girls. As the co-education of their children was involved in this petition, which was presented to me last February, I thought it only courtesy on my part to present it to the Women's Missionary Society of our Church, they owning and operating a girls' school at Port Simpson. The Board of the Women's Missionary Society met the last week of September, and they unanimously reached the conclusion that they would heartily cooperate with the general board in the management of a school for the education of boys and girls and would render any assistance possible to the Government in the\nerection of the same.\n\nI presented this petition to the General Board of Missions which met last week in Toronto. The Board acceded to the principle of co-education and also to the wisdom of selecting Port Simpson as a place suitable for the erection of a large industrial school.\n\nWhen I received this petition from the people they appointed a deputation to show me the land that they would be willing to give; it is about a mile and a half down the coast from the village. They offer all the land we require from one hundred up to four hundred acres if necessary. I also required that they would build a dock, dig out the foundations of the main building, put in a dam for water supply which would be about half a mile up the mountain-side, dig a ditch and put in the pipe. I may say that these terms they did not agree to. I have written Mr. Lawson who was Secretary of the meeting telling him what I have done with the petition, and also rehearsing the conditions that I would like them to comply with. I have pointed out to him that not only is the Women's Missionary Society and the General Board of our Church sympathetic to the movement, but the Deputy Superintendent General is also. At the same time I have assured him that\nit is a question of time as to when we will be able to get the money, since the Government has a large number of schemes that call for large expenditures.\n\nI would take it as a favour if you would write a letter to the Secretary of the meeting that presented me with the petition, setting forth the Government's viewpoint.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. F. Ferrier\nOttawa, November 11th, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Methodist schools, has placed before the Department the petition of the people of Fort Simpson, in which they ask for the establishment of an industrial school at that point, that would provide for the education of the children in that and neighbouring districts. In reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed to consider the project favourably, but I regret that it is not possible to give you assurance that the work will be undertaken in the near future.\n\nThe funds at the disposal of the Department for this purpose are very limited and it is necessary not only to economise but to extend our boarding and industrial school system very gradually, bearing in mind those districts in which such provision is most urgently needed. The Department is aware of the conditions at Fort Simpson and will keep the needs of the educational work there constantly in view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Nathan Lawson,\nFort Simpson,\nB.C.\nExtract from report of Agent Charles C. Perry on the Port Simpson Girls' Home for the month of January, 1921. Original on 119500/4.\n\nI would recommend that the Department give immediate consideration to the establishment of a suitable boarding school for the co-education of Indian boys and girls somewhere on the northern coast of British Columbia, preferably at or near Port Simpson.\nSir:\n\nI am glad to be able to report the opening of the new Indian Girls' Home by the Methodist Church at Fort Simpson on the 29th of the month. A number of pupils have already been admitted and as the accommodation is limited, all available room will soon be taken up. The need of a large boarding school for Indian boys is becoming most obvious, as the boarding schools in the south are unable to receive more pupils from the northern agencies, being already filled to capacity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nWhereas we are informed that the new Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, opened last October at Sardis, B.C., is now filled to capacity, with an attendance roll and waiting list including many children from the north-west coast of British Columbia;\n\nAnd whereas, at the present time, the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada, in conjunction with the Department of Indian Affairs, are continuing their long-established and most effective efforts among the Indian girls at Port Simpson, - no provision, however, being made by any organization, of boarding-school facilities for the boys of that district;\nthat district.\n\nAnd whereas the undersigned missionary workers and friends interested in the welfare of the native people do declare that the moral and social conditions especially among the boys and young men of the Northern tribes give rise to great anxiety for the present, and great apprehension for the future, - many such young people giving evidence of certain developments which will not only bring about race degradation and extinction, but which, if unchecked, will produce a moral and social menace to the adjoining Canadian white population;\n\nAnd whereas it is our strong conviction that such undesirable conditions can only be met by granting to our Native people such Educational facilities as accrue from a local Boarding School;\n\nAnd whereas it is generally conceded that few native tribes, if any, in the whole of the Dominion of Canada, manifest a higher standard of social and intellectual progress, than do those British Columbia tribes included in the Nass and Queen Charlotte Agencies, - the children of the Tsimsean and Haida tribes especially, responding most readily to influences of Education and social uplift;\nsocial uplift.\n\nAnd whereas in Port Simpson; Skeena River; Nass River and Queen Charlotte districts, there is at present a concentrated field containing several hundred children eligible for entrance into a Boarding School, but who are at present denied requisite Educational facilities owing to the nomadic habits of their parents, and owing to the great distance at which Boarding Schools presently available, are situated;\n\nAnd in view of that practical and most sympathetic attitude which has always been manifested by the Department of Indian Affairs in native educational problems such as this;\n\nWe, the undersigned missionary workers and friends interested in the Native people, do make earnest petition that the Department make provision for the immediate establishment of a Boarding School for Indian boys and girls at Port Simpson, British Columbia.\n\n[Signatures]\n\nWilliam Allan\nMissionary-in-Charge\n\nR.B.

I am writing to you for first hand information on a matter that means much to all our people here.\n\nI have been confidently assured, and have understood all along, that the Dominion Government intended, as soon as funds were again available (the $40,000.00 at one time voted for this purpose having been withdrawn), to build us a Residential School for Indian boys and girls.\n\nYou will of course know all about this. Our people are expecting it, and keep asking me about it insistently.\n\nI did not wonder that no action was taken last year, pending the settlement of the Indian Land Question. But I have been eagerly waiting for word this year that we might expect a beginning at the new school in the near future.\n\nA rumor now comes to us that a school is to be built, but on another Reserve, and under the auspices of another church, which only recently have had a new school built at Lytten.\n\nWill you kindly tell me, Dr. Scott, if there is any truth in this report, and what hope I may give to my people of a Residential School being built in Port Simpson in the near future?\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 836-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI understand that you expect to be out at the coast this summer.

Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nDec. 11,\n1928.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nRe: A New Indian Residential School in Northern British Columbia.\n\nPursuant to our conversation when I was in your office on Friday last I wish to draw your attention to the urgent need of a new School to accommodate from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five pupils to be situated at Port Simpson for the education of the Indian children under the care of The United Church of Canada.\n\nThis request has been before you for some years. Our teachers and missionaries in that part of the Province are pressing very urgently for this building and their request is supported by a resolution from the Prince Rupert Presbytery and also by the Home Missions Committee of the British Columbia Conference, both of which were before our Home Mission Board at its recent session on the 28th of November. As you kindly gave me to understand that this could not be included in the Estimates that are coming before the next session of Parliament, I trust that it will receive your favourable consideration and provision be made for the construction of this building, if possible, in the Estimates that will come before Parliament in 1930.\n\nIn the meantime we will look over the ground for a suitable site and also report on the type of building, also the size of building, that will be required.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF:AMA.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nFeb. 14th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to forward my report as follows: for the months of December and January, also account of travelling expenses for the same period.\n\nThe need of a boarding school for this Agency is becoming increasingly urgent, and I hope this matter is receiving the earnest consideration of the Department. The present boarding schools at Coqualeetza and Alert Bay are overflowing whilst no provision is made for this large agency. At present great expense is incurred by the Indian parents in paying transit of their children to and from these schools. It would be a source of great satisfaction to the Indians in this agency if there were a residential school for boys and girls near at hand and I am quite sure there would be no difficulty in filling it.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nApril 12th, 1929.\n\nSir:\nI have the honor to forward herewith my daily journals for the months of February and March and to report as follows:\n\nThe day schools throughout the Agency have been satisfactorily carried on, but the attendance began to fall off as the people left the villages for their hunting and fishing camps.\n\nThe Indians of the agency are keenly alive to the need of education for their children and regret the necessity of having to take them away from the schools when they leave the villages in search of employment and other means of livelihood. I have in previous reports stressed the need of a residential school for this Agency to remedy the present condition of affairs, and would also respectfully urge that a proper inspection of the day schools by an Inspector qualified for the work be made regularly. This would not only bring all the day schools in the Agency under a uniform system of teaching but would also be an encouragement and help to the teachers in isolated villages. Possibly an arrangement might be made with the Provincial Department of Education in this regard.\n\nW. E. Collison.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report dated the 12th instant for the months of February and March relative to the day schools in the Skeena Agency, I have to say that the matter of the need of a residential school is receiving attention. There are, however, no funds available this year for the purpose.\n\nRelative to the inspection of the day schools by a provincial school inspector, I have to say that the Department has been in communication with the Provincial Department of Education with reference to utilizing the services of its inspectors. Arrangements for this service have not yet been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nThe following recommendations were sent forward to our Board from a meeting of representatives of The Anglican Church and The United Church of Canada, held in Vancouver on September 30th, in reference to the matter of Indian Residential Schools for the area north of Queen Charlotte Sound:\n\n(1) THAT both Indian Residential Schools - one for The United Church and one for the Anglican Church - should be located on the mainland.\n\n(2) THAT each Church should recruit pupils only from its own constituency.\n\n(3) THAT, subject to the above, each Church should be free to agree with the Department upon the location and capacity of the school for its own constituency.\n\nThese recommendations represent the unanimous findings of the Commission, and go forward to you with the approval of the Executive of our Board.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 17, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the recommendation of representatives of the Anglican and United Churches, concerning Indian residential schools for the area north of Queen Charlotte Sound.

Wilson, D.D.,\nAll Dominion Bank Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Dr. Wilson:\n\nRE PROPOSED NEW INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN THE NORTH.\n\nI had hoped to have written to you before this on the above matter, but have had an unusually busy trip South to Smiths and Rivers Inlets for the last two weeks and found no time for writing en route as I sometimes do.\n\nI talked the matter of a site for the above school with Dr. Darby and Mr. Gibson, and should have done so with Mr. Deans, but forgot it yesterday when in to see him. I shall take it up with him later. Dr. Darby was strongly in favor of a site at Old Town, near Bella Bella. Mr. Gibson was not so strongly favorable at first, but came round to that view later, I think. I was not at first much impressed with the suggestion, but every day since it has appealed to me more strongly. Of course, there is the undoubted fact that the Presbytery, through the recommendation of the Fort Simpson delegates, endorsed the request that the new school be located at that place. Then there was a request that the school go to Hazelton, but I do not think there was any great unanimity of heart on the question, seeing there was really no other proposition forthcoming. I shall try to set forth the pros and cons of the thing as I see them, and think I shall be ready to support my view at Presbytery when it meets.\n\n(1) Fort Simpson: Possesses undoubted power as an historic centre; Has also a large native population in itself and nearby. Is close to the Queen Charlotte Island peoples, and has a good Hospital nearby, etc. But, on the other hand, as I understand it, there is no good farming land nearby, which is a fundamental requisite for such a school. Again, it has only a weekly boat service, and is off the main lines of boat travel. It is also at one end of the territory to be served, and close to territory served by the Anglican Church. Some mention is being made of the fact that the Tsimshians are old time enemies of the Haidas of the Q.C.Ids., and Port Simpson would therefore not be looked upon as a favorable site by the latter people. I do not know whether there is much in this argument or not. I don't think such a spirit should be countenanced although it may have some practical bearing on the problem for the meantime.\n\n(2) Hazelton: Has a fine site with all kinds of good land available for cultivation. It is the centre of a fair number of our United Church Indians, for example at Kishpiox and at Kitzegucla (Skema Crossing). On the other hand there is a large centre of Anglican Indians right at Hazelton itself. We have a fine Hospital there, and the Anglicans have only a church and resident pastor, which we have also, of course. But, Hazelton would not appeal to the Indians of the Coast, I fear. It would mean a boat journey and then a train journey as well with a stopover in Prince Rupert. It would however, have the advantage of being too close to any site, or proposed site for an Anglican School as would Port Simpson, I feel, for seeing the Anglicans have a school now at Alert Bay, if they purpose a further school, it could only naturally be in the North.\n\n(3) Bella Coola: Has all the advantages of being near a good sized village of native people. There is a good Hospital, partly in connection with our Church and there is good land available, although it would have to be cleared at a probable cost of at least $500.00 per acre.\n\nAgainst this are the facts of a weekly boat service, and the situation being to one side, although central from the point of view of north and south. I do not think it would make any strong appeal to our native people, or to the Church at large.\nBella Bella: I have come to the conclusion that this is the logical centre for a new school for the following reasons:\n\n1 - It is central, both for the East and West and North and South.\n\n2 - It has the best boat service of any place on the Coast, all S.S.Co's have it on their list of ports of call. It has from three to four boats a week each way, during the summer months, and at least two and usually three boats each way in the winter.\n\n3 - It has all the drawing power of historic associations that Port Simpson can have, and is without any of the old lingering tribal objections so far as I know.\n\n4 - The site is far enough away from the present village to ensure privacy and the best environment for the pupils, and I understand the land is good for agricultural purposes, and is practically cleared and ready for occupation.\n\n5 - In view of the fact that there is some likelihood of the Anglican Church asking for another school on the Coast, Bella Bella would be the logical place for our own Church. It has long been the stronghold of United Church work, made sacred through the work of men like Dr. Large and now our own Dr. George Darby. It is far enough away from Alert Bay to cause no lessening of the functions of that school, and it is central to our own work, especially, to those parts that have been neglected so long, namely, Smith's and Rivers Inlets where the Indians constitute a problem for our Church at the present moment. I feel that Bella Bella would appeal very strongly to the Indians of these two localities. Kitammat, Hartley Bay and Bella Coola are not far removed, and in the summer these peoples are always in the Bella Bella area during the cannery season. It is much more nearly in the centre of our Native work than any other point proposed as a site for a school. As I have said before, if there is likelihood of the Anglican Church asking for another school it could only go in the North, either at the Nass, Metlakahtla, or Port Simpson, and while there may be room for two schools there, yet it seems to me the United Church School at Bella Bella and the Anglican one in the North would be the more reasonable arrangement.\n\n6 - Steamships of the C.N.S.S.C., from the Queen Charlotte Isds. pass right by Bella Bella giving a direct connection with the villages on the Islands.\n\nI think this is about the best I can do on the problem and trust that in the musings of a multitude of counsellors there may arise wisdom for the guidance of our Church in this important matter.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(SGD.) R. C. Scott.\nDear Doctor Wilson;-\n\nYour communication as regards the new Residential School received by last mail and at the earliest opportunity it was brought before a large gathering of our people. Indian Agent Fougner in the Chair. The gathering was pleased to know that our Church recommended that a new Residential School be erected for the benefit of our Northern Indians.\n\nOur people unanimously urge that the proposed new school be erected at Bella Coola where there is an area of over 3000 acres of arable land, and support this contention with the following reasons:\n\n(1) We ourselves have at present over 100 children in the village; 65 of these being of school age.\n\n(2) Our day school is full up; besides those of our children at Alert Bay and at Sardis.\n\n(3) The parents find that our school at Sardis is too far away; and the fares too expensive; while the one at Alert Bay is not under the charge of our Church.\n\n(4) Bella Coola is in a central position from Rivers Inlet people, Bella Bella, Klemtu, Kitlope and Kitaamat, and also the stick Indians back of us who have no school facilities wish their children sent here.\n\n(5) Bella Coola is quite a centre for United Church work. We have two Churches, a fully equipped hospital and day school manned by our Church.\n\n(6) We have a regular weekly mail service; beside other connection, with local points.\n\n(7) Bella Coola can offer what no other Indian Reserve can tender - 50 acres of agricultural land, and more if necessary on which to erect our new Residential School.\n\nI cannot recall the Presbytery where a resolution was passed asking that a school be erected at Port Simpson, though at a meeting of the Workers amongst the Indians held some years ago, before Union, did recommend a school at Port Simpson, but since that time conditions have changed entirely. A school at Port Simpson will not help us at all - 275 miles away in a severe climate.\n\nAs soon as the site is decided on in Bella Coola, our people will at once begin to clear the land. A portion of the land is covered with a good growth of wood, making excellent fire-wood.\n\nI trust the Church may see its way clear to erect the school in our midst where it is greatly needed.\n\nI am, sincerely,\n\n(SGD.) T. EDW. RENDLE.\nMissionary to the Bella Coolas.\nKITIMAAT MISSION, B.C.,\nDecember 10th, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Wilson:\n\nYour letter of November 4th came to hand November 28th regular mail. In reply to your queries - you will remember in my former reply re centre for proposed Central School or Schools for Indian children I said I was not so well acquainted with the geography of the district as to be able to name a location not only central but socially furnished for the highest upbringing and welfare for the present and future of our Indian people and children.\n\nNow, if there was a Vancouver or Victoria north of Queen Charlotte Islands, I would advocate placing the school there. We have not such cities; I would then place the school at Prince Rupert.\n\nMy brief experience with the Indians is - bring them out in contact with our white population, and the best of them, if you are ever to benefit them and lift them out of the deadening past. They meet now with white men, as they go out to work in canneries or engage in fishing, to their great detriment. White men, I have heard myself, that would poison the good in Saints. And the Indians think this is the White Man and his Christianity. My policy is, then, - bring the Indian (or any other backward people) into the open, into open welcome contact with the very best, purest and noblest in the Human Sphere. Otherwise \"we are hiding our Light under a bushel.\"\n\n\"If you were God and God were you\nSay, what would you do?\"\n\nIf you were the Indian and the Indian were you,\nSay - What would you do or like done?\n\nShow our Indians (children) you are men and must see and learn and do the man's part.\n\nIf this thought helps the location - Amen!\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(SGD.) ALEX MOGEE,\nKitimaat Mission, B.C.\n\nRev. Dr. G.A. Wilson,\n411 Dominion Bank Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nTo the Rev. Dr. Cochrane;\u2014\n\nWe, the native residents of Port Simpson, B.C., represented by our Chiefs and Councillors, lay before you our humble request that you and the United Church of Canada will use your influence on behalf of the Tsimshian people in establishing a residential school at Port Simpson.\n\nIn requesting this we will endeavour to show you some of the difficulties that we are laboring under at the present time, making it impossible to give even an elementary education to our children, owing to the fact we must at different seasons of the year leave our homes and taking with us our children to our various fields of our activities at which points there are no way of educating them.\n\nIn asking that you use your influence for us with the proper authorities to establish a residential school in our village, we would point out to you the central location of Port Simpson, which is the central point of a group of Tsimshian, Nisga'a, Gitksan, and Haida villages serving over a large population, over three thousand people and in the village of Port Simpson alone there is over a hundred children of school age who cannot get a proper education owing to the present mode of living of the natives here, this would be overcome with the establishing of a residential school here at Port Simpson. All of these villages are located within a radius of twenty four hours from Port Simpson at the farthest points, making communication between parent and school easier and not costly.\n\nAt present some of our children are being taken care of at Sardis, but the distance from home which in some cases is over six hundred miles, making it almost impossible and costly to the parents in sending their children to and fro and very often the children are not able to acclimatize themselves to the new surroundings, which tends to discourage us in sending them such a distance from home, thus placing a hardship on the children over which we at present have no control, owing to our present mode of making our living.\n\nWe also wish to point out to you that educating the children right in their own district amidst his own environment and in suitable industries for their own future welfare in the district they will be a credit to themselves and the people they represent.\n\nWe wish also to mention that in the past when matters of school came in our midst there was always some little dissensions in the matter of lands and locations. We can assure you at this time the people are all one in their request and will co-operate with you and the authorities in supporting any reasonable request for lands and location.\n\nWe wish also to point out to you our location is right on the paths of the regular steamers and also the splendid Church and Hospital right here in our midst.\n\nWe earnestly ask that you give our humble requests your very careful consideration and we trust we will have your support in them.\n\nSigned on behalf of the native residents of Port Simpson, B.C., October 22nd, 1929.\n\nW.E.S.

Alert Bay is very close to us. In fact, when we are talking Church Union, why separate Indian Children.\n\nAs to location, if it is to serve Prince Rupert Presbytery only, there are two or three places.\n\n1st - Bella Coola, very good land, mild climate, rather heavy timber on the promised site. The trouble with Bella Coola, it is at one end of the district, and is not over well served with steamboat service.\n\n2nd - Port Simpson is maybe central, but what about the land?\n\n3rd - The Forks of the Skeena, or Hazelton, was in the old days thought to be the very best site of all.\n\nIt would pay to look over the above places before deciding. At Bella Bella old town there is a very good place indeed, right on the steamboat route, good soil, fair supply of water. I think this could be bought at a very fair price from the B.C. Packers, who own it.\n\nI think the whole question should be left till Conference.\n\nKind regards,\n\n(Sgd.) W. Hewson Gibson.\nPORT SIMPSON, B.C.,\nNov. 25th, 1929.\n\nRev. G. A. Wilson, D.D.,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Dr. Wilson:\n\nYour letter of the 4th inst. received, and contents carefully noted.\n\nAfter consultation with Dr. Large and others of our staff and white group here I beg to submit the following reply, in which there is general concurrence.\n\nI.\n\nWe believe the school ought to be placed on the coast, and not inland. The Residential Schools that are placed inland naturally give considerable time and attention to farming, which is useful to natives of the interior, but is almost wholly wasted on our northern coast Indians. This is a serious consideration with us, and ought to carry weight in any deliberations of the board as to the location of the school. This northern coast region, which contains so large an Indian population, is in no sense a farming country. And the young Indians of these tribes ought to receive their education and training along lines that they can utilize after their school days are ended.\n\nOur people require an academic education that will create in them an intelligent interest in literature and art and science and history and citizenship and public affairs and the general cultural aspects of civilization.\n\nThe young men require an elementary business education that will enable them to compete on a somewhat equal footing with white men.\n\nAnd on the Industrial side they would profit by carpentering, boat-building, gas oil and electrical engineering, and general machine shop practice.\n\nAnother industry that we believe might wisely be undertaken, in at least an experimental way, and might in time grow into a major source of income for our people, is fur farming. The trapping industry, at one time so lucrative on the northern coast, is decreasing year by year. Where a trapper brought in 100 skins 20 years ago, he now brings in ten. But fur farming, under proper direction, ought to be rewarding; and it might in time be a source of income for our Indians comparable to reindeer raising in Alaska; which has made the natives there so eminently prosperous. This latter is only a suggestion, but certainly worth looking into.\n\nII.\n\nNow as to the location of a Residential School on the northern coast, - we believe that Fort Simpson is the logical place; and for the following reasons:\n(1) The central and accessible location of Port Simpson. We are situated between the two northern rivers, the Skeena and the Naas, with their Indian villages. And we are within 3\u00bd hours' run by gas boat of Prince Rupert.\n\n(2) Port Simpson is much the largest Indian village on the coast. There are about 600 Indians resident in Port Simpson. There are also about 20 families belonging to this village living in Prince Rupert.\n\n(3) Our fine new Government Dock, built during the past two years, affords convenient accommodation for the landing of boats at all times of the year, and for the handling of freight.\n\n(4) There is plenty of land available at Port Simpson for school purposes, either (a) by extending the mission holdings on the Indian Reserve, or (b) by purchase from the Hudson's Bay Co. The Hudson's Bay property of almost 107 acres immediately adjoins the Mission property and the Indian Reserve. A considerable area is levelled and sown to grass. And it has a wide harbour frontage. The whole property could, I understand, be purchased quite reasonably at the present time; and there are certain store buildings, now in use, that could be purchased and used for shop purposes if desired.\n\n(5) There is already at Port Simpson a fine commodious Church; which has been newly painted this year. And there is a hospital of 35 beds, with Dr. and nursing staff. Also the Crosby Girls' Home, a substantial modern building, built by the Women's Missionary Society a few years ago as a temporary measure until the Residential School, which was at that time promised, would be built. This latter building could be used as a teacher's residence, or such other purpose as desired, in connection with the School.\n\n(6) The native people of Port Simpson have for many years looked forward to the establishment of a Residential School at their village; and are themselves eagerly asking for it.\n\nWe believe, therefore, that the Mission Board will be acting in the best interests of the United Church Indian constituency on the northern coast by deciding to build the new Residential School at Port Simpson.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD.)

The United Church Missionary Society, which is active among these Indians, has requested the establishment of an educational institution for our wards at Hazelton, Port Simpson, Bella Bella and Bella Coola. There has been much correspondence and several resolutions concerning the best location. It appears that the United Church representatives are now unanimous in the selection of Port Simpson.\n\nYou know that residential schools for each group are out of the question, and, in a matter of this kind, considerable weight is given to the wishes of the interested church. At the present time, I do not know when it will be possible to establish a residential school for these Indians, but I can safely say that Bella Coola will not be favoured when a site is being chosen.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is a nice building, well kept and in good order. I also inspected the new school at Skidegate. 48 children attend there. This school, too, is in splendid order, and clean. Quite a number of children from this agency go either to the Alert Bay Residential school or to Coqueleetza, which is quite a distance for them, and costs the parents quite a large sum in fares.\n\nIf a school for Protestants is erected finally at or near Prince Rupert as referred to by me before, this will be a great convenience to the Indians of Queen Charlotte, who could almost fill a residential school themselves, as you can see.\n\nGeo.

That in view of the fact that the Indians have to compete against the white man, in their efforts for a livelihood and in order to meet this competition, one of our great needs is a suitable Industrial school to train and equip our young to meet this ever increasing competition. We would ask and recommend that such Industrial School be situated here in Port Simpson, which is the centre of an Indian population of over two thousand Indians and would thus better serve the Northern Indians in their own requirements and in their own environment. Past experience has shown us that our native children cannot acclimatize or adjust themselves to conditions in the southern part of this province.\n\nx x x\n\nThat previous to arriving to a definite decision on this our humble petition and as there are many other matters, such as can only be dealt with in direct conferences, with the Honorable the Minister of Interior, we humbly ask that we be granted the privilege of having a direct conference here, at your convenience.\n\nWm.

In consideration of the establishment of an Industrial or Residential School at Port Simpson, which is a station of the United Church of Canada, it would have to be borne in mind that such a school, if established, would probably result in the withdrawal of approximately 58% of the pupils of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School at Sardis, B.C. who hail from northern British Columbia as indicated in the attached list taken from the Quarterly Return of Coqualeetza School for the quarter ended December 30th, 1931. It will be further known to the Department that a Girls' School as well as Day school exists at Port Simpson.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOn the same date (21st of June), I also visited Coqualeetza Residential school, but the principal, Mr. Raley, was away, and about 40 of the children had already left for their homes. As most of the other children were busy getting ready to go away, I did not hear or see any of the children at work. I understand, however, that 40 odd children will have to remain under Mr. Raley's care throughout the holidays, as their parents have not the money to pay for their fares back over the long distance to Queen Charlotte Islands. This is another point that bears out my contention that this school, of Protestant denomination, should really be up north, somewhere in the vicinity of Prince Rupert, as suggested. Owing to the outward movement of the children, naturally the school was in a somewhat untidy condition, but under the circumstances this was to be expected. However, the essentials were in order, including fire fighting apparatus, fire escapes, etc., and the kitchens and lavatories clean.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith report dated July 24th received from Inspector Pragnell, and numbered 6, of his inspection of the New Westminster Agency. As certain matters mentioned in this report involve consideration of the policies of the Department in respect to school matters as well as the distribution of lands in the reserves, and as these questions have been discussed to some length with Dr. McGill during his recent visit it is not considered necessary at the present moment to make any further comment on these subjects, except possibly to point out that the Indian Act provides that the Department may meet the expenses of pupils to and from the school during the vacation period, and that the question of the management of Indian lands will be understood by the Department to be fully covered by Section 4 of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharles C.

For, always also such an environment is, generally speaking, morally unhealthy.\n\nAnd Whereas our views on this question were laid before the Royal Commission on its visit to the Naas in 1915, when the various native communities on the river united in presenting a petition for the establishment of an Industrial Boarding School for the Naas district, which petition the Commission promised to lay before, and recommend to, the Government:\n\nYet, notwithstanding the assurances thus given, we regret to hear now that it is proposed to erect the school we asked for at Port Simpson (entirely outside our Agency) instead of on the Naas River.\n\nWe think it ought to be clearly understood by the Authorities concerned in this decision that the Nishka people would prefer a school situated within a short distance than one situated at Port Simpson. And for this reason, the Tsimshians and Nishkas, while of certain racial affinity, are divided by the use of two different forms of speech. It is therefore intolerable to us to find our young people return from school with an outside dialect upon their tongue. We desire to send them to school to learn English, and to receive something of a literary training, and not to become further steeped in the idiosphere of Indian\u53e3\u8bed.\n\nWe feel compelled therefore to state that, in our opinion, and from our point of view, the establishment of an Industrial Boarding School at Port Simpson will in no way benefit the Nishka people. It would be outside of our country; it would be outside of our Agency; it would be outside of our...\ndesires, our church and other interests, as we see them.\n\nAnd whereas duly qualified medical supervision is to be considered as an essential factor in the establishment and carrying on of such an institution as this petition has in view, not only with regard to the health of the children individually, but in the matter of hygiene and sanitation generally, and especially as to the steps to be immediately taken in cases of emergency for the prevention of infection and the spread of disease:\n\nWe beg to draw attention to the fact that, already, the Indian Department has substituted a school at Mass River as one of the means so that at least this most essential prerequisite for the establishment of such a school is already on hand.\n\nAnd whereas the entire native population of the Nass being now separately constituted on distinct Indian Agency; and being religiously members of one distinctive church, viz., the ANGLICAN; and being of one language and one racial mentality; and being also sufficient in population to assure a full complement of scholars for such institution from term to term,\u2014\n\nWe consider that the best interests of our people, and the benevolent desires of the Government on the subject should be harmonized by providing for the establishment of one central industrial institution for Indian boys and girls on Nass River (at a point to be determined upon having that near Simpson or any other point on the coast or interior of B.C.)\n\nTHEREFORE, and because of the reasons herein severally set forth, we the undersigned NISHKA INDIANS of Nass River, British Columbia, do hereby present our humble petition to the Government of Canada to grant us an INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL for the more complete up-lift and educational advancement of our people; and that this School be centrally situated on some suitable place on the NAAS RIVER.\n\nAnd your Petitioners shall ever pray:\nA.

We therefore urge the part of our people to have an Industrial Boarding School on the Nass for the benefit of our children, both now and in the days to come.\n\nAnd whereas, hitherto, as far as we were conscious of the need of higher education for our children, we sought to obtain it by sending them to institutions remotely situated in various parts of the Province, with results, however, far from satisfactory to us:\n\nFor, firstly, the mortality among those so sent has been abnormally high; and secondly, the difficulty of getting both boys and girls back to school after a few months' completion of courses has been found almost insuperable, owing to the aversion of the scholars to return to conditions in various ways distasteful to them, said conditions being inevitable in institutions where racial antipathies, or sized forms of speech not infrequently usher relations among the children, and where the dominance of the teacher, which may not be altogether undesirable among the children, tends to the fostering of indifference rather than reverence; while thirdly, as matter of fact, some of these institutions are located at the sites of, or almost adjoining, non-Indian settlement or village which is the case of girls especially while perhaps carrying with it advantages for those native to that particular place, is pitiful of dangers for those coming from elsewhere. For the boys also such an environment is, generally speaking, scarcely unhealthy.\n\nAnd whereas our views on this question were laid before the Royal Commission on its visit to the Nass in 1913, when the various native communities on the river united in presenting a petition for the establishment of an Industrial Boarding School for the Nass district, which petition the Commission promised to lay before, and recommend to, the Government:\n\nYet, notwithstanding the assurances thus given, we regret to hear now that it is proposed to erect the school we asked for at Fort Simpson (entirely outside our Agency) instead of on the Nass.\n\nWe think it ought to be clearly understood by the Authorities concerned in this decision that the Nishka people would preferably send their children to an institution school than to one situated at Fort Simpson. And for this reason,\u2014the Zinshans and Wishkas, while of course of racial affinity, are divided by the use of two different forms of speech. It is therefore intolerable to us to find our young people return from school with an outside dialect upon their tongue. We therefore plead with you to locate the school on the Nass and to receive some civilized domestic training, and not to become further steeped in the atmosphere of Indian mentality.\n\nWe feel compelled therefore to state that, in our opinion,\nAnd whereas duly qualified medical supervision is to be considered as an essential factor in the establishment and carrying on of such an institution as this petition has in view, not only with regard to the health of the children individually, but in the matter of hygiene and sanitation generally, and especially as to the steps to be immediately taken in cases of emergency for the prevention of infection and the spread of disease:\n\nWe had to draw attention to the fact that, already, the Indian Department subsidizes a medical man at the south of the Nass; so that at least this most essential prerequisite for the establishment of such a school is already in hand.\n\nAnd whereas the entire population of the Naas being now separately constituted one distinct Indian Agency; and being religiously members of one distinctive church, viz., the ANGLICAN; and being of one language and one racial mentality; and being also sufficient in population to assure a full complement of scholars for such institution from term to term,\u2014\n\nWe consider that the best interests of our people, and the benevolent desires of the Government of our nation, would be most effectively served by the establishment of one centrally located institution for native boys and girls on Nass River (at a point to be determined upon hereafter) than at Port Simpson or any other point on the coast or interior of B.C.\n\nTHEREFORE, and because of the reasons herein severally set forth, we the undersigned NISHKA INDIANS of Naas River, British Columbia, do hereby present our humble petition to the Government of Canada to grant us an Industrial School for the more complete up-lift and educational advancement of our people; and that this School be centrally situated on some suitable place on the NAAS RIVER.\n\nAnd your Petitioners shall ever pray:\nA.J.

Though sufficient for domestic purposes, there would not be enough pressure to fight any sort of fire.\n\n\"Fire-Fighting:- There are four large 'Soda Type' extinguishers. These are tested from time to time. There are about six small hand extinguishers. With reference to my report of last year under this heading, I am glad to be able to report that regular fire drills have been held this last year.\n\nWhen Colonel Pragnell was with me during the inspection of this school last year, we came to the conclusion that a fire escape was necessary for the use of the children in the new dormitory. I beg to recommend again that such a fire escape be erected on the end of the new addition. I have gone into this matter again during the present inspection and am satisfied that this is the best place for such an escape. It will be the least expensive place to erect such an escape, which should be constructed from the dormitory window right to the ground where the hill rises behind this dormitory; a fairly short escape is all that will be required. I would suggest that the Department take this matter up with the United Church authorities, as was done in the case of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School.\n\nThe only possible thing to do in a school of this type in case of fire would be to get the children out as soon as possible. Any serious fighting of fire is out of the question owing to lack of any pressure in the pipe lines.\n\n\"Lighting:- The present Electric Lighting plant, a 650 Watt 32 Volt Delco, is ten years old. It is far too small for the school. New batteries are required but as I recommended last year this machine should be sold to the Indians for what it might fetch, and a proper sized plant substituted. This recommendation was contained in a special letter to the Department last year; but I understand that my suggestion has not been accepted. I would now suggest that the contents of this report as far as it is of vital importance to the United Church Board of Home Missions be communicated to them, with a view of having the more urgent work at this school attended to in the near future.\"\n\nI should appreciate if you would bring our Inspector's report to the attention of the officers of the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The one already in place serves for the older part of the building. This improvement would be for the better protection of the children and would cost approximately $100.00.\n\nW. E.

E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of November 21st, last, and your reply of November 24th, with reference to the report of our Inspector regarding the necessity for the erection of a fire escape at the Port Simpson Indian Residential School.\n\nIn his report for the month of January, 1934, Mr. Agent Collison writes as follows:\n\n\"In connection with the girls' school I would again draw the attention of the Department to the need of a new fire escape for the new wing of this building.

A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his inspection of the PORT SIMPSON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on May 21, 1937.\n\nOriginal on File 168-1-6.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nI would ask that the following be read in reference to and continuation of my report on Page 2 forwarded from Victoria on October 18, 1935.\n\nThe four large type Soda Fire Extinguishers have been refilled since my last inspection. There are also some half dozen Pyrene Extinguishers at this school.\n\nI am told that Fire Drills are held regularly now, but this is very difficult to believe. The Fire Drills held are obviously not of the type we understand as such. My reason for saying this is that I have now at last discovered why the Principal did not want a fire drill held on September 19, 1935, and why it has been impossible to hold these drills regularly as the Indian Affairs Branch has instructed. THERE ARE FINE WIRE MESH SCREENS NAILED OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS LEADING FROM THE DORMITORIES TO THE ESCAPES.\n\nThe Principal tells me that to hold a Drill down the escapes FROM THE DORMITORIES the screens have to be taken off by a skilled man or the window frames suffer.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nThe source of the water supply is muskeg. There is not quite sufficient water in a dry year, and there is of course no sufficient supply to fight even a small fire. The pressure in the pipes is very low.\n\nI would recommend that the extension of pipe line from the school to the Mission House put in a few years ago be disconnected and the school permitted to make use of all the available water. The Mission House can arrange for a separate supply. The school requires all the water it can get, from its own pipe line.\n\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Letter of May 23, 1937, addressed to Indian Commissioner MacKay, submitting above report.\n\nMiss Deacon asked me, in confidence, to try and have the pipe line disconnected below the school and so that the Mission House could not draw on their supply which is none too plentiful for them and they need it in the drier seasons. The Mission House can arrange for its own supply and in any case has nothing to do with the school. The present time is considered suitable as the Missionary is expected to leave soon for another sphere of work and it would be hard to cut this line when there was a Missionary in residence.\nOttawa, June 24, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Barry's report regarding the inspection of the Port Simpson Indian Residential School on May 21st, 1937. In connection with the water supply, our Inspector writes as follows:\n\n\"Water Supply:\n\n\"The source of the water supply is muskeg. There is not quite sufficient water in a dry year, and there is, of course, no sufficient supply to fight even a small fire. The pressure in the pipes is very low.\n\n\"I would recommend that the extension of pipeline from the school to the Mission House, put in a few years ago, be disconnected and the school permitted to make use of all the available water. The Mission House can arrange for a separate supply. The school requires all the water it can get, from its own pipeline.\"\n\nIn connection with the above, I understand that the Mission House could arrange for its own supply, and, if so, the school will obtain a much larger supply of water. I would appreciate it if you would bring this matter to the attention of the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nTORONTO 2, Ont.\nJuly 6th, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter containing a copy of Inspector Barry's report regarding the water supply at the Port Simpson Residential School has been received.\n\nI beg to advise you that the matter has been considered by our Executive and that provision has been made for tanks to take the place of the water system at the mission house, and consequently the suggestion of Capt. Barry has been met.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:HC\nOttawa, July 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Port Simpson Indian Residential School on May 21st, he suggested that arrangements be made for disconnecting the extension of the pipeline from the residential school to the mission house.\n\nThe Department wrote the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada and we are now advised that provision has been made for tanks to take the place of the water system at the mission house and, therefore, the extension of the pipeline to the school will be disconnected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

J. Lemire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., June 4th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report for the month of May as follows:\n\nCROSBY GIRLS' SCHOOL\n\nDuring my inspection of the school, particular attention was paid to the window exits leading to the fire escapes in each of the dormitories. Window screens have been made to open outward on hinges which can be easily manipulated by the pupils. Two senior girls sleep in each of the dormitories their duties being to take charge of the smaller children in the event of a fire. Fortunately as the school stands on sloping ground, the distance from the fire exit windows to the ground in one of the dormitories at the rear is only a matter of a few feet and the children can easily be lifted to the ground without the use of the fire escape, if necessary.\n\nI found the several departments of the school in excellent order. In the classroom, pupils under Miss Lincoln, teacher, have made good progress.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor several weeks past our electric light plant has been giving great trouble and I have been wondering if the Department of Indian Affairs would consider coming to our assistance in the purchase of a new engine.\n\nThe Delco engine and generator capacity 850 watt, 32 volt has been in operation since 1923 and the estimated cost for a general overhaul and repair would be about $100.00 with always the doubt if such an expenditure would be advisable.\n\nThere is also the danger of fire as the engine back fires badly and during the winter months especially and the heavy strain on the plant, which is small, its just a gamble whether we have light or not. Mr. Gosnell has managed to keep it going so far this fall, but he says he can't guarantee that it will last all winter, he is getting a few minor repairs in the meantime.\n\nAnything you can do in our behalf will be greatly appreciated here, and also by our W.M.S. Board in Toronto.\n\nVery many thanks,\n\nYours truly,\n\nBessie French\n\nPrincipal\n\n(copy)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith an application received through the office of the Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, from the Principal of the Crosby Girls' Home at Fort Simpson for assistance in having the school lighting plant repaired or replaced.\n\nOur records would indicate that in November, 1932, a request for a lighting plant and heating equipment was submitted to the Department on behalf of the Crosby Girls' School but the Department replied to the effect that inasmuch as the school was the property of the Church Authorities and was erected by them without reference to the Department, the provision of such equipment was a responsibility of the Church. See your letter of November 25th, 1932, your file 168-1-5, in this connection. It would appear that since the above ruling was made, the Department has modified its policy to some extent in such matters.\n\nIf the Department is prepared to extend assistance in this case, the Agent will be requested to investigate and advise as to whether the plant should be repaired or replaced. I should appreciate your instructions in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant an amount of $500.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Fort Simpson residential school.\n\nIt will, therefore, be in order for you to have the Agent investigate and advise in what manner he considers the amount provided should be expended. Due to present regulations it will not be possible to allow more than the amount stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 9th, I have now been informed by the Indian Agent that a new engine and batteries are necessary for the lighting plant for the Crosby Girls' Home, Port Simpson, Skeena River Agency, B.C.\n\nThe Agent recommends that the engine be purchased from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd., 798 Beatty St., Vancouver, B.C., at a cost of $216.50, f.o.b. Port Simpson, and that the batteries be purchased from the MacKinnon Sales & Service Ltd., 1308 Granville St., Vancouver, B.C., at a cost of $167.15, f.o.b. Port Simpson.\n\nMr. Gillett also requests five 1-qt.

The Port Simpson Indian Day School has only one teacher at present. Rev. Wilding is still substituting at the Crosby Girl's Home. There are a number of Indian Children attending white schools at Prince Rupert and Inverness.\n\nThe shingling of the Crosby Girl's Home was finally completed.

Gillett, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nOn September 27, 1943, you were forwarded, by air mail, an accountable cheque for $500.00 for labour in connection with repairs to the Port Simpson Indian Residential School. As yet you have not accounted for this advance and, as the end of the fiscal year is approaching, we would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th inst., relative to an accountable cheque for labour on the Crosby Girl's Home at Fort Simpson.\n\nWe experienced great difficulty in securing labour for this work but it has now been completed. Unfortunately, as soon as the work was finished, one or two of the labourers went trapping and we have not been able to contact them to make payment. I believe, however, that we may do so this week. I will forward the pay sheet as soon as completed.\n\nJ.

If this recommendation meets with the approval of the Department it would be appreciated if you would advise how the Department would like the matter handled, whether by the submission of a voucher or if the amount will be paid directly to the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nD.

I have visited this school at least once a month since it has opened in September and several special visits were necessary. The children have been disobedient and defiant. The teachers have not been working harmoniously together which has been the chief cause of disobedience on the part of the school children. Miss Rogers is classed as Secretary-Treasurer of the school, Miss Fulton more or less is in charge of the children outside of the classroom and Miss Gormley is the classroom teacher. Miss Rogers would not assume the position of matron or principal instead it was divided between herself and Miss Fulton, who is young and inexperienced. Miss Gormley is a missionary teacher who has served many years over in China.\n\nWe have done our best to try and keep the school functioning under the present setup as the Women's Missionary Society could not secure a better staff. Recently I asked Mrs. Campbell, Representative of the Women's Missionary Society for B.C., to visit the school. This she did and she has given us assurance that the whole staff will be changed in September.\n\nJG/pb\n\ncc. Major D. M. MacKay,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJuly 9, 1946.\n\nRe: The Crosbie Girls' Home\n\nAs you know, the hospital at Port Simpson has just about reached the limit of its usefulness. I went through the building very carefully on my recent visit there and it would not seem to me to be good business to put the necessary money into this old building to effect the repairs and renovation required.\n\nI carefully inspected the Crosbie Girls' School and if there should be any disposition on behalf of the Women's Missionary Society to discontinue the operation of this building as a school, I would be pleased to discuss its purchase. It would make an excellent hospital providing all the ward accommodation were necessary with adequate provision for staff quarters.\n\nThe Miller Bay Hospital will amply provide for all long term cases including tuberculosis from Port Simpson. I feel, however, that we should keep a resident doctor at this point and accommodation sufficient to care for maternity cases and emergencies. The doctor would be responsible for frequent visits to Naas and the supervision of nursing stations there.\n\nI would be pleased to receive an early reply as to whether or not there is any possibility of acquiring this school on behalf of the Indian Health Services.\n\nfor P.E.

He will be accompanied by an architect. Mr. Cuthill suggested that the services of these two men might be of value to us in coming to some decision regarding the conversion of the present old Hospital building or the Crosby Home into a suitable hospital unit for future needs there.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company intend to build a new store at Port Simpson, and they will have a construction gang in there later this winter. It is possible that we can make use of this construction gang to a limited degree in connection with any changes that may be necessary. In any case Mr. Cuthill indicated that they would cooperate in any way possible to assist us there.\n\nIf you have any further information regarding the possibility of taking over the Crosby Girls' Home at Port Simpson I would be pleased if you would let me know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDouglas Galbraith, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSeptember 25th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nThe Crosby Girls' Home at Fort Simpson was inspected on September 23rd. The fire alarm system is completely inadequate. There is only a small three-inch electric door bell, the batteries are dead and the wiring corroded and out of order. The present setup is installed by the kitchen door - the most obvious site of a fire.\n\nIt is recommended that two eight-inch gongs with batteries, wiring and all equipment be installed at once on the dormitory floor of this school with the switches placed at either end of the building. Authority is requested to incur this expenditure as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 2 only 8 inch gongs         |          | $9.00      | $18.00  |\n| 2 only batteries            |          | $3.00      | $6.00   |\n| 2 only switches             |          | $2.00      | $4.00   |\n| wiring                      |          |            | $8.00   |\n| labor                       |          |            | $20.00  |\n| **Total**                   |          |            | **$56.00** |\n\nIt is considered that the installation of this equipment is urgent.\n\nF.

MacDonald has agreed that one man could handle both the hospital and school on a joint salary basis.\n\nThere has been a lot of trouble with native boys at this school, apart from the fire risk, and it is recommended that a grant of $40.00 per month be made towards the salary of a watchman. The Medical Superintendent has engaged a very suitable man already and if approved, vouchers will be submitted monthly towards the salary at the aforementioned rate, for eight months per year.\n\nThe Crosby Home is frame, with hot air furnace, and oil burner in kitchen range. The building was put up in 1918, and is a potential fire hazard.\n\nF. EARL ANFIELD,\nIndian Agent.\n\ncc-Dr. MacDonald\ncc-Miss Lawson\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of November 1st in connection with the necessity for the employment of a night watchman at the Port Simpson Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted that the Port Simpson Hospital is employing a watchman and it has been agreed that one man could watch both the hospital and the school on a joint salary basis. This school is a church owned building but in view of the fire hazard and danger to the pupils and as the Department apparently has allowed similar grants at the Cariboo, Christie, Kootenay and St. Mary's Schools, reference Mr. Phelan's letter 155-0-5 of March 1st last, it is recommended that the Department contribute $40.00 a month for eight months each year.\n\nD.

However, we will include an amount in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 which will permit a grant being paid for the winter of the same year.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nElectricity\nFOR ANY JOB...ANYWHERE\n\nWITH an F.M Electric Generating Plant you take your electric power source anywhere you need it...for any job! If city power or rural highlines are too remote, or if other factors make installation of commercial service impractical or too expensive, then an F.M Electric Plant will provide the most economical, reliable means of securing electricity. Even where municipal power is readily available, F.M units are ideally suited as emergency, auxiliary or standby plants.\n\nThere is the simplest, 350-watt model for furnishing electricity for small cottages, trailers, or homes, to the 35,000-watt types for supplying current for large scale industrial or contracting operations using hundreds of lights, motors and electric tools and machinery.\n\nFrom the extensive F.M line, models can be selected to serve homes, farms, trailers, schools, camps, ranches, repair shops, ranch stores, service stations, etc., where they furnish reliably electric power for lighting, refrigeration, communication, battery charging, fire fighting, water pumping and other jobs. They are practical for countless applications such as railroad maintenance, construction or engineering, mining, aviation, medical, transportation.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nAttention: Mr. F. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nFile: 2-11-19C.\n\nWe have your request for information as to the availability of Fairbanks-Morse-Onan Electric Lighting Plants in both 1000 and 2000 watt sizes, and are pleased to be able to tell you that at the moment we can make immediate delivery of either of these plants.\n\nUnfortunately these plants are available only equipped for remote control stop and start and the factory are quoting some 3 - 4 months delivery upon Automatic Panels, which, of course, can be installed on any remote control plant very easily.\n\nThe price upon the Model 10LS Fairbanks-Morse-Onan Electric Lighting Plant with a capacity of 1000 watts, 115 volt, 60 cycle, single phase is $483.00 less 10% f.o.b. Vancouver, and the price of the Model W2S Fairbanks-Morse-Onan Electric Lighting Plant, capacity 2000 watts, 115 volt, 60 cycle, single phase, is $727.50 less 10% f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nWe are enclosing a folder which illustrates and describes the plants upon which we have quoted and trust you will find it self-explanatory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Canadian FAIRBANKS-MORSE Company Limited\n\nA. S. Bird, Manager,\nDealer and Appliance Department.\nAn extensive examination of the Crosby Girls Home was recently made by the Agent accompanied by the Executive Secretary, Women's Missionary Society, Mrs. Isobel M. Loveys, of Toronto. The plumbing and sanitary condition in the School were in a frightful state, and after an extensive conference, and a further inspection by a competent plumber from Prince Rupert, Mrs. Loveys authorized repairs and alterations from Women's Missionary Society funds to a total of $1500.00, as per the attached list. A complete new staff has been engaged at this School, and from present indications there is hope for a much improved standard throughout the School.\n\nThe lighting plant is in very bad condition indeed, and is totally inadequate to meet the needs of the School. It was leaking raw gas whilst I was there, and I consider its present condition a grave fire risk to the School. It took at least 20 minutes to get it started, and it has a very bad knock, indicative of either a worn crank-shaft bearing or main bearings gone. The plant is a Briggs-Stratton, 750 watt plant, 32 volt and was put in by the Women's Missionary Society many years ago.\n\nAn examination of the load potential was made, and it is recommended that a 110 volt AC plant of 2000 watt be installed to take care of an estimated load requirement of 1400 watts. Under present conditions the lights are kept to a minimum, but even then they go so dim as to be of little use in the school. The dulness and dinginess of the present light is such as to have an unhealthy effect on the children's minds.\n\nMrs. Loveys asks that in view of her action in sanctioning the sum of $1500.00 for plumbing, baths, more toilets and overhaul of the furnace, that the Department meet the cost of the proposed\nnew plant.\n\nBid on an Onan plant is attached. It is considered that the 2 K.W. plant at a cost f.o.b. Vancouver of $596.55 would provide a most suitable plant for this School.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Co. at Port Simpson have a competent electrical man who would install this plant, and check all present wiring for $100.00. The present plant is battery operated (16 /2 volt storage cells). These are 10 years old and are absolutely dead and beyond further use.\n\nThe new plant suggested can be started manually but is equipped with a remote control stop and start switch, which can be installed in the Matron's room. The plant also permits 4 - 12 volt (10 watt) night lights, to be operated from the starting batteries. The Hudson Bay Co. would install these in their one charge of $100.00.\n\nIt is considered that the installation of this plant is an urgent requirement and the plant is recommended for immediate purchase.\n\nF. EARL ANFIELD,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWEA:ec\nIncl.\nOct. 15, 1946.\n\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 8th in connection with the proposed replacement of the lighting plant at the Crosby Girls Home, a review of our file indicates that representations were made by the Principal on October 22nd, 1939 for repair of their lighting plant which was stated to be a 850 watt 30 volt Delco plant. Following this, under date of January 3rd, 1940, Mr. Gillett wrote recommending the purchase of a Model 800 Fairbanks-Morse plant and under date of January 11th, 1940, the proposed purchase was referred to the Department and recommended for approval. Nothing further was heard in the matter. Your letter above mentioned indicates that the present plant is a 750 watt, 32 volt Briggs-Stratton regarding which we have nothing on file although it is thought that this may have been supplied in lieu of the Fairbanks-Morse plant recommended by Mr. Gillett in 1940.\n\nYou might look into the matter further and advise me when the present plant was secured and what disposition was made of the Delco plant above referred to, and in addition secure an estimate of repairing the present plant as I am doubtful if the Department could secure funds for its replacement.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nNovember 28th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nReference your 215-8-5451 of October 15th dealing with the proposed replacement of a lighting plant at the Crosby Girls Home, Port Simpson, it is advised that in 1945 the Department paid 50% of the repairs required to overhaul this Model 800 Briggs & Stratton lighting plant. The School paid the balance and the work was done by Boultey Limited, B. C. Agents for Briggs & Stratton engines.\n\nIt is possible that in 1940 Fairbanks-Morse engines were unavailable and that a Briggs & Stratton was purchased at that time. The present plant is giving increasing trouble and in a report received yesterday it had temporarily expired.\n\nRepairs were being effected locally in an effort to keep the plant running during the present winter. The batteries are definitely gone and beyond any possibility of replacement. I am going to Port Simpson, Alice Arm and Stewart this week-end and will make a further check on this plant and submit another report.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of October 8th and enclosures referred to therein, together with a copy of my reply of October 15th and the Agent's subsequent letter of November 28th, in connection with the proposed replacement of the lighting plant at the Crosby Girls Home.\n\nAs stated in my letter above referred to, following my recommendation of January 11th, 1940 to the Department regarding the purchase of a Fairbanks-Morse, Model 800, lighting plant, we have no information on file regarding the present plant. It would appear, however, that the Department provided the present Briggs-Stratton lighting plant in preference to the Fairbanks-Morse plant recommended.\n\nThe information enclosed is provided in order that the Department may be aware of the condition of the present plant at this school but no action is recommended in connection with the matter pending receipt of Mr. Anfield's further report.\n\nD.

As I have reported on previous occasions I do not believe that this building is suitable for school purposes, and have advised that the school be closed. I cannot support Mr. Anfield's request that the Department be involved in considerable expenditure for a school which is unlikely to operate with any degree of efficiency.\n\nI also wish to point out that the lighting plant at this school is in very poor condition and should any encouragement be given in this matter, it is probable that there will be further demands upon the Department. The operation of this school has been unsatisfactory for a number of years, and it is my considered opinion that there will not be any great improvement as long as this old building with its inadequate plumbing, playground facilities and lack of space is used.\n\nR.F.

In view of the fact that last year the W.M.S. spent $1800.00 on repairs and are now spending a further $1000.00 on the roof and building, would it be possible to secure a grant from the Department to make this place safe.\n\nIf funds are not forthcoming from either the Department or W.M.S. I would recommend that use of the lighting plant be discontinued, and the school revert to lamps, also a considerable fire risk.\n\nThe school is just about ready to open and pupils are being assembled now for this purpose.\n\nF.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Crosby Home Indian Residential School, Port Simpson.\n\nOn September 24th the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church, which body operates the above-noted School, wired me that funds to the extent of $1,000.00 were available for repairs to this building. They requested that I supervise these repairs, which have now been completed and which make the building tight from rain and much more habitable than heretofore.\n\nI would refer to my letter of August 1st, 1947, following up my letter of June 14, 1947, and your reply of August 19th, also to your subsequent telegram of August 29th, 1947. Rightly or wrongly, I inferred from this correspondence that the Department was not opposing the re-opening of the School for the current academic year, and on the strength of this information proceeded to arrange for repairs and the admission of pupils. At the time of writing there are eight children in residence and more have been called in. Practically all these children are orphaned in part or children from anti-social surroundings and their care in an institution is imperative.\n\nThe School is in charge of Miss Moats and from my observations I would say she is competent to manage the School. Her co-workers are elderly but seem anxious to do their best. There are three workers only at the time of writing. The question of classroom work comes into the picture. At present the day school with some adjustment of grades can handle these children. If the pressure gets too heavy, it is recommended that Miss Moats be asked to teach them on a half day basis at the Crosby Home.\n\nIn view of all the facts, it is recommended that the School be re-opened as from October 1st; that pupilage be\nlimited to girls of 12 and under; that a maximum of 20 be enrolled and that as long as there is available room these children attend Day School in the village. And finally, that the situation be reviewed when Inspector Davey makes his annual inspection next spring.\n\nF.

Mr. Anfield, apparently acting on the basis of the same information, proceeded to arrange for repairs and the admission of pupils with the result that the school is now in session with eight children in residence.\n\nA memorandum dated December 1st from District School Inspector Davey is attached wherein he concurs in the recommendations made by Mr. Anfield regarding the age limit, number of pupils to be enrolled and the proposed attendance of the children at the day school at Port Simpson. Under the circumstances there would appear to be no alternative but to recommend approval of these arrangements.\n\nD. M.

Therefore we are today writing to Dr. Dorey, of the United Church, concerning this school, as a distinct impression was gained from him recently that this school was not to be re-opened.\n\nBernard F.

As you know, the Home is no longer in operation and consequently the building is deteriorating. I have been asked to communicate with you to ascertain if any use could be made of this building, with the suggestion that it might be used as a home for aged persons who cannot otherwise be cared for.\n\nI should be glad if you could let us know, first, whether there is need for such a home, to accommodate probably fifteen or twenty persons. It is obvious that those to be accommodated must be members of the Band at Port Simpson, or not too far away, because old people usually do not want to be removed too far from their home people.\n\nThe second question has to do with finance. If these people were not Indians, the old age pension which they would receive would probably finance the expenditure for maintenance, but the Government policy does not seem to contemplate anything except a very meagre allowance for old Indian people. I do not suppose that you are in any position to venture a prophecy as to whether the Government will make a change, so that the principle of the old age pension may apply to Indians as well as to white people. In any case, the question of the financing of such a home remains. I do not think it would be looked upon with any favor that the Church should do any more than provide the building, and probably the salary of a competent person to manage the affairs. In other respects, the venture should be self-sustaining, as all expenditure for maintenance, including the upkeep of the building, should be met out of the resources of the people.\n\nThis is just a bare outline of a possible use of the building which has been discussed. If you have any other suggestions, we should be very glad to have them.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MIT\nD.I.A.\n\nMay 25, 1949.\n\nW.S.

As a matter of fact I think this correspondence should be on some other file.\n\nThere has been previous correspondence regarding this matter, but you will note that this occurred during the early part of 1948. Please note the correspondence on the file.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Port Simpson Residential School Building\n\nWith reference to the Director's letter of May 25th regarding the proposed use of the above-mentioned building as a home for aged and infirm Indians, my views with regard to this proposal are very much in line with those expressed by Mr. Anfield in his letter of June 14th, attached.\n\nMr. Anfield's suggestion concerning the use of the building for hospitalization of T.B. cases has been referred to Dr. Tennant, who is taking the matter up with Dr. Galbraith, Superintendent of the Millar Bay Hospital.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nYour 12-11-1 of June 10th, 1949, having reference to the possible use of the former Crosby Girl's Home at Port Simpson, has been received with copies of correspondence with the Director and Dr. G. E. Dorey of the United Church.\n\nFor several years I have been exploring the possible value of homes for aged Indians and have surveyed this building and the old Mission House at Port Simpson with such a project in view. From this study, I have reached the conclusion that the institutionalizing of old Indians is an unsound procedure and that they would be better taken care of in necessitous cases by placing them in private homes on a monthly grant basis.\n\nIt is considered, however, that the Crosby Home at Port Simpson has definite values as a T.B. Preventorium and it is recommended that this phase of endeavor be explored by the Indian Health Services. I would say, however, that from practical experience in building and operating a preventorium for years at Alert Bay, I can see where the Crosby Home has a definite use along these lines. Apart from the crowded conditions at Miller Bay's children's wards, there are, I am sure, sufficient T.B. suspect children to fill two preventoria in this district. This is, of course, a medical problem and not within my jurisdiction. From the physical point of view, the building is still sound though a new furnace, lighting plant and complete wiring job would have to be installed to make the place habitable. In addition to this, complete decoration and repairs to the roof would have to be done.\n\nI see no practical use to which this building could be put within the ambit of our welfare service. It is, however, recommended that the possible use of this building by the Indian\nHealth Services be fully explored. It is just possible that if a preventorium was started at Fort Simpson, with it could be combined the present nursing facilities.\n\nF.

They have suggested, however, that it might be used to advantage by the Indian Medical Services and have referred the matter to Dr. Tennant.

However, the piano is, in our opinion, perhaps worth a little more than $150.00 so the $200.00 estimate is fair enough.\n\nThough the piano is a little out of tune and a few of the ivories are missing from its keys, we make good use of it in the senior classroom and I am glad that it is to remain in the school.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\"Gladys Findlay\"\n\nCOPY\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6458)\n\nFile 886-1, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Port Simpson United Church Residential School - Establishment - General Administration 1897 - 1943\n\nFile 886-1, part 2\nNass River Agency - Church of England Naas Residential School - General Administration 1921\n\nFile 886-3, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Port Simpson United Church Residential School - Payments of Grants 1931 - 1948\n\nFile 886-5, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Port Simpson United Church Residential School - Inspector of Construction 1913 - 1914\n\nFile 886-5, part 2\nSkeena River Agency - Port Simpson United Church Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts 1933 - 1950\n\nFile 886-9, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Port Simpson United Church Residential School - School Land 1913 - 1914\n\nFile 886-12, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Crosby Girls Residential School (Port Simpson) - Supplies - Accounts 1904 - 1921\n\nFile 886-24, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Crosby Girls Residential School (Port Simpson) - Audit Reports 1935 - 1948\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI enclose you a copy of the document I received, signed by three of the Chiefs of the Fort Simpson Band, re the lease of land sufficient for school purposes.

This lease ought to be drawn up in favor of the Indian Department rather than the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYou know the Government are building the building and the Methodist Church is to manage the same. I presume your intention is to lease the land for school purposes, however that will make no difference to the Band whether the lease is drawn up in favor of the Government or the Methodist Church. The school is to be built for the welfare and the education of your children. I have carefully looked over the document and am much pleased with its spirit.\n\nTrusting that the school will soon be built and that it will be a credit to all the people that are interested in it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTF/JM.\n23rd, October 1913.\n\nThe Rev.

We have a number of good carpenters and good general workmen and we feel that you will be able to secure for our people some work in connection with the undertaking of the building. We are enthusiastic about the work and hope the building will be commenced without any delay.\n\nThanking you for your interest on our behalf,\n\nWe are yours Faithfully,\n\nChief Councillor A.G.

Mr. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nand Hospitals,\nBrandon Man.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nFor some time past I have been trying to get the Port Simpson Indians to commit themselves in regard to a site for the proposed new school.\n\nWhen you were in Port Simpson in the spring if you remember we examined three, one of which, if you look at the rough diagram in part of lot 9, Range 5, Coast District. This is adjacent to the Girl's Home bordering on the south line of their lot and a very desirable location.\n\nA second site is exactly opposite across the Government trail in a westward direction and on the Indian Departments plan of the Port Simpson Townsite is marked Block XVI. This joins the present mission property on the south side. This also is a desirable location.\n\nIf neither of the above suit or if we could not secure the one adjacent to the Girl's Home there is the present site, which would certainly be a last resort.\n\nI am inclined to think the first impossible. It is owned by a Victoria liquor seller, who said a few years ago that he would not sell any but he would sell all his holdings viz., 20 acres in a block. He asked $25,000.00. I have tried to see him in Victoria but failed. Now have written him in regard to the matter, so that we shall have some basis to work upon when the site is decided upon.\n\nIn regard to the second site the fact that the Indians are willing to give it to us shows two things, their desire for a school and their confidence in the Methodist Church. The Indians are incensed over the present conduct of the land question, they have refused to \"Lose Land,\" turning down all applications even though good money has been offered them, until their grievance is settled and I had to assure them before they were willing to consider the matter that the granting of the land for educational purposes would make no difference to the legal aspect of their claim. Their promise is in writing. I thought it would do them good to commit themselves to paper, the letter they sent is important and should be kept on file. I kept a copy but it has not their signatures.\n\nMight I ask that in your acknowledgment of the letter to Mr. Dudowad nothing is said of the site off the reserve. At present they do not know that we are even thinking of that.\n\nWith kind regards Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE.\n\nMetlakatla, B.C.,\nNo.F. Boys' Home. May 27th, 1914.\n\nSir:\n\nAs regards a site and size of same for the proposed Boarding school, I beg to say that, being unaware of the requirements of the Department, I am not able to furnish it without further knowledge of the Department's proposals. It would seem that whatever arrangements have been entered into between the Methodist Church and the Department have taken place without the matter being officially referred to me.\n\nSome time ago, when visiting Port Simpson, I met Rev. Mr. Ferrier, with whom I casually took a walk to what Mr. Ferrier regarded a possible site for a boarding school. Later at his request, we looked over the townsite plan to see how the selection of such a site would affect the surveyed lots. On another occasion, Rev. G. H. Raley, the principal of the old school, whilst preparing suggestions to be embodied in a specification to be placed in Mr. Ferrier's hands, to be later considered by the Department, asked me if I would spend a little time with him in considering such suggestions, to which I consented. Neither of these interviews were considered by me to be official, as I had received no instructions from you in regard to such matters, and I simply obliged these gentlemen by acceding to their requests. At the same time, I reported them to you.\n\nI have been given to understand that the Church authorities have found difficulty in endeavouring to secure from the Port Simpson Indians their approval to the establishment of a new boarding institution on a site proposed by Rev. G. H. Raley at the suggestion of Rev. T. Ferrier. I am informed that Mr. Raley very recently met the chiefs and asked them to give their consent to the setting aside of six acres, to which proposal the Indians would not agree.\n\nSeveral such interviews are said to have been had with the chiefs, individually and collectively, but I have not been made officially aware of any of them by the Church authorities; and, not having received any instructions from the Department, I did not feel that it was my duty to be inquisitive in the matter.\n\nI would suggest that (unless it is the intention of the Department to expropriate a site for the proposed building) a meeting of the Port Simpson Indians be convened, to acquaint them with the Department's intentions, officially, and if there are any objections coming from the Indians, to find out what they are, before so extensive an undertaking be commenced.\nThe site proposed by the Church authorities, seemed, at the time of Rev. T. Ferrier's visit to Port Simpson, to be the best in view of the desire on the part of the said authorities to have a building upon or closely adjacent to the Mission reserve. A considerable sum of money will have to be spent to make the site a really desirable one for a big institution. Many better sites exist, and it would seem to be a favourable time for the Department to purchase outright a desirable piece of land.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

The school has an enrollment of 45 pupils with an average attendance of 42 for the past year and up to the present time they have only been receiving a grant for 20 children from the Department, although 15 more pupils are provided for in next year's estimates. This school, Dr. Sutherland informed me, is carried on independently of the Methodist Missionary Society by the Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, and judging from reports received from the Superintendent and Agent, the school is deserving of any financial assistance the Department can see its way to grant.\n\nThe Department has supplied boarding schools with iron bedsteads, in special cases and where special authority has been obtained, and if funds are available, I would recommend that a grant for this purpose be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 836-12, part 1)\nSchools\n\nOTTAWA, 6th May, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd ultimo, submitting an application from the management of the Port Simpson Girls Home for a grant of $450.00 to purchase 45 iron beds, I beg to say that no decision can be arrived at until the Departmental estimates are concluded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.

Railway on the Skeena River. This being the case the shipment had to be traced and forwarded and was some time in arriving at Port Simpson, after which some delay was occasioned in having the bills of lading sent back to me from the school, certified to by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 27th May, 1919.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that voucher No. 2058 which you submitted in favour of the Globe Furniture Company of Waterloo for school desks supplied for use at the Crosby Girls' Boarding School at Fort Simpson, has been paid, less the charge of $19.80 for freight. The deduction was made consequent upon the fact that the company agreed to supply the desks without charging freight thereon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.G. Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 27th May, 1919.\n\nGentlemen:\u2014\n\nI beg to transmit herewith cheque No. 207 for $64.80 in payment for school desks which you shipped to British Columbia for the Crosby Girls' Boarding School at Port Simpson. $19.80 has been charged for freight, but I may remind you that under your agreement with the Department, you were to pay the freight charges, and therefore I may say that the amount has been deducted from your account. I have also to point out that no receipt has been received by the Department for the freight charges paid.\n\nIn this connection I may say that Mr. Perry, the Indian Agent at Prince Rupert who submitted the account for the desks, stated that they were addressed to Skeena City, a flag station of the G.T.R. Railway on the Skeena River, with the result that the shipment had to be traced and forwarded and therefore it was delayed in arriving at Port Simpson, so the bill of lading had to be sent back to him from the school certified to by the teacher. Had shipment been made direct to Port Simpson as requested, the delay referred to would not have occurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

We paid the freight from Waterloo to Skeena City which amounted to $16.30 a copy of which we enclose herewith. You will, therefore, note that the Railroad Company has charged the freight twice on this shipment and would therefore, ask you to kindly mail us your freight receipt on which you paid $19.80 and we will put in a claim for same at this end.\n\nWith regard to shipment being destined Skeena City, wish to say that the destination was billed as Port Simpson and the railroad Company had no right to stop this shipment at Skeena City. The amount of freight was only paid to Skeena City which was on account of the Railway not going any farther than Skeena City and from there on it goes by boat and we were unable to get the transportation charges from Skeena City to Port Simpson.\n\nHoping that this will clear matters and that we may receive your check for $19.80 amount deducted in error.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE CO. LIMITED.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 836-12, part 1)\nOttawa, June 10th., 1918.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to draw attention to letter to you of the 27th May, and your reply of the 6th instant, relative to your account for school desks which you shipped to British Columbia for the Crosby Girls' School at Port Simpson. In the Department's letter quoted it was pointed out that the freight charges on the consignment amounted to $19.80. It should have been stated that those charges amounted to $19.18. You were reminded that under your agreement with the Department you were to pay the freight charges, with the result that when your account of $83.98 was received, it was paid at $64.80. Apparently you did not read the letter sent you carefully as you seem to be under the impression that the railway company charged freight on the shipment before making delivery. In this you are mistaken. I shall be glad if you will again peruse the Department's letter of the 27th May in a careful manner.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter you request the issue of a cheque in your favor for $19.80. I may point out that the freight receipt which you have forwarded shows that you actually paid only $16.30 freight charges, although you have shown $19.18 in your account as paid, and you are asking the Department to pay $19.80. In view of the agreement made at the time you received the order it is you and not the Department who should make payment of the freight charges. You will therefore understand that it is not proposed to issue a further cheque in your favor.\n\nThe Department observes your explanations in regard to shipment being made to Skeena City instead of to Port Simpson and the said explanation is accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHE Globe Furniture Co. Ltd.,\nWaterloo, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWaterloo, Ontario, June 20, 1919.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of June 10 with regard to shipment to Port Simpson wish to state that the amount of freight of $19.18 was omitted in the price per desk and was therefore charged on the invoice in this way. Under the circumstances it is our fault in not including this amount in the price of each desk and are therefore dropping the matter, and will credit your account with same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-12, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor: Crookley Girls' School on 7th September\n\nReserve in: Sherrin Agency.\n\nDate: Feb. 6, 1920\n\n| ARTICLES          | No. on Hand | Date of last Receipt | No. Required | No. Authorized | REMARKS |\n|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|---------|\n| School Books No. 3 | 12          | Jan. 1819            | 10           | 10             | no 3 single |\n\nAddress to which above supplies are to be sent:\n\nName: Crookley Girls' Home\n\nSchool: Crookley Girls' Home\n\nPost Office (nearest): West Temagami\n\nProvince: Ont.\n\nExpress Office (nearest): E.T.

The Department will await a full report from you regarding the present condition of the desks and whether it is absolutely necessary that a further supply be purchased at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.

I regret that this letter has not been answered sooner. It reached me only three days ago.\n\nIn replying thereto I beg to inform you that before requisition was made for these desks, Mr. Chief Inspector W.E. Ditchburn and I visited this school. The Matron-Principal asked for two dozen desks, but the Chief Inspector and I thought that some of those referred to by the Matron as having been often repaired might possibly be repaired again. After careful inspection and elimination, we reduced the requisition and submitted it to the Department as so prepared.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the supply asked for be furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSKEENA RIVER AGENCY, B.C.\nREPORT NO.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nFile No. 119500/5...

This is in accordance with a letter No.C150-46, which was sent to you under date of May 27th, 1935.\n\nAccording to the report submitted by Mr. Holmes, the Auditor, it is necessary for you to be supplied with a Cash Book as furnished to other residential schools by this Department for the purpose of recording accurately the receipts and expenditure of the school's business.\n\nPerhaps you have seen or used one of these books at other schools and will be familiar with its correct use, but in case you have not the following is an outline showing the manner in which it should be kept.\n\nThe headings to the columns are, to a large extent, self-explanatory. On the debit or left hand side you will observe all the cash receipts are recorded showing the dates upon which they were received. These receipts are classified under Government per capita grant, Church grants, farming and garden proceeds (if a farm is operated) and proceeds from other sources.\n\nYou are requested to ascertain from the W.M.S. the exact amount of the per capita grant which is sent to you and also the amount of the Church grant, if any, when those remittances are sent to you. This will\nbe necessary in order to keep the Cash Book correctly and to give the desired information to the Department at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nYou will, from time to time, deposit these funds in the Bank Account, which by the way should be in the name of the school and not your own name or any other individual. The receipts shown in the Cash Book should agree with the total of the deposits which appear in the Bank Pass Book over any given period, the only exception being when you have cash on hand and have been unable to deposit it in the Bank.\n\nThe credit or right hand side of the book is used for expenditure where the expenses are recorded under the various column headings, such as salaries, clothing, food, etc. The enclosed specimen Cash Book sheet which has been written up and balanced as a guide for you covering a month's transactions and by this you will see that all the totals of the different columns of expenses agree with the total on the extreme right hand side of the sheet.\n\nYou will also observe that although one cheque may be written for more than one item of expense when it is made out to the same Company or individual the total of the cheque is extended and all cheque numbers must be recorded in the extreme right hand column provided for that purpose.\n\nBy recording the cheque numbers carefully you will find that you will save yourself much time when referring back over several months or years for a certain cheque and finding how it was made up. Also when you come to check your Bank Pass Book it is very simple and convenient to be in a position to compare the cheques presented and\n\ncashed\ncashed by the Bank with those you have recorded in the Cash Book. In this way you are in a position to know which cheques have not been presented at the Bank, and which should appear as outstanding at a month end or a fiscal year end. This also facilitates checking should your books be audited either by a Church official or the Field Auditor.\n\nAt the foot of the attached specimen sheet there has been prepared a Bank Reconciliation statement covering the close of the same period of business for which the cash sheet is written. It is quite simple and very easily followed and if carried out correctly will be satisfactory to you knowing that the Cash Book record agrees with the Bank balance shown in the Pass Book.\n\nIt is customary for the principals to assemble the cancelled cheques after they are paid and received from the Bank each month end, in numerical order, and you may also attach the invoice or voucher to the cheque which pays it. Another method which also proves satisfactory is to file the vouchers and invoices alphabetically and write the cheque number which pays it on the face of the account. Either method you will find will help you considerably for reference purposes.\n\nThe Cash Book will of course be closed off and totalled at the end of each month and the balance of the total receipts, less the total expenditures, will be carried forward to the following month. These totals of all the headings may be summarized each month at the back of the Cash Book, then when the twelve months' totals have been recorded your financial statement is complete for the fiscal year end (March 31).\nThe procedure for handling Petty Cash has been written separately and is attached hereto.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing and the attached statements will be of some assistance to you,\n\nYours truly,\n\nActing Superintendent of Schools.\n\nHBR/AEB.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch\n\nIn accordance with a verbal request of Mr. Phelan this office has prepared a draft letter addressed to the principal of the Port Simpson Indian School outlining the procedure to be followed in connection with the use of the Cash Book.\n\nA specimen has been prepared of a month's transactions together with an example showing how to reconcile the Cash Book with the Bank Account.\n\nAlso attached to the letter of instructions is a short statement outlining the procedure to be followed in handling Petty Cash. It is understood that you will take the necessary steps to supply the principal of the School with a Cash Book.\n\nWhen writing Miss Deacon will you please let us have a copy of your letter.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nADW/MAJ\nOttawa, October 16, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Holmes' report regarding his examination of the books at the Fort Simpson Residential School on July 22nd, last.\n\nAccording to the report submitted by Mr. Holmes, it is necessary for you to be supplied with a Cash Book as furnished to other residential schools by this Department for the purpose of recording accurately the receipts and expenditure of the school's business.

Allan, Esq.,\nAudit Accountant,\nAuditor General's Department,\nConfederation Building,\nOttawa.\n\nLLS/AEB\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Allen,\n\nSubmitted herewith is report covering my examination of the books of the Crosby Girls' Home, Port Simpson, B.C.\n\nI was informed by the Agent at Prince Rupert about noon of July 22, that the Principal of this School was leaving on holidays the following morning. I, therefore, proceeded to Port Simpson that afternoon and was shown the books, but as time would not permit more than a hurried examination, I brought such records as were considered necessary back to Prince Rupert. After as thorough an examination as was possible, I met the Principal when passing through on the boat and secured some necessary explanations.\n\nThe Principal is Miss L.M. Deacon and while she kept records which were apparently satisfactory for her own purposes, for audit purposes they were not satisfactory.\n\nAs there is no branch bank in Port Simpson, the account is kept in the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, under the title Crosby Girls' Home. All grants are forwarded by the Women's Missionary Society direct to the Bank, without any notification to the Principal as to what they constitute, her only information being that obtained from the statement from the Bank. Cheques issued do not bear much relation to the actual accounts as many cheques are issued to the Hudson's Bay Company for cash, and accounts may be paid all in cash or by cheque or part cash and part cheque. The Bank forwards all paid cheques with statement of account monthly, the statement being checked by Miss Deacon and the receipt signed and returned to the Bank.\n\nThe School has never been supplied with the Departmental Cash Book for use at Residential Schools. A small Day Book is used in which the balance at the beginning of the month is debited followed by entries for revenue and on the credit side each individual payment is entered. At the end of each month a summary of expenditure under the headings used by the Department, is made and both debits and credits transferred to a small book used as a Cash Book. Cheques were numbered but the numbers were never entered in the books of account and cheques dated one month might apply to expenditure of a previous month and be so included in the books.\n\nThe Principal stated she thought this School was on a different status from other Residential Schools, in that it was more completely controlled by the Women's Missionary Society. For this reason and the fact that the Departmental Cash Book had not been provided, I did not issue any instructions with regard to bookkeeping procedure. If the Cash Book is to be put in use I thought that when forwarding it that instructions might be issued as to its use and the proper bookkeeping procedures.\n\nIn order to provide some information as to receipts and expenditures, statement #1 attached herewith was prepared to show Receipts and Expenditures for the fiscal year 1934-35.\n\nThe total receipts for the year were $7,079.38 made up of $6,689.38 as the Per Capita and Church Grants and $50.00 as a grant for a scholarship, forwarded by the Women's Missionary Society and $340.00 paid by the teachers for board and room, being at the rate of $10.00 per month each for three teachers.\n\nThe total expenditures were $7,080.83.\nOf this total $2,291.52 was for Salaries of teachers, $320.73 for Clothing and $1,779.07 for Food.\n\nUnder the heading Phone, Light and Fuel, the total was $896.58 of which $727.75 was for coal and wood.\n\nFurniture for Buildings and Repairs amounted to $804.78, of which $266.43 was for bath-room fixtures and installation, $229.90 for repairs to the furnace, $85.00 for repairs to the roof and $52.55 for calamine in the School building. The Principal stated that no added allowance was made by the Department for any of this expenditure.\n\nExpenditure for House Equipment amounted to $600.59 of which $250.00 was for the purchase and installation of a small Delco system for lighting purposes, the balance for cleaning materials and utensils and dishes and kitchen utensils.\n\nExpenditure for Extra Labour amounted to $195.20 which is made up of payments for domestic service and the services of a handyman.\n\nOf a total of $138.76 under the heading Miscellaneous, $50.00 was for the payment of the scholarship as provided for in the receipts to the School, about $50.00 for Hospital and Medical expenses for the pupils and the balance for newspaper subscriptions and other incidentals.\n\nThe cost of operations as shown by statement #2, is based on the actual cash expenditure only as there are no farming operations carried on.\n\nThe averages are based on an attendance of 27 pupils.\n\nThe Per Capita could not be separated from the Church Grants for, as explained before in this report, the Women's Missionary Society forwarded funds direct to the Bank without notifying the Principal as to whether they were Government or Church grants, and it is therefore impossible to show the amount allowed by Government grant per pupil per day.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report, which is in duplicate,\n\nStatement of Receipts and Expenditures, fiscal year 1934-35\nStatement of Cost of Operations, fiscal year 1934-35\nStaff Occupations and Salaries as at close of School year 1934-35\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.W.

Holmes,\nAuditor.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe- Crosby Girl's Home,\nUnited Church\nPort Simpson B.C.\n\nSubmitted herewith is report of an examination of the books and records at the above-mentioned Residential School covering the period of sixteen months dating April 1, 1935, to July 31, 1936, completed on September 3.\n\nThe account for the School is kept in the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, as there is no bank in Port Simpson. This is another school where, due to inconvenient banking facilities, much of the expenditure is made by cash which is obtained at the store of the Hudson's Bay Company, where cheques are cashed for the School. Such cheques are usually in amounts of $25.00 to $50.00, while payments were noted for amounts as high as $65.00.\n\nA record of cash receipts and payments is not kept. The Principal informed me she kept a statement for each month at the end of which expenditures were classified and entered in the cash book and the statement destroyed.\n\nA small Day Book was used as a cash book until January 1, 1936, when the Departmental Cash Receipts and Expenditures Book, which had been received in November, was opened. This book had been written up to June 30th.\n\nReceipts were never secured for cash payments and the monthly account of the Hudson's Bay Company was the only detailed account covering payments by cheque.\n\nIn order to illustrate the proper keeping of the records I wrote up and balanced the cash book for July and instructed the Principal regarding the system of bookkeeping and filing of records which the Department was endeavouring to establish at Residential Schools, and in order to confirm verbal instructions prepared memorandum attached herewith as Exhibit A, a copy of which was forwarded to the School.\n\nBank and Cash Book Reconciliation.\n\nFrom date of last audit receipts as shown by the cash book were compared to credit entries in Bank statements and cancelled cheques to debit entries in Bank statements and expenditure entries, when entered in the cash book. Additions, extensions and balances were checked.\n\nBank and cash book reconciliation at March 31 and July 31, 1936, is shown in statement #1. Cash on hand at July 31 was $281.00.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApproximate Standing of Cash Account at August 31.\n\nBalance at July 31 (Statement #1) $281.00\nLess cheques issued during August $197.95\nAccounts payable August 31 (estimated) $83.05\nBalance (Dr.) $66.95\n\nFrom information available it would appear that the per capita grant covering the quarter to March 31, 1936, was the last credited to the School account.\n\nRECEIPTS and EXPENDITURES.\n\nStatement #2 shows receipts and expenditures for the year April 1, 1935 to March 31, 1936.\n\nReceipts - Total receipts amounted to $7,087.52 of which $6,767.52 was received from the Women's Missionary Society and $320.00 in payment for board by the staff of three, at the rate of $10.00 per month each.\n\nAs the Women's Missionary Society transfer funds from Toronto direct to the account of the School in the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, and notify the Principal stating only the total amount of such transfers, it was not possible to definitely establish the amount of the per capita grant. The amounts shown in the statement were estimated by the Principal from attendances during the different quarterly periods.\n\nExpenditures - Expenditures as shown under the various classification headings in statement #2 are shown in detail in Statement #3.\n\nAs accounts were not available for analysis the break-down in statement #3 was made from information supplied by the Principal from memory.\n\nUnder Buildings and Repairs as shown are amount of $156.80 for repairs to dam and pipes for water supply. In explanation of this expenditure, I was informed that the water for the School flows down from the hills and is dammed back at a certain point in the stream, from which it is piped to the School. During last winter the pipes burst as a result freezing and in the spring part of the dam was destroyed due to flood conditions.\n\nThe payment for extra labour consists principally of a monthly wage averaging about $10.00 paid to an Indian for performing such manual labour as is required about the School, as there is no male member on the staff. Additional expenditure under this heading was for saving wood for winter's use.\n\nSufficient details could not be obtained to analyze Miscellaneous expenditure. I was informed it consisted of subscription to one newspaper, church papers and leaflets, drugs, postage and stationery.\nCOSTS OF OPERATION.\n\nStatement \u00a74 shows costs of operations for the year based on an expenditure of $7,010.03 and an average attendance of 27.75 pupils.\n\nThe average cost per pupil per day was 69 cents, while the amount allowed by the estimated per capita grant per pupil per day was 42.4 cents.\n\nA small garden is planted but the amount of produce raised is negligible. The cost of supplies is increased considerably by freight costs.\n\nThe staff, occupations and salaries at September 3 are listed, the salaries per annum being $2,295.00, of which about $300.00 per annum is repaid to the School for board.\n\nGENERAL\n\nI desire to acknowledge the courtesies extended during my audit inspection.\n\nThis report is submitted in duplicate with the following attachments:\n\nMemorandum to Principal outlining bookkeeping procedure\nBank and Cash Book Reconciliation\nStatement of Receipts and Expenditures\nDetailed statement of Expenditures\nCost of Operations: Staff, Occupations and Salaries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. W. Holmes,\nAuditor.\nMemorandum\n\nMiss L.M. Deacon,\n\nThis memorandum covering bookkeeping procedure as the Department is endeavouring to establish it at Residential Schools, has been prepared to confirm verbal instructions issued when at your School.\n\nPayments should be made by cheque whenever the cashing of same would not greatly inconvenience the payee.\n\nAll cheques should be numbered and those in payment of accounts or services entered in the Cash Book, those issued for cash should not be entered in the Cash Book, but should be accounted for through a Record of Cash Payments.\n\nCash Book\n\nAll revenue to the School should be entered on the Dr. side of the Cash Book in the appropriate column and in due course deposited in the Bank.\n\nCheques entered should show the cheque number in the outer right hand column for the month in which they are issued. Expenditures should be classified and entered in the appropriate column. Detailed accounts should be secured on which the number of the paying cheque should be entered and the accounts filed by cheque number.\n\nRecord of Cash Payments.\n\nThis record should be started as from August 1. On the Dr. side the first entry will be the amount of $22.50, shown as cash on hand at July 31, by Bank Reconciliation statement, followed by cheques issued and cashed for the month. Such entries will include date, cheque number and amount.\nOn the Cr. side (right hand page of book) will be entered each item of expenditure, the entries to show date, name of payee, what the payment covers and amount. Receipts should be secured for payments of $2.00 and over and filed together in order of payment.\n\nAt the end of each month the account should be added and balanced, the balance being carried forward to the following month. Expenditure for the month should be classified and entered in the Cash Book under the appropriate classification headings.\n\nBank Reconciliation.\n\nAs cheques issued to obtain cash will not be entered in the Cash Book, it will be necessary when reconciling the Cash Book balance with the Bank balance at the end of each month, to include the balance of cash on hand as shown by the Record of Cash Payments. This is illustrated in Bank and Cash Book Reconciliation at July 31, statement #1.\n\nF. W.

Allan, Esq.,\nAudit Accountant,\nAuditor General's Department,\nConfederation Building,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Crosby Girl's School\n\nSubmitted herewith is report of examination of the Books and Records of the above named Residential School covering the period of thirteen months, dating from the 1st of April, 1926, to the 30th of April, 1927, completed the 9th of June, 1927.\n\nAs mentioned in the last report, the method of obtaining cash through the Hudson Bay store on account of inconvenient Banking facilities, continued, the Creditors in many cases refusing to accept cheques in payment of indebtedness.\n\nReceipts are now being obtained for paid accounts and same are being carefully filed away in good order.\n\nThe Principal, however, did not seem to understand that cheques issued in payment of accounts should be written in the Cash Book immediately in numerical order opposite the creditors account, but, waited until the end of the month and then wrote in the cancelled cheques only, as returned by the Bank; then listed her outstanding cheques below and deducted same from the Bank Balance, which showed a net balance agreeing in each case with her balance after she had deducted the distributed expenditures for the month from the debit side of her Cash Book. I went into this matter with her and I believe she now understands exactly what to do.

Oct.14 - 1938\n\nRe: Crosby Girls' Home,\nPort Simpson, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit a report of an examination made of the books and records at the above school on October 12 - 1938. The examination covered a period of 17 months dating from April 1 - 1937 to August 31 - 1938.\n\nBank Reconciliation (Statement 1)\n\nThe cash book was written up to the end of August and statement from the Bank of Commerce, Vancouver, gave a balance of $1607.82 as at that date. The outstanding cheques amounted to $103.50, and with cash on hand of $22.01 as per petty cash journal gave net balance of $1576.97 which agreed with cash book.\n\nAll receipts as per cash book are deposited in bank. Paid cheques were examined and compared to cash book entries. Vouchers were all on file by months and these were compared to synoptic entries and petty cash journal by test. A decided improvement is shown in the cash book and a reconciliation is made each month, and balance carried forward.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures\n\nThis statement was prepared from a recap of the monthly synoptic totals and statement 2 gives the expenditures in detail.\n\nThe total receipts for this period amounted to $1049.28. The per capita grant is shown as $7094.75, but this is only the matron's estimate as the cheque goes to the W.M.S. Toronto and the per capita and church grant is received in one cheque at the school. The head office in Toronto should notify the school as to the amount received from the Department from the per capita grant.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $9274.78 and are self-explanatory. The cost of clothing at $11.94 per child is not high but the cost of food at $68.76 per pupil is above normal and due to some extent to the location of the school. The cost per child per year was $233.31 and is very high for a residential school. It is apparently very necessary for the church to contribute about $2000.00 a year to finance this school.\n\nThe average attendance was 28 pupils and the staff of three carry on all the work.\n\nThe books and records were found to be in very good condition and Miss Deacon has succeeded in having the account-\n\nJ.W.

The audit covered a period of 17 months dating from September 1st, 1938 to January 31st, 1940.\n\nBank Reconciliation - Statement 1.\n\nThe bank statement as at January 31st, gave a balance of $1,959.28 and the outstanding cheques amounted to $289.78. The cash on hand as per petty cash book showed $30.09 and the net balance of $1,699.59 agreed with cash book. Cheques were examined and compared to cash book entries and vouchers. Very few cheques are issued due to practically all the larger purchases being made at one place, and petty cash used for all small local purchases.\n\nThe petty cash book was examined and compared to vouchers. The per capita and church grants are mailed from Toronto to the bank in Vancouver for deposit.\n\nThe total receipts for this period amounted to $9,723.37. The per capita grant and church grant are sent from Toronto in one amount and are computed as to their total by the principal. I would recommend that the principal be advised as to the proper amount to credit to per capita.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $9,600.75 and are shown in detail on Statement 3. All expenditures are about normal and the extra labour of $434.38 takes care of all male help required during the period.\n\nThere are no farming operations carried on at this School and no livestock. The cost of operation per pupil at $250.99 is very high and requires considerable aid from the church. It is impossible for a school of this size to operate on its earnings. The cost of clothing at $9.63 is rather low, and cost of food at $67.76 per pupil above normal. The average attendance of pupils was 27 and the staff numbers 3.\n\nE.

The audit covered a period of 12 months ended January 31st, 1941.\n\nThe Statement from the Bank of Montreal, Vancouver, gave a balance of $451.48 as at January 31st. There was one outstanding cheque in the amount of $20.00 and cash on hand was shown as $2.97. The net balance of $414.45 agreed with cash book.\n\nThe cheques from Toronto are sent direct to the bank in Vancouver. All cheques were compared to cash book entries and vouchers were checked to synoptic. Practically all supplies are purchased from the local Hudson's Bay store by cheque. Petty cash is used for small purchases from Indians.\n\nThe total revenue for this period was $3746.23. The per capita grant as received from Toronto was $3700.00, but does not include the total earnings for the year.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $5031.37 and are shown in detail on Statement 2. There is a large decrease shown in all expenditures this year. The food costs show a reduction of $13.87 per pupil and clothing a reduction of $5.18.\n\nThe cost of operation shows a reduction of $4.79 per day and $77.50 per pupil. The full grant of $175.00 would appear to be being paid to this School. The average attendance was 29, an increase of 2, and the staff remains at three.\n\nThere is no farm or garden at this School and extra labour is done by the Indians.\n\nThe books and records were in very good condition and up-to-date. While the cost of operation is very low this period, the supplies on hand are small and expenditures will be heavier. The school would appear to be in a good financial condition.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the cooperation of Miss French during my audit and the following Statements accompany this report:\n\n1.

Outstanding cheques totalled $281.92, and cash on hand 18 cents. The net balance of $681.43 agreed with the cash book.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book entries. There were vouchers on file for the expenditures and these were compared with the synoptic entries. The per capita grant cheques from the Women's Missionary Society were all deposited in the bank, and the other revenue used to reimburse petty cash.\n\nThe total revenue for the period was $10,712.08, including the per capita grant of $10,292.50.\n\nThe expenditures totalled $10,444.90 and are shown in detail in Statement #2. Fuel costs are up slightly, while all other costs appear to be about normal. The extra labor is for chores and laundry.\n\nClothing costs at $2.15 per pupil per year is exceptionally low, but it is the practice of the principal to have the parents purchase most of the clothing, as at present they are earning good incomes. The cost of food is very high at $63.23, an increase of $9.34. No farm is operated at the school, and all food must be purchased with the exception of gifts of fish.\n\nThe cost per pupil per year was $189.88, an increase of $16.39, but is not high in comparison with other small schools.\n\nThe principal advised that there were no unpaid accounts, and the school would appear to be in good financial condition.

MacKintoshon, Esq., Chief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to submit the report of an audit made at the above school on April 1st, 1944, covering the period of 14 months dating from January 1st, 1943 to February 29th, 1944.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nThe statement from the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, gave a balance of $1,341.32 as at February 29th, 1944. The outstanding cheques totalled $57.99 and the cash on hand 25 cents. The net balance of $1,083.58 agreed with the cash book.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book entries. Vouchers on file to cover the expenditures were examined by test. The cheques received from the Women's Missionary Society to pay the per capita grant are deposited. Other revenue is used to reimburse Petty Cash.\n\nRevenue and Expenditure\n\nThe revenue for the period totalled $6,750.85 of which $6,470.00 was from the per Capita grant. The disbursements totalled $6,348.70 and are shown in detail in statement #2.\n\nMost of the costs appear to be about normal. Extra labor is higher, and includes the teacher's salary for several months, as the local missionary is filling this position until another teacher can be located.\n\nClothing costs are exceedingly low at $1.357, as the parents buy practically all clothing. Food costs work out at $66.35 per pupil per year, an increase of 2 cents. All food used at the school has to be purchased. The cost of operation per pupil per year was $187.65 -- a decrease of $2.25 --, and is low for a small school.\n\nI was advised that there are no debts owing by the school.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the cooperation of Miss French during the audit.\n\nFollowing are the statements attached to this report:\n\n1.

McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI submit herewith the report of an audit made at the above school on June 12th, 1945, covering the period of 15 months dating from March 1, 1944 to May 31, 1945.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nThe statement from the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, showed a balance of $1,408.54 as at May 31, 1945. Outstanding cheques totalled $910.17, and cash on hand amounted to $19.59. The net balance of $517.96 agreed with the cash book.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book entries. Vouchers were on file to cover expenditures and these were checked by test. The per capita grant is mailed directly to the bank by the Women's Missionary Society, Toronto. All other revenue was used to reimburse petty cash. Cash expenditures are quite heavy at this school due to banking difficulties. However, the amount of $637.68 shown as paid in cash in the Cash Reconciliation includes $300.00 deducted from the staff members in payment for board. Such deductions are shown as both revenue and expenditure in the statement.\n\nThere have been three principals at this school during the period, and as a result a number of errors had occurred in the cash book. The errors together with the method of entering cash expenditures caused considerable difficulty in striking a balance over the period. A good deal of time was spent in locating and correcting the errors.\n\nRevenue & Expenditure\n\nA total of $7,445.52 was received during the period, of which the per capita grant accounted for $7,012.50. The board of staff members amounted to $300.00, but as stated above the value of board was deducted from the salary cheques, and treated as contra entries in revenue and expenditure. Other revenue totalled $133.02.\n\nThe disbursements amounted to $8,100.14. Due to the time spent in balancing as above mentioned and to the necessity of leaving at the time of a favorable tide, I did not make an analysis of the expenditures. However, judging from the vouchers examined, the breakdown would be much as for the last period.\n\nThe following table shows the respective increase or decrease per month per each synaptic heading as compared with the last period:\n\n| Increase | Decrease | Per Cent |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Salaries | 19.83    | 11.5     |\n| Clothing | 3.56     | 108.5    |\n| Food     | 25.15    | 15.5     |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel | 3.63 | 9.        |\n| Buildings & Repair | 4.55 | 60       |\n\nFORWARD 53.09 3.63\n\n(Cont.)\nOttawa, August 17, 1945.\n\nW.R.

W. Macutechon, Esquire,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nFROM: L. S. Houghton, Port Simpson Residential School\n\nI submit herewith the report of an audit made at the above School on June 2nd, 1946, covering the period June 1st, 1945 to May 31st, 1946.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nThe Bank statement and vouchers had not been received for the month of May 1946. Statement from the Bank of Toronto at Vancouver showed a balance of $1,783.29 as at April 30th, 1946 and outstanding cheques totalled $1,626.36. No deposits were made during the month of May, 1946 and cheques were issued in the amount of $93.65. Cash on hand as at May 31, 1946 amounted to $1.72 and the net balance of $65.00 agreed with the Cash book as per Schedule No. 1.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and checked to the Cash book entries. Vouchers were on file in support of expenditures and the same were examined by test and appeared in order. The per capita grant constitutes practically all the Revenue and is mailed directly to the Bank of Toronto at Vancouver by the Women's Missionary Society, (United Church of Canada), Toronto. The small amount of Sundry Revenue was used to reimburse petty cash, and not deposited. Cash expenditures are not particularly heavy, and are unavoidable owing to the lack of banking facilities at Port Simpson.\n\nThe Cash book was written up to date and in balance. The synoptic distribution was reasonably correct.\n\nRevenue & Expenditure\n\nA total of $7,535.39 was received during the period, of which the per capita grant amounted to $7,273.44, and sundry revenue $261.95. No deduction is made from staff members for board as during the previous audit.\n\nThe disbursements amounted to $7,988.35, showing a comparative increase in the cost of operation over the last corresponding period. The following summary shows the relative increase or decrease per month under the various synoptic headings which hardly require further breakdown.\n| Item                  | Expenditure per month - previous audit period | Expenditure per month - this audit period | Increase | Decrease |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Salaries             | $195.47                                        | $222.85                                  | $27.38    |          |\n| Clothing             | 6.84                                           | 12.44                                    | 5.60      |          |\n| Food                 | 185.26                                         | 184.19                                   |           | $1.07    |\n| Phone, Light & Fuel  | 41.22                                          | 9.38                                     | 31.84     |          |\n| Buildings & Repair   | 12.09                                          | 27.55                                    | 15.46     |          |\n| House Equipment      | 38.33                                          | 73.46                                    | 35.13     |          |\n| Farm & Garden        | -                                              | .20                                      | .20       |          |\n| Transportation       | 15.12                                          | 12.50                                    |           | 2.62     |\n| Extra Labour         | 25.54                                          | 22.77                                    |           | 2.77     |\n| Miscellaneous        | 14.21                                          | 17.01                                    | 2.80      |          |\n| **Total Monthly Increase** |                                           |                                          | 86.57     | 38.30    |\n\nThe above summary shows an average monthly increase in the cost of operation of $48.27. There is a noticeable decrease in the fuel costs by reason of fuel supplies purchased during the last audit period having carried over well into this period. The supply was recently depleted and further purchases are now necessary for which the Principal is seeking an advance of the per capita grant. With the exception of minor decreases in respect to Food, Transportation and Extra Labour, the other departments show appreciable increase.\n\nThe cost of operation per pupil per year has risen from $227.025 for the last period to $307.24, an increase of $80.215. The average pupil attendance has been reduced from 28.23 to 26.\n\n**General**\n\nThe books and records were fairly well maintained and have been kept up to date. I am advised that there are no liabilities with the exception of one months salary to the teacher and a contingent account for fuel now being supplied.\n\nMiss Rogers, the Principal extended every co-operation during the conduct of this audit and all explanations required were readily obtained.\n\nThe following Schedules are attached to this report:\n\n- Schedule 1 Bank Reconciliation Statement\n- Schedule 2 Cash Reconciliation Statement\n- Schedule 3 Statement of Revenue and Expenditures\n- Schedule 4 Statement of Operating Costs and Staff.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nL.

The Statement from the Bank of Toronto at Vancouver showed an overdraft of $46.05 as at June 31, 1947, and outstanding cheques as listed amounted to $353.68 in June and $18.96 in July. Cash on hand was verified in the amount of $19.76 for a net overdraft as per Cash Book of $398.93 at July 31.\n\nThe overdraft as per Cash Book as at June 30, 1947 was $660.81 while expenditures in July amounted to $38.12 and receipts amounted to $300.00 thereby reconciling with the net bank balance. The $300.00 was credited by the bank in June but was not entered in the Cash Book until July.\n\nAll cancelled cheques for the period together with those outstanding from the previous audit were examined and checked to the Cash Book entries. Vouchers were on hand in support of expenditures and as examined by test, appeared to be in order.\n\nThe per capita grant constitutes practically all the Revenue and is mailed directly to the Bank of Toronto at Vancouver by the Women's Missionary Society, (United Church of Canada) Toronto.\n\nCash Reconciliation - (Statement #1)\n\nSundry revenue amounting to $294.07 was received but not deposited, being used for petty cash expenditures. A further $30.00 was received for this purpose from the bank account and total expenditures supported by voucher amounted to $364.03. The balance of $19.76 was verified as being on hand. Cash expenditures are unavoidable owing to the lack of banking facilities at Port Simpson.\n\nRevenue and Expenditures - (Statement #2)\n\nA total of $11,024.42 was received during the period, not including a refund of a Travel Advance as per contra. The\nper capita advance accounted for $10,740.35 and the balance of $294.07 represented sundry revenue. No deductions were made from staff members for board.\n\nThe disbursements amounted to $11,498.35 showing a comparative increase in the cost of operation over the last corresponding period. The following summary shows the relative increase or decrease per month under the various synoptic headings.\n\n| Expenditures per month | Expenditures per month |\n|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Previous audit Period  | This audit Period      |\n| Increase               | Decrease               |\n| Salaries $222.85       | $215.63                | $7.22 |\n| Clothing 12.44         | 13.37                  | .93   |\n| Food 184.19            | 223.31                 | 39.12 |\n| Phone, Light & Fuel 9.38 | 74.87                  | 65.49 |\n| Buildings & Repair 27.55 | 181.16                 | 153.61|\n| House Equipment 73.46  | 35.50                  | 37.96 |\n| Farm & Garden 12.20    |                        | .20   |\n| Transportation 12.50    |                        | 12.50 |\n| Extra Labour 22.77     | 60.02                  | 37.25 |\n| Household Supplies 7.94 | 7.94                   | 7.94  |\n| Miscellaneous 17.01    | 9.51                   | 7.50  |\n| Monthly Increase 582.35 | 821.31                 | 304.34|\n|                       |                        | 65.38 |\n|                       |                        | 238.96|\n\nThe fluctuations in the costs from year to year are due, for the most part, to the practice of charging expenses in total to the period in which they are paid. In the previous audit, for example, coal purchases were negligible, due to the large inventory at the beginning of the audit period resulting in a corresponding decrease in the fuel costs.\n\nCost of Operations - (Statement #3)\n\nThe breakdown of the costs shows an increase in each category over the previous audit while the attendance has decreased.\n\nThe cost of operation per pupil per year has risen from $307.24 for the last period to $473.83, an increase of $166.59 and has more than doubled in the past two years. The average pupil attendance from the four quarterly returns ending June 30, 1947 was 20.8, a decrease from 26 in the previous year.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records were fairly well maintained and have been kept up to date. Operations apparently ceased in July 1947 and at the time of the audit the school was closed and no staff were available, as a result it has not been possible to determine if there are any contingent liabilities.\n\nThornton Taylor\nTreasury Auditor\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-24, part 1)\nPort Simpson Residential School\n\nBank Reconciliation as at July 31, 1947\n\nJune 30/47 Balance as per Bank Statement - Overdraft $46.05\n\nJuly 1947- Deposits - nil\n\nJune 30/47 Outstanding Cheques\n#39 176.05\n40 25.00\n41 38.85\n42 115.78\n353.68\n\nJuly 31/47 Cheques Issued 18.96 372.64\nOverdraft July 31/47 418.69\n\nJuly 31/47 Cash on hand 19.76\n\nOverdraft as per Cash Book June 30/47 660.81\nExpenditures July 38.12\n698.93\nReceipts July 300.00\n398.93 398.93\n\nCash Reconciliation as at July 31, 1947\n\nMay 31/46 Cash on Hand 1.72\nCash Received and not deposited 294.07\nCheques drawn to reimburse petty cash 30.00\nCash expenditures 306.03\n\nJuly 31, 1947 Cash on Hand 19.76\n\n325.79 325.79\n## Statement #2\n\n### Port Simpson Residential School\n\n#### Statement of Revenue and Expenditures June 1, 1946 - July 31/47\n\n| June 1/46 Balance | 65.00 |\n|-------------------|-------|\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- Women's Missionary Society: $10,740.35\n- Refund of Travel Advance as per contra: $100.00\n- Sundry: $294.07\n\nTotal Revenue: $11,134.42\n\n**Expenditures**\n\n- Salaries: $3,018.76\n- Clothing: $187.17\n- Food: $3,126.30\n- Household Supplies: $111.17\n- Telephone, Light and Fuel: $1,048.23\n- Buildings and Repairs: $2,536.29\n- House Equipment: $496.93\n- Travel Advance: $100.00\n- Extra Labour: $846.29\n- Miscellaneous: $135.21\n- Cash on hand: $19.76\n\nTotal Expenditures: $11,618.11\n\nBank Overdraft July 31/47: $418.69\n\nTotal: $11,618.11\n## Port Simpson Residential School\n\n### Cost of Operations\n\n| Description                                      | Amount     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cost of Operation June 1/46 - July 31/47         | $11,498.35 |\n| Cost of Operation per year                       | 9,855.73   |\n| Cost of Operation per day                        | 27.00      |\n| Average Attendance                               | 20.8 pupils|\n| Cost of Operations per pupil per year            | 473.83     |\n| Cost of Clothing per pupil per year              | 9.00       |\n| Cost of Food per pupil per year                  | 150.30     |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-24, part 1)\n711 Stock Exchange Bldg.,\n475 Howe Street,\nVancouver, B.

This school was officially closed in June, 1948.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nThe certificate of the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, B.C., Statement - 2, shows a credit balance of $431.96. There was one unrepresented cheque for $3.50, leaving a bank balance of $428.46, which with the cash on hand 34 cents equalled the cash balance of $428.82 as showing in the Cash Book.\n\nCheque No. 124 for $428.48 to close this account was issued in favour of the Women's Missionary Society, United Church of Canada, during September, 1948.\n\nCash Reconciliation\n\nThis statement shows in total the amount paid in cash, and its source. The cash receipts of $62.96 were not deposited, and cheques totalling $209.00 were drawn on the Bank to provide the cash needed to pay small bills at this village, due to lack of banking facilities. The balance on hand, 34 cents was verified by count.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements\n\nThe total receipts amounted to $7,355.46 of which Grants from the Women's Missionary Society accounted for $7,292.50; Sundry items totalled $50.96, and there is an adjustment of $12.00 for Income Tax deductions.\n\nThere was a bank overdraft of $418.69 on August 1st, and the disbursements during the period amounted to $6,527.71, which left a Cash Balance of $428.82.\n\nThe following summary shows the increase or decrease of costs between this and the previous audit period, under the various Cost headings.\n\n| Expenditure, per Month | Previous Audit Period | This Audit Period | Increase | Decrease |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|\n| Salaries               | $215.63               | $201.24           | $14.39   |          |\n| Clothing               | 13.37                 | 7.45              | 5.92     |          |\n| Food                   | 223.31                | 158.57            | 64.74    |          |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel     | 74.87                 | 77.97             | 3.10     |          |\n| Building & Repairs     | 181.16                | 6.28              | 174.88   |          |\n| House Equipment        | 35.50                 | 3.64              | 31.86    |          |\n| Farm & Garden          |                       |                   |          |          |\n| Transportation         |                       |                   |          |          |\n| Extra Labour           | 60.02                 | 40.70             | 19.32    |          |\n| Household Supplies     | 7.94                  |                   | 7.94     |          |\n| Miscellaneous          | 9.51                  | 5.65              | 3.86     |          |\n|                        | 821.31                | 502.13            | 319.18   | 322.91   |\n| Monthly decrease       |                       |                   |          |          |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-24, part 1)\nThis comparison has been made on the basis of the number of months in the audit period, which is the usual method. The decrease in average cost per month has, no doubt, been affected by the closing of the school, which resulted in approximately one less school month than in the previous period, and smaller school attendance, which reduced the food costs; also, repairs to building were negligible during this period, as a result of the extensive repairs made during the previous period and the closing of the school.\n\nCost of Operations.\n\nStatement - 4s.\n\nThis statement shows a reduction in the cost of operation per year and in the cost per day as compared with the previous audit period.\n\nThe cost per pupil per year in total and for clothing and food, however, shows a small increase. This variance is accounted for by the sharp decrease in the average daily attendance from 20.8 to 12.11 pupils.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Cash Book and other records presented for audit were in good order, and written up to date. The cancelled cheques, supplier's vouchers and other vouchers for the period August 1, 1947 to December 31, 1947 were not available for audit, as consequent to the closing of the school, all records pertaining to the house, with the exception of the cash book and vouchers etc., for 1948, were sent to the Women's Missionary Society Executive, Toronto.\n\nThis school closed officially on June 30, 1948, salaries ceasing - Mrs. MacEachlan, on June 30th, Miss Middleton and Miss Morse, on July 21, 1948. In addition Mrs. MacEachlan and Miss Middleton received a month's salary $75.00 as Holiday Pay.\n\nMiss Middleton advises that there are \"no unpaid bills or indefinite claims on the school.\" \"We checked on this very carefully.\" It was noted during the audit that an old account of Prince Rupert Roofing Co., for $7.56, no details had been paid to Brown & Harvey, Solicitors.\n\nThe Cash Book, and vouchers for the period January 1, to August 31, 1948, which were mailed to Mr. F. H.

This school was officially closed in June, 1948.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nStatement - 2 NOV 24 1948\n\nThe certificate of the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver, B.C., Statement - 2, shows a credit balance of $631.98. There was an unrepresented cheque for $3.50, leaving a bank balance of $428.48, which with the cash on hand 34 cents equalled the cash balance of $428.82 as shown in the Cash Book.\n\nCheque No. 124 for $428.48 to close this account was issued in favour of the Women's Missionary Society, United Church of Canada, during September, 1948.\n\nCash Reconciliation\n\nStatement - 1.\n\nThis statement shows in total the amount paid in cash, and its source. The cash receipts of $62.96 were not deposited, and cheques totalling $200.00 were drawn on the Bank to provide the cash needed to pay small bills at this village, due to lack of Banking facilities. The balance on hand, 34 cents was verified by count.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements\n\nStatement - 3.\n\nThe total receipts amounted to $7,355.46 of which Grants from the Women's Missionary Society accounted for $7,292.50. Sundry items totalled $50.96, and there is an adjustment of $12.00 for Income Tax deductions.\n\nThere was a bank overdraft of $418.69 on August 1st, and the disbursements during the period amounted to $6,527.71, which left a Cash Balance of $428.82.\n\nThe following summary shows the increase or decrease of costs between this and the previous audit period, under the various Cost headings.\n\n| Expenditure, per Month | Previous Audit Period | This Audit Period | Increase | Decrease |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|\n| Salaries               | $215.63               | $201.24           | $14.39   |          |\n| Clothing               | 12.37                 | 7.15              | 5.22     |          |\n| Food                   | 223.21                | 158.57            | 64.64    |          |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel     | 74.87                 | 77.97             | 3.10     |          |\n| Building & Repairs     | 181.16                | 6.28              | 174.88   |          |\n| House Equipment        | 35.50                 | 3.64              | 31.86    |          |\n| Fram & Garden          |                       |                   |          |          |\n| Transportation         |                       | .63               | .63      |          |\n| Extra Labour           | 60.02                 | 40.70             | 19.32    |          |\n| Household Supplies     | 7.94                  |                   |          |          |\n| Miscellaneous          | 9.51                  | 5.65              |          |          |\n|                        | 821.31                | 502.13            | 3.73     |          |\n| Monthly decrease       |                       | 319.18            |          |          |\n|                        | $821.31               | $821.31           | $322.91  | $322.91  |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6458, file 886-24, part 1)\nThis comparison has been made on the basis of the number of months in the audit period, which is the usual method. The decrease in average cost per month has, no doubt, been affected by the closing of the school, which resulted in approximately one less school month than in the previous period, and smaller school attendance, which reduced the food costs; also, repairs to building were negligible during this period, as a result of the extensive repairs made during the previous period and the closing of the school.\n\nCost of Operations.\n\nStatement - A.\n\nThis statement shows a reduction in the cost of operation per year and in the cost per day as compared with the previous audit period.\n\nThe cost per pupil per year in total and for clothing and food, however, shows a small increase. This variance is accounted for by the sharp decrease in the average daily attendance from 20.8 to 12.11 pupils.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Cash Book and other records presented for audit were in good order, and written up to date. The cancelled cheques, supplier's Vouchers and other vouchers for the period August 1, 1947 to December 31, 1947 were not available for audit, as consequent to the closing of the school, all records pertaining to the home, with the exception of the cash book and vouchers etc., for 1945, were sent to the Women's Missionary Society Executive, Toronto.\n\nThis school closed officially on June 30, 1948, salaries ceasing - Mrs. McLachlan, on June 30th, Miss Middleton and Miss Monte, on July 21, 1948. In addition Mrs. McLachlan and Miss Middleton received a month's salary $75.00 as Holiday Pay.\n\nMiss Middleton advises that there are \"no unpaid bills or indefinite claims on the school.\" We checked on this very carefully. It was noted during the audit that an old account of Prince Rupert Roofing Co., for $7.56, no details had been paid to Brown & Harvey, Solicitors.\n\nThe Cash Book, and vouchers for the period January 1, to August 31, 1948, which were mailed to Mr. F. E. Anfield, Indian Superintendent, Prince Rupert, B.C., for audit, were returned to Miss Eva Middleton, Fort Simpson, B.C., by parcel post on September 30, 1948.\n\nThe following statements were attached:\n\n1.

Only a few of these Indians have ever been to school. They are all most anxious to have their children educated, but there is no school provided where they can send their children to.\"\nIndian Office,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nTo Mr. Kendall Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 25th Oct., 1896, and beg to report for your information that there are 15 children of school age at Douglas, 4 at Skookum Chuck, 15 at Sam-a-hoquane, 165 at Pemberton Meadows, 10 at Sechelt, 32 at Homalco, 15 at Homalco and 15 at Alkhouse. Besides these there is the whole Skwacham Group having 92 children of school age among them. There are no schools in the neighborhood of any of these Reserves or all excepting those in the vicinity of Vancouver, but Indian children would not be admitted to the City Schools as the City is taxed to its full capacity to find accommodation for all the white pupils.\n\nBeing the migratory habits of the Indians, my school is very deficient of very little service, and I would most recommend that a new School be opened on any Reserve. I would recommend that three Industrial Schools be established in this Agency, one at Pemberton Meadows, having accommodation for all the children of school age at Douglas, Skookum Chuck, Sam-a-hoquane, and Pemberton Meadows. One at Sechelt having accommodation for all the children at Homalco, Alkhouse, Homalco, and Sechelt, and one at Homalco having accommodation for all the children at Homalco. Bishop Reeves is at present building a School just outside the Reserve at Mission, and I believe he intends to open for the Indians.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\nIndian Office,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nIndian. This is however accommodation only for 25 pupils but it is the intention of the Bishop to enlarge it as soon as funds are available. The Indians on the Reserve mentioned are very much dissatisfied at seeing their children grow up in ignorance. I believe ever since I came that the question is not brought up as one of their standing grievances. They claim the Government has broken faith with them. If schools for their children that they may be educated. Schools for their children by Lord Douglas, Governor Seymour, Lord Dufferin, and again about two years ago by Lord Aberdeen. Some time after Lord Aberdeen's visit Mr. Hay to Reed wrote to say that a sum would be placed in the Estimates to build a School at Squamish where but for some reason or other nothing came out of the matter. If the Department could spare provision for the education of say 150 of the most promising pupils of Reserve mentioned to start with, it would meet the pressing needs of the educational question. Say a School for 50 pupils at Pemberton Meadows including all the Douglas tribe, another at Sechelt for 50 pupils including Homalco, Malahat, Squamish, Sechelt, Kwakiutl, Squamish Mission for 50 pupils which would include all the Squamish tribe. This would I feel remove the ground for the discontent existing. I should strongly urge that every effort be made by the Department to place within the reach of every Indian child of school age in this Agency an opportunity to obtain a suitable education.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nFrank Dobbin\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 22nd ultimo having reference to Mr. Agent Devlin's Annual Report ending 30th June last past and requesting a report giving the number of children of school age with other information connected with schools in respect to the Indians belonging to the following Reserves namely: Douglas, Shookum Chuck, Santah Quam, Naramata, Kelkoose, Sechelt, Stiammon, and Pemberton Meadows.\n\nIn accordance with your request I beg herewith to submit for your information Mr. Devlin's report dated 12th instant which goes fully into the questions put forward in your letter under consideration. I would add that my views coincide with the agents in the matters mentioned by him and which are warranted by the facts in each case. I would therefore support his recommendations as far as they may be found feasible and expedient.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, 24th December, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY.\n\nIn revising the manuscript of the annual report of Mr. F. Devlin, Agent for the Fraser River Agency, B.C., I observed the statement occurring several times that there are no schools on certain reserves in that Agency. Extracts of these statements I placed on this file for reference.\n\nSuperintendent Vowell was informed of Agent Devlin's remarks and he was asked to report the number of children of school age on each of the reserves named, and to say whether he thought a school ought to be established in each case or whether there were white schools within a reasonable distance serves to which the Indian children might be sent.\n\nIt will be observed from Agent Devlin's letter, transmitted by Superintendent Vowell, that owing to the wandering habits of the Indians it is thought that day schools would be of little use, and it is recommended that three new industrial schools be established. As there are at present in this Agency two boarding schools and one industrial, namely, (R.C.)

Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nshould be reminded and that without delay, as from one end of the Agency to the other, the Indians are complaining on account of no schools for their children. As you are aware, members of the Indians of this Agency are Roman Catholics and cannot avail themselves of a Catholic Institute or All Hallows' School. That they have a tangible grievance, this being a question of their education should be remedied. Mr. Hayter Reed several years ago promised the Squamish Indians that a school would be provided for their children, even wrote to them that a sum would be placed in the Estimates that year for a school, but nothing came of it. On one occasion about four years ago while the Governor General was visiting Squamish Mission, a delegation of the Indians presented him with an address of welcome and requested him to use his influence to get a school for their children, pointing out to him that Governor General promised them schools for their children, but that that promise had not been kept.

He pointed out to me that they have a large number of boys and girls of school age (187) who are growing up in ignorance and without any opportunity of acquiring an education. The Chief asked me whose fault this was. He says it is not the fault of the Indians as they are our own and all anyone to send their children to school and give them an education. I promised Jack I would write you on the subject and would let him know result when I heard from you all the Indians visiting on the coast including myself, Alaskoos, Shannan, and Squamish as we a similar situation to Skokelk Indians as far as educational facilities are concerned, he was after the influence of Douglas Stewart Church Sam Adams and Pemberton Meadows not any of whom are at school, and no school for them to go to.

They consider that I am to blame in not pressing their claims on the Indian Department for a school. I assured them I had nothing whatever to do with it, that the Department was well aware they had no school, that I had myself drawn your attention to it (see my letter 23 November 1899) and that I had felt certain you had placed the matter before the Dept. for its consideration. They then proposed that I write and request the Department to draw from their money to their credit for rent of Slate Quarry a sufficient sum to cover expenses and to purchase transportation for two of their number who would proceed to Ottawa to press their claims on the Dept. for a school adding that they would not leave Ottawa until they got what they want for. I told them I could not recommend that any money to their credit for rent of Slate Quarry be used for this purpose. I promised them I would place their grievances before you and that they could not achieve the best possible would be done for them. They informed me they had been told by white men in Vancouver if they were Methodists they would have been provided with a school long since, and pointed to Blubber Bay where there were only a small number of Methodist Indians altogether yet they had a magnificent School.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSchool supported by the Government.

I have reason for believing that the Sechelt and neighboring Indians are earnest in their request for the advancement of their children and would therefore recommend that the application made on their behalf by the Agent be seriously considered in order that a boarding establishment for the large number of children of the district may be opened as soon as possible. This is the subject that was brought to the Department's notice under cover of my letter of the 27th of November 1899, and your communication to me of the 9th of December of the same year.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nThe case of the Indians of the Pemberton Meadows and contiguous bands may be in a measure met by the opening at no distant date of the proposed Lytton Industrial School. The Indians of the Sechelt and other near-by bands are particularly anxious for the education of their children and I should be pleased to see provision made to that end as soon as the Department can spare the money necessary to commence work in that locality.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, P. C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th December, 1901:\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nMr. Supt. Vowell forwards a letter from Agent Devlin who states that the Sechelt Indians complain that they are not provided with a school for their children and suggests the opening of a boarding school for the Indian bands in that neighborhood and another for the children of the natives of the Pemberton Meadows locality. Agent Devlin states that there are 42 children of school age resident at present on the Sechelt reserve, not one of whom can read, write or speak English. Mr. Supt. Vowell recommends the application made by the Agent on behalf of these Indians to the serious consideration of the Department in order that a boarding establishment for the large number of children in the district may be opened as soon as possible.\n\nThe principal reserve of the Sechelt Indians is situated on a reserve of that name, which I have shown on a rough sketch herewith. There are 234 Indians in the Band with a school population of 42 as above stated. They are all said to have comfortable dwellings and are industrious and well behaved. Their principal resources are fishing, hunting and hand-logging with a little gardening.\n\nIt seems to me that if a day school were opened on this reserve it would afford all the educational facilities required. These Indians are all Roman Catholics and are ministered to by Rev. Father\nChirouse, who has put up a fine church, which is shown in the Passion Play held last summer, photographs of which were sent you by Mr Agent Devlin. A very interesting account of this Passion Play is given in the Christmas number of the Metropolitan Magazine, a copy of which is in the Department.\n\nApplications for boarding schools in British Columbia are becoming very numerous but I fail to see why they are considered necessary there as the Coast Indians especially are all well-to-do and able to provide for their children, and to teach them while they are young the pursuits they will have to follow in order to obtain a livelihood in after life. Of course assistance should be given them in the matter of education but I would not advise its going any further than provision for day schools, as it would be quite possible to increase the existing accommodation at Industrial and Boarding schools, if necessary.\n\nThe want of a knowledge of English is not so great as might appear as all the Indians of this locality speak Chinook, which is understood by all residents on the Coast.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 20th January, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th November last submitting a communication from Mr Agent Devlin relative to a complaint made to him by the Sechelt Indians of the absence of educational facilities for their children, and asking for the establishment of a boarding school for the Indians of that neighborhood and one for the Indians of Pemberton Meadows.\n\nIn reply I am directed by the Superintendent General to inform you that no action can at present be taken in the direction indicated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nMarch 1, 1903\n\nTo the Honorable Mr. Sifton\nChief of the Indian Affairs in Ottawa\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI will make use of this little schooling I received at the school of the Father of St. Mary's mission, to let you know what we want; we have a great number of children who ought to go to school but they cannot go because we have no school. We have over seventy children who are old enough.\n\nNow we come to ask you to help us to have a school; if you will you can help us right away. First help us to build our school house where our children can be looked after as we have to go far away from our village to make our living; our children ought to be kept at a boarding school while we have to go to our work\u2014we are sometimes four and five months away.\n\nThen we would like that the government could give what is given elsewhere for boarding our children at school.\n\nWe have the promise of our bishop who has already done much for us to get sisters to look after our children at the school our children are growing up and they do not learn anything.\nit is too bad\u2014but what can we do if the government does not help us? Long ago the government who came here, Governors Douglas and Seymour told the Indians of this country to be quiet and not make trouble because their land was taken away. They gave their word coming from the queen that the Indians would be well treated, that they would get tools, seed, medicine and doctors' help and especially school in exchange for their land. Now, we have a right to a school, if the government does not wish to give us a school then give us back our land and we will get our school. We write you this now because we know that you as the principle chief of the Indian Department in the government of Canada, can help us\u2014we have good hope in you and we expect that you will help us now; we know that the King has a governor in Ottawa but we will not write to him now, we will wait help from you first.\n\nAnother Governor from Ottawa who came here once, Governor Dufferin said that the Indians of British Columbia have not been given their right yet, they never got anything for their land\u2014that is true today. Now we think that the government ought to something for us right away, we hear that...\nThe Methodist School of Chilliwack gets ten thousand dollars every year, now we know there are very few Methodist among the Indians there, why is that. Here we are so many Catholic Indians, why should we have no school\u2014the School at St Mary Mission cannot take our children, the school is too poor. The same at Squamish mission\u2014 you would see how we like to have a school, you would help us at once\u2014now we say you will help us quick.\n\nChief Julius\nSekelte tribe\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 12th March, 1903.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nChief Julius of the Sechelt Band, B.C., writes under date of the 1st inst., applying for the establishment of a boarding-school on the Reserve. A similar application was received in November, 1891, from Mr. Agent Devlin through Superintendent Vowell, and I consider that the memorandum I then prepared covers the ground. The Minister decided that no action was then necessary.\n\nThere are two Roman Catholic Boarding-schools to which their children could be sent provided there was room for them, and, rather than open another boarding-school, I think it would be better to provide for more pupils at these boarding-schools if it was deemed necessary to secure boarding-school accommodation for some of the Sechelt children. As they are wholly without educational facilities, I think that a day-school might be allowed them.\n\nMy previous memorandum is turned out on this file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 387-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 14th March, 1903.\n\nChief:-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., applying for the establishment of a boarding-school on the Sechelt Reserve, and in reply I beg to inform you that no action can be taken in this direction at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They also ask for authority to expend the sum of $100.00, in the purchase of furniture for the same institution.\n\nA detailed list of the furniture required cannot be given at present as the Sisters who are to have charge of the School have not yet arrived here, and as they are the best judges of suitable furnishings it is thought best to leave the selecting in their hands. If authority is given for these purchases the whole amount is to be deducted from funds deposited to their credit with the Department. As these Indians are making great efforts to open their School as soon as possible, and are unable themselves to purchase the furniture and drain pipe I would recommend their application to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.M. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Sect.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nAt a meeting of the male members of the Sechelt Band of Indians held at Sechelt this 17th day of September 1903, it was moved by Chief Jules and seconded by Chief George; that we the undersigned, being a majority of the male members of the Sechelt Band of Indians, of the full age of twenty-one years, do hereby most respectfully ask the Indian Department to purchase for us two hundred and twenty-five feet of six inch drain pipe, and also to expend the sum of $100.00 in the purchase of furniture for our School, the drain pipe to be used in connection with the sewer system for the same institution. The whole amount to be deducted from funds deposited to our credit with the Department.\n\nOur School is now nearing completion, and as we have devoted all our energies during the past six months in endeavoring to earn money with which to pay the building contractors, we are consequently unable to purchase the necessary furniture ourselves\u2014\n\nChief Jules his + mark\nChief George his + mark\nAlex his + mark\nPercy his + mark\nBeg August his + mark\nCapt Joe his + mark\nBilly Johnson his + mark\nJohn Casper his + mark\nLager his + mark\nChief Paul his + mark\nJohn Hall his + mark\nAlexis his + mark\nPeter his + mark\nPoor August his + mark\nGabriel his + mark\nCapt August his + mark\nOld August his + mark\nCapt Dan his + mark\nAlexander his + mark\nAntone his + mark\nLittle Joe his + mark\nAlfonso his + mark\nPatrick his + mark\nJohn his + mark\nDanny his + mark\nBasil his + mark\nJohnny Wilson his + mark\nFrancis Billy his + mark\nAmos his + mark\nCapt William his + mark\nAugustine his + mark\nCapt Charlie his + mark\nFrank his + mark\nGeorge his + mark\nJackson his + mark\nCapt George his + mark\nOld Paul his + mark\nLewis his + mark\nPaul his + mark\nTimothy his + mark\nJohn Baptist his + mark\nDanny his + mark\nJack Leader his + mark\n\nWitnesses:\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, 27th October, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo forwarding an application from the Scheldt Indians for a grant of $3.75 for the purchase of drain pipe in connection with the new school building proposed to be erected on their reserve; and in reply I beg to say that this expenditure may be incurred.\n\nThe question of providing furnishings for the school will be considered when the detailed statement referred to is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nOTTAWA, 10th February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn further reference to the application of the Sechelt Band of Indians for permission to expend the sum of $1,000.00 from their funds in the purchase of furnishings for their new school building, I beg to say that a detailed list of the articles required has been forwarded by Mr Agent McDonald to the Department through Mr Supt. Vowell amounting to $1016.36.\n\nA resolution was passed by a majority of the male members of the Band for the expenditure of $1000.00 for this purpose on the 19th Sept. last and is turned out herewith. These Indians have a sufficient amount to their credit to meet this outlay and they have put up a school building themselves at a cost of about $7000.00. The Department was not consulted on this subject, although applications had previously been received for the establishment of a boarding school on that reserve, which were endorsed by Mr Devlin, the late Agent and Mr Vowell.\n\nThe last time this matter was before the Minister was in December 1901, when he decided that no action could be taken and Mr Vowell was so informed. Two communications were subsequently received from the Chief demanding the establishment of a boarding school, but he was informed that the Department could not accede to his request. The Indians, as I said...\nbefore, have built the school, which is to be placed in charge of the Roman Catholic Sisters, and the expenditure they now wish to make out of their funds will equip it for 50 pupils.\n\nThe Department has never recognized this school in any way and no provision has been made for its maintenance. It is now completed, however, and will be ready for occupation when furnished and the Department will no doubt be expected to give it the usual support granted to boarding schools. It would appear that whoever is at the back of this movement is desirous of forcing the hand of the Department into recognizing this school. The Band has the requisite funds to its credit and claims the right to spend it in equipment. If the Department authorizes this outlay, it will be tantamount to recognizing the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 837-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nMoney in the Sechelt account is available for expenditure on furnishings for their school and as the whole amount is interest, it will not be necessary to obtain an Order-in-Council. I think the funds might properly be used for this purpose. No application from any source has been received asking for a grant in support of this school and I do not observe any information as to how the maintenance of the school is to be carried on. Perhaps Mr. Vowell might enlighten us upon this point and when writing him it might be stated that the Department is not disposed to assume the expenses maintaining the Institution.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 22nd February, 1904.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 24th December last, relative to the application of the Seeholt Indians for permission to expend the sum of $1000.00 from the trust funds at their credit for the purpose of purchasing furnishings for their new school building, I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to sanction the purchase of the furnishings set forth in the detailed list which accompanied your letter above referred to.\n\nNow that this school is built and provision made for its equipment the Department would like to know how it is proposed to maintain it as no provision has been made for this purpose, nor has any application ever been made, and the Department is not disposed to assume any liability in connection with the maintenance or management of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.

December 35 1903,\nTo the Honorable Clifford Sifton, M.P.\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nWe, the undersigned chiefs and Indians of the Sechelt tribe come to lay before you our needs in the matter of the education of our children and to beg you to grant our requests.\n\nWe have often before asked of the Government through our agent that we should be given a school for we see our children growing up around us without any learning. Our children don't know how to speak or write the English language.\n\nLast Spring we wrote directly to yourself; but so far we have had only refusals.\n\nThis is very hard to bear, for we think of all the things we have had to lose since the white men came and we were forced to give up all but a few small strips of our lands.\n\nThe Governors sent out by the Queen always promised that we would have some return for what we gave up, that we would be helped in many ways. We were told that we would have schools; but up to now the promises have been vain. Yet we believe that we have a good right to get help from the Government.\n\nTo show the Government that we mean what we say we all combined last spring to get enough from our labor to have a school house put up.\n\nWe\nWe were lucky enough to get a merchant from here, Mr. Whittaker, to take the logs we would cut and in exchange he built the school house we wanted.\n\nWe don't know how we shall get through if the government does not help us at once. We need help to complete and furnish the building and we need a grant for boarding our children once at school.\n\nThere will be room for fifty children boys and girls. We must have a school wherein our children can be boarded, for, as we have to go pretty far away from our village to make our living, our children must be kept at school while we are away.\n\nAs we are all Catholics we love our religion and we wish to have our children trained under Catholic sisters. Our Bishop has gone to great trouble to secure good teachers for us and they are now waiting for the school to be finished with your help.\n\nWe pray and hope that you, who understand our needs will hear us and grant our request at once. You may be sure that we will be thankful and that we shall make a good use of what shall be given us to maintain our school.\n\nWe remain very humbly\n\nYour wards of the Sachelt tribe.\n\n(signed)\n\nChief Julius his x mark\nGeorge his x mark\nPaul his x mark\nJohnny his x mark\nThomas his x mark\nAntoine his x mark\nAntony his x mark\nAlphonse his x mark\nPierre his x mark\nIgnace his x mark\nGabriel his x mark\nPaul his x mark\nEugene his x mark\n\nGaspar his x mark\nBarile his x mark\nFran\u00e7ois his x mark\nPierre his x mark\nJean Baptiste his x mark\nNoel his x mark\nJoseph his x mark\nAugustine his x mark\nPierre Auguste his x mark\nJos.

They ask that the Department will kindly assist them to the extent of $2500.00 in paying for the building as well as the usual annual allowance for boarding schools with fifty pupils.\n\nIf the Department can see its way clear to granting their request it will be a great encouragement to them.\n\nI may add that the work on the School building so far has been done in a workmanlike and satisfactory manner, and the material used has all been of the best quality.\n\nHave the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo authorizing an expenditure of $1000.00 from the trust funds at the credit of the Sechelt band of Indians for the purpose of purchasing furnishings for their new school building, I have the honor to enclose herewith for the information of the Department a letter, dated the 16th instant, No. 533/2, today received from Mr. Agent McDonald, Fraser Agency, covering a statement of the actual expenditure on the structure up to and including the date of rendering the same - the 29th of last month. The Agent's letter of the 31st of December last, No. 225/2, and enclosures, referred to was not at the time forwarded to the Department in consequence of its lack of details which are now supplied by letter of recent date. The Agent remarks in his communication of the 16th instant that he was unable to obtain an account of the expenditure on the building until his recent visit to Sechelt, hence the lapse of time between the date of his first letter (Dec. 31st last) and the one received this morning. A copy of the plan of the building is also being forwarded to the Department under cover of this letter.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\n\nDeputy Supt.

They, therefore, ask that the Department assist them to the extent of $2500.00 in paying for the building as well as the usual annual per capita allowance for fifty pupils and, if possible, I would strongly recommend that their request be complied with as I consider they are in every way deserving of the assistance asked.\n\nI may add that the Indians intend to get together another boom of timber for sale and can be depended upon to exert themselves in every reasonable direction towards extinguishing the debt incurred by reason of the construction of the building.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

Plans and specifications of the building are also forwarded, together with a statement of the actual expenditure incurred so far. A letter from the local Agent covering these documents is also enclosed from which you will see that the total cost of the building, when completed, will amount to $8,438.95, of which the Indians have already paid $2,798.05. They were allowed to spend $1,000.00 from their capital for furnishing and they claim to be able to make up the balance if they receive the assistance asked for.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to my memorandum of the 10th ultimo, in which I pointed out that whoever was promoting this enterprise would be sure to look to the Department for help to carry it out. The school has been built without consulting the Department which advised the chief of the band in April last, that it was not prepared to establish a school there at present. Notwithstanding this notice they have gone on and incurred liabilities and now look to the Department to help them out of the\nI think it is about time some action should be taken, once and for all, to convince the churches that are forcing the Department's hand, that it will not be held up for money to cover unauthorized expenditure.\n\nThe Department has the right to decide where schools are to be established and of what class, and it is not for priest or parson to dictate on this point.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 30th March, 1904:\n\nA.W.

Indian Dept.)\n\nREAD THE NOTICE AND AGREEMENT AT THE TOP\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.,\n\nMarch 25, 1904,\n\nTo the Honorable CLIFFORD SIFTON,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Can.,\n\nHONORABLE SIR,\n\nSome time ago the Indians of the Sechelt tribe, who live about fifty miles up the coast, north of Vancouver city, sent you a petition to the effect that you would give them an annual grant for a Boarding School as well as a grant to help them to finish the school building which they have themselves erected on their reserve.\n\nIn this petition they have told you what they have done towards the long deferred realization of a wish to have a school on their reserve.\n\nNow they have requested me to assist them in obtaining what they have asked for in their petition.\n\nEven should they not have asked me to plead with them I feel prompted to do all I can for them for the reason that I, as their bishop, take a hearty interest in their progress, and because I am convinced that the Boarding School, for which they have a grant, will be of great benefit to them.\n\nNow these Indians deserve that the Government should not defer any longer to grant them what they ask.\n\nApart from their constant docility and submission to the laws of the country and their admirable efforts to become virtuous citizens of this Dominion, for which the Department should have regard, these Indians have shown in a most practical manner that their wish to improve by education is no mere pretense. They have set with a will to erect a school building for which they have partly paid by their industry.\n\nNo better encouragement could be given by the Government to these people than by coming to their assistance at once and enabling them to finish their undertaking. You, Honorable Sir, who have their advancement so much at heart, can appreciate their energy and perseverance in the work which they have done so far, because these qualities are precisely those which need most to be developed in the natives.\nFor my part I have, from the beginning of their undertaking, promised to do my share to help them. I have secured a good staff of Sisters who are prepared to teach the school branches and the various industries. I shall also give every other assistance that I am able to give to place the School on a good footing, as soon as the Government shall have given the needed cooperation for the completion of the enterprise.\n\nI trust, therefore, that, for the reasons given above and for others which are clear to you, who have such a wide experience with the Indians, you will grant the requests contained in the petition of the Sechelt Indians.\n\nBoth Mr. Vowell, the Superintendent for Bri. Col. and Mr. Mac Donald, the Agent for New Westminster District, have visited the new premises erected at Sechelt. They find that the building will comfortably accommodate the number of children for which a per capita grant is asked, namely fifty.\n\nMr. Vowell must have forwarded to the Department the plans and specifications of the school building, towards the finishing of which the Government ought to allow a grant of at least 2500 Dollars, which sum represents about one fourth of the whole cost.\n\nAs on previous occasions, when I had the opportunity to lay before you the needs of our Indians, I found you ready to support our efforts towards their advancement, I hope to have the satisfaction to learn that in this case you shall grant the requests of your petitioners, in whose behalf I have the honor to address you today, and that the grants asked for will be placed on the list of estimates which shall be voted during the present session of Parliament.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable and dear Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nRoman Oath, Bishop of New Westminster.\nIndian Office Victoria B.C.\n\nL-4.

Vowell writes under date of the 2nd instant stating that Agent McDonald had authorized the purchase of beds, desks and chairs for the Sechelt boarding school, which by the detailed list of furnishings sent the Dept. on the 24th Dec. last would amount to $601.90 out of the $1000.00 the Indians wish to take from their funds for the purchase of furnishings for this school, and adds that the balance of the furnishings have not yet been authorized and that the Agent will await further instructions in connection therewith.\n\nOn the 25th ultimo, His Lordship the Bishop of New Westminster wrote to the Superintendent General applying for a grant of $2,500.00 to assist in paying for the building of this school on which the Indians have already expended $2,798.06 of their own money, and also for a per capita grant of $50.00 for each of 50 pupils. The Bishop urges the claim of these Indians for the recognition of their school, which application is also endorsed by Agent McDonald and Supt. Vowell in a communication received from the Victoria office.\n\nThis school was undertaken without consulting the Department and I beg to refer you to my memo. of 25th ultimo turned out on this file.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI beg to say that it appears to me necessary to come to a definite decision in regard to the manner in which the Department will deal with the Sechelt Boarding School, in the Fraser River Agency. If it is decided to afford assistance to the Institution provision for the same will have to be made in the Supplementary Estimates. The case is as follows:\n\nIn 1899 the Sechelt Indians applied to the Department for educational facilities for their children. They were informed that the Department could not then accede to their request. They renewed their application from time to time, but the Department did not consider it advisable to establish a school. Finally, without authority from the Department they undertook the erection of a school building. In March last Mr Agent McDonald submitted, through Supt. Vowell, accounts showing that $6306.95 had been expended on the building and stated that the estimated cost of completing the building was $8428.95, of which the Indians have already paid $2798.05. It appears that the Indians proposed defraying the cost of erection by the sale of logs but after they had made their arrangements and the work had begun, the price of logs dropped nearly 50%. They now find themselves unable to complete the building without assistance. Owing to the logs having deteriorated in price they attribute their inability to complete the building themselves and they now ask the Department to assist them to the extent of $2,500.00 in paying for the structure. While the building was in course of construction the Department was asked to pay $270.00 from Band funds of the Sechelt Indians towards the purchase of galvanized iron water pipe and also to authorize an expenditure of $93.75 for a drain pipe in connection with the building. The necessary authority was granted in both cases. Authority was also asked for the expenditure.\nexpenditure of $1,000.00 from Band funds for furnishings for the school building. Outlay for this purpose up to $601.90 was allowed. The Agent has been told that he must await further instructions before incurring expenditure for this purpose up to $1,000.00.\n\nThe building has accommodation for 50 pupils and the Department is now asked in addition to the above to furnish a per capita grant of $60.00 for each of 50 pupils.\n\nI think the Indians are entitled to sympathy for the position in which they find themselves. The efforts which they have made to provide themselves with a boarding school are laudable, but they have undertaken more than they could possibly carry out. I am convinced that they must have been advised towards this course probably by the resident Priest so that no matter how great sympathy be extended to them, the position resolves itself into this: the hand of the Department has been forced by the ecclesiastical authorities certainly should not be permitted. The educational policy of the Department and the right to establish or dis-continue schools must reside with the Department, and the most dangerous precedent which we could establish is the present that we should finally become responsible for the boarding school which we time and again refused to sanction.\n\nAccountant-\n\nOTTAWA, May 10th\u2014\u2014\u20141904.,\nDept. of I.A.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn further reference to the new boarding school built on the Sechelt reserve, I beg to say that the estimated cost of this building was placed at $8,438.95 towards the erection of which the Indians had contributed $2,798.05. This contribution was personally made by individual Indians, and out of the Band funds $1,347.35 was contributed for water supply drainage, and furnishings.\n\nThe balance of the funds remaining to the credit of this Band at present amounts to only about $300.00 and if the building has been completed according to the estimate, there would be about $5,500.00 required.\n\nIn March last these Indians petitioned the Department for a grant of $2,500.00 to assist them in paying for the building, and also the usual per capita grant for 50 pupils. No grant has been provided for this school and if it is in operation, the Department is not aware of the fact, as it has had no returns.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 837-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Sechelt Indians, B.C., have expended nearly the whole of the funds at their credit in the construction of this school building. There is no special provision made in the estimates for the current year for any further expenditure and the Vote could not bear it. If it is proposed to give assistance from Parliamentary appropriation it will be necessary to place a sum in the estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Accountant.\n\nOttawa, 30th November, 1904.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 19th January, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr School Inspector Green has reported on the Sechelt boarding school, which was opened in July last and has an enrollment of 46 pupils. He reports very favorably on the school, which is conducted by the Roman Catholics. The building was put up at a cost of nearly $10,000 towards which the Indians have paid over $3000.00; the balance is still due. As the school is not receiving any per capita grant at present, and is being carried on on credit, a large deficit will be piled up before they can receive any Government aid. Provision is made in the estimates for next fiscal year for 50 pupils at $60 per capita and $2500.00 towards the building. This will not be available until the 1st July next.\n\nThe school was built without obtaining the authority of or consulting the Department and starts with a debit balance in the neighborhood of $5000.00, even allowing for the $2500.00 which is not yet available. Before any grant, either for maintenance or buildings, is paid over to this school, a clear understanding should be arrived at with the Church that the Department, not being a party to this deficit, is in no way responsible or liable. It would be better to settle this matter definitely before any money changes hands.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.\n\nDecember 31st, 1904.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen at Seshelt, on the 27th instant in company with Mr. Green, I inspected the Seshelt Boarding School which was opened about six months ago. The school building is an excellent one costing in the neighbourhood of $10,000.00 and has accommodation for fifty pupils. There are now 46 pupils on the roll, all belonging to the Seshelt band. It is feared that this school will have to be closed unless the assistance asked from the Department is granted. There is a debt of about $7,000.00 on the building and the payment of this large sum together with the cost of maintenance is more than the Indians can accomplish and at the same time support their families. Since the opening of this Institution considerable liabilities have been incurred for maintenance in addition to what the Indians were able to give; and as there are no funds to meet these obligations, it will be impossible for them to continue buying on credit.\n\n(signed) R.C. McDonald,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, March 3rd\u2014\u20141905.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 31st. of December dealing with the Sechelt Boarding School, I have to inform you that the Department has included in the main estimates an item of $8,500 to assist in erecting the school and a grant of $3,000 for 50 pupils at $60 each. These sums will probably become available on the 1st. July, but the Department cannot be responsible for any debts incurred by the Institution before that date and cannot be expected to pay a deficit at any time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\nDeputy Sup't.

Had this catastrophe, caused by the fire, not occurred the Indians would have been able to clear the debt off the school. But the complete loss by fire of said church with no insurance whatever has completely paralyzed the poor people. They would take heart if they could soon turn their efforts towards rebuilding what they have lost.\nYou know how important the church was for them. It was their pride, their consolation. They never gathered in their church but they came forth better men and more determined to improve. Truly, it is to their church that we must principally attribute the good that was done amongst them.\n\nWell, it is only by the rebuilding of that church in their village that the good work which has been accomplished in the past will be preserved and increased.\n\nThe Government cannot be indifferent to the spiritual welfare of its wards; may it be just to say that the Canadian government aims to make the Indians good and superintendents to carry out its intentions.\n\nHere then is an occasion to do so by lessening the burden weighing on the poor people on account of their heavy debt on the school building. Let the Government grant at least $2000 towards the school debt and the Indians will take heart again. They will renew their efforts to pay off the balance that would still remain, and then turn their energies toward the rebuilding of their church.\n\nI trust that you will use your influence to induce the Department to receive favorably the petition for help which the Indians have already forwarded to the Honorable Superintendent General.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.

This building cost us over $10,000.\nWe had started to pay this sum by putting our work together and we succeeded to raise $3000 before the Government granted us $2500 in 1905.\n\nThe help which the Government gave us pleased and encouraged us very much. We were determined to continue paying off the debt, which amounts still to $5000; when a fire completely destroyed our beautiful church. We had no insurance. All was lost.\n\nThis misfortune made us all downhearted; we feel as though we have no strength left. We cannot do without a church. Without a church we cannot keep together and practice our duties as Christians and citizens.\n\nWe know that the Government, like a good father, is anxious that we should keep on doing what is right. It is for this reason that we now ask the Government to help us pay what we still owe on our school so that we soon be able to turn our efforts to the rebuilding of our church.\n\nWe ask our friend, the Honorable Mr. Sloan, to present this petition to you.

McLean\nSecretary.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Sloan, M.P., forwards a letter from Bishop Dotenwill, with a petition from the Sechelt Indians asking the Department to grant $2,000 to help them to pay off the indebtedness on their new boarding school.\n\nTheir reason for applying for this assistance is that their church was totally destroyed by fire and was uninsured. The Department contributed $2,500 towards the erection of the Sechelt boarding school, but it cost over $10,000 and there a debt of some $5,000 still remaining on the building. The Indians will not be able to rebuild their church and pay off this debt, and Bishop Dotenwill states that if they are left without a church they will be very much discouraged and likely to lose the excellent reputation they now have for industry, temperance and morality.\n\nThe petition is indorsed by Mr. Sloan, and our Superintendent and Agent have also reported in favour of assistance being given to them. Of course, the Department cannot contribute towards the rebuilding of their church, but if they could start free of debt they would undertake to build it themselves, and it is for this purpose that they ask assistance.\nOttawa, September 4, 1906.\n\nBishop Dontenwill called this morning and referred to the request of the Sechelt Indians for a grant of $2,000.00 to help them to pay off the indebtedness of a new boarding school.\n\nThe Bishop strongly urged that the Department make provision for this grant in the estimates to be submitted to Parliament at the coming Session.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, June 23, 1907.\n\nSirs\u2014\n\nI beg to inform you that the supplementary estimates for the current year contain an item of $3,500.00 to provide an additional grant for building the Sechelt Boarding School and the improvement of the water supply there.\n\nOf this amount $2000.00 is for the purpose of paying off the indebtedness on the building and $500.00 for the water supply.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

You should state what bands of Indians are resident in the vicinity of the school, and whether a doctor resides in the locality. If it should be decided to appoint a medical man what salary do you consider he should be paid, and what do you consider should be the extent of his duties? Be good enough to give the matter early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt,\nVictoria, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nAugust 10, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st No. 196, K.S., stating that the principal of Sechelt Boarding School has asked the Department to appoint a Doctor to visit the school from time to time, or at least in cases of serious illness, and requesting a report on the subject.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there are no other Indians in the vicinity of Sechelt School except the Sechelt Band (population 240), whose village is situated on the same reserve as the school. These Indians, when sick, usually consult Dr. Brydon-Jack at Vancouver, which is about forty miles from the Reserve, and the nearest place for them to get medical treatment, and the Doctor is obliged from time to time to send quite a number of them to the hospital for proper care and treatment.\n\nIf a Doctor were appointed to visit the pupils of the school and the destitute Indians of the band who might require medical treatment, say twice a month, it would not be necessary to send so many cases to the hospital, in fact, in my opinion, only in cases when operations were to be performed, would it be necessary to send patients from that locality to the hospital.\n\nI discussed this matter with Dr. Brydon-Jack, the medical officer of the Department at Vancouver, and he would be\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent.\nbe willing to make two trips a month to Sechelt to attend the pupils of the School and the destitute members of the band who might require his services, for the sum of $25.00 a trip, and if any extra trips should be necessary in extreme cases, they would be charged for at the same rate.\n\nThere is a daily boat now between Vancouver and Sechelt, but as she only stays long enough at the latter place for passengers to get off, the doctor would be obliged to remain until the following day, and in view of the fact that it would take him two days to make the trip, and his travelling expenses would be $5.00 or $6.00, I consider $25.00 a trip a very reasonable charge.\n\nThis arrangement would be satisfactory to the Principal of the school, as well as to the Indians of the band, and I recommend same to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo informing this office that Sister Therastine, Principal of the Sechelt Boarding School asked the Department to appoint a doctor to visit the school from time to time, or at least in cases of serious illness, I have the honor to enclose herewith for the information of the Department a report in the premises, dated the 10th instant, No. 80/II, from Mr. Agent McDonald, of the Fraser Agency recommending that Dr. Brydon-Jack, the medical officer of the Department at Vancouver, B.C., be engaged to make two trips a month to the institution for the sum of $25.00 a trip, and in the event of extra trips being required the charge to be at the same rate.\n\nIn view of the circumstances mentioned by the Agent the suggested arrangement seems at the present time the best that can be thought of, except it be that in view of the fact of there being now a daily boat between Vancouver and Sechelt it might be advisable to have the doctor sent to Sechelt only when needed, when word of necessity of his visit could be sent him by the management.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nof the institution, he to proceed to the school by the return of the steamer. It will be noted from the Agent's letter that the distance to Sechelt from Vancouver is about forty miles.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

It will of course be necessary for the Doctor to make arrangements in every case before leaving Vancouver to have another medical practitioner attend should necessity arise to the Indians already under his (Dr. Bryden-Jack's) care, and for the attendance on whom he is now paid a salary of $1800.00.\n\nIf Dr. Bryden-Jack is willing to undertake enter into the above arrangement, you should at once advise the Department, and you should also write Sister Thereseine, Principal of the Sechelt Boarding School, informing her of the arrangements made. Both she and the Indian Agent should be told that Dr. Bryden-Jack should not be requested to visit the School unless in cases of absolute necessity, as the Department does not propose to have him go to the Institution in most cases of trifling illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McIlwraith,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVancouver, B.C., September 19th, 1908\n\nR.C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your letter in regard to the making of visits to Sechelt, at the time when Dr. Monro spoke to you I understand that he imagined that for $25.00 a visit we would make two visits each month, and that the time to make such visits would be largely left to our own discretion. In your last letter regarding the appointment you speak of making the visits when requested to do so by the Superintendent of the Indian Schools. I would point out that this might be somewhat awkward at times, as a call might come when we were particularly busy in Vancouver and when arrangements had been made at the hospital for an operation on an Indian or some other person. Again the weather conditions up the coast are not always favorable in the winter time, and boats are sometimes delayed for even to a couple of days on their way to and fro from Sechelt on account of the weather conditions.\n\nThe actual cost incurred, as I understand them, are as follows:\n\n- Each way, to and from Sechelt, $1.25; hotel charges $2.50 per day;\n- The trip takes at least two days, one day going and one day returning practically. As the boat service is not all that could be desired perhaps one would have to pay for an extra meal on the boat if the boat happened to be delayed. This means an actual outlay of cash for us of at least\n$7.50 to $10.00, besides providing fees for a substitute while away for the two days, and you must take into account the loss of actual practise which would necessarily occur while I was away from home for these two days, so you see that the fee of $25.00 when expenses are taken out of it may leave only a small sum of perhaps $10.00 for two days work, or perhaps it might even cost more than the $25.00 in the way of fees and extra assistance during that time. However if you like to make it $25.00 and expenses, or a round sum of $35.00 for each visit to and fro which would allow $10.00 for expenses, I think that we might overcome the difficulties and make arrangements for a substitute to attend to any Indians calling at the office while I was away.\n\nI may state that the Indians themselves are evidently commencing now to appreciate our services and apparently feel a great deal more confidence in us than what they did a few years ago, and we feel that they are entitled to our best services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nSeptember 22nd, 1908.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo,\nNo. 612, K. S., in regard to the proposed visits of Dr.\nBrydone-Jack to Sechelt Boarding School, I have the honor\nto enclose herewith a letter, in duplicate, dated the 18th\ninstant, received from the Doctor on the subject, from\nwhich it will be seen that under the new arrangements pro-\nposed by the Department, he asks that $25.00 a trip be paid\nhim.\n\nTaking into consideration the possibility that he\nmight be called upon to make these trips when it would be\ninconvenient for him to do so, and occupy two days of his\ntime, it would seem that the amount asked is reasonable.\n\nIf the Department agrees to his terms, I would\nsuggest that the destitute members of the Sechelt band\nshould be included with the pupils of the school, if they\nshould require medical treatment when he visits the reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo in regard to the proposal to have Dr. W. D. Brydone-Jack visit the Sechelt Indian Boarding School, Fraser Agency, B.C., I have the honor to enclose herewith, for the information and consideration of the Department, a further communication, of the 22nd instant, No. 208/II, received from Mr. Agent McDonald, with letter to him of the 19th instant from Dr. Brydone-Jack. It will be perceived that the doctor asks that $25.00 per trip and expenses be paid him or a round sum of $35.00 for each visit. As regards one item of the expense to which the doctor refers - that of board and lodging while at Sechelt - it may be that the management of the Sechelt Indian Boarding school could provide gratis the necessary accommodation seeing that the doctor's visits are made in its interest. Again, I think it would be well if the doctor undertook the work for, say, a period of six months at the rate specified by the Department and it might be found\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\nfound that even less than an average of two trips per month would be necessary. If it were then seen that the estimated number of trips were much in excess of that named the Department could then take into consideration the question of the advisability of its paying the doctor at the rate of $25.00 per trip and expenses or a round sum of $35.00 - provided the institution be not in a position to accommodate him with board and lodging during his stay at Sechelt. The latter arrangement would, of course, include, as the Agent suggests, attendance and medicine for the sick, destitute members of the Sechelt band.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

The arrangements as outlined in letter to you of the 24th August should be given a six months trial. It can be then decided whether the other arrangement indicated by you can be entered upon, in which latter case the doctor would be expected to attend not only pupils of the school but the sick destitute members of the Seehelt Band.\n\nKindly advise the doctor of the Department's attitude in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.W.

S., regarding Dr. Brydone-Jack's report on his recent visit to the Sechelt school and village.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it appears to me the Doctor has given expression to very extreme views in connection with existing conditions amongst the Sechelt Indians, apparently for the purpose of impressing upon the Department his views in regard to establishing a hospital or hospitals for the treatment of Indians.\n\nI consider that the sanitary conditions and surroundings of the Indians of this agency, including those of Sechelt, compare very favorably with those of white people in similar circumstances, and, in my opinion, some people expect too much of the Indians in this and many other respects.\n\nIt is quite true that the Indians in general object to dieting, and they will give solid food to the sick when it should not be given, and this practice, I am inclined to think, causes many deaths, especially amongst the children. Their chief objection to being placed in a hospital is because they cannot get plenty of food at all times.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThere are a good many deaths in the Sechelt village every year, mostly children, and I am quite sure that a good many are caused by other diseases than tuberculosis. The only cases of tuberculosis I am aware of at the present time at Sechelt are Chief Johnny, who has been sick for about two years, and Mrs. John Baptist, who has been sick for several months. There is also a little boy, Cassimere, who has been a pupil in the school, and recently a patient in St. Paul's Hospital, but now at home. This boy is now said to have tuberculosis, although, by referring to Dr. Brydone-Jack's letter of the 27th ultimo, which was attached to voucher in favor of St. Paul's Hospital, for treatment of this patient (Cassimere), and forwarded from this office March 30th, it will be noticed that the Doctor stated then that, if this boy had been left in the Hospital, he thinks he could have cured him. It does seem rather strange to me that, if this boy had such a good chance of recovery if left in the Hospital, he should now be in the last stages of consumption, in fact his death is hourly expected. I have always had the impression that consumption is rather a lingering illness; however, I am not a doctor.\n\nIn regard to the Doctor's statement that \"there are very few families there but have had some time recently a death in the family from tuberculosis.\" I may say that I am not aware that the Doctor has made more than two visits to Sechelt during the past five or six years, and could not, therefore, have seen many of those who died during that time; and, consequently, this part of his report\nreport would appear to be based on hearsay.\n\nFrom the records in this office it is noticed that the population of Sechelt in 1900 was 226, in 1901 - 234, 1902 - 236, 1903 - 236, 1904 - 238, 1905 - 239, 1906 - 230, 1907 - 235, 1908 - 242, 1909 - 244.\n\nThe complete isolation of a sick person in a family is a very difficult matter even amongst white people who are considered highly civilized and educated; and it seems to have taken a long time to educate the doctors themselves as to the contagious nature of tuberculosis.\n\nIn visiting Indians suffering from any ailment, especially consumption, it is a rare thing not to find by the bedside a dish of some kind, chiefly a tin can or cup, in which they expectorate instead of on the floor.\n\nIt is, unfortunately, too true that there are many cases of tuberculosis amongst the Indians, and if it is of the contagious nature now claimed by eminent physicians, steps should be taken to properly isolate such cases as appear from time to time amongst the various bands, not only for the benefit of the Indians, but also for the protection of whites with whom they come in contact in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThis complete isolation can, in my opinion, only be accomplished by quarantining those affected, as is done in the case of other infectious diseases, or removing them to some hospital or place remote from the reserves, where they cannot be taken home by parents or relatives.\n\nI fear that Dr. Brydone-Jack's hospital scheme on the reserves would accomplish very little more than has been\nbeen done in the past by those who have been instructing and advising them, as the influence a nurse could have on the Indians would be a very slow process if the Indians were allowed to enter and leave such an institution as they wish, and would not, I think, fulfill the prompt action recommended by the Doctor.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nApril 12th, 1908.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith voucher in triplicate in favor of Dr. Brydone-Jack, for the sum of $25.00 for 1 visit to Sechelt School; also letter from the Doctor, dated the 7th instant, in regard to a request from the principal of the school for him to visit the pupils; also his report, dated the 8th instant, in connection with his visit to the school, and the other Indians of Sechelt Band.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.

A letter of the 7th inst. addressed to Mr. Agent McDonald will be found attached to the Agent's letter as well as a letter of the 8th inst addressed to Mr. McDonald by Dr. Brydone-Jack dealing with the matter, the need of proper medical care of the Indians of the Sechelt village. It may be added that Mr. McDonald in forwarding to this office this correspondence made no comment nor recommendation in regard thereto. He was, as is the practice, asked to report fully on the Doctor's statements, which he has since done in letter of 20th inst., No. 305/12 and I may add that I agree with the tenor of Mr. McDonald's letter which seems reasonable throughout.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\nR. C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminister, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Saturday, April 3rd, at the request of the Sister in Charge, I visited the school at Sechelt. There had been quite a few cases of tuberculosis in the village recently and some deaths, and there was one child in the school whom they were in doubt about in that respect, and there was also a boy suffering from a rash which they were doubtful about and which upon examination, turned out to be no more serious than acne.\n\nEnclosed is a report on the conditions of the school, and also the bill for the visit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nR. C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminister, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Saturday, April 5th, I left Vancouver at twelve o'clock, arriving in Sechelt about six o'clock. That evening I visited the school there and found that the Sisters had done most excellent work in connection with the management of the pupils in their care, both physically as well as mentally. The children that had been there for some time showed marked superiority to any children in the village who had not taken advantage of the school. Sister Therisine, who is in charge, is most painstaking as regards the physical well-being of those under her charge. She is laboring under many disadvantages however, although these are being gradually lessened. It is very difficult to overcome the superstition and ignorance of the Indians who cannot see that everything is being done for their own ultimate benefit and again as some of the children come from tubercular stock and as there are a number of tubercular cases in the village at the present time, it is extremely difficult and almost impossible to prevent the children mingling with the Indians in the village who are afflicted with this disease. The Indians will not permit any isolation and you\ncannot make them realize the danger of contact in close rooms for those who are at the present time free from disease with those who are afflicted with tubercular disease, and the consequence is that it will be advisable to visit the school at certain intervals and examine the pupils carefully to ascertain whether any of them have contracted tuberculosis. The pupils are all examined very carefully upon entrance and while they may be perfectly free from any evidence of tuberculosis in the first place, yet they may contract it from associating with those who are suffering from it in the village. Moreover, there are very few families there but what have had, some time recently, a death in the family from tuberculosis. One case, a little girl who was examined a short time ago, was then perfectly well, now there is evidence of tuberculosis commencing. This case I have given sick leave of absence and told them to send her home.\n\nThe examination of each individual pupil lasted until 11 or 12 o'clock that night. But with very few exceptions, all were in very excellent condition.\n\nIn the early morning I went around the village and saw as many as possible of those who were sick. I found tuberculosis present in quite a few cases. In one family, the father has been suffering from\nconsumption for the last two or three years and although he has been warned of the danger of giving the disease to others, the warning had no effect. He himself is now in the last stage of tuberculosis and frequently has visitors in a close room and he himself goes around and mingles promiscuously in the different houses and expectorates more or less freely around the different rooms, so that in all probability, the spread of tuberculosis will be very great. In one other family, the mother and two children are suffering from tuberculosis and the father looked as if he would be a ripe subject before very long. The only way that anything can be done with these cases is to provide them with a house up there with large verandas and put in charge a nurse who will gradually impress on their minds the necessity for isolation of these cases. It would be impossible to consider the project of building a small hospital anywhere but just in their midst, because they will not go to it and you cannot compel them to. Even at the present time in cases where the Indians are suffering from tubercular abscesses that require surgical treatment and surgical dressing, we cannot persuade them to remain in the hospital and receive proper treatment. They want to be among their own family and among their own people, even when they scatter the disease amongst those who are free from it.\nI would advise the Department to take prompt action in this matter and to immediately give instructions whereby a hospital or small house could be established with a fully trained nurse there who would be able by degrees to persuade those who were sick and afflicted to come in and be under proper supervision and proper care.\n\nAnother feature in connection with the Indians is that they cannot be made to understand the necessity of dieting in certain cases. A child may be suffering from typhoid fever. If he should be at home and wanted crabs or anything else that was improper for him to have and if he asked them for it, they would give it to him even if he died the next minute. They cannot understand why they should diet and not have everything they ask for. If a good nurse were put in charge of them, she would gradually teach them, and possibly the lives of many of them might be spared and they might become useful. If the present conditions are allowed to go on, I do not think the Department will be troubled very long with many of the Indians as tuberculosis is gradually but surely killing them out by degrees. These same remarks apply to other districts as well as Sechelt, and I would advise that a small hospital be established at Mission as well.\n\nIt took us from early morning until nearly 10-30 o'clock to get\naround to all those who were ill and suffering from tuberculosis and other diseases, but tuberculosis was the general disease they were suffering from. I left at 10-30 o'clock and arrived back in Vancouver about 3-30 Sunday afternoon, April 4th.\n\nShould the Department require any further information on the subject or assistance in preparing plans for the hospital and obtaining the services of a trained nurse, I will be very pleased to help them in every way possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa 15th May, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a communication from Agent McDonald of the Fraser Agency, and also a letter from Dr Brydone-Jack relative to a visit which he paid to Sechelt Village and the Indian School at that place, and in connection with which he recommends that an hospital be established by the Department; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds where-with to finance such a project.\n\nWith reference to the doctor's remarks regarding the condition of the Indian homes, and the evil results of the same, I beg to say that you should impress upon the Indian Agent that he should endeavour to get the Indians to adopt cleanly habits, particularly in connection with all cases of tuberculosis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

The above mentioned sum is to include all charges in connection with each trip.\n\nIn your letter of the 31st of August, 1908, No. 612 K-5, I was requested to inform the principal of the school that the Department does not propose to have the Doctor go to the Institution to treat trifling ailments, but only in cases of absolute necessity. This, the principal considers, places responsibility upon her of deciding between trifling ailments and serious cases before asking the Doctor to visit the school, and she is afraid that it might sometimes happen that she would consider a case serious which might afterwards be found by the Doctor to be\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nbe a trifling ailment. However, if the principal is assured that she will not be held responsible by the Department, provided she uses her best judgement in such cases, I think the arrangement outlined in your letter of the 31st of August, 1808, will be satisfactory to her.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\nNov. 29th, 1909.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 24th of August 1908 in regard to the arrangement then entered into by the Department with Dr. Brydone Jack of Vancouver, B.C., to visit the Sechelt Boarding School, Fraser Agency, from time to time as his services were needed at the rate of $25.00 a trip and all expenses, I have the honour to enclose herewith for the information and consideration of the Department a further letter on the subject dated 25th inst., No. 445/13, recently received from Mr. Agent McDonald, from a perusal of which it will be perceived that Dr. Brydone-Jack has expressed his willingness to continue these visits at $25.00 per trip for the present and that he will notify the Department if he finds at any time impossible to continue at that figure.

A child by the name of Angela had been suffering from a high temperature and as this continued for some days the Sister was afraid that something serious might occur. We brought the child down to the hospital and find that she is progressing as favorably as can be expected under the circumstances.\n\nWhile up there we made an examination of the other pupils of the school and found that they were in a very fit condition of health. It is certainly wonderful the work that Sister Therese has been able to accomplish in that respect for she has some children under her care who are not on the role. I think if arrangements were made whereby she would receive recompense for such cases, it would be of mutual advantage to the Department and to the Indians themselves. There is no doubt but that the excellent work which has been done in the school will be gradually disseminated amongst the Indians themselves and will be productive of a great deal of benefit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

I would respectfully recommend that the request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 29th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant,\nI beg to say that permission is hereby granted to the Principal\nof the Shoalst Indian Boarding School to grant summer holidays\nto the pupils of that Institution on the usual terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nDuring my visit of inspection of the Sechelt Boarding School, the Principal brought up the question of Manual Training for the boys.\n\nThere is a carpenter residing at Sechelt, Mr. Ellis T. Hermanson. He was putting new seats in the Chapel in connection with the School, when I was there.\n\nHis work is first class. He has done satisfactory work on several occasions for the School. He understands the boys, and his influence on them is good. The Principal spoke very highly of the man.\n\nHe is prepared to give the boys training two half-days per week for 10 months each year, for the sum of $200.00 per annum.\n\nThe school is prepared to carry on this work, if the Department will pay the salary.\n\nThe educational and vocational could be combined, and I have no doubt, the results would justify the expenditure in this particular case.\n\nI, respectfully, submit this for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns visited the Sechelt Boarding School on the 13th and 14th of April, last, and in addition to his report he has written a letter to the Department stating that there is a carpenter residing at Sechelt who would be prepared to give the boys at this school training two half days per week for ten months for the sum of $200.00 per annum. He says that the school would be prepared to carry on this work if the Department would pay the salary.\n\nThis boarding school is in receipt of a per capita grant of $100.00 and is well and economically managed, but the expenditure has overrun the receipts to the amount of $207.76, being the total deficit up to the present. All the members of the staff are sisters and there is no one connected with the school who could give the boys instruction in carpentry and it would be a great advantage to them if someone were appointed for this purpose. There are fifteen boys fourteen years of age and over on the roll. I think it would be money well expended if the Department secured the services of the carpenter recommended by Mr. Cairns.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 5, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th of April, last, recommending the appointment of Mr. Hermanson, who is a practical carpenter, to give instruction in carpentering to the boys at the Sechelt Boarding School and that the Department pay him $200.00 a year for ten months' services.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department favours the proposition, it is not in a position to assume the payment of the wages of an instructor, as this school is on a per capita basis and under section 7 of the agreement for the maintenance and management of Indian boarding schools it has to provide a sufficient number of teachers, officers and employees.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Although the children have not been attending school during the September and the early part of the December Quarters, a number of the pupils were continuously staying with the Principal, who with her staff remained at Sechelt and supervised as much as possible the arrangements in connection with the erection and furnishing for the reopening of the new school buildings. This school was formerly opened on December the 8th with all the children in attendance.\n\nIn view of the great loss which the Sisters have sustained as a result of the fire and bearing in mind the very efficient work carried on by them amongst these Indians for the last fourteen years, a work which I am sure the Department fully appreciates. I would respectfully recommend that, if possible, a grant in full for the quarter ended September 31st be made to the Principal of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary, Indian Agent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOblate Fathers\n-- 39 Blackwood Street --\nNew Westminster, B.C.

Report dated January 15, 1919. Original on 177517/6.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nThere is plenty of water for domestic purposes, but none for fighting fire. The pressure is very low.\nMarch 12, 1919.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to the last sentence of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you make inquiry with regard to the Sechelt school, I have to say that I have not lost sight of this matter, but I think there is little hope of obtaining a grant for the school building this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n59 Blackwood St.\nNew Westminster, B.C., Mar. 3, 1919.\n\nDuncan C.

Welch, O.M.I.\nMay 14, 1919\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nActing Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI received your letter dated 12 March 1919 in which you held out little hope that the Government would erect a new boarding school this year in Sechelt. This is to be regretted, but I trust you will use all your influence that the building of the school is not deferred beyond another year. Would the Department be willing to give me a guarantee that it will build in 1920? The reason why I make this request is because I am prepared to build a new cottage for the resident priest once I am assured that the boarding school will shortly be an accomplished fact.\n\nI spent a few days in Sechelt last week and I came away more than ever convinced of the immense superiority of the boarding school over the day-school. In day-schools the attendance of the children is very irregular. The parents are always on the move so that the vast majority of the children receive little or no education. Sometimes when the parents go away they entrust their children to the grandparents or other relatives who are however unable to manage the youngsters. Very often they roam about the village till late at night, even to midnight.\n\nComparing day-schools and boarding schools it is an acknowledged fact, I think, that the day-scholars never reach the high standard of the boarders. Many then again the day scholars leave school at an early age to work in the logging camps or on the fishing boats. Here they come in contact with the I.W.W. and quickly imbibe their pernicious theories, and so become a danger for the future of the Country.\n\nReligion alone is able to influence their lives for good, as no one knows better than yourself. I consider that in Sechelt the Sisters have done excellent work. It is to be seen plainly in the school and in the young generation of young men and women who have passed through the school. Practically all the children...\nOblate Fathers\n- - 59 Blackwood Street -\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nwho have attended the school have settled down and married. I do not know of a single case of separation amongst them, only one girl, an orphan, has given cause for complaint.\n\nSechelt as you will remember consists of five subdivisions, living chiefly in five different places for the greater part of the year; viz. Sechelt, Fender Harbour, Head of Jervis Inlet, Skokum Chuck, and Deserted Bay. Sechelt is the main village, but even here they only congregate on the big feasts for a short period and then scatter in various directions, leaving only a few old people behind them. A day-school in Sechelt would be absolutely useless.\n\nAt this moment fifty-five children are attending school. There are about a dozen more of age to go to school, but the sisters have no room.\n\nI will not refer again to all the discomfort they have to endure in Sechelt particularly during the winter months, but I do hope that they will not be called upon to put up with it beyond the next twelve months.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 337-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 26th, 1919.\n\nRev. and dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of May 14th. As no building can be erected without favourable action by Parliament in providing sufficient funds for the purpose, I regret it would not be possible for me to give a guarantee in advance of such action. However we will not lose sight of the need of a new school building at this point. I have read your letter with interest and have noted the contents.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my way to France last September, I had the honour to pay you a visit and you were so kind as to promise me to do all in your power to have a School built for the Scolt children.\n\nA new Principal has been appointed in my place because I could not return to B.C. at least for some time; I hear by her and the Indians that their application has not been granted; this means another winter to be spent in the temporary buildings.

Better than I could do; and I know that, if you look at the group of the Children you cannot help being interested in their welfare; therefore I have a great hope that you will use your influence and your power to obtain from the Government the erection of the Sechelt School for next spring.\n\nA word from you, dear Sir, would be very much appreciated.\n\nMy address is as follows:\n\nMadame la Sup\u00e9rieure\n2, Rue de Vienne\nLe Puy, Haute Loire, France\nMay 26, 1920.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the erection of a new Boarding School at the Sechelt Indian reserve to replace the one destroyed by fire some time ago.\n\nThe needs of the Sechelt School are fully realized by the Department but I regret very much that up to the present time funds have not been available for the re-building of the school and until money is voted by Parliament we will not be able to undertake the work. As you are aware, it is necessary to practise the most rigid economy in the expenditure of public funds owing to the heavy drain on finances caused by the war, but I assure you that when it is possible to take action the needs of this institution will not be lost sight of.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMadame la Superieure,\n2, Rue de Vienne,\nLe Puy, Hte Loire,\nFrance.\nGibson's Landing B.C.\nMay 19, 1930\n\nMr. C Scott Say\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to add my plea to the request for assistance from the Department for the Skeetches Indian School.\n\nSince the burning of the old school the classes work has been carried on in two large temporary buildings.

These I am sending you herewith in order that you may consult with the Sisters and make any comments and suggestions that you think necessary. The cost of all materials and labour is so high that it is necessary for us to exercise the strictest economy. Buildings must, therefore, be of the plainest design possible; at the same time I wish to provide adequate and proper accommodation for 70 pupils.\n\nI shall be pleased if you can have these plans returned at an early date, accompanied by a plan showing the grounds and the buildings thereon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

I much regret that I shall not have an opportunity of meeting you as there are some matters in connection with Sechelt which I would like to discuss with you.\n\nThe new School which you have kindly and wisely I consider, decided to build at Sechelt, will be a credit to your Department and a fresh proof of your interest in the well-being of the Indians. There are, however, just two things which I trust you will take up with Mr. P. Byrne, the Indian Agent and Rev. Dr. O'Boyle, O.M.I., who is succeeding me pro tem, when you come this way.\n\nThe first is the advisability, if not the necessity, of acquiring additional land for the support of the School. The soil at Sechelt is rather poor and what I regard as almost a necessity is some good land where the Sisters could raise a plentiful supply of vegetables and perhaps they could keep some hogs and a few head of cattle. If you could find time to visit Sechelt, it is only three hours sail from Vancouver, you would probably understand my meaning better and perhaps get a fuller knowledge of the fine work, which has been achieved there by the Sisters.\n\nThe other point which perhaps you may be willing to consider is the question of an increase in the grant\ngrant for this School. When the new building is an accomplished fact may I be permitted to say that we all sincerely hope that you will place it in Class A. This concession would make for the greater efficiency of the Institution, and would at the same time lighten the heavy burden which those in charge are now carrying.\n\nThe plans for the new School are being carefully considered and may be sent to you within a week.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n44 Hutchinson Block\nPender & Fairweather\n\n19 Sept. 21\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI should be obliged if you could let me know if there is a vacancy in the Indian School soon to be opened at Sicamous, B.C.

The villagers, who use the same system, may urge for a greater quantity of water, but this is a selfish reason. A hydrant for fire purposes might be supplied. I spoke to Mr. Ditchburn regarding supplying a typewriter for the school, from the D. S. C. R. surplus.\n\nThe Sisters complain of the differentiation between boarding and industrial schools, and I am of the opinion that the whole matter of category should be inquired into. Perhaps a new classification could be made on the bases of farm and garden facilities and transportation costs.\nJuly 5th,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Sister Superior at Sechelt is anxious to know if the new School will now be placed in Class A, and respectfully submit the following reasons why this should be done.\n\n1. The proportions of the new school, its equipment and general excellence from a material standpoint seem to call for it.\n\n2. Manual Training from now on will receive special attention. The Sister Superior has already engaged an experienced gardener and an expert engineer and carpenter. When the tools arrive, they are expected shortly, the school will have its workshop and the boys will be taught carpenter work and steam fitting. Already the boys are being taught shoe repairing and are adept pupils.\n\n3. More land for garden purposes is required. Last year the school had to buy $300.00 worth of potatoes. The Sisters wish to clear five acres at once. This they hope to do if they receive the maximum grant.\n\n4. In March 1921 the balance for the year was $206.00. In March 1922 there was a deficit of $146.00.\n\n5. The engineer's and carpenter's salary this year will increase their expenses $1,200.00.\n\nFor these reasons I consider that the Sechelt School should henceforth rank as an Industrial School and receive the Maximum Grant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 10, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th ultimo, in which you request that the new boarding school at Sechelt, B.C. be graded as a Grade A school and receive the grant for schools of that class.\n\nIn connection with this request, I would point out that the new school building at this point is now the property of the Department; consequently it will be placed in Class B, Western Division. This is the grading allowed to all other schools where first class buildings are erected and which are the property of the Government.\n\nThe grant allowed to schools of this class during the present fiscal year is at the rate of $120 per capita plus a bonus of $20 per capita. The new building at Sechelt provides accommodation for 80 pupils, and this is the number for which a grant is allowed. I, therefore, regret that it will not be possible to comply with the principal's request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nCorrespondence re water supply placed on\n\nR-7.7\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Classroom.\n\nJanuary 4, 1923.\n\nThe boys are very backward. They do not appear to be making much progress. I think if they were put up to an efficiency test they would rank very low.\n\nThe girls, however, do better work. Their reading and spelling may be classed as fair.\n\nThis school has not yet introduced the British Columbia course of study. I recommend that this be done at once.\n\nThis school needs one or two trained and experienced teachers to raise the standard of education. I discussed the whole matter fully with the principal.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOTTAWA, February 17th, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his recent visit to the Sechelt Indian Boarding School, states that the boys are very backward in their studies, and do not appear to be making much progress. He further states that the school needs one or two trained and experienced teachers to raise the present standard of education, and that he discussed this matter fully with you. He recommends that the British Columbia course of studies be used in the classrooms.\n\nRegarding the course of studies, I have to inform you that we are now insisting that the studies as prescribed for use in white schools be followed in Indian schools. You should obtain from the Department of Education, Victoria, B.C., a programme of studies for white schools, and, in future, when requisitioning for textbooks, only those prescribed by the Provincial Department of Education should be asked for. It is hoped that the wishes of the Department in this respect will be carried out.\n\nThe question of obtaining the services of one, or if possible, two trained teachers should receive the consideration of the authorities of the school. The names, qualifications and experience of the teacher, or teachers, secured should be submitted for the consideration of the Department. As this is a new and thoroughly equipped building, we are anxious that full advantage be given the Indian children in attendance to obtain a good education, and to this end it is very necessary that qualified teachers be engaged. The Inspector discussed this matter fully with you at the school.\n\nWe note from the Inspector's report that the girls are making much better progress in their studies than the boys. The standard of education at this school will only be brought to a satisfactory condition by the engaging of qualified teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School,\nSechelt, B.C.\nSekelit Indian Boarding School\nSekelit, February 26th, 1923.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the letter of Mr. D. Maclean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary, of the 15th inst., stating that the pupils of the Sekelit Indian Boarding School, especially the boys, are very backward in their studies and do not appear to make much progress, I beg to say that the staff is of the same opinion. But I must inform you that the majority of the present school children are more than dull; besides, at the beginning of 1922, they were sick with the \"flu\" for nearly three months, after which they were left weak and languid, consequently unable to do much work in the class rooms. Furthermore, at the re-opening of the school, after the summer holidays (that is at the beginning of September) for years past, a great number of the oldest pupils, instead of coming back on the appointed day, are taken by their parents to the hops field and stay there sometimes four or five weeks. All this handicaps our work which is already quite difficult, owing to the dullness of the pupils and their lack of ambition.\n\nWhat would you, dear Sir, recommend us to do?\nunder such circumstances? We cannot go in the\nhops field. Would it not be advisable to tell\nMr. E.C. Perry, the Indian Agent, to take this affair\nin hand, in the future, and have the children\nbrought back to the school on the appointed day?\nIn the meantime, we are going to do our best\nto stir the boys in order to have them make up\nfor the lost time; we are also preparing some\nqualified teachers, who latterly will replace\nsome of the members of the present staff.\nHoping this will meet with your approval,\nI am, dear sir,\nYours respectfully,\nPeter Gabriel,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 6, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you refer to the boys of the Sechelt Indian Boarding School and their lack of progress with their studies.\n\nI have noted the reasons for this condition, and in reply I wish to state that the Department will give you every assistance in the matter of returning the older boys to the school at the expiration of the vacation period. Mr. Indian Agent Ferry, of Vancouver, is receiving instructions in this connection, and you would be well advised to keep in close touch with him and seek his cooperation in the event of delinquent children. A penalty has been imposed by principals at some schools, when pupils have failed to return on the appointed day after summer holidays. Such children are not allowed holidays during the next summer, and this practice has militated for a better attendance during the month of September.\n\nI note, with satisfaction, that better qualified teachers are being secured and every effort is being made to bring the work among the boys at Sechelt up to standard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nSechelt, B. C.\nOttawa, March 6, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, following a recent report of Mr. Inspector Cairns on the Sechelt Indian Boarding School, this Department has communicated with the Rev. Sister, with a view to bringing the academic work among the boys up to the required standard. Rev. Sister Gabriel has stated that the lack of progress on the part of the boys is due to several causes - one of which is a failure on the part of the older boys to return promptly after the vacation period in the summer.\n\nThe Principal has been instructed to cooperate closely with you and that you will give every assistance possible in the effort to see that the pupils return promptly on the appointed day. It may be necessary to return from the hop fields certain of the boys, under escort. Further, it might be advisable to cancel, for the next year, the holiday privileges of any pupil who is delinquent during the coming summer. You will please give this matter your attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 401, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nVancouver Agency, Vancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 29, 1923.\n\nDear Reverend Father Welch:\n\nI am sending herewith, for your information, a petition which has been received from the Sechelt Indians, regarding school conditions, which will be self-explanatory. You will probably remember a similar petition being received by me last fall and discussed with you and Inspector Cairns in my office at which time you informed us that you would take steps in the direction of improving conditions in that institution. The matter has been allowed to rest there, but it seems the Indians are not satisfied and upon discussing the matter with Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Schools, we are of the opinion that upon the return of the Indians from the hop fields to their village, it may be well if you could make it convenient to accompany Mr. Cairns and myself to Sechelt, for the purpose of going studiously into this matter, with a view of ascertaining if there are any grounds for the dissatisfaction of the Indians.\n\nWill you be good enough to inform me whether you can make it convenient to visit Sechelt towards the end of October?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.G. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nReverend Father Welch, C.M.I.,\nVicar of Roman Catholic Missions,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nVancouver Agency, Vancouver, B.C.,\nAug. 29, 1923.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your petition in regard to conditions at the school and in reply beg to say that a copy of the petition is being forwarded to Mr. Chief Inspector Ditchburn of Victoria, as requested by you. The matter will also be taken up with the Reverend Father Welch, Vicar of Missions, New Westminster. It has also been discussed with Mr. R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Schools for British Columbia. We expect to look into this matter as soon as the people return from hop picking.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nChief George,\nSechelt, B.C.\nAug.14,1923.\n\nSechelt,B.C.\n\nC.C.Ferry,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver,B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are forwarding a petition agreed by meeting at Secheltand also at Jervis Inlet. It is inregards the education of our children at our school, and we tell you to forward this to Mr. Ditchburn, Inspector.\n\nIt proves our children have never improved in education in this school. They are merely boarding in this school on Government expense. Children in school for seven and eight years cannot hardly write, add, and cannot even talk decent English.\n\nNow our wish is change of teacher. We want a man to principal this school, experienced in educating children for our boys and have good teachers for our girls. This is the only point and if it is not settled the Government is spending money for no use.\n\nWe are not satisfied with the education giving in this school and want to change the principal and her teachers immediately. If this matter is not settled we are not taking our children to school till it is settled.\n\nNow if you want to investigate this matter come over and we will tell you the whole thing, this is the main point and we want to get it settled as it is no use to get our children there to learn nothing. We have already send you a petition of the same point before and we want you to look deep in this matter and go to work to fix and we will be glad to see our children getting a good education later on.\n\n(Signed by the Sechelt Band.)\n\nChief Tom, Chief George, Sam Julian\nChief John, Peter, Thomas Julian\nChief Johnson, Tony Baptist\nJoe Dixon, Tom Julius\nJohnnie Wilson, Leo Julius\nLittle Joe, I.N.Isaac\nAlwx William, John Baptist\nCaptain Joe, Billy Johnson\nVictor Alex, Jack August\nEd.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nCOPY.\n\nSechelt Boarding School\nSechelt Sept.1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe day appointed for the reopening of the Sechelt Indian School was on the 4th inst. I beg to inform you that only one boy came back on that day. The majority of the pupils went hop picking with their parents; some to Agassiz, some to Sardis; the others are at Jervis Inlet and other camps.\n\nWould you kindly send Constable Bartlett after them and have them brought back to school at once, and oblige,\n\nYours respectfully,\nSister Gabriel,\nPrincipal.\n\nC.C.Ferry,\nIndian Agent\nHolden Bldg.\nVancouver,B.C.\nVancouver Agency, Vancouver, B.C.,\n\nSept. 11, 1923.\n\nDear Reverend Sister:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated September 1923, informing me that only one boy came back to school on the 4th instant, the majority of pupils having gone to Agassiz, and some to Sardis, and others to Jervis Inlet and other camps, and requesting that I would send Constable Bartlett after them and have them brought back to school at once, I beg to say it is unfortunate that this matter was not taken up at the time the Indians were leaving Sechelt for the hop fields, as many of them were passing through and were supplied with tickets by Constable Bartlett and Chief of Police Harding and the pupils could have been retained here had we received information from you at that time.\n\nI received a call yesterday from the Reverend Father Bellot, North Vancouver, who informed me that the Indians to all appearances deliberately took their children to the hop fields because the transportation would be paid by the Hop Company and that they were quite aware that if the children did not return to school their fares back to Sechelt would likely be paid through the Dominion Constable, being sent to round them up and return them to school at the Government's expense.\n\nFather Bellot suggested that if a distribution of money were being made to the Sechelt Indians that it might be a good idea to return the children to school and charge the cost thereof against the respective shares of the Indians as a punitive measure. As no distribution is contemplated, however, this is not feasible.\n\nI am going to the Hop fields on Friday, and I will look into the matter. I cannot say, however, that the Department will be agreeable to paying the expenses connected with the return of these pupils, as the hop picking will be all over in a few weeks and the Indians will return to the village. I will, however, do what seems best upon making further inquiries.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nReverend Sister Gabriel,\nSechelt Boarding School,\nSechelt, B.C.\nSir,\n\nDear Reverend Sister:\n\nKindly furnish me with a list of any pupils who may be absent from the school without permission, stating, if possible, their whereabouts if this information is at hand. The Indians will be returning from the hop fields very soon. I was informed by the Manager that there is about a week's more picking to be done. As the wet weather has set in, however, it is possible the Indian will return at an earlier date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nReverend Sister Gabriel,\nSnellet, B.C.\nSechelt Indian Boarding School,\nSechelt, Sept. 22nd, 1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th inst., asking me to furnish you with a list of the pupils who may be absent from the school without permission, I beg to say that none of the pupils have come back since the holidays except three girls and one boy from Coquitlam Reserve and another boy from Lillooet. Therefore, we have only five children at present, at school; the others are at Jervis Inlet and other camps, and the majority at the hop fields; but as the Indians did not inform me, the children would not come in time, I cannot say their whereabouts. I heard that some went to the hop fields (I do not know who) from their respective camps, while others left Sechelt a week before the end of the holidays. Had I known, sooner, that the Indians were going to act this way, I would certainly have informed you of their intended departure, I sincerely regret this misunderstanding.\n\nParents and children knew very well the date of the reopening of the school; we were expecting them, all, on the 4th and 5th inst and, for that purpose, we had made provisions which are now getting spoiled.\n\nBy this time, they have been missing quite a whole month besides the month of holidays they have had; would you kindly tell me if I must mention it in the Quarterly Report and how I must make this report.\n\nWould you also allow me, dear Sir, to ask you to be kind enough to find some little children to take the place of the big boys and big girls who are of age to be discharged and who, probably will not come back to school. On account of these anticipated discharges we will not have our full number this year.\nThanking you again for all you do for use and hoping to see you at Sechelt soon,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n'sgd) Sister Gabriel,\nPrincipal.\n\nC.C.Ferry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver,B.C.\nSir,\n\nDear Reverend Sister:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the children not returning to school after vacation, I desire to inform you that I have addressed letters to Chief Tom, Chief John, Chief Johnson, Chief George, and Indian Constable Roberts, instructing them to require from the Indian parents and guardians concerned the return of their children, who are up to your school without delay. I have told them that if they do not return at once that the court will be opened and all expenses connected therewith will be charged to the parents and guardians.\n\nKindly let me know if there is any movement in the direction of returning the children. If not, I will immediately proceed against the parents.\n\nI may say that a letter was received this morning from Noel Paul, asking me to tell the school inspector that he wants to keep his son who \"got a bad sickness\" and cure him. He states that he lost two children from the same sickness, on account of the food that they had in the school. He also states the boy has been in school nine years and he did not learn much.\n\nOf course, I do not take complaints of this kind seriously, as similar complaints have been made of other schools in the past. I would inform you, however, that there appears to be on the part of the Indians as a whole a strong desire to have the affairs at the school investigated. A petition was received last spring, signed by the villagers complaining about the school, particularly the food, secondly that the children were not learning anything and thirdly that they wanted a male principal. This petition was discussed by Reverend Father Welch, Mr. Inspector Cairns and myself and we decided to let matters rest for a while.\n\nWithin the past few weeks, however, another petition of a similar nature has been received, signed by practically all the villagers, asking why the former petition was not acted upon and calling upon us to have an investigation of these matters made. This is just where the matter stands at present. It is possible that the Indians in refusing to have their children return to school are keeping these petitions in mind and it looks to me as if there will have to be an inquiry in order to clear matters up. Mr. Cairns is out of the City at the present moment. It is possible that prosecution of the parents may bring about a solution of the difficulties complained of by the Indians.\n\nReverend Sister Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nSechelt Boarding School,\nSechelt, B.C.\nI am very anxious to avoid anything of an unpleasant nature in connection with your school. If you can offer any suggestions that will help solve the difficulty I shall be very glad to receive them.\n\nOn the return of Mr. Cairns, to the City, it is probable that he and I will visit Sechelt, with a view of having school matters investigated. It is clear that there is dissatisfaction on the part of the Indians and it there is no good reason for this, this will have to be explained to them, after the investigation referred to.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.C. Perry,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nSir,\n\nComplaint has been made at this office that the pupils of the Sechelt Boarding School who should have returned to the Sechelt Boarding School on the 4th or 5th of September have not returned and I have been requested to apply the law and have these boys returned to school.\n\nLet me ask you to warn immediately all those parents whose children have not returned to school that unless they immediately return their children to school, the court will be opened and all the expenses are likely to be charged to the Indian parents and guardians. If the people desire to keep clear of this expense, they had better get busy and send the children back right away.\n\nDo not fail in your duty to see that these instructions are carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.C.

Hop Co.,\nSardis, B.C.\nSir,\n\nDear Reverend Father:\n\nWith further reference to the petitions of the Sechelt Indians, as brought to your attention in the two letters addressed from the Indian Officer under date August 29th and 31st respectively, I beg to advise you that the attitude of the Sechelt Indians in regard to matters complained of therein has assumed a more serious aspect. It is reported by Reverend Sister Gabriel by letter of the 22nd of September that only five pupils out of an approximate enrolment of eighty who should have returned to school on the 4th instant, have reported at the school; most of the absentees being Sechelt Indians.\n\nIt has also been reported by a member of the Squamish Band that an attempt has been made by the Sechelt Indians to enlist the sympathy of the Squamish parents and their co-operation in a boycott of the two boarding schools.\n\nUnder the circumstances we deem it imperative that an investigation of the whole matter be made as soon as possible after the return of the Indians from the Hop Fields. While the four chiefs and constable have been urged to use their powers of persuasion with a view to the return of the pupils and the Indian parents and guardians have been threatened with Court proceedings to return their children, we would feel that it would be comparatively easy to deal with a few truants, but the whole band being practically unanimous present a serious problem, which would call for a more diplomatic way of dealing with the situation than by court proceedings.\n\nWe, therefore, respectfully request that you be good enough to consent to assist in the inauguration of some plan, whereby a thorough investigation and solution of the present difficulty could be assured. It is our desire to meet the parents only, who may have complaints to make and to ascertain, if possible, if there is any good ground for such, and we would appreciate it if you would accompany us on the occasion of our visit to Sechelt in order that we may have the benefit of your good counsel in these matters, also your co-operation as a representative of the Church interested in the school.\n\nWe remain, dear Reverend Father,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nRev.

In the meantime, the children should all return to school at once. It would be impossible to hold an inquiry if the children were not in school. I hope, therefore, you will exercise every power to have these children returned to school at once. Please also tell the parents that if they do not return at once we shall be obliged to carry out the plan referred to in my last letter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C.

Terry\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIt was found at the time that the smaller children who had run away from the school had done so upon the instigation of the older boys and girls.\n\nIt is the intention of Mr. Cairns, Father Welch and myself to hold an inquiry and make a thorough investigation of school affairs at Sechelt upon the return of Mr. Cairns from the North, about the first week in November, proximo, after which a detailed report will be furnished for the information of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit to you herewith the returns of the Sechelt Boarding School, for the Quarter ended September 30th, ultimo. It will be noted in the remarks column that pupils, who number about seventy out of seventy-five, failed to return to the school at the appointed date, September 4th and 5th. In this connection I am forwarding a copy of my complete file on the subject by which it will be seen that efforts are being made to have this matter looked into and the pupils returned to school. I would inform you that up to the present time no word has been received from the Sisters to the effect that any of the children have returned. If no word is received by Friday next, the 19th instant, Police Officers will be dispatched with warrants for the arrest of all pupils.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the investigation of this affair has been inadvertently delayed owing to Mr. Inspector Cairns having made arrangements to go to the Nass River, which trip was imperative owing to the early freezing over of the Nass River, making navigation expensive and difficult. Had it been possible for the Reverend Father Welch to have gone to Sechelt in response to my letter of August 29th, no doubt an earlier investigation might have been made on the return of the Indians from the hop fields.\n\nImmediately upon leaving the hop field the Indians began to scatter all along the Coast and it will be with difficulty that they will be reached and the children brought back to school. I am expecting word from the Sisters at any moment and I am hoping that it will be to the effect that the pupils have returned.\n\nI pointed out to Dr. Scott in an interview during his visit to Vancouver that the affairs of the school will be fully and carefully investigated with a view of correcting any condition which may be found inimical both to the interests of the pupils and the staff. I feel at present there is no justification for the attitude taken by the Sechelt Indians and I believe good results would follow a change of policy, whereby children from other villages should be encouraged to enter the school and a number of the older pupils now enrolled discharged and replaced by younger children.\n\nIf you will kindly consult my diary for the month of May, it will be noticed that on the 17th day of that month I reported that I had found it necessary to visit the school and severely censure a number of the pupils who had been giving trouble to the teachers.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nCharles C. Perry,\nRoom 404, Holden Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe your letter seventeenth instant and enclosures concerning return of Sechelt school pupils - STOP - Your action and plans for future approved - STOP - Spare no efforts to have children returned to school and to remove prejudices of parents - STOP -\nRequest Father Welch to kindly assist.\n\nDUNCAN C. SCOTT.\nSTATEMENT OF CHIEF JOHN.\n\nI'll say a few words about the school matter. You are inquiring about what matter this school is closed about. This school building is one of the best buildings as we look at it. The school children today are not the same today as they were. Children coming out of this school lately hardly know anything at all. The Band got together and said we may as well stop this and have a better plan.\" We decided in asking for a different principal and teachers that is why we stop the children from going to this school. 'Tis not because we do not like the Sisters, it is because of the poor education. It is all mixed up. They can hardly put things together. So it was agreed by the Band that they would want a man principal, a man teacher for the boys and the Sisters for the girls.\n\nSTATEMENT OF CHIEF JOHNSON.\n\nI'll say a few words to you about this school matter. The School building looks good inside and outside. The teachers are the main trouble. The food too is pretty poor and the children get sick on it. It is a shame for the Government to pay a large sum of money and for children come out of school and know so little or education. When our children speak English half of them English is French. When we want our children to add or count they can't do it. We are tired of this poor business in the school and if the matter is settled it may be better later on and as Mr. Carlson says if the Sachelt children do not come to school, others will. I can say it will be different. We Sachelt people built the first school in this Reserve. We want to follow what the government wants us to go, but we cannot get it out of this school in the way of education. It is not because we do not like the school. It is because we want good food and good education for this school.\n\nSTATEMENT OF JOE WILSON, Indian.\n\nI'll tell you a few words about this school matter. You are Inspector of Indian Schools. In regards to school matter, we have a kick about the food. When we start a school in Sachelt the Government pays $5.00 per month for each pupil. We could not kick then if the food was not of high standard. Lately we found out the Government was paying more money. We found out the food in the school was just the same as when it was $5.00 per month. The children are getting mush and tea without milk and without sugar. So our children have been getting sickness with eating such poor food as that. I have known a few kids who have got sick with the food and have died. Our kids have looked well whenever in school, but a few months after looked sick and were not well. About the Sisters they hate all the people of Sachelt, and hate the Priest (Priest present) as much as we. After we had meetings we decided to hold our children till we get better teachers and better food for the children. So this time we have brought our children to school and if the school matters are settled we are ready to put them into school. It has been agreed by the Band to have a man principal, a man teacher for the boys and Sisters to teach the girls.\nSTATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JOE (Indian)\n\nI got a complaint about my little girl. One day Mother Superior slapped her on the nose with a book and it bled all day. I do not think a school teacher would go that far in punishing kids. I came up to school one day when I came to Schect, and just as I came in the door, the Sister chased me away like a dog. Before that they had chased my wife away the same way as that. I do not like to remember what she said at that time. I would not like to say what the Sister said in the presence of the Mothers and the Fathers and the children. The teachers hate the people here. If any of the women come to school they chase them away. If there is no change of teachers in this school there will be more trouble than there was before with the people of the village.\n\nSTATEMENT OF MRS. AGNES ALPHONSE (Indian)\n\nMy husband when he was alive came to school to get our boy to cut wood. As he came up behind the school he saw the boy crying and blood coming from his nose. My husband asked what was the matter but the boy would not say a word. The Sister would not let the boy sit and cut wood, so my husband went and got the boy to cut the wood. At last I got the boy down to the house. The boy would not tell me what was the matter. In the evening when going into church they boy began to cry and there was still a little blood coming from his nose. I took him home and put him to bed. I coaxed my boy and asked him what was wrong. He said to him: \"Your both eyes are black and I do not know what is wrong with you.\" By and by he told me what the trouble was. It was at the school and it was after dinner time and it was his job to wash the dishes. A sister thought it was not in his place to wash dishes, so the sister instead of telling him, she came up behind him and gave him a slap on the back of the head with a closed hand. I never told anybody about this. My boy was laid on his bed, but I didn't want to say anything to anybody. Quite a few days after this his grandmother came to the house and saw the boy was sick and asked what was the matter. When she saw it she went to Father Plamondon. (Here Father Plamondon explained that he saw the boy with black eyes but that the boy had told him about this but could not remember the Grandmother having done so.)\n\nSTATEMENT OF MRS. NOEL PAUL (Indian)\n\nI lay down before you what I know and what I have seen of the Sisters, and the truth. One day I came up to the school to get my boy to cut wood. My husband and eldest boy were sick. As I came up I seen my boy and the Sisters in charge let me come to see the Superior. I took my boy along with me. I saw the Mother Superior and I could see that she looked mad. She asked me what I wanted. I told her I wanted the boy to cut wood for me. Mother Superior then got mad with both of us. She told me that I had got my boy before, and he had missed the Church Service and for this reason she would not let him go. It could not be helped that time, we were in the woods when the Church bell rang and we could not be in time. It got me very sore. So I told Mother Superior I would not come to get my boy again. At last Sister found that I was mad. She asked me what I wanted to have my boy out of school for. Then we started to fight words with her. She was talking in English and in French, when she was talking French she was saying \"O! la la, O! la la.\" I have an idea what she was saying. She asked me right there if I wanted to fight with her. I got ready and the Sister ran away. As I went towards the village another Sister was running after me. The Sister asked me to come back or she would wire to Mr. Perry, and he would send a Constable to come up.\nSTATEMENT OF SAM JULIAN (Indian)\n\nIt is a long time since I first heard of trouble with this school. I used to come up and see my children two or three times a year to see my children. I had to fight with the Sisters. Two or three times we had trouble. There are two parties in this Reserve. The Sisters are one party and the people in the village a party too. Sometimes when we have celebrations we come and try to have the Sisters enjoy it with us, but they would not come. This is where the trouble begins. The Reserve belongs to the Indians. The Sisters are working for the Government. The Government has given us a good school and no good has come out of this school the Government has done for us. There has been more trouble every year. I put my time in in Sechelt this Spring and every day there were school boys and girls running away from School. We spend most of our time running around looking for the kids. Two times I took my kids back to school. I couldn't help it when the kids ran away each time. I got a few kids here and it proves the Sisters cannot give them a good education. Women cannot give them sense enough to get anything education. When the kids come out of school they would not listen. They go out into the world and please themselves. Why do the teachers not teach the children to obey their parents, the law of God. That is one thing that makes the people of Sechelt sore and should be cut out right now.\n\nQUESTION BY INSPECTOR CAIRNS:\nWhy do the children run away?\n\nAnswer: They were treated too rough by the teachers.\n\nA.Voice: Over-punished.\n\nSTATEMENT OF MRS.ISAAC SHIELDS (INDIAN)\n\nA few words in regard to the food of the children. My little girl was sick and I came up one day just in time for dinner. I had fried some fish to take up to my little girl for dinner. Just as I came up (it was in the old school building) the Sister was taking in the dinner for the sick girls. It was salt fish. It must have been old and it smelt rotten. When the Sister walked away I took it away and gave the girl the fish I had brought. The girl told me that if she didn't eat the Sister's fish she might be punished. So I took it away myself. There is no sugar in the tea and the tea very light just like water.\n\nInspector Cairns here addressed the Indians, at length.\n\n\"You cannot say you own this building which was built primarily for the education of Indians. You must have some regulation to ensure order and to prevent chaos. Sister Superior has responsibility. You must treat her with respect, as she represents authority and order. I am a tax-payer in the City for instance. The Mayor is the head of the City and represents the people. Things must be done in an orderly manner.\"\n\n(It was impossible to take down Mr. Cairns entire speech, as I could not write shorthand...C.C.F.)\n\nThis concludes the charges against the school.\nRev. Sister Gabriel insisted by Inspector Cairns to make any observations that she may desire upon the statements of the Indians, stated as follows:\n\nWe always put some sugar in the tea, also milk when the cows produce it. There has been no sugar put in the porridge of the pupils since the war, but nobody has complained. The children each morning return their plates for a second helping. The doctor never said the children died of poor food. He, on the other hand, has been most careful not to allow a boy to be in school in a weak condition. The food has been improved of late and the dietary scale has been approved by the Department.\n\nAs to chasing the Indians like dogs, the contrary is the case. It is the Indians who have chased us. There must be discipline and the Indian cannot do as they like. We never had a child whose nose bled for a whole day. Morris has black eyes because he had been fighting with a big boy.\n\nWith reference to obedience the teachers encourage the children to obey their parents every day. We need the cooperation of parents. If parents do not teach their children to obey their teachers, the parents cannot expect the children to obey them.\n\nWe do send the children to participate in the rejoicings of their parents and people.\n\nConcerning the fish\u2014the Indians say the fish was no good, the Indian parents salted the fish themselves and we were obliged to throw away seven barrels, as it went bad.\n\nThe Indians say the Sisters make money out of the Indians, but it is different. Since January last we have purchased cord wood from the Indians amounting to $640.65 besides this we have paid engineers and gardiners expenses.\n\nWe discipline the children often in penance at their own choice. They usually choose the strap. They are disciplined reasonably and are not treated roughly. The Indians insult me when I refuse to allow them to take their children. How can they become educated if the parents are allowed to take their children away?\n\nFollowing the statement of Sister Gabriel, Tom Julian, the Indian interpreter, who had interpreted all the proceedings desired to speak. The following is what he said.\n\nThere are four points. Education, food, treatment and hatred. These have been discussed at all the meetings held by the Indians.\n\nAt Deserted Bay the Chiefs get letters from Chief Inspector Ditchburn and the Indian Agent and they go to the Ex-pupils of the boarding school and ask them to explain the letters to the old people and they could not do so.\nA letter received recently from Mr. Ditchburn through the Indian Agent regarding fisheries matters could not be interpreted.\n\nThere was better education under Mother Theresa. Some of the young people now write letters to Father Flanondon, which are so poor they cannot be read. As to the food, I put nine years in this school and know how on some occasions the food was poor and couldn't be eaten. I have seen kids go out after meals and throw up their food to prevent being sick.\n\nAs to discipline, in some cases the treatment goes too far. There are some bad ones, but others do not deserve it. There should be a different system. The boys should have someone who should rule them. Sister St. Juan is laughed at by the boys. She is too old. My mother is old. Sometimes I laugh at her. That is like the Sister. I can correct my boy when my wife can't. There is distance and lack of sympathy between the people and the Sisters and it is getting worse. I know this myself. We are ambitious for a good school.\n\nThe Reverend Father Flanondon, desiring to address the Assembly stated as follows:\n\nBefore God I am bound to be impartial, fair and just. This trouble is of long standing. I have been here a long time. Many times the late Indian Agent Byrne spoke to me about the complaints he had received from the Indians regarding the food, discipline and education at Scotch Boarding School. When Mr. Cairns came here Jan. 1921, he informed me there had been a meeting in Chief Julius' house at which complaints had been made to him re food. The petitions sent to Indian Agent Perry were never shown to me by the Indians. The Indians said \"Father, we are tired and want an understanding, on the question referred to.\" I see there is friction between the Indians and the management of the school. I didn't until lately go into the dining-room. I knew what they had in the old building and was well satisfied, but when I saw the poor food given to the pupils by the present Sisters, I told Father Welch myself that I was sorry for the children who had that mush with no sugar and milk. The result of this condition was that on September 1st only one boy came back to school. A priest came from Westminster last fall and said he would like to see the food of the pupils and when he saw it he said to me \"Father it is a shame for the Sisters to give those children heavy mush with no sugar or milk.\" He also said that potatoes, soup and bread so frequently used was of little use to these children. He told me it was my duty to come and see every meal and taste it. I mentioned this to Mother Gabriel and told her that the big boys need lots of food and that if we could not feed them properly it would be better to close the school for else ask the Government for more money as we are responsible before God. What reflects on the Sisters, reflects on the Church and Priest. We must not starve the children. The climate in this country demands good food and plenty of it.\n\nAs to education, Mother Gabriel invited me to the school when Inspector Cairns visited last January. I went to the classroom and considered the work was not up to standard. Father Welch admitted to me at the table\n\"They do not know much\"\n\nAs to discipline the Sisters are scolding the children from morning to evening. Sometimes the Sisters could be heard shouting at the children from as far away as the wharf. I told the Sisters they should not kick, slap and shout at the children. I must speak the truth for I know that I will be judged. I said to Mother Superior \"These children are slaves. They used to have a Christmas tree and more recreation\" (The Sister here answered \"I never have anything like that\".)\n\nI know the Sisters intentions are good, but they may have been brought up like that. They are watching the children too closely, allowing them no latitude, and visiting priests have remarked about this. They are watched in Church and faced everywhere. I know they have to be watched but not to this extent. I told Father Welch over and over again. Mother Theresa used to visit the sick, but lately the Sisters have not visited the sick Indians. I told Father Churchill this and we agreed that we must love the Indians if we desire to serve them. Last fall there was no stove in the Church. At that time there were not more than seven or eight Indians in the village. One day there was snow on the ground and these few people and I wanted to use the school chapel. Sister Gabriel became very angry and she said to me \"Look, Father, I cannot stand it any longer. See what water they have made all over the floor.\" Her intentions no doubt were good, but there seems to be no understanding. There is room for improvement. The Indians are not wholly to blame. There should be co-operation and understanding and this should be possible. A sister here insisted that they (the Sisters) themselves had eaten much and long all through the year. Father Flanndon retorted that is perhaps what you were used to in France, but in this country more food is required.\n\nThe Indian Agent next addressed the meeting in an endeavour to council the Indians and all parties concerned with a view to better understanding, also promising that the statements etc., would be carefully analyzed and discussed with the school staff and hoped that there would be no recurrence of this trouble in the future.\n\nThe singing of the National Anthem concluded the proceedings.\nVancouver, B.C., Oct. 30, 1923.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nMr. Cairns and I are leaving for Sechelt on Thursday morning, November 1st, proximo, in accordance with promises made to the Indians and our arrangements. We feel that to put off our visit would be to break faith with them, for, when sending Mr. Constable Bartlett to Jervis Inlet to require the return of the pupils that school, he was instructed to inform the Indians that we would be at Sechelt on November 1st, under which circumstances and in view of the fact that the proposed investigation has already been considerably delayed, you will readily understand our position. We hope that it will be possible for you to send a representative should you be unable to accompany us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) Charles C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. Father Welch, O.M.I.,\nVicar of Roman Catholic Missions,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nKamloops, B.C.,\n\nOct. 29, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Cairns:\n\nYour letter of the 25th inst., just received.\n\nI hope to be back in N. Westminster Friday or Saturday and will be free to accompany you to Sechelt any day next week. Kindly send a line to 59 Blackwood St., New Westminster.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(sgd) J. Welch, O.M.I.\nVancouver Agency, Vancouver, B.C.,\n\nOct. 25, 1923.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nThis acknowledges the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, regarding school affairs at Sechelt.\n\nConstable Bartlett left here last Sunday morning and is still in the North. He went out with instructions to persuade the Indians to send their children back to the school at once. If he meets with success, we will be prepared to leave Vancouver on November 1st, and proceed to Sechelt where the whole matter will be fully investigated.\n\nI am pleased to know that you will accompany Mr. Agent Perry and myself on this trip. If for any reason we are compelled to cancel that date, we shall at once notify you by phone.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(sgd) R.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir,\u2014 With further reference to the trouble at the Sechelt Indian Boarding School, as outlined in a file submitted to the Department under cover of letter dated Oct. 17th ultimo, we, your Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia and Indian Agent of the Vancouver Agency, hereby concurrently report for the information of the Department, as follows:\n\nBy correspondence (copies of which are herewith submitted) and interviews, it was arranged that the Rev. Father Welch, O.M.I., Vicar of Missions and ourselves would visit Sechelt on November 1st, for the purpose of holding an official investigation into conditions as complained of by the Indians.\n\nNotice of the proposed meeting having been sent to the Indians scattered at remote camps along the Coast, through Dominion Constable Bartlett, it was imperative that we should not break faith with the Indians. Further, we had come to the conclusion that the seriousness of the situation had not been fully apprehended by the Church Authorities to whom it had been pointed out that delay would not improve the situation.\n\nIt is unfortunate, as will be noted by the correspondence that the Reverend Father Welch was not free to accompany us to Sechelt on November 1st. Previous to our investigation, a special effort had been made by Rev. Father Flemmond to have the Church represented at the investigation, by an official apart from the resident Missionary and Staff, which failed.\n\nWe proceeded to Sechelt on the first instant where we were met by Dominion Constable Bartlett who had visited the Camps and had urged the Indians to keep the appointment at Sechelt on November 1st. There were thirty-eight school children in the village with their parents and friends, they having all arrived that morning from Jervis Inlet.\n\nIt pleased the Indians that your Agent should first hold a meeting with the Hunaechin Band of the Sechelt Tribe, and in the meantime they would call the people together for a meeting in the Boarding School Assembly Hall, which room was placed at our disposal by the Reverend Principal.\n\nAfter meeting the Hunaechin Indians, and disposing of their business, we repaired to the Boarding School classroom where all the adult Indians\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nand several children were assembled. Present on the platform were the Principal and Institution Staff, The Reverend Father Plamondon, Resident Missionary and Chaplain, Mr. R.H.Calhoun, Inspector of Indian Schools, Indian Agent C.C.Ferry, and Dominion Constable Bartlett. Your School Inspector occupied the chair and Indian Agent, C.C.Ferry acted as Secretary and took the minutes, assisted by Dominion Constable Bartlett. Evidence as submitted herewith was taken and duly read and approved by the meeting. After testimony of the Indians having concluded, the Chairman invited the members of the staff to make any observations they may desire upon the statement of the Indians, whereupon the Reverend Principal Gabriel made his statement, which is submitted with the evidence. Following this the Reverend Father Plamondon, made a statement during which Reverend Sister St. Dennis interjected a few opposing remarks upon which she was heckled by the Indians to some extent. The Indians desiring to have Father Plamondon speak.\n\nWhile we have noted that the testimony of the Reverend Father Plamondon is reflected in the evidence of the Indians and while we regretted very much to observe the embarrassment of the Reverend Sister, who listened to the evidence of Reverend Father Plamondon, in the presence of the Indians, where the Reverend Father deemed it meet that his sentiments should be delivered, we feel that the Reverend Father was sincere in his statement, for we have hitherto found him a pious and worthy Missionary, whose representations would not, we believe, be without reasonable grounds.\n\nThe evidence thus taken was of such a nature as to lead us to the belief that friction exists between the staff and the resident Missionary-Chaplain on the one hand and the staff and some of the Indians on the other hand, which circumstance would appear to call for the attention of the representatives of the church to look into the matter with a view to action being taken for the creation of an atmosphere of harmony and cooperation. We are convinced that the Indians of Sachelt were not justified in taking action as a Band, to force the recognition of their grievances which might easily have been remedied had the aggrieved parents presented them to the Principal of the School or to the local officials of the Department, individually. This, however, was not done.\n\nThe evidence of all the parties concerned having been completed, on the first instant, we decided to visit the school the following day to discuss with the Principal and staff, the several points at issue between the staff and the Indians. Every phase of the situation was thoroughly gone into with the result that it was decided to institute immediately with the assistance of the Department the following program:\n\n1. The dietary scale to include for the time being an addition to the breakfast porridge, of the pupils, of Pacific canned milk and sugar, pending the slaughter of the old cows at present in use and the purchase of three good milch cows to take their place;\n\n2. The slaughter of two old cows, a scrub bull and two ill-nourished calves for meat for the institution\n\n3. This discontinuance of stock-raising at this school.\non account of insufficient accommodation and pasturage, etc.\n\n4. To recommend that the Department provide three good milk cows for the school.\n\n5. The school Inspector and Indian Agent to write a joint letter to the Principal setting forth for the regulation of the Indians visiting the school the times and conditions under which the pupils may be visited by their parents.\n\n6. Suggestions left with the Sisters to make provision each day for proper and sufficient exercise.\n\n7. In disciplining the pupils the Sisters were advised to use great care and discretion. In this connection we found no serious grounds for complaint.\n\n8. With reference to the clothing of pupils, it was decided that while it was not desired that parents should be discouraged from making gifts of clothing, shoes, etc., to their pupil-children, provision for the comfort of the pupils in this regard to be made by the staff, in accordance with existing regulations.\n\n9. It was decided that the annual summer vacation should commence on August 1st each year and continue until the opening of the public schools for the Province.\n\n10. That a male teacher be appointed for the boys' classroom.\n\nThe foregoing adjustments, it is thought, will remedy in the main any grievances the Indians may have against the conduct of the institution.\n\nIn addition to the suggested arrangements referred to, the question has arisen on the part of the Church Authorities regarding the payment of the salary of the resident Engineer, who looks after the boilers and electric lights. The Reverend Father Welch, Vicar of Missions, has suggested that provision be made by the Department for the payment of this salary, which amounts to $900.00 per year. He has further suggested that the per capita grant for this Institution be increased by the Department. These suggestions open up to us a rather difficult problem, for, having no data which would enable us to make comparisons, between the various educational institutions, as to their mode and cost of operation, it is difficult for us to determine whether or not the Department should be asked to follow the suggestions made by the Reverend Father Welch. We would gladly do so, however, if it is found, upon investigation, in the Department where the records would likely be available that the grant at present being paid towards the operation of this Institution falls appreciably short of those made to other institutions.\n\nIn conclusion, we desire to say that when meeting the Indians we made very clear to them the fact that the Department is exceedingly anxious that this school should be conducted along efficient lines; that there should be harmony and co-operation between the Indians and the officers of the School. We advised them also that should any occasion for complaint arise in the future, representation in this regard should be justly and properly made, first to the Principal by the aggrieved parent or guardian individually. We made it clear that we felt they were not justified as a band in taking the drastic action they did; also that it was not likely that the Department would, in the future, allow an institution which costs...\nwhich costs so much to build, furnish and equip to be detrimentally impeded in its operation through the caprice and whims which may seize the Sechelt Band, particularly as there are in the Province of British Columbia many Roman Catholic children, whose parents would gladly have them enter this institution as pupils. On the other hand we advised them that the complaints made by them on this occasion would be thoughtfully and carefully considered and the Reverend Sisters gave their assurance that any causes of legitimate complaint would be effectively remedied, which they did, resulting in the return of all the pupils who were that day in the village, numbering in all thirty-one, immediately. The Indians further promised that the remaining pupils, bringing the enrolment up to seventy-four would be returned by the parents, who were residing at the Camps along Jervis Inlet.\n\nWe are daily expecting to receive word from the Reverend Principal that the balance of the pupils have returned, the Indians appearing to be quite satisfied with the investigation made.\n\nWe beg to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools\nfor British Columbia........\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharles C. Perry,\nIndian Agent, Vancouver Agency, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 287-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 1928\n\nThe Honorable Duncan Scott\nIndian Department\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nDoubtless you are aware that so far not one Beekelt child is in the school and the Indians refuse absolutely to send them back unless a thorough investigation is instantly made into the management.\n\nTheir grievances are of long standing; they have reported them over and again to the late Mr. Peter Byrne, but the good old gentleman, who died not like the idea of annoying any, specially the sisters, always managed to send the poor Indians home with the promise that he would take the matter into consideration.\n\nOn the 5th of January 1921, taking the occasion of the official visit of Mr. Burns, Inspector of the Indian schools, they held a meeting in his presence in chief Julius' house and exposed to him their complaints against the school.\nIn the summer of the same year they made two petitions, one to Mr. Evans and the other to another principal of St. Paul's school North Vancouver as she is the head superior in charge of the sisters, requesting that a change be made into the staff of the school.\n\nLast winter they wrote to their new agent, Mr. B.C., Percy, asking again for a change or acceleration in the way of feeding, educating and correcting these children. During the last vacations I am told that they notified the authorities that unless they gave their instant attention to their reiterated grievances they would not send their children back to school.\n\nI spoke myself many times to my own superior, Rev. Walter J. Welch, who is supposed to look after the interests of the Indians of the ever-increasing bad feelings which the Indians have towards the management of the school. But the good holy priest, much in the same low disposition as was the late Peter Byrne, thinks almost impossible for the \"good sisters\" to be unfair, were unintentionally, to the Indian children. As missionary priest of Sechelt and chaplain of the school, looking after the spiritual...\nspiritual interest of both the Sisters and the Indians; my position is quite a crucial one. I see and hear everything; we must be fair, impartial and just. The Indians are not to blame altogether. There is something defective, and very defective in the management of the Sechelt boarding school regarding the food, the education of the boys and discipline. The food is what it should be and what the Indian Department wants it to be in the quantity and quality. For instance, for breakfast the whole year round, one plate of thick mush without milk or sugar, but salt with one single piece of dried bread, no butter or anything else on it, and a cup of tea. The same is said of the supper or any other meals, never more than a poor plate of soup with one piece of dried bread, no matter how big or hungry may be the child then or sick. The teacher of the big boys is an old French Sister (they are French) over 65 years of age who can hardly speak English and have been since the opening of the Sechelt school in 1904. The discipline is by far too rigid & do not think that the penitentiary guards of Westminster handle their convicts more roughly than some sisters do the Indian boys here. The Indians are very well satisfied with\nwith Sister Gavina, teacher of the girls and speak highly of her, only they would like to have the girls learning cooking before leaving the school.\n\nI must apologize for my liberty of writing you and such a long one for the first time in my life to the Indian Department, though I have been for over 25 years in charge of Indians in B.C. I hope you will understand that I think it important to do justice done to everyone, no matter his race, his color or creed.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour respectful and humble servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. V. Lamondon\nOttawa, Dec. 3, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Cairns:\n\nI have the report on the Sechelt Indian Residential School, signed jointly by yourself and Mr. Perry. I learned, with regret, that the Rev. Father Walsh was not able to accompany you to the school at the time of our investigation. I was sorry to learn that there has been friction between the staff and the missionary and the Indians on the reserve, but I have noted, with satisfaction, that steps were taken to surmount the present difficulty.\n\nYour remedial measures, relative to the children's diet, the rules for visitors, recreation for the children and school discipline, are approved. You should also insist on a properly qualified teacher for the boys' classroom. I am authorizing Mr. Agent Perry to secure three good milch cows and deliver them to the school.\n\nI am pleased to note that the members of the Band have been censured for their drastic action in withdrawing their children from the school and I trust that, in future, petty troubles will receive a rapid adjustment.\n\nYou, in company with Mr. Perry, should make another visit to the Sechelt Indian Residential School in the near future, when your duties permit, and a special report should be forwarded to the Department in due course. In the meanwhile, I should be pleased if you would make recommendations relative to management and finance, so that the Department can take remedial measures of a permanent nature. A similar letter is being addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Perry.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 402, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.

Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Agent Perry have lately reported, following inspection and an enquiry on the first ultimo.\n\nI am arranging for remedial measures and I trust that conditions at Sechelt will be greatly improved in the very near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I was sorry to learn that there has been friction between the staff and the missionary and the Indians on the reserve; but I have noted, with satisfaction, that steps were taken to surmount the present difficulty.\n\nYour action, relative to the children's diet, the rules for visitors, recreation for the children and school discipline, is approved. The Principal of the school is being informed of the Department's attitude in this connection. I am insisting on a properly qualified teacher for the boys' classroom.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase three good milch cows and have them delivered to the school. You should secure the advice of Mr. Arthur Morton, 419 Duncan Building, Vancouver, B. C., local representative of the Livestock Branch of the Department of Agriculture, who will inform you as to the best source of supply. You will please incur no unnecessary expense.\n\nI have noted, with satisfaction, that the members of the Band have been censured for their drastic action in withdrawing their children from the school, and I trust that, in future, petty troubles will receive a rapid adjustment.\n\nI have suggested to Mr. Cairns that you should make another visit to the Sechelt Indian Residential School in the near future and forward a second special report at that time. In the meantime I should be pleased if you would make recommendations, relative to management and finance, so that the Department can take remedial measures of a permanent nature. I have written, also, to Mr. Inspector Cairns.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nChas. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 404, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, Dec. 7, 1923.\n\nDear Father Welsh:\n\nI have received from Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Indian Agent Perry a special report on the Sechelt Indian Residential School. I was sorry that you were unable to accompany them at the time of their investigation. I am writing to the Sister Superior, insisting on additions to the children's diet, definite rules for visitors and approving of the suggestions of the Department officers, relative to recreation of the children and school discipline. Further, a properly qualified teacher for the boys' classroom must be appointed. To assist the school for the time being, I have directed Mr. Agent Perry to purchase and deliver three good milch cows.\n\nThe future of this institution is giving me much concern and I should be pleased if you would make recommendations, relative to management and finance, so that I can take remedial measures of a permanent nature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. John Welsh, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nOttawa, Dec. 7, 1923.\n\nDear Sister Gabriel:\n\nFor some weeks I have been much concerned because of the unusual situation at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. The report of Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Indian Agent Perry has been received and I wish to urge that their recommendations guide you in the management of the institution. You should spare no effort to provide food for the children, that is adequate in quality and quantity. To assist you, I have authorized Mr. Indian Agent Perry to purchase and deliver three good milk cows.\n\nThe instructions of our local representatives, relative to visitors at the school; their suggestions for the children's recreation and their advice in the matter of school discipline should be incorporated in the regular routine and management. Further, I have to insist on a properly qualified teacher in the boys' classroom. If you have not already made a change, you should do so without delay.\n\nI am corresponding with our representatives and with the Rev. Father Welsh, in an effort to determine what remedial measures of a more permanent nature can be undertaken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSechelt, B. C.\nSekhelt Indian Boarding School\nSekhelt December 2nd 1923\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour favor No 167-18-1 of the 7th inst. was duly received. In answer, I beg to say that Reverend Father J. Welch is presently at Sekhelt to settle the matter; and he has come to the conclusion that a male Principal should take the charge of the school. To this we have no objection and I promise that the members of the staff will devote themselves, in the future, as well as they have done for these twenty past years. Unfortunately, for the two last years there have been some misunderstandings and, I regret to say, that we have not been supported in our work by the one who has some influence over the Indians.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours respectfully,\nSister Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Duncan Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOttawa\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n27th December, 1923.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 7th, in which you ask me to make recommendations relative to management and finance at Sechelt, I am pleased to say that I have gone fully into these questions, and am satisfied that a promising solution has been reached.\n\nThe week before Christmas Messrs. Ditchburn, Cairns, Perry and myself spent a whole afternoon in the Indian Agent's Office discussing the Sechelt situation. The resolutions passed at this meeting will doubtless be submitted to you by Mr. Perry. It was left to me to interview Mother Gabriel and Mother Amy, and also the Indians to try and arrive at a settlement with them. This I did without delay.\n\nAs regards the Indians the main difficulties were the diet and the management. They insisted particularly on having a male principal. On two different occasions I went thoroughly into this matter with Rev. Mothers Amy and Gabriel and they finally completely agreed with me that it would be in the best interests of the school for the Oblates to take over the management and place the school on the same footing as Kamloops, if they were acceptable to you. But let me assure you that I was not anxious to assume this responsibility. In consenting to it my sole purpose was to put an end to the friction which has arisen between the present staff and the Indians, and at the same time to meet the wishes of the Department, and yourself in particular.\n\nWith this object in view I have carefully looked through this Province for a competent principal and manager, and now respectfully request you to approve of the appointment of Rev. Anthony Swenceski, O.M.I. He is of Polish descent, 40 years of age, but came to British Columbia when a mere child, so that practically he has lived all his life in this province. I may say that he is quite a mechanic and a carpenter and in these capacities will devote himself to the technical training of the boys. What Father McGuire is doing in Kamloops, as far as conditions will permit I believe Father Anthony will accomplish in Sechelt.\n\nYou ask for a qualified teacher for the boys. Unhesitatingly I recommend for the bigger boys and girls Mother Gabriel. To assist the Principal in maintaining discipline I purpose giving him Brother Joseph who has had considerable experience with the boys in the Cariboo School.\n\nThe Indians have promised to send all their children back to school after the Christmas holidays, and to wait\npatiently pending the arrival of a male principal.\n\nIn conclusion let me say that I take it for granted that the school will be placed in Class \"A\", and that you will approve of the suggestions submitted by Messrs. Ditchburn, Cairns and Perry.\n\nThanking you for your Season's Greetings which I most sincerely reciprocate, I am,\n\nVery respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 7th instant, No.4167-18-1, with reference to the desired suggestions as to better management and financing at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply thereto I beg to inform you that the whole situation has been carefully discussed with the Reverend Father Welch, Mr. School Inspector Cairns, and the Chief Inspector of Indian Agencies, Mr. W.M. Ditchburn, both individually and in conference. Every phase of the present situation has been carefully considered with the result that we have reached a decision as to our recommendations in this connection to be made for your consideration. These are as follows:\n\n1. That the Institution be placed in Class A, with the status of an Industrial Boarding School, with the maximum grant.\n\n2. The school to be placed under the Principalship of a male principal to be appointed by the Oblate representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, the school to be no longer under the Principalship supervision of Sisters. This has been agreed to by the Sisters themselves. Under this arrangement the Reverend Principal will be assisted in the training of the pupils by the resident priest, who himself has considerable experience along the lines of manual and carpentry work. It is proposed to place Rev. Father Anthony, who is now at Fernie, in charge of the school, this Father being, it is believed, the desired qualifications to fit him for the position. With this program the proposal to have a male teacher in the classroom will be eliminated and the institutional and classroom work will be done by Reverend Sisters, under the supervision of the principal, with the understanding that every effort be made to raise the classroom work to a higher standard of efficiency.\n\n3. That a piece of land in area approximately two and a half acres be acquired by lease (subject to survey) from Dan Faull, the recognized owner, at Swycaise Reserve No. 1, in George Bay, at a rental of $25.00 per acre per year for at least three years, to which proposal Dan Faull has agreed. The entire three years rental to be paid in advance as soon as\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nthe area of the land has been ascertained. This land will be used for necessary garden purposes.\n\n4. That the sum of $1000.00 be immediately made available to the Indian Agent for the purpose of blasting stumps and clearing an additional acre for garden purposes at the school grounds, in order that the same may be placed under cultivation for the supply of vegetables etc., for the school. This recommendation, as well as No.3 is made with the assumption that the Department will proceed with the proposed Water Supply scheme which, it is understood, has been the subject of correspondence between Mr. Chief Inspector Ditchburn and the Department. As soon as additional land has been cleared in the immediate vicinity of the school and a suitable irrigation arrangement has been installed, the land referred to in recommendation No.3 would be vacated and the immediate school grounds further cultivated.\n\n5. That a small boat with an engine, to cost approximately $600.00 be furnished this school, the same to be used under supervision of Rev. Father Flamondon for the purpose of carrying fish, primarily, for the school supply, and in order that the boys of the school may be taught by the Reverend Father how to operate and care for marine engines, which knowledge will be useful to them after they leave the school, as most of the Indians make use of motor boats in connection with their fishing.\n\nUp to the present time the girl pupils of the school have received no training along the lines of baking although the institution is equipped with valuable bakery apparatus which has never been used. Under the proposed industrial status of this school, attention will be given to the training of the girls along this line as well as laundry and other household arts.\n\nIt is believed that the carrying into effect of the foregoing recommendations will result in the entire elimination of the present difficulties surrounding this school as well as the attainment of higher standards of efficiency as desired by all concerned. We would recommend that these proposals be given the earliest possible consideration and, if approved by the Department, their immediate application would ensure the certain response of the Indians, which seems to so vitally affect the future usefulness of this institution.\n\nWe have the honour to remain,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servants,\n\nH.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent, Vancouver Agency.\nJanuary 4, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI have carefully examined the suggestions of Mr. Inspector Cairns, Mr. Indian Agent Perry and Rev. Father Welch, for the future of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and I wish to recommend the following action:\n\n1. That the school be placed under the control of the Oblate Fathers and have as its principal a resident Priest. The Rev. Father Svecoski, O.M.I., is available for this duty and would be given by the Order a lay Brother to assist in boys' activity.\n\n2. That the Department make a grant of $1,000 for the purpose of clearing land at the school for garden purposes and that in the meantime a few acres on Porpoise Bay (Reserve No. 3) be rented.\n\n3. That a small boat, to cost approximately $600, be given the school, to be used for the purpose of securing fish, which are not found in the immediate vicinity, and for the training of the boys in the care and handling of such craft.\n\n4. That the new principal be urged to use all the equipment in the building, that is designed for the purpose of instructing the girls in the domestic activities and that organized instruction be given the boys in gardening, the care of stock, fishing and the handling of a boat.\n\n5. That the per capita grant be increased to that of the Industrial School class.\n\nI am hopeful that this program, if carried out, will permit the Sechelt Indian Residential School to give adequate instruction and care to the pupils and to finance successfully on the per capita earnings. The present management of the school has agreed to the appointment of a principal from the Oblate Order.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 4, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nThe Sechelt Indian Residential School, in British Columbia, has lost during the past year or two some of its popularity with the Indian communities. Investigations have revealed the fact that a change in the management is desirable. The Sisters who have been in charge and the Provincial of the Oblate Order are agreed that the appointment of a resident priest as principal is desirable. Changes are being made in the instruction offered; and the institution is being placed in the Industrial School class and will receive a larger per capita grant. The preparation of a larger garden is imperative and I shall be pleased to have your authority to allow a grant of $1,000 for clearing purposes. The work will be performed under the supervision of the Indian agent. A small boat with an engine is required for the supplying of fish, which are not to be found in the waters immediately in front of the school; it will be useful in the training of the older boys in the handling of marine boats and engines. It is estimated that $600 will secure suitable equipment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your authority to authorize this expense.

Father Welch. I am pleased to inform you that arrangements have been made to allow a per capita grant of $170 for this institution. I have also arranged for the Oblate Fathers to assume the responsibility for the management, and the temporary appointment of Rev. Father Anthony Sadowski, O.M.I., has been approved.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase a small gasoline boat for the use of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. This equipment should be used not only for fishing activity but for the training of the boys. You should secure competitive prices from the best local sources of supply, and when presenting the voucher in favour of the firm given the business, you should support it with either an abstract of tender form or a complete explanation of the manner in which the business was awarded. Your estimate of $500 should be a guide to you in this connection.\n\nPlease arrange at an early date for clearing operations on land at the school which can be used later for gardening. You should secure as foreman for this work someone who is qualified to blast stumps, and you would be well advised to engage members of the Indian Band for the rough labour. If it is advisable to use the older boys at the school for some of this work, please instruct the foreman you engage to take precautionary measures to see that they receive no injury.\n\nYou may arrange for the rental of the 2-1/2 acres at Squamish Reserve No. 3, which is owned by Dan Paul. The Department will allow a special grant of $25 per acre per annum for three years. You should secure the concurrence of the new Principal before making the arrangements for this land.\n\nI am instructing the new Principal to make organized efforts at vocational training for both the boys and girls, and you should give this your hearty support and co-operation upon the conclusion of your visit to the institution.\n\nI am sending a copy\n\nPlease inform Mr. Inspector Cairns of the contents of this communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 10, 1924.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to conditions at the Sechelt Indian Residential School and I am grateful to you for your co-operation and offer of assistance.\n\nI have been in correspondence with our local officers and with the present Sister Superior and I am now pleased to offer you, as the representative of the Oblate Fathers, the responsibility for the satisfactory management of the school.

In this connection and with reference to reports and correspondence between this office and the Department, I beg to say that Mr. School-Inspector Cairns and I visited Sechelt this week and inspected the school and as a result of our dealings with the Indians, concerning the non-return of the school of about thirty pupils, an important report will be submitted to the Department as soon as Mr. Cairns and I have had a further interview with Rev. Father Welch.\n\nI would inform you that while about forty pupils have so far returned to school, following the trouble, there are still Indians who refuse to return their children until their demands which were embodied in subsequent recommendations to the Department have been met. The Indians, at a very strenuous and tense meeting, further demand the removal of Sister Gabriel and Sister St. Dennis, and have threatened to empty the school completely unless this demand is met.\n\nIt is our intention to again go into this matter very fully with Rev. Father Welch after which Mr. Cairns and I will make a joint report. It is anticipated from an interview, of Mr. Cairns and myself, with Rev. Sister Gabriel that the latter will leave the institution in July next, and it is expected that new appointments of teachers to this school will be the outcome of our interview with Rev. Father Welch as referred to.\n\nWhile we feel that the Indians' demands as such ought not to be encouraged for obvious reasons, the fact remains that the trouble at this school will not be over until further arrangements of a mutual character are made, having in view the better conduct and control over this institution.\n\nEvery effort.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nEvery effort is being made by Mr. Cairns and myself to cooperate with the Church Authorities in bringing about the desired results. The Indians expressed satisfaction with the recommendations which have been jointly made to the Department and further stated that the removal of the two Sisters referred to would result in the school being completely filled up to capacity and the return of harmonious relations in every particular.\n\nIt is not desired that this report should be acted upon; it is simply sent for the Department's information. I would request that the Department await the joint report of Mr. Cairns and myself, which we will make after a discussion with Rev.

SWENCESKI PRINCIPAL.\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\nJuly 28th, 1924.\n\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn May 27th, 1917, all the buildings of the Sechelt Indian Boarding School were burnt down. I had insured the main building for $3,000.00, and the furniture for $3,000.00 also. I paid the insurance for many years. After the fire had occurred, the Insurance Co. gave me $6,000.00.\n\nAs, for a moment, the reopening of the School was uncertain, the Indian Department asked me to send to Ottawa the amount of the insurance on the building, that is $3,000.00 to be put to the credit of the Sechelt Band.\n\nThe $3,000.00 of the furniture were left to us, being our own property, since we had furnished the house with everything; all we saved from the fire was above.\n\nSoon afterwards, however, it was decided that the School would continue and that temporary buildings would be erected for the boys and the girls, as well as a well-built cottage for the Staff and the sick children. The Government, left for that purpose, the sum of $3,000.00; amount of the insurance on the building and granted $300.00 as a help.\nWe need also for the temporary buildings, the cottage and furniture, our $3000.00, together with the donations of relatives and friends, as shown by the enclosed amount.\n\nWe had when the fire occurred six good cows, about sixty hens and seventy chickens, which, of course, were left for the use of the School.\n\nAs we have no longer the direction of the Sechelt School, we earnestly beg the Government to settle this matter and to refund to us the value of our belongings on the School.\n\nWe have run this School for twenty years, working with an untiring devotedness for the welfare of the children and their parents. When we started in June 1864, the main building alone was standing, there was nothing in it, and no land cleared around. With the boys' help we did ourselves the clearing and planting of the garden and orchards. From 1864 to 1872, the Grant being only $5.00 per capita, we could not take any salary, we were even helped by our Community in France.\n\nAfter 1872, when the Grant was increased, we took a very small salary, as can be seen in the accounts of the Sechelt School, just enough to buy our clothes and meet the necessary expenses.\n\nLate Dr. Green, Inspector, and Mr. P. Byrne, Agent, knew all our hard beginnings; Mr. Hutchburn and Mr. Cairns have seen us for many years and know how hard we have worked.\n\nWe are confident that you will kindly take all these things into consideration and recommend our petition to the Government.\n\nAs I am going back to France by the middle of August, I would ask you to be kind enough as to send payment to Mother Amy, Superior Provincial and Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School, North Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith anticipated thanks, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nSister Therese, Superior General\nEx-Principal of the Sechelt Indian Board School\nReceipts and Expenditure\nof the Sechelt Indian Boarding School\nfor temporary buildings, cottage furniture in 1872.\n\nReceipts.\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Insurance money on the buildings                  | 3000.00|\n| Government Grant                                  | 800.00 |\n| Insurance Money on the furniture (belonging to Sisters) | 2000.00|\n| Donations of the Sisters' relations and friends   | 1340.00|\n| From the School Grant                             | 164.83 |\n| **Total**                                        | **8294.83** |\n\nExpenditure.\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Workmen's Wages                                  | 5621.43|\n| Lumber, Paint, Windows, Doors, Cement, etc.      | 3450.15|\n| Furniture                                        | 1242.11|\n| **Total**                                        | **8294.83** |\n\nSisters' Account.\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Insurance money on the furniture                 | 3000.00|\n| Donations of relations and friends               | 1340.00|\n| 6 cows                                          | 400.00 |\n| Hens and chickens                                | 75.00  |\n| **Total**                                        | **4815.00** |\n\nSister Theretina, Superior General\nEx-Principal of the Sechelt Indian Boarding School\n597 McDermot Avenue, WINNIPEG, Man.\n\nAugust 4th, 1924.\n\nMr Duncan C.

Mother Th\u00e9r\u00e9sine, Ex-Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School and presently, Superior General of her Community, to forward you the accompanying letter and statement.\n\nAs you can easily judge by the contents the story of the Sisters is a very sad one. After having worked over twenty years and placed large sums of money (including special gifts from friends and relatives) for the benefit of the school, and see themselves practically turned away from the direction of the school, without the least remuneration, seems an almost unbearable situation.\n\nI have told Very Rev. Mother Th\u00e9r\u00e9sine, on her passage in Ottawa, June last, that you were very kind and sensible, and therefore, would take into consideration any reasonable request. I understand by the letter that she would ask for $4,815.00.\n\nI leave the whole matter to your kind and fair judgment and hope that a satisfactory solution will be reached. Please note for your own information that the Rev. Mother will be at St Paul's School (Squamish) North Vancouver, until the 14th inst and will reach Ottawa about the 23rd inst.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJoseph Seybert.\nMontreal, August 25th 1934\n\nDr. Duncan Scott\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter the fire had occurred at the Sechelt Indian School, we built a cottage for the staff and the sick children. We put about $1,800.00 of our own money in it. This cottage is a good solid frame building on concrete foundations, it has a good hot water heating plant. It comprises in the basement, a big room which was used as a store-room, the furnace-room and another small room; on the first floor, three bedrooms and a bath-room; the same on the second floor.\n\nSince the erection of the new school building, this Cottage has been occupied by our Novices, but as our Novitiate is going to be transferred elsewhere, we would be very thankful to the Indian Department if this cottage could be bought from us by the Government for the use of the Indian School.\n\nI am leaving for France, therefore this matter should be treated with Mother Amy, Principal of the Residential Squamish School at North Vancouver, and\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSuperior Provincial of the Sisters.\n\nTrusting that my request will be granted,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSister Theresa\n\nEx-Principal of the Sackville Indian School,\nand Superior General of the Sisters of the Child Jesus.\nSquamish Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\nSept. 2, 1874.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter the fire had occurred at\nthe Sechelt Indian School, we built a cottage for the\nstaff and the sick children.

Sister Mary Alix, with the request that the same be forwarded to the Department.\n\nIn explanation of the fact that this letter appeared to have been dictated by a third party, who desired that the matter therein referred to be negotiated with Mother Amy at North Vancouver, while at the same time the letter was signed by Sister Mary Amy, I was informed by Rev. Sister Alix that the Superior General of the Sisters, who recently returned to France, dictated this letter without signing it and left it with Rev. Mother Mary Amy to deliver here. Sister Alix also informed me that the Superior General had called upon Dr. Scott at Ottawa on her way back to France and that Dr. Scott had advised her to have this letter sent to the Department through the office of the Indian Agent at Vancouver, under which circumstances I now beg to present the letter accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.O. Perry,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1924.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Perry has forwarded your letter of the 2nd instant, which is a copy of a communication I have received from the Very Rev. Sister Theresine, Superior General, following her visit to Ottawa. I have given very careful consideration to the question of reimbursing the Sisters of Child Jesus for the expenditure incurred in the erection of a cottage at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. There are no funds available at the present time; but, when future budgets are being prepared, your request will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Amy,\nPrincipal,\nSquamish Indian Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI have your No. 3-96 of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from Sister Mary Amy, Mother General of the Sisters of Child Jesus, with reference to a cottage that has been built by the Sisters at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. I had already received this communication over the signature of the Very Rev. Sister Theresime, Superior General of the Order, and I have written to Sister Mary Amy direct.\n\nI should be pleased if you would make a valuation of this cottage at your convenience, giving a full description and reporting on its present use. I am returning the copy of the letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoom 404, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSquamish Residential School\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\nOct. 9th 1924\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of the 29th ult. In answer I beg to thank you for the careful consideration you have given to the question of reimbursing our Community for the expenditure incurred in the erection of the Cottage at Sechelt. We hope you will plead our cause before the members of the Department, as you always have done, and we trust that your request shall be granted.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kindness and courtesy, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\nSister Mary Amy\nPrincipal\nWith reference to your letter of Sept. 29th last, No.167-18-1, in connection with the suggested purchase by the Department of the building adjacent to the Sechelt Indian Residential School, as reported upon by The Very Reverend Sister Therese, Superior General of our Order and the Sisters of the Child Jesus, and requesting a report from me as to the building and its necessity as an adjunct to the school, I beg to say that my visit to Sechelt has been somewhat delayed owing to the fact that the Indians visit Sechelt only at certain times of the year, during the festivals of the Roman Catholic Church and as the Indians were all assembled at Christmas and all the business of this nature was undertaken at that time, I thought it would be satisfactory to investigate the matter of this building during my visit at Christmas time.\n\nWith regard to this matter, I now beg to report that I have made a very careful examination of the building and find the same to be in most excellent condition and the description given in the correspondence already in the Department relating to its conveniences and construction are in all points correct. The building is almost as good as new as it has been kept since the time of construction in excellent condition.\n\nI consider this building to be a necessary adjunct to the School as its rooms and general facilities adequately and not with difficulty accommodate the male members of the staff who are working in connection with the school, and for whom there is no convenient accommodation in the school building proper. In addition to the reverend principal there are four men occupying the rooms of this building and I am heartily in accord with its acquisition by the Department in connection with the institution.\n\nAs to the value to be placed on the building I discussed this matter with the Rev. Father Anthony and the Rev. Father J. Hammond, O.M.I., by whom I was informed that the Rev. John Welch, O.M.I., Vicar of Roman Catholic Missions had informed the Principal that this building when constructed was paid for partly by the Department and partly by the Reverend Sisters of the Order. They understood that the cost of the building was $5000.00 and towards this expenditure the Department had contributed the sum of $1500.00. Whether this information is correct or not may best be determined through the records of the Department which were current prior to my incumbency here.\n\nIt is probable.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., M.M.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt is probable, however, having in view the statement of the Reverend Sister that approximately $4500.00 of their own money had been put into this building, there may have been expenditures in connection with the construction work and above that which had been furnished by the Department and the Sisters, to which Father Welch may not be aware. It was noticed that the building was plastered and installed with electric light wiring, but I cannot say whether or not the cost of this was included in the figures quoted by the Reverend Father Welch.\n\nPrima facie the building had the appearance to me of being well worth the sum of $2500.00 as a second hand concern, but not being more than a casual observer in building matters, I could not determine with exactitude what would be the actual worth of this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 3, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge and thank you for your No. 106 of the 16th ultimo, relative to the cottage at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J'esp\u00e8re que vous nous continuerez votre paternelle protection et que vous plaiderez notre cause pour que l'argent que nous avons mis dans le cottage de Sechelt nous soit rembours\u00e9. J'ai \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Duncan-Scott \u00e0 ce sujet, et il m'a promis de faire tout ce qu'il pourrait; mais je suis s\u00fbr que si vous soufflez un mot \u00e0 l'oreille de ce cher Monsieur, il vous c\u00e9derait et obtiendrait que nous rentions dans nos fonds.\n\nVoil\u00e0, croyez-vous, nous sommes pauvres. Voil\u00e0 bient\u00f4t-trente ans que nous travaillons parmi les Indiens et, apr\u00e8s ce laps de temps, nous nous trouvons dans le gouffre. Ce n'est pas, mon Reverend P\u00e8re, que je d\u00e9sire les richesses ou non, pas le moins du monde! Ce que je voudrais, ce serait une maison spacieuse et confortable pour nos leurs anciennes ou infirmes et, cela, impossible de le leur procurer puisque, encore une fois, nous n'avons pas de fonds. Quant \u00e0 emprunter, comme on me le conseille, je ne le ferai pas, parce que je pr\u00e9vois que je ne pourrais payer les int\u00e9r\u00eats. C'est pourquoi, mon Reverend P\u00e8re, je fais encore appel \u00e0 votre bienveillance pour nous obtenir qu'un moindre l'argent que nous avons d\u00e9bourser \u00e0 Sechelt nous soit rendu.\n\nC'est dans l'espoir que vous ferez tout ce qui d\u00e9pendra de vous que je me dis,\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s humble et tr\u00e8s reconnaissante\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\nNorth Vancouver, B. C.,\nJanuary 14th, 1925.\n\nReverend Father Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI do not want to let the month of January go by without sending my best wishes for the New Year and at the same time I wish to thank you for the interest you have taken in our school. I hope that you will continue your faithful protection and will plead our case so that the money which we have expended on the cottage at Sechelt be refunded to us. I have written to Mr. Duncan C. Scott about this matter and he has promised me that he would do all he could, but I am sure that if you said a word about it to him he would listen to you and we would soon be refunded.\n\nYou know how poor we are, we have been working for thirty years among these Indians and after this long time we remain penniless, it is not, Reverend Father, that we desire richness not by any means. What wish, would be a house large and comfortable for the old and infirm Sisters and this is impossible for us to get as we have no funds. I do not wish to borrow as I have been advised to do as I am sure I would be unable to pay the interest.\n\nThis is why, Reverend Father, I appeal to your devotedness to obtain for us at least the money which we have spent at Sechelt.\n\nIn the hope that you will do your best for us, I remain\n\nHumbly and thankfully\nSister Aimee of Maria Provincial.\nOttawa, February 14, 1925.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nPlease find enclosed letter sent to me by Reverend Sister Aim\u00e9e, Provincial of the Sisters of the Infant-Jesus, stationed at North Vancouver and Sechelt.\n\nYou will remember the visits of the Reverend Mother General in the course of last year relative to certain matters which have crept up in connection with the transfer of direction of the School. The present letter is another request and I hope that you will give to it your very favourable attention.\n\nKindly advise me of any step which you find proper to take in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure.\nMarch 11th, 1925.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo, with further reference to the request of Sister Mary Amy, Mother Provincial of the Sisters of Child Jesus. She was informed some months ago that, in view of the need for economy, no promise of favourable consideration could be made. At the present time funds are extremely limited, and the re-imbursement of the Sisters for the cottage at the Sechelt Indian Residential School cannot be considered now. I shall be pleased to know, however, where the Order proposes to erect a home for the aged Sisters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. D. McLEAN\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

I know you have informed me that the funds of the Department are extremely limited at the present time, but I expect that in the near future you will use all your influence in the Department in favor of the Sisters of the Child Jesus.\n\nAs I have told you already we have been working among the Indians some for 27 years, others 25 and 30 years doing our utmost for their welfare, and we are ready to continue the task to the end. But unfortunately we are growing old and some shall not be able to work much longer, and I am sorry to say that I have not even a decent lodging where to shelter the aged sisters.\n\nMy intention was to erect a home for them in North Vancouver close to the school, but I have not the means to do so and I do not want to run into debt.\n\nTherefore, I beg of you dear Sir, to bring again my request before the Department and be so kind as to plead our cause as you have already done many a time.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Amy\nPosticia\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\nUNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA\n\nOttawa, May 19, 1925.\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Her letter was supposed to be an answer to a request for more definite information regarding a previous demand for reimbursement of money invested in a cottage at Sechelt.\n\nI leave the whole matter to your judgment and hope that you will do your utmost to help the devoted Sisters in their present difficult circumstances.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, File 887-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 30, 1925.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing a communication from Sister Mary Amy, of North Vancouver, requesting the Department to reimburse the Sisters at Sechelt for the erection of the cottage.

The visit of the clergy to these Indians gave them much encouragement for they were all in a very happy frame of mind and our business was transacted in a very decorous and friendly way.\n\nIt was pleasing also to observe that the trouble in evidence a short while ago between the Indians and the Boarding School Staff had entirely subsided and the relationship existing between the school and the Indians was most friendly and harmonious.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

You will remember that I had correspondence with you some two years ago in this connection. I have very kind thoughts with regard to the Rev. Father Rohr and recognize the important contribution he has made to the Indians of the province; but I hesitate to approve of his appointment to Sechelt because of his advancing years.

James McCaffrey as Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School, to succeed Rev. Father Barney, who is retiring on account of ill health.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[C.C. Perry]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nMay I respectfully enquire whether, as Principal of Sechelt Residential School, I have authority to compel attendance at school of our pupils, till they have arrived at the age of eighteen years? I find that in the past the parents have withdrawn their children as soon as they reached the age of sixteen years. Whatever may have been the conditions that demanded or sanctioned this custom, I am of the belief that it is objectionable, and for the following reasons, viz., that it is not to the best interests of the children themselves and that the interests of the school as an institution require that they remain longer in residence.\n\nIn the first place, at the age of sixteen they are physically, mentally and morally unfit to face life as maintains among their people. Experience has taught us that, especially among the boys, they have been, with few exceptions, idlers, for all of two years, after having left school.\n\nAlong this rock coast of British Columbia, they can find no other occupation, than what is offered in the fishing and logging camps. Because of their youth, their inexperience and their all-too-often undermined constitutions, they are not wanted in these industries. At best they can obtain only temporary employment in the canneries, at certain seasons.\nSo far, none of our children have made progress further than the sixth book, which hardly corresponds to fifth grade work. From the age of sixteen on is, therefore, more vital for such progress in school work. From the moral point of view, they have barely begun to grasp the significance of Christian principles, when they are snatched from our influence. It is a noted fact that the Indians have little or no control over the children in the home, after a certain age. The school discipline, as you know, makes for a better and more orderly citizenry, and thus the years under restraint are invaluable from the point of view of law and order later on.\n\nThe girls of our school are trained in needle work, domestic science and the like, while the boys do gardening, shoe repairing and cleaning of the land, of dead-wood and timber. On account of the restricted (eighty) number of our pupils, comparatively few are of age to participate in the heavier work. For instance, this year we have five boys who will have attained the age of sixteen by the first of August current; not one of them, is fit to leave, and take his place in the world, and in sheer justice to themselves, should remain longer at school.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I would beg of you to issue to me the necessary authority to retain these five boys on the roll of the school.\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSechelt Residential School,\nSechelt, B.C.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in connection with the age at which children should be discharged from the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nYou will note from an examination of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act that, legally, the Department can only enforce the attendance of Indian children at school from age seven until they reach the age of sixteen. However, the Department agrees with you that the majority of residential school pupils will considerably benefit by remaining in such schools until they reach the age of eighteen years and, in some cases, it might be advisable to have them remain even longer. Indian Agents, Principals and others interested in Indian education are expected to make every possible endeavour to persuade parents to leave their children in residential schools for a longer period than that prescribed by the Indian Act. The cases of any parents who insist on the discharge of their children at the age of sixteen should be referred to the Department through the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. McCaffrey, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSECHELT, B.C.\nSechelt School ------- Reverend Father McCaffrey's reply was not as satisfactory as I would have wished, as he was of the opinion that it would be a mistake to give Coast Indians any technical education as it might induce them to migrate to the more populous centres where they would have to compete with white labour. He is of the opinion, however, that a properly equipped plant for the repair and making of shoes for the pupils would serve a useful purpose. Father McCaffrey, however, is a new man in the Indian work and what I have seen of him leads me to conclude that he is more studious than practical. In view of the attitude of this School, I am of the opinion that no manual training equipment should be purchased as the phase of technical education at present being dealt with has reference to manual training only. Possibly next year the Principal may become possessed with a broader vision.\n\n----------\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6459)\n\nFile 887-1, part 1\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nGeneral Administration 1898 - 1929\n\nFile 887-1, part 2\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nGeneral Administration 1930 - 1950\n\nFile 887-2, part 1\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nQuarterly Returns 1941 - 1950\n\nFile 887-5, part 3\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts (reports)\n1921 - 1923\n\nFile 887-5, part 4\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts\n1924 - 1929\n| Central Registry | P.A. | Date | Initials | Referred To | Remarks | Initials | Date |\n|------------------|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|------|\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n|                  |      |      |          |             |         |          |      |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 11, 1930.\n\nDear Father Grant:\n\nPursuant to your visit to the Department this morning I write to inform you that the Department approves of the appointment of the Reverend E. Maillard, O.M.I., to the principal-ship of the Seeholt Indian Residential School. This institution is a rather difficult one but I am satisfied that Father Maillard's experience has fitted him for the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I should be grateful if you would make enquiries in this connection and let the Department have a full report. At present, I am unable to find any correspondence in connection with the commitment of these boys or their condition upon arrival at the provincial institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

I had already heard about these boys arriving in the School in a filthy condition.\n\nApparently three boys broke out of Sechelt Indian Residential School and did some petty stealing in Sechelt and the new principal, Reverend Father Maillard, had them committed to the Industrial School. I was absent up the Coast at the time and did not hear about it until my return. Personally I think it was rather precipitate action to take as one of the boys was especially quite young.\n\nI have noticed in both residential schools the lack of cleanliness among the children which is probably due to insufficient bathing facilities.\n\nThere seems to be continuous trouble at the Sechelt School where they have recently made a change in the principal and assistant and I had hoped for better things from Father Maillard. I am taking up this matter with him and trust there will be no further cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Fred J.C. Ball\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.E.

Brankin, Esq., Superintendent of the Provincial Industrial School for Boys at Port Coquitlam. Copy of Mr. Brankin's report was forwarded on February 25 to Mr. Indian Agent Ball who was asked to make special report thereon. Mr. Ball replied on February 26th to the effect that these boys broke out of Sechelt Indian Residential School and did some petty stealing in Sechelt and that the Reverend, Rev. Father Maillard, had them committed to the Industrial School. Mr. Indian Agent Ball states that he was away up the coast at the time and did not hear about it until his return. He considered the action of Reverend Father Maillard rather precipitate as one of the boys especially was quite young. Copy of Mr. Ball's report is sent herewith, in which it will also be noted that the Agent observes that there is lack of cleanliness among the children which is probably due to insufficient bathing facilities, also that there seems to be continuous trouble at the Sechelt School; that he was taking up the matter of Mr. Brankin's complaint with the Reverend Principal and he hoped there would be no further cause for complaint. I wrote to Mr. Brankin on March 2nd setting the conditions complained of and pointing out that a circular letter had been sent by me to each of our Agents in B.C. in which they were being asked to see that, as far as may be practicable, Indian boys who in future may be sent to the Provincial Industrial School would be sent there in clean condition. Copy of my circular letter dated March 2nd to all Indian Agents is also sent herewith for the Department's perusal. I may add that it is expected that Mr. Barry, our Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, will be officially inspecting the Sechelt School about the middle of May, proximo, when conditions will be fully reported on to the Department in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP/AC\nOttawa, April 10, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that, in February, last, three pupils of the Sechelt Indian Residential School were committed to the Provincial Reformatory for boys and that they arrived at the provincial institution in an unsatisfactory physical condition. This, of course, is to be regretted, and the Department would be grateful if you would see that there is better supervision and care of the boys at this school. I may add that, in future, you would be well advised to get in touch with Commissioner Ditchburn's office before taking court action against any pupil of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am enclosing, for your information, copy of my letter of today's date to the Reverend Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, from which these boys were sent. Please ask Mr. Inspector Barry to give special time and attention to this school upon the occasion of his first inspection there, which should be as soon as convenient.\n\nENCL\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nBoys committed to Provincial Industrial School:\n\nWith reference to Department letters under number 167-18-4 dated March 27th and April 10th 1931 I beg to report that I gave special attention to this case, and also to the general cleanliness of the children at the school.\n\nIt is quite true that there is not sufficient bathing facilities at the Sechelt Residential School. As above reported this matter is now in the hands of Mr Indian Agent Ball.\n\nI am sorry to have to report that as far as I can gather from the correspondence on the above subject, the Department was not made acquainted with the full facts in this case.\n\nThe Rev. the Principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School has made a very full statement to me. He states, in part, that the three boys mentioned had formed a \"Gang\" that they had made a practice of stealing in the Indian Village of Sechelt. There appear to have been a number of cases of theft. The Provincial police caught these boys, who are reported to have confessed to a number of thefts. The Provincial police took the case to a stipendary magistrate, who convicted and sentenced the boys; The Principal does not appear to have much to do with this part of the case.\n\nThe Principal states emphatically that previous to the departure of the boys for Vancouver, they were given baths and clean underclothes. He states that in addition the boys were provided with new shoes and new suits of clothes. He also states that the sores to which reference is made in the letter from the Superintendent of the Provincial Industrial School, dated February 24th 1931, were of in one case a syphilitic nature, and in the other case of a tuberculous nature. These boys had been treated daily by the Sisters at the school for these sores.\n\nI regret to have to say that I do not consider that the letter from Mr Indian Agent Ball to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia in any way covers the facts of the case, as stated by the Rev. the Principal.\n\nThe Principal told me that he had been assured in an interview with The Superintendent of Indian Education at Ottawa that he would have the support of the Department in dealing with this very difficult school. He feels that he has not had such support. I asked him why he did not ask for a full enquiry, if he thought himself badly treated. He replied that he knew that the Inspector of Schools would be inspecting his school shortly, and that the Inspector would be able to see the true facts of the case.\n\nI consider that the Rev. E. Maillard is doing everything in his power to improve the standing of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nI do think that as reported above, the children of this school should have a very thorough medical examination in the near future. This will bring to light, no doubt, a number of other cases of a syphilitic and tuberculous nature.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Indian School\n\nBy W. H. Dunlop, P.R.C.S.\n\nFather Mailiard (who gave his name to Mailiardville) met me with a welcoming smile at Galiano Island where I called on him in the neat little house on the edge of sunny Sechelt. Below us the broad expanse of the Bight on which the summer sun played with shifting green waves to the right the Trall Islands, steep in salmon spawn; and the distant approach to Half Moon. The little verandah and the glad eye of the good father invited me to go in.\n\nI had often wished to inspect the interior of the Indian Boarding School\u2014a familiar landmark on that pleasant coastland. The father gladly opened to guests as soon as my visit was understood. I saw an average scale and not a prepared show. I don't quite know what I expected, for the entrance ground did not promise much but I was pleasantly surprised. On every hand there was the evidence of thoroughness. It was early forenoon. The bright dry dormitories were already in spick and span\u2014each bed made up in snowy white, each pillow covered by a clean pillow sham to give a touch of grace; the clothes in the lockers hung or laid with regard for care and cleanliness; the girls told me that the boarders are taught to make up the beds promptly; and as he lifted one or two of the sheets I saw that the work was not a mere routine but really done. The kitchens were the same neat and cleanliness. The little chapel\u2014if that is the proper name\u2014where mass is said daily made me think anew of the revered controversy as to religious exercises in city schools.\n\nAs we entered the various class rooms the lesson was halted and the scholars stood in respectful silence not too common among little children; and here and there I spoke a well-merited word of praise and encouragement on the excellent work shown by Indian schools in the remote wilderness.\n\nThe discipline, though strict, is, I am sure, mild and easy, aided by temperamental docility and the active respect for the gentleness of the teaching sisters and what I saw at least in that casual visit made me think of the ancient word, \"Love casteth out fear.\"\n\nThese boarding scholars, under the control of the school for a period of years, stand many of them have reached a standard that would do honor to city high schools. I was told that during the school year they take the trouble of leaving home for holidays! One reason suggested itself. When at length they must automatically go back to home life, faced with the fact that many of the ordinary channels of community usefulness are blocked by a racial bar, will the education they have had in curriculum and ordered habits persist when it slips to them that the morals and hygiene of the desert are rude, or spoiled fresh contacts, will these young people simply follow the inevitable law of reversion to type? It is a question of some pathos\u2014in a sense, perhaps, of tragedy.\nEXTRACT from Commissioner Bitchburn's Letter of June 6, 1932, forwarding Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the Sechelt Indian Residential School on April 19th, 20th and 21st, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 167-18-6.\n\nIt will be observed that the Inspector points out that some friction seems to exist between the Indian Agent and the Principal of the School. I have gone over the correspondence in this connection and, while I do not consider there is any particular friction, it is a case of misunderstanding or delayed information being furnished the Department.\nSechelt Indian Residential School\nSechelt, B.C.\n\nDec. 3, 1932\n\nF.J.G. Ball\nIndian Agent\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish you would apply at Ottawa for certificates of good conduct for the three following pupils of Sechelt School:\n\nMary Martha\nCatherine John\nAlfred August\n\nAll three from Sechelt.\n\nI saw by a letter written to Indians of the Village that Brother Dave is interviewing the Dept in favor of some Indian Boys. I think that Br. Dave should be told to leave the Principal alone and mind his own business.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. Ed. Mailhard\nO.M.\nPrincipal\n\nDEC 8 1932\nSir:-\n\nI have received the enclosed letter from the Reverend Principal at Sechelt School.\n\nI presume the certificates referred to are those given when the pupil is honourably discharged from school.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of his letter, I think the Reverend Principal conducts the school satisfactorily to the Department; the children are well fed, particularly clean and properly clothed and the school is a credit to the school authorities. The Reverend Father Maillard is a little difficult at times, but he is keenly interested and absolutely fair in his dealings with the pupils and staff.\n\nWhen he took over the school, he found the discipline had been slack and he had some trouble in remedying it but the staff and pupils are well pleased now and quite contented. While Father Maillard gives me plenty of trouble, it has always been in the interest of the school. He makes many requests which it is not always possible to recommend but the school is a model of cleanliness and neatness and a credit to him.\n\nI do not suppose Brother David will apply direct to you. Father Maillard sent him away from the school for disobedience and there is probably hard feeling between them in consequence. It is not good for Brother David to correspond direct with the Indians in school matters as it leads to difficulties.\n\nI am mentioning these matters without prejudice as you may not be aware of all the circumstances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to say that I have just received a letter from the Reverend Ed. Maillard, O.M.I., who is leaving France for Canada on the 8th. instant. You may remember he was Principal at the Sechelt Residential School when you visited there. He left on a holiday about September last and tells me he has been advised by his headquarters at Rome that he will not return to Sechelt School.\n\nI know the Indians complained to the Church authorities that he was too strict with them in the village, and he had some trouble with the Reverend Father Plamondon, an old priest who visits the Indians in the village. Also, Slidell, Sechelt and other Reserves. Maillard accuses him of undermining his authority and making trouble for him among the Indians, which is common talk in the district and probably true. However, that is a Church matter and outside our province to deal with, but the school is owned and operated on the grant from the Department and in this we should at least be consulted.\n\nWhen Father Maillard took over his duties the school was in bad shape, discipline was lax and the Indians in the village, as the result of some trouble, had even put handcuffs on the brother who was supposed to be managing the school. Crime was common and practically every girl after leaving school came to Vancouver and lived on the streets.\n\nFather Maillard was strict, but just, and he had but one idea, the welfare of his pupils. Whereas at one time pneumonia, bronchitis, etc., were expected every winter and usually deaths occurred every year, Father Maillard went through some winters without even a serious cold among the pupils. This was due to the care and feeding of the children, to which he gave his earnest attention. The school was a model of cleanliness, and the pupils were particularly well-fed and clothed.\n\nIt is true he was harsh in his language towards the village people, but they certainly improved in conduct. He is quite excitable and uses extravagant language when roused, but I believe he would do anything to help any Indian, either in the school or in the village, but would do it in his own way.\n\nAs Father Maillard feels very hurt on account of his dismissal, I thought it only fair to report that if it can be re-considered, the School would gain by it, and I should certainly be pleased to see him back again.\nHe may be considered a difficult man to get along with, but his heart was in his work, and he was a real success at the School.\n\nHe will probably call upon you on his arrival in Ottawa, and I thought it only fair to let you know what has happened.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F. J. G. Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nB/GM.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to say that I have just received a letter from the Reverend Ed. Maillard, O.M.I., who is leaving France for Canada on the 8th instant. You may remember he was Principal at the Sechelt Residential School when you visited there. He left on a holiday about September last and tells me he has been advised by his headquarters at Rome that he will not return to Sechelt School.\n\nI know the Indians complained to the Church authorities that he was too strict with them in the village, and he had some trouble with the Reverend Father Plamondon, an old priest who visits the Indians in Homalco, Klahoose, Slalum, Sechelt and other Reserves. Maillard accuses him of undermining his authority and making trouble for him among the Indians, which is common talk in the district and probably true. However, that is a Church matter and outside our province to deal with, but the school is owned and operated on the grant from the Department and in this we should at least be consulted.\n\nWhen Father Maillard took over his duties the school was in bad shape, discipline was lax and the Indians in the village, as the result of some trouble, had even put handcuffs on the brother who was supposed to be managing the school. Crime was common and practically every girl after leaving school came to Vancouver and lived on the streets.\n\nFather Maillard was strict, but just, and he had but one idea, the welfare of his pupils. Whereas at one time pneumonia, bronchitis, etc. were expected every winter and usually deaths occurred every year, Father Maillard went through some winters without even a serious cold among the pupils. This was due to the care and feeding of the children, to which he gave his earnest attention. The school was a model of cleanliness, and the pupils were particularly well-fed and clothed.\n\nIt is true he was harsh in his language towards the village people, but they certainly improved in conduct. He is quite excitable and uses extravagant language when roused, but I believe he would do anything to help any Indian, either in the school or in the village, but would do it in his own way.\n\nAs Father Maillard feels very hurt on account of his dismissal, I thought it only fair to report that if it can be re-considered, the School would gain by it, and I should certainly be pleased to see him back again.\nHe may be considered a difficult man to get along with, but his heart was in his work, and he was a real success at the School.\n\nHe will probably call upon you on his arrival in Ottawa, and I thought it only fair to let you know what has happened.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.

T. J. Fahlmann to succeed him as principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. The Department is approving of the appointment of Father Fahlmann, and it is hoped he will meet with every success in the work. I would request that you give him any assistance you can.

Maillard, O. M. I., former principal, is being replaced by Rev. T. J. Fahlmann. Father Fahlmann's services were satisfactory during the period he was principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, and it is therefore confidently expected that he will meet with every success as principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. His appointment to Sechelt is approved. Mr. F. J. C. Ball, local Indian Agent, and Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, B.

I have no doubt Father Fahlman will be successful at Sechelt as at Mission. I hope in due course, a change will also be made in the case of Reverend Father Flamondon at Sechelt.\n\nI have received a letter from the Indians at Sechelt saying that every Indian on the Reserve is in need of relief, not only food but money also.\n\nIn addition, you were good enough to send me a letter today which someone had written you, signing the names of several Indians, saying I was not giving them everything they ask for.\n\nIf they are not being encouraged in these matters, they are certainly not discouraged as was the case in Father Maillard's time at Sechelt.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Fred J.

I thereupon wired Father Falhmann to communicate with you immediately and to give you all details.\n\nI am now in possession of the copy of the Indian agent's (F.J.G. Ball) letter to you in connection with same. Until I hear from Father Falhmann I am naturally reserving my judgment on some of the paragraphs. But in the meantime I have written to him and explained quite clearly that Sechelt school cannot possibly be managed from Mission and I have no hesitation in saying that there will be no further question of Father Falhmann being absent from his post. I am quite in agreement with the last sentence of your letter, namely that Father Falhmann cannot give proper supervision to the school unless he is at Sechelt the greater part of his time.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPROVINCIAL.\n\nJ.S./M.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1936.\n\nVery Rev.

C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, and Very Reverend J. Scannell, O. M. I., Provincial of the English Oblate Order, who is at present in Vancouver, visit the school, together, enquire into present conditions regarding the staff and other matters, and Mr. Perry was requested to report fully regarding the management of this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your night letter of the 4th instant re reported unsatisfactory conditions at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and instructing me to visit the school. This matter will be attended to as soon as Rev. Father Scannell is heard from.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAG\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report, in reply to your letter of the 5th instant, that I met Reverend Father Scannell, Mr. Perry, and Reverend Father Fahlman, on the Sechelt boat, and accompanied them to Sechelt Indian Residential School, on the 12th instant. After the conference there, we returned to Vancouver.\n\nI am very glad indeed to have had the pleasure of meeting the Reverend Father Scannell, and he said he would call upon you and tell you the result of his visit to the School. I am satisfied that Father Scannell will be quite just in whatever he reports to you, and that the complaints made will receive his full consideration.\n\nMr. Perry called this morning to read a long report he was writing to you. I strongly objected to some of the statements, especially about Dr. Connold and Mrs. Gus Band, and I told him they were unfair, not in accordance with facts, and totally unnecessary. (He accused Dr. Connold of attacking the School on religious grounds, which is ridiculous; Dr. Connold was not attacking anything or anybody. He also accused Dr. Connold of unethical conduct in writing his letter of the 17th ultimo, as it attacked another doctor, which is also incorrect).\n\nI regret to say that Mr. Perry left in a violent temper and threatened to call for my resignation because I objected to some of the report he had written, although he had invited me to say what I thought about it.\n\nI am sure Father Scannell's visit will have a beneficial result at the School, which was the object of the inquiry.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nHarold W. McGill, M.D., Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental nightletter dated May 4th, instant, reading as follows:-\n\n\"Conditions at Sechelt Residential School reported unsatisfactory (Stop) Reverend J. Scannell, Provincial of Oblate Order, at present in British Columbia (Stop) He will wire you when he can visit Sechelt and Department wishes you to go there with Father Scannell and report fully regarding management of this school.\"\n\nIn connection with this message, and in consideration of Mr. Agent Ball, I addressed a letter to him on May 5th, instant, and received his reply dated May 6th, instant. These letters, copies of which are hereto attached, will be self-explanatory.\n\nOn the 9th instant, Reverend Father J. Scannell telephoned to me at Victoria, from Vancouver, and we arranged to visit Sechelt on Tuesday, May 12th. He asked me if Agent Ball would also go to Sechelt and I replied that no doubt he would be pleased to do so if the Reverend Father would so request him. This was done. I joined Agent Ball, Reverend Father Scannell, and Reverend Principal Fahlman at the steamer at Vancouver on Tuesday morning, the 12th instant, and we proceeded to Sechelt arriving there soon after lunch. A meeting was held on the School premises, at which Reverend Father Scannell presided. Present at the meeting were Principal Fahlman, Agent Ball and myself.\n\nMr. Ball was invited to say whether or not he was satisfied with the present management and conduct of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. He replied that he was not. In support of his views, Mr. Ball presented copies of three communications. These were\n\n(1) Letter of Dr. Lane Conneld of Pender Harbour Hospital,\n(2) Letter of Mrs. Gus Band, Squamish Indian woman,\n(3) Petition signed by Chiefs Louie Johnny, John and Tom, dated March 7th, 1936.\n\nIt is understood from Mr. Ball that the three communications, or copies thereof, were sent by him to Ottawa. They will be there\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nin...\nin file for reference. In connection with the Indians' petition, I enclose herewith copies of correspondence with Agent Ball, in order that the Department may know fully my reasons for returning it. The subsequent letter of Agent Ball, to me dated May 6th, would indicate that my action was fully justified; Mr. Ball having stated that \"the troubles at Sechelt are too serious and too numerous to mention by mail.\" Mr. Ball did not reply to my letter regarding a witnessed petition, but obtained a signature of a witness and sent it to Ottawa.\n\nIn addition to the presentation of the three letters mentioned above, Mr. Agent Ball made verbal complaint to the effect that Reginald Paul, Indian Councillor of Sechelt, had informed him verbally that one Andrew Fahlman, a nephew of the Reverend Principal, had been seen by him (Paul) to enforce drill upon an Indian pupil who was complaining of feeling ill. Mr. Andrew Fahlman was called and said he had never disciplined the boy but that a former disciplinarian may have handled the boys. He knew nothing whatever about it. As Reginald Paul was not in the village, he could not be called. An Indian Abe Jefferies, father of a large family, whose name was listed in the petition of the Indians numbered \"3\" hereinabove, was called in connection with the petition, and stated that he had no complaint to make against the Principal or the School or the management, but that he had heard from his son (a pupil who had died later from natural causes) and had also been told by Reginald Paul that a former disciplinarian (not Andrew Fahlman as alleged) had been a harsh disciplinarian and had subjected the boys at the School to hard drills or exercises which resulted in excessive fatigue. He added that he had heard that Andrew Fahlman (the Principal's nephew) also drilled the boys too much and that the boys were made to run around the grounds in circles.\n\nMr. Fahlman had previously stated that on one occasion, in an effort to compel the boys to tell who had stolen or hidden a large ring of school keys which had been removed and could not be found, had drilled the boys hard for longer periods than usual by making them hop on one leg. The excessive duration of these drills, however, was not supported by any definite evidence by those making complaint. Mr. Fahlman stated that the boys had undertaken greater fatigue in their voluntary play than he had witnessed at these drills, but that as this particular drill was done under pressure as punishment some of the boys had complained. The keys had not been recovered. Rev. Principal Fahlman stated that he had not been aware of any excessive punishment and that he would do his best to see that the boys were treated properly, since Abe Jefferies had brought it to his attention apart from the petition of the chiefs. Abe Jefferies is a good type of Indian and he agreed that a reasonable amount of discipline was necessary at any school and that he had told his son so. Jefferies said he did not know what was in the petition in which his name had been mentioned. Chief John, a signatory to the petition, who is an old and somewhat illiterate Indian stated that he knew what was in the petition when he signed it but it was only hearsay and he had signed it at the request of Chief Louie Johnny.\n\nChief Tom...\nChief Tom, a second signatory to the petition, is an aged, decrepit and illiterate Indian who would sign his death warrant if asked to do so. Neither Chief Tom nor the third signatory\u2014Chief Louie Johnny\u2014was in the reserve and therefore could not be called to explain their views to the investigators. Abe Jefferies and Chief John, however, having heard the explanation of the reasons for the punishment referred to, left the meeting without rancour and appeared to be satisfied that the matter had been looked into.\n\nMrs. Band's letter\n\nThis was dealt with at a meeting held at the School with the Mother Superior and four Sisters. Reverend Father Scannell presided also at this meeting. The letter was read aloud and the Mother Superior and the Sisters were asked if they had anything to say in regard to Mrs. Band's complaints. The complaints were categorically denied by all the Sisters.\n\nMrs. Band is more white than Indian, but is married to a Squamish Indian. They separated a few years ago and I found the husband and children on the North Vancouver reserve without food and the children neglected. This family is now reunited and the incident is mentioned only to suggest that any alleged lack of \"home atmosphere\" or quality of food that Mrs. Band may attach to the School could not be compared in favor to Mr. and Mrs. Band with the conditions which I have mentioned as relating to their neglect of their own children at a time when the children were younger and more dependent than they are at present. Mr. Ball did not produce any further evidence to support of Mrs. Band's charges and consequently the matter could not be further proceeded with.\n\nAs to music, the Mother Superior explained that the Sister who had taught music had been sick but that she would resume this work in the near future. In any event music is not a compulsory part of the Department's curricula for the schools, although it has been taught in the schools as a matter of course, and possibly Mrs. Band may have been paying for these services.\n\nDr. Conneld's letter re Medical Services and Hospitalization\n\nThe letter was read at the first meeting and was discussed. The Reverend Principal stated that there had not been, to his knowledge, any neglect of children as to Medical attendance or hospitalization, that Dr. Inglis, the Department's medical officer, had been diligent in all such matters and had consulted with the Principal in all cases. The case of a girl who had syphilitic sores on her leg was recovering as a result of Dr. Inglis' care and advice, and there appeared to be no reasonable grounds for the complaints of Dr. A. Lane Conneld. Principal Fahlman added that he had given due attention to the health of the children on all occasions and, should hospitalization be considered necessary by the Department's physician he would always be prepared to abide by the Doctor's decisions concerning admission to...\nadmissions to hospital, the latter being governed by Departmental regulations and usages. Perhaps it might be reasonable to suggest that since Dr. Connell comes into contact in the holiday and other vacation periods with children from the school and, in fishing time, with Indians of the village of Sechelt, these having during the balance of the year been under the medical care and treatment of the Department's part-time physician Dr. Inglis, it would have been possible for Dr. Connell to confer with Dr. Inglis as to the medical care or hospitalization of Indians who are Dr. Inglis' charges. This would have avoided the circulation of rumours concerning alleged neglect of medical services to the Indians. The hospital at Pender Harbour is under Anglican management while the Sechelt Mission and School are Roman Catholic.\n\nManual Training Instruction\n\nAgent Ball stated that while it would seem that the question of the appointment of Mr. Morley as Manual Training Instructor to succeed Mr. Tebb whose services had been discontinued, was no longer a matter of issue, nevertheless he questioned Mr. Morley's qualifications and fitness for the position. The Principal replied that the application of Mr. Morley set forth his qualifications with which he was satisfied, and that Mr. Morley had shown in practice that he was familiar with the use of tools, technique of Manual Training and had designed and erected five or six cottages. Neither Mr. Bell nor the Principal produced written matter concerned in the application. The question, however, was believed by the Principal to have been settled at the Department as he received a cheque from Ottawa for the December Quarter in Mr. Morley's name although the work had been done by Mr. Tebb\u2014Mr. Morley started work in January, 1936. The Principal advised that Mr. Morley had been taken ill after his appointment and would soon leave the hospital. He thought he should be permitted to decide as to the matter of Mr. Morley's future services, as he considered Mr. Morley to be the better of the two men quite apart from other considerations, Mr. Ball thinking, however, that any Manual Training instructor who may be engaged at Sechelt Residential School, should know something of boat construction and he doubted if Mr. Morley could succeed in this work. The matter was left for further discussion by Reverend Father Scannell with the Department, it being understood that the Principal is allowed reasonable latitude by the Department as to the choice of his staff, also that the Principal would see that the Manual Training would increase in efficiency.\n\nAs to alleged frequent absences of the Principal, the latter explained that in the interests of the Mission of the Church he has been asked to officiate in cases of emergency and has also availed himself of occasions of retreat but not without leaving a responsible person in charge in his absence. Reverend Father Plamondon, who is an experienced and most reliable missionary in charge at Sechelt and who is very close to the hearts and minds of the local Indians, upon being invited to express his opinion of the matters of complaint, (as he did on a previous occasion when a similar inquiry was made by the late Schools Inspector Cairns and myself during the administration of the\n\nReverend Sisters ....\nReverend Sisters of the Child Jesus, as on record), informed us that he had received no complaints from the Sechelt Indians apart from the rumours in circulation as concerning the alleged harshness of a disciplinarian, the latter, however, not being Mr. Andrew Fehlman as reported. With this assurance, it is felt that the matter at issue will probably dissolve and normal conditions will prevail as a result of the inquiry of which the local Indians will be aware.\n\nReverend Father Scannell, the Indian Agent and I, in discussing all the issues with the Principal and staff, urged them to safeguard the interests of the Department, themselves and the Indians, by giving the closest attention to the removal of the remotest causes of complaint in order to avoid truancy and co-related troubles. They all agreed to do so and the meeting closed with mutual understanding prevailing.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no doubt in my own mind that the present agitation is a recrudescence of an attitude on the part of a few Indians such as has been previously experienced at the Indian Village of Sechelt, and that the same is a result of rumours arising from the unfortunate coincidence of death from natural causes of three pupils in succession, coupled with rumours of alleged ill-treatment on the part of a former school disciplinarian, who is not now attached to the School. These rumours usually grow in seriousness with the circulation of village gossip, fanned into intensity through the unwarranted interference of outsiders having ulterior motives or religious prejudices.\n\nI beg to say finally that it has been a pleasure to co-operate with Reverend Father Scannell in looking into these regrettable complaints. He was most tactful and fair in his approach to and treatment of the matters under review and discussion. He will probably discuss them in person with the Department upon his return to Ottawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 9th, covering a petition dated March 7th, instant, received by you from parties signing themselves Chief Louie Johnnie, Chief John (cross) and Chief Tom (cross) but which was not witnessed as to the marks of the two last named Chiefs, and making complaint with respect to certain alleged conditions at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, I beg to say I have discussed the matter with the Inspector of Indian Schools after his perusal of the correspondence, and he advises me that the matter under review does not come within the scope of the several headings in his instructions from Ottawa concerning the inspection of schools. Moreover, Inspector Barry states that as his itinerary is already arranged for a period to the end of June he could not conveniently visit Sechelt for the time being even if the case did come within his regular duties of inspection and report.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I would suggest that you forward the correspondence to the Department and ask if, in view of Inspector Barry's last report dated January 16th, last, it would wish to have either Inspector Barry or Inspector Pragnell make a special trip to Sechelt for the purpose of investigating the alleged difficulties there.\n\nIt is my opinion that the petition should be looked into with regard to its origin and genuineness, since the same is not witnessed, before submitting the matter to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received today regarding Sechelt Residential School. I have had many complaints verbally and have usually told the Indians that matters will adjust themselves after they become more used to the change of Principals there.\n\nAs Mr. Inspector Barry has visited the school recently, and made a report on conditions there, I feel that this complaint from the Sechelt Council should be referred to him first.\n\nI have had many intimations, not all from Indians, that the pupils are not being fed as well as formerly, but Mr. Inspector Barry found the meals good while he was there, so those intimations would appear to be incorrect.\n\nWith regard to the complaint against Andrew Fahlman this, presumably, is the young nephew of the Principal, who was engaged as janitor. I do not know why he is handling the pupils at all. They had a young brother there but he has been absent for many months.\n\nAs I have recently had some difficulty with the Sechelt School in regard to manual training (which is not now being given as the instructor appointed by the school has been in hospital since his appointment), I am afraid the Principal will think I am exceeding my duty if I take up the matters referred to in the enclosed petition. I have always been consulted on school matters by previous Principals, but under the present regime there is a feeling that the Agent has nothing whatever to do with the School, and as our duties in this regard are rather indefinite, I am passing the complaint on to you for action.\n\nI might mention that the Department has refused to recognize the appointment of the manual training instructor as it was made entirely contrary to their instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Fredk.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n\nSir:-\n\nWe are dropping you these few lines regards school, it is no more a school the way they handle the children it is more like Okalla.\n\nMost of the children are trying to find their way to get to their parents now for been punished for the thing they have not done they give them drills which Andrew Fahlman calls it, make them all sit on the floor with their feet up in the air also their body and arms for about 20 minutes or so, just one position, if a boy tries to rest a bit he will be right there with his strap, one might be guilty but just the same Andrew Fahlman makes all the boys do his drill in many different ways which hurts the children very much almost cramped up.\n\nSo two boys are out now Arthur Jefferies that's Abe Jefferies boy. Also Johnnie Louie, that's Chief Louie Johnnies boy which the parents are holding in their home, so we are asking you to take Andrew Fahlman away as all the children are dissatisfied the way they are handled.\n\nAs for food it is of poor quality most of the time are given stale food which the children are forced to eat.\n\nAs for Father Fahlaman he do not seem to look after the school as he should, as he is away most of the time.\n\nSo we are asking you come and see us as we could tell you more about the school.\n\nWe are waiting patiently to here about Sechelt Counsel Hall.\n\nWe are\n\n\"Chief Louie Johnnie\"\n\"Chief John X\"\n\"Chief Tom X\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nIn submitting the enclosed report on conditions at Sechelt Indian Residential School, I beg to inform the Department that on May 11th, instant - the day before I left for Sechelt - Mr. Agent Ball telephoned me from Vancouver to confirm arrangements for accompanying Father Scannell and myself to Sechelt. He stated that in his opinion Father Scannell had been \"playing for time\" and that the \"whole thing had been cooked\", suggesting that Father Scannell had been in touch with the Church representatives at Sechelt and that very little progress would result from our investigation. I felt disturbed by his remarks and tried to dismiss them from my mind as I was anxious to avoid any prejudicial approach to the complaints to be investigated. Subsequently, I was satisfied that before going to Sechelt neither Father Scannell nor Rev. Principal Fehlman knew anything of the charges to be made by Mr. Ball, except that the Principal knew that Mr. Ball had not approved of the appointment of Mr. Morley.\n\nI wrote the report on the evening of the 13th from my notes and, on the morning of the 14th instant, took it to Mr. Ball's office with the objective of going over it with him. I was reading it to Mr. Ball when he became quite irate and told me that the reason he had written such a report was that I was afraid of the Roman Catholics. He said I had gone to Sechelt with the intention of opposing him and the complaints which he had made. He said parts of the report were untrue, and that my reference to the doctor at Pender Harbour was in the interests of the Catholics and against the Anglicans as Dr. Connell was not prejudiced as he alleged I had inferred. It was obvious that I would be unable to make any point of contact with Mr. Ball on the issues involved, and so informed him. I then left the office. It seems improbable that the Department will esteem Mr. Ball's remarks as being conducive to maintenance of a desired morale in our service with respect to the Vancouver Agency.\n\nIf, in view of this report the Department should feel that a wider investigation should be made in order to give Mr. Ball an opportunity to fully defend his charges in the production of further data or witnesses, I shall not be out of harmony with such an enquiry, although I would not recommend that such action be taken as I consider the action already taken will be sufficient to meet the existing conditions for the time being.\n\nReverend Father Scannell, who investigated the Sechelt School charges jointly with myself, requested me to give him a copy of my report, which was done.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nI did not think when this investigation began that these developments would ensue, but I suppose it is the way of the world and must be treated accordingly. I deeply regret the necessity which occasions the transmission of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.

I advised them I had reported their complaints before and the Department had requested Assistant Commissioner C. C. Perry and the Reverend Father Scannell to hold an enquiry and I understood the various complaints against the School had been reported unfounded. They then requested me to take their statements and send them to Ottawa as follows:\n\nCouncillor Louie Johnny complains that the children are not getting butter and milk, only occasionally; butter once a week. The Principal would not allow the Councillors to go to the dining room during meals, and they want permission to visit the school any day at meal time.\n\nCouncillor Reggie Paull - \"I see a kid, Simon Jeffries, jumping the length of the playground on one leg as punishment. He jumped twelve times and he complained to the Brother he had a bad pain in his side and he was lying down on the ground, but Brother told him to keep on with this punishment till he did it 25 times. I heard this myself and the boy died about three or four months after from lung sickness; he was sick all that summer and died of T.B. It was carrying punishment too far and hurting his health. Chief John says his son, Rennie John comes home and complains about the food, but the Brother threatens to punish them if he tells anything about the food. MacDonald and Andrew Fahlman are too hard on the children; they are not strong to do all the drills they get.\"\n\nSeveral other Councillors spoke along the same lines.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, (Chairman)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIndian Agent Ball reports that, at a recent meeting of the Sechelt Indian Council, he received the following complaints regarding the Sechelt Indian Residential School:\n\n\"Councillor Louie Johnny complains that the children are not getting butter and milk, only occasionally; butter once a week.

Following this, a report should be submitted to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, February 9, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of letter just received from Indian Agent Ball. As this letter constitutes rather a serious charge against the Principal and management of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, the Department wishes you to arrange an early investigation of conditions at this school.\n\nIn the last paragraph of Mr. Ball's letter he refers to the investigation held by Mr. C. G. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, in May, last. His report was forwarded to the Department in letter dated May 15th, 1936.\n\nOn the 2nd instant you were written with a view to having Inspector Barry investigate certain complaints that had been received regarding the Sechelt School. Mr. Ball's letter should also be considered when the investigation is being held.\n\nIf you can arrange to do so, it might be possible for you to accompany Inspector Barry to Sechelt, as the Department wishes to have a thorough investigation and a definite statement as to whether or not the charges that are being made are based on fact.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.

Barry to inspect the Sechelt Indian Residential School during the coming week but as the persons Indian Agent Ball wishes examined will not be available until March 30th I consider it important to wait until that date before proceeding with investigation, instructions for which are contained in your letter above referred to.\n\nCapt. Barry informs me the Sechelt School will be closed insofar as the classrooms are concerned between March 26th and April the 5th, and as he wishes to commence on the latter date inspections of the schools on the mainland coast which inspection was interfered with some time ago and which will take him until the first week of June, it is considered advisable he should proceed with the inspection of the Sechelt School next week and in addition investigate in accordance with the wishes of the Superintendent of Welfare and Training as expressed in his letter 167-18-1, dated February 2nd to this office. It will be noted if Capt. Barry waited until March 30th, the date on which I propose to hold the investigation, he could not hold the usual inspection as the children would not be in the classrooms and it is therefore considered the arrangements as outlined are the best that can be made under the circumstances.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDM/AC\n\nD.

The Rev. Father Falhman will be replaced by the Rev. Father Cornell at present at Kamloops. Although Father Cornell has never been principal of an Indian School, he has for many years been in touch with the Indians both in the School at Kamloops and on the Reserve. I have every reason to think that he will be a success in his new sphere of labor. With Father Cornell I am sending a young priest, Father McGrath, who will have full charge of the office work and will at the same time acquire a knowledge both in the school and in the neighboring missions of the management of Indians.\n\nI received your kind letter relative to the Christie School on the West Coast. I have just returned from spending a week there. In the near future I hope to be in Ottawa and I hope to have the pleasure of going into the whole question with you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 10, 1937.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 5th, the Department approves the appointment of Reverend E.J.

MacKay.\nThe 14th and 15th were spent at Sechelt reserve and school, but no meeting could be held as many of the Councillors were absent. I was able to meet the new school principal at the residential school, Rev. Father Cornell, who will, no doubt, operate the school in a manner more satisfactory to all concerned. There has been far too much truancy in the past year or two and judging by Father Cornell's personality, the school is again going to be a credit to us. A number of cases of infractions of the liquor sections of the Act were adjudicated upon, and on the 25th I visited several reserves along Howe Sound by launch on complaint that squatters were building on Indian reserve land. Six buildings were found, and the owners notified to remove.\n\nF. J. G. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON VANCOUVER AGENCY FOR DECEMBER 1937.\n\nI visited the various schools, day and residential. The Sechelt Residential school is now under a new principal, and already there is a great improvement in the attitude of both pupils and parents. I was particularly pleased to see the return of the Sister-in-charge, who, I understand, has been there for over 30 years and knows not only the present pupils, but their parents also.\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour and pleasure to report that at a musical festival held in Vancouver on the 9th and 10th instant for Roman Catholic Schools, the only Indian entrant won the Gold Medal for elocution and composition.\n\nStella August, the successful candidate, is a pupil of Sechelt Indian Residential School; the principal is Rev. Father Cornell, who has quickly made so much improvement there in so short a time. The School is now in good hands with Father Cornell as Principal, and Father McGrath as vice-principal.\n\nThe success of this girl reflects much credit upon the School, and especially her instructor, Sister Superior Theresa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D., Indian Agent.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nSchools reported many absentees at first and we had some difficulty rounding them up; there is a distinct opposition to residential schools in this vicinity. The reason is that the parents are able to supply their children with better food at home than they are given in the schools. Eventually, the residential schools will be used rather for orphanages and homes for neglected children than as educational institutions for the Indians in general, and day schools on the reserves will be needed. As the Indians become more self-supporting they prefer raising their own children at home, which is a satisfactory situation in many ways.\n\nF. J. C.

Please let me know to what school the Indian Agent refers and whether or not you have received any complaints regarding the food.\n\nIt might also be inferred from the report that the training that the pupils receive at the Residential Schools in the Agency is not as good as could be expected.

Father Cornell, I made a visit to the school on Saturday and Sunday, the 26th and 27th. To my amazement, I was met at the dock by the Reverend Principal and all the boys, escorted to the school, and for 30 hours was given full permission to meet the pupils either in class or individually or visit any part of the school. An interesting programme was provided, and the Reverend Principal and staff were exceeding kind.\n\nF.J.C.Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON OKANAGAN AGENCY FOR NOVEMBER 1938.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThese were all inspected with Mr. Inspector Barry during the month, and also apart from his visit. They all appear to be progressing and it is hoped that the Inspector's stressing of vocation training will have the desired effect, as I consider this of the greatest importance to our future development. It might some day be considered feasible to give the older pupils a few hours on the \"Indian Act\", etc., in order to overcome the misrepresentations of agitators. The subject could no doubt be made interesting to them.\n\nJas. Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nNovember 29, 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nActing on your instructions I visited the Squamish Indian Residential School, Vancouver Agency, today, without informing the school authorities or any other person of my intention to carry out a surprise inspection.\n\nI had read a Departmental letter addressed to you by Mr. Hoey, in which portions of a report from Mr. Indian Agent Ball were quoted suggesting that the food supplied to the children at the Residential Schools in the Vancouver Agency was not satisfactory, and that possibly other conditions might be improved.\n\nI arrived at the Squamish Indian Residential School at exactly 11:52 a.m. this morning, and by 11:55 a.m. I was inspecting the Noon meal then being served up and distributed to the different tables in the school diningroom.\n\nThis meal was an excellent one and a complete report on the food at this school is given on pages 3 and 4 of the attached school report.\n\nThough my time was of course limited I managed to visit all the classrooms and make a thorough inspection of the whole of the school building.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the Squamish School is splendidly conducted by the Sisters of the Child Jesus. As far as I could learn there has been no difficulty with regard to having the children return to school after the summer vacation.\n\nI regret that I am quite unable to understand the Indian Agent's remarks. Is he trying to suggest that the schools are not being properly inspected and that I am not qualified for the position I hold in the Department?\n\nTo report that the children (at some school not mentioned by name) do not get as good food as they would in their own Indian homes appears to me to be a little far fetched and hardly a statement that should have been included in an official document. At the Squamish School a number of the pupils are either orphans or from homes which make it necessary for us to educate the children in a Residential School.\n\nGreat care is taken in all school inspections and though I of course make mistakes from time to time in my reports, many of which are typed under very adverse circumstances and often like this one late at night, any adverse condition in a school is noted and mentioned in the school report. I do not like these wild suggestions that things are unsatisfactory. I should be informed if there is some definite adverse condition which should be investigated. I am quite confident that the Indian Residential Schools in the Vancouver Agency are being administered in a very satisfactory manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

I have not on file here her full particulars but will supply age etc. in my next report.\n\nSister M. Joan of Arc Age ?\nThis teacher was for some time at Sechelt. She has had considerable experience in Indian schools in B.C.\n\nNone of the above teachers are Normal School graduates.\nThe methods employed by the teachers are quite satisfactory, and excellent results are obtained. My suggestions are in general followed.\n\nSister M Joan of Arc is having very good success with the Primary Class. She is not a very cheerful teacher in an old fashioned manner is doing very good work. She follows advice as far as she can.\n\nSister M Hieronymie is rather too old for the classroom work but is being helped by a very young Sister whom she is also instructing, Sister M Lucien.\n\nSister M Denise is making a success of the Junior Grade work.\n\nRemarks relative to examination of the pupils:\n\nThese will be brief as I did not have more than a few hours in the classrooms on this occasion.\n\n**Senior Division**\nTeacher Sister M Hieronymie\nGrades 6 and 7\n\nExcellent work is being done. General Achievement was tested by the B.C. Achievement Test for Juniors 1934\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 36\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 33\nGrade Norms are not available but the above are satisfactory under the circumstances.\n\nArithmetic was tested by the All Canada Test in which Grade 7 made a Mid Score of 36 Norm 32\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 31 Norm 29\nThe Arithmetic is very good indeed. Teacher's control of class \"Excellent\".\n\n**Intermediate Division**\nTeacher Sister M Lucien\nGrade 5\n\nThis class also works with the Senior Division.\n\nArithmetic was very good. In the All Canada Test Grade 5 made a Mid Score of 29 Norm 24\nGrade 5 also made a Mid Score of 29 in the B.C. Achievement Test for Juniors 1934 the Norm being 31. This last result shows that the Grade is well up to standard. They no doubt gain much from being in the same room often as the Senior Grades, in whose lessons they sometimes share.\n\n**Junior Division:**\nTeacher Sister M Denise\nGrades 4, 3, and 2.\n\nIn general the Reading is good. Work books are being used with success. Writing is well above the average now. The control of the pupils is maintained with ease. Very good progress is being made by the children.\n\n**Primary Division:**\nTeacher Sister M Joan of Arc.\n\nThe children are reading very well. A demonstration lesson was given to explain to the teacher just how to deal with Beginners Reading in Grade 1C the children being very young. Control is excellent. Language Work has been done very well indeed. The progress of the pupils is highly satisfactory.\nVocational Training:\n\nI have seen the work of the girls and boys in exhibition and at the school several times during the past year.\n\nThe Manual Training appears to be quite satisfactory. The girls keep the school, an old building, spotless. They prepare the vegetables and cook the meals. They preserve fruit and make jellies, bake pies and cakes, and in general learn all those arts which will make their own housekeeping a success when they leave school.\n\nSewing, meant to be of the most practical nature, is undertaken daily. They mend, darn, patch, knit, and make dresses, underclothes, pillow slips, etc. Machine and hand sewing are taught.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThere are some eight soda type fire extinguishers which I examined and found to have been tested and where necessary recharged in July 1936.\n\nThe representative of the North Vancouver Fire Department visits the school regularly and holds simple fire drills. Since my last report I have visited the school several times with visitors and on one occasion at least he has drill down the dormitories down the wooden escape and ladders. To-day the weather was too bad to again test the children in this way, but I am perfectly satisfied that they do have frequent practice Fire Drills. They are very good at this.\n\nSome improvements have been made to the escapes since my last visit and a new door has been placed in the small boys' dormitory which opens out to the fire escape. Doors and windows are not locked but protected by an excellent type of electric alarm which sounds when either door or window is opened. This type of alarm was described in my last report on the St. George's School, Lytton.\n\nDormitories:\n\nThese were all visited and found to be splendidly kept. Floors and beds were perfectly clean. There was no overcrowding of any sort.\n\nThe children have plenty of covers.\n\nDining Room:\n\nI visited the children at their Noon meal. As there have been certain adverse ideas expressed on the children's diet at this school, I arranged to visit the school on this occasion without informing anyone of my intention. Even those in the Commissioner's office did not know where I was going, nor did I make up my mind to visit the school till late this morning. I arrives at the school at exactly 11:52 a.m., when the Noon meal was being served out on the tables. This meal consisted of steaming hot mashed potatoes two slices of pressed beef raw turnip sliced bread, cooked pears. Tea was served with plenty of milk in it and some sugar. The Diet Sheet of the school was examined and is copied into this report, see Page 4.\n\nThere is no truth whatever in any statement to the effect that the children are not well fed here, nor is it true that there is any substantial difference in the meals when it is known that I am to visit the school. This has been proved by my unexpected visit to-day at a time when it was impossible to change the meal to any great extent.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nThis is abundant and of first rate quality. The water is supplied by the city of North Vancouver under the same pressure as that available in that city. Fire could be fought, but on any outbreak the main thing to do would be to clear the building at once.\nMENU\n\nThis statement was copied for me by the Sister in charge of the kitchen from her own Diet Sheet.\n\n1. Sunday\n   Stew or boiled meat, beans.\n   Dessert: pudding or fruit.\n   Supper Cream of wheat, butter,\n   Dessert Buns.\n\n2. Monday\n   Hash or meat balls roasted, peas.\n   Dessert: fruit or jelly.\n   Supper Macaroni. Dessert: fruit or jelly.\n\n3.

Dessert: fruit or jelly.\n\n   Cup of raw milk every morning.\n   Tea with milk at Noon\n   Cocoa with milk at supper time\n   Bread at every meal\n   Raw carrots and raw turnips often\n\nThe Sister who copied the above for me does not show the breakfasts, which remain much the same from day to day.\n\nIn a statement in my possession dated November 16th 1938 the daily breakfast is said to consist of Porridge (rolled oats) or wheateats, bread and peanut butter, a cupful of raw milk.\n\nBread at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. with fruit or raw carrot daily.\n\nI consider the quality of the food supplied very good, the variety as shown above satisfactory, and the quantity given to each child more than sufficient.\n\nDuring certain days and seasons of the Church's year the food would be slightly varied by substituting eggs and fish for meat on one or more days in each week.\n\nThe food supplied at this school is better than that placed before the children at other and larger Indian Residential Schools, though it is true that at certain other schools the food shows more variation than here.\n\nI am particularly pleased with the fresh and cooked fruit supplied to the children.\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nThe great improvement noted in my report of January 20th 1936 and mentioned again in the report of September 25, 1937 has since then been well maintained.\n\nThe whole school from the dormitories to the basements and including kitchens, wash places, toilets, etc., has been again inspected and found to be perfectly clean.\n\nThe school is old but a large amount of repair work has been done each year for the past three or four years. Cement floors are being placed in the basements where shower baths have been constructed. Supervised baths are also given to the children at least weekly.\n\nThe old floors of the school are kept in a perfectly clean state.\n\nI was particularly glad to find that even when no one knew of my proposed visit the whole of the school was in such perfectly clean condition. Great care must be taken at all times by the staff and children.\n\nIn the basements I noticed new saw dust burners which are a very great improvement to the hot air heating system.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe children look well and very happy.\n\nThere was no opportunity for the children to change their clothes for the occasion, and I was glad to note how neat and well dressed they were in their ordinary school clothes.\n\nIt has been suggested in the past that this school would be better if the Principal was a man, and that the boys in particular would benefit.\n\nThis is a wrong idea, and no experienced Inspector of Schools could agree to such wild statements. The work of the Sisters of the Child Jesus here is quite remarkable. The boys do not remain at school to an age when their control is in any way difficult for experienced teachers and Sisters.\n\nThe conduct of the children boys as well as girls is very good indeed; their manners are far better than in many of the larger Indian Residential Schools where the Principal is a man. The local Missionary Priest is the Chaplain of the school. I hope that this school will be continued for years to come under the same excellent administration, for I am perfectly satisfied that the children are being properly cared for from every point of view.\n\nIf the Department has had the slightest doubts as to the education of the children being faulty, or the general administration of the school unsatisfactory, I hope that this report, made after an unexpected visit, will set such doubts at rest.\n\nThe school will be visited again in the early part of 1939, when a longer time will be spent in helping the teachers with their classroom work.\n\nP.O.Box 444, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.15/14/6969.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant regarding my October report with reference to Residential Schools.\n\nI do not refer to either of the Residential Schools in this Agency particularly; as a matter of fact, the percentage of the per capita grant used for food in both the Squamish and Sechelt Residential Schools is above the average, according to the auditor's report, and still the pupils find cause for dissatisfaction.\n\nAn institution is restricted to the choice of foods which can be cooked satisfactorily in large quantities. On the other hand, where the parents are earning good wages, they are able to supply their children with a better and more varied diet than is possible in a school. When the pupils return home during the holidays, they notice the difference, and this is magnified to their parents, who use all kinds of excuses to postpone returning their children to school after the holidays.\n\nAs more Indians become self-supporting and independent, which is much to be desired, the necessity for residential schools as such will diminish, although they will still be needed where Indian parents are unable or unwilling to provide satisfactorily for their children.\n\nThe only definite complaint at Sechelt School was from two of the bigger boys who said they did not want \"mush\" every day for breakfast as it was not cooked properly. They said they \"would like bacon and things like that.\" Rolled oats with milk and sugar are considered proper food and no fault can be found with the Schools for supplying it. Such things as bacon and eggs for 80 children would be impossible in any case. My report was in no way a complaint, which would be reported specifically if found necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Fredk. J. C. Ball\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of November 16th in which reference is made to that part of Mr. Ball's October report dealing with Indian Residential Schools in his Agency.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I asked Capt. Barry to visit, without notice, the Squamish Indian Residential School, North Vancouver, and report on the food supplied at the noonday meal. Capt. Barry visited the school on November 29th and made a general inspection, and a copy of his report thereon is forwarded herewith. I need not comment on this report, other than to say that the Inspector found the children were being well supplied with good food, nor did find cause to complain about the training the children are given.\n\nOn December 1st I wrote to Mr. Ball and asked for an explanation of his reference to the food and training at the Residential Schools in his Agency. His reply, a copy of which is attached, indicates that the Agent has now no charge or complaint to make in respect to these matters, and also affords an opportunity to assess the references made by him in his report at their true value.\n\nMy reply to the last paragraph of your letter is in the negative.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

John\nCouncillor Louie Johnny\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nMOVED by Chief John\nSECONDED by Louie John\n\nTHAT the Indian Commissioner be requested to make an immediate investigation into conditions at the School.\n\nCARRIED UNANIMOUSLY\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I was personally present and presided at the meeting of the Shelkt Indian Council at which the foregoing resolution was unanimously passed and carried.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on the 8th, 9th & 10th instant I held a meeting of the Sechelt Indian Council. As I have stated several times in the past, it is difficult to get the Council together for a meeting except around the end of the year, as they all meet on their main Reserve at that time. Many return at Easter but we never have a full Council except at this time of the year, consequently it proved to be a long and tedious meeting, extending over three days and from morning till after 7 p.m. each day. A number of resolutions were passed and are reported upon separately.\n\nThe Secretary, Ed. John, sent his resignation, and Reggie Paul was appointed in his place. These two men appear to take turns as Secretary.\n\nConsiderable time was taken up listening to complaints about Sechelt Residential School, which seems to be a regular thing at each Council meeting. A resolution was passed asking the Indian Commissioner to make the usual investigation, but I do not favour such procedure. One of the complaints was, as usual, about the food. The auditor has just audited the school books, and the amount per capita spent on food is one of the highest in the Province, I believe. The diet sheet showing daily meals appears to be satisfactory, and the pupils do not look undernourished. Another serious complaint was that a 13 year old girl was with children and was corrupting other small pupils. I had the new Medical Officer, Dr. Holm, examine the girl and as a result she has been returned to her Reserve. She states she was raped by an Indian last summer; both parties concerned are from the New Westminster Agency, and Mr. Daunt has been advised. The vice-Principal of the School keeps a record of the weights each month of all pupils, and except in a few instances, they show a small monthly increase. However, in future, the medical officer, who lives near the school, will keep these records, and will also watch the diet sheet, with a view to making suggestions when necessary.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Father Connell, is interested in the welfare of the pupils, and will not allow irregularities in the School. The transfer, a few months ago, of the former vice-Principal, Father McGrath, from Sechelt School, was a blow to the pupils. The Indians who complain are those who no doubt are able to give their children more variety of food than any school is able to supply, they are mostly loggers making good wages. Logging camps generally are famous for the quality and quantity of food supplied to the employees, and I am afraid these Indians are apt to compare the school dining table with what they see in logging camps. Father Connell, however, is making some changes in his staff, which will probably correct any incompetence. Of course, day schools are the solution of the residential school problem, but the Department is committed to residential schools and we must make the best of it.\nI believe, however, that if the inspection of Indian schools was carried out by Provincial Government School Inspectors, we would have a comparison between Indian and white schools which might prove most beneficial, both to the school authorities and the Indians. If we want to educate the Indians, we should at least know how our efforts compare with white children, and I think we should be surprised and disappointed with the result of any unbiased comparison.\n\nThe resolution of the Secteit Council regarding the School is enclosed herewith, but I cannot favourably recommend at this time that it be acceded to.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nWe have recently had a number of truancy cases from both Sechelt and Squamish Residential Schools, the most serious being from Squamish School, North Vancouver. Fortunately, we have been able to locate and return these runaways without any protracted absences, and they have been suitably punished by the School authorities, but they immediately decamp again.\n\nThe Principal of Squamish School, Sister Alix, has now requested that some action be taken regarding the latest trio, who have run away three or four times. The last time, when they were picked up, they were in possession of a large quantity of toys, perfumes, flashlights, oranges, etc., which they admit having stolen from various stores in Vancouver. The Police are not taking action against them, but I think something should be done about it. It is suggested by Sister Alix that these three boys be discharged from Squamish School and separated by sending them to different Schools - Kuper Island, Christie and Kamloops being considered most suitable.\n\nThe boys are:\n\nKenneth Peters, aged 14,\nArchie Gonzales, \" 14\nIrving Gonzales \" 12\n\nThe Provincial Boys Industrial School is unsuitable for these boys as all our 'graduates' from that School have returned much worse than when they entered. Also the Superintendent there releases the boys without cause, and they are usually in trouble again.\n\nIf the above-mentioned Schools will accept these three boys, will the Department authorize their transfer, please? At these ages, they need sterner oversight than the Sisters can give them. Sechelt School is too near, and Mission School is filled up and, in any case, is also too close to be effective. This action would, I believe, have a good effect upon the other pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nB/DH.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.G.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nP.S. Since the above was written Sister Alix reports that a girl, Mildred Baker, aged 14, obtained 3 hours leave to go home. She failed to return and the father reports she left home on Saturday to return to School and has not been seen since. Search will be commenced immediately.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to truancy from both Sechelt and Squamish Residential Schools.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that there would likely be no permanent advantage in placing these boys in the Provincial Boys' Industrial School and consequently no such action should be taken if the Department is expected to pay for their maintenance.\n\nRegarding the suggestion that three of them be transferred to other Indian residential schools I would point out that the schools mentioned have their full quota of pupils at the present time and consequently supernumerary grant would have to be allowed for the boys transferred. Practically every Indian residential school at the present time has its full quota of pupils and, therefore, they are earning their full per capita grant. As a result the Department is short of funds to pay the per capita grants for all residential schools for the December quarter and some of them will have to wait until the next fiscal year before payment can be made. You will, therefore, realize that it is impossible for us to consider taking any action that might increase the amount required for per capita allowance.\n\nIf the Principals of the Sechelt and Squamish Residential Schools cannot prevent truancy the only possible course is to send such pupils home. Before doing so, however, I believe it would be advisable for you to consult the parents and have them point out to their children the necessity for their remaining at school where they will receive training that will be of\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nadvantage to them in the future. After all the parents have some responsibility in this matter and should be made to assume it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMINUTES OF MEETING OF SECHELT INDIAN COUNCIL AT SECHELT\nNo. 2, January 9th, 1940.\n\nCouncil complains that treatment of the children at Sechelt Residential school is unsatisfactory, both regarding food, the disciplinarian (Brother MacDonald) and the teachers, and they ask for a general investigation. Some of the complaints were as follows:\n\nBoys are dismissed at 14 or 15 because school cannot handle them. Statement by Mrs. Fitz Louie that a pupil from Ladner named Mary Louise Williams, 13 years old, was with child. Saw doctor and found this was true. Mrs. Dan Paull stated that Mary Louise called Mabel Jackson (aged 7) to \"feel the child kicking\". Council complains that all the young girls know things they should not know and are learning it at school. The girl stated Frederick Jacob raped her, but changed the story later, now saying it was one of the school boys, but it took place on the reserve during the summer holidays. He is her first cousin.\n\nMrs. Grant says son Harold has lost 9 lbs since summer holidays. William Mitchell says on December 27th he saw both lunch and dinner. 1 potato, bread and tea for noon meal, and 1 potato and small amount of cabbage and bread and tea for supper and no butter at either meal. At 4 O'clock, had 1 apple. Month before it was a raw carrot. No good in cold weather. Dan Paull says a cow with a diseased shoulder was killed for food. Had big abscess on shoulder and when Sam Hackett put a knife in the shoulder, the matter flew up in his face. Meat was green. Dan Paull says Father Plamondon told him he did not like to see the cow eaten as it was too sick to be eaten. George Craigton says Father Plamondon told Willie Paull one day that if the Government knew how the school was being run, the children would be sent home. George Craigton says children running around stealing food, they are so hungry. Mrs. Dan Paull says her son Walter has lost lot of weight. Brother Dave asked why Walter looks so thin. William Baker (Squamish) says his children failing, just brought his youngest child to school. He weighed 75 lbs, the elder boy has lost lots of weight, and now weighs only 75 lbs, 4 lbs less than the younger one. Many say children down in village all the time begging for something to eat. Brother Dave had children in his house giving them meals. Mrs. Fitz Louie says children all have body lice, head lice and bugs. William Baker says his son's shirt was not washed for nine weeks. Mrs. Dan Paull says her adopted grandson had over 600 bugs they combed out and killed them as they stood by the fence. The Brother was looking at them all the time. All the children are alive with vermin. Sisters never take care of the children at all. Another day the poor little kids came and asked for bread, jam and syrup. Children from Sliammon Churchhouse and Squamish come to Mrs. Dan Paull. Willie Joe asked her for bread, said he was starving. Every day he came down and she gave him a\nbag of food. The children are starving at the school, she says. They say her grandchild is best little child in school, he brought some meat down that was rotten, said he could not eat it. The mush is full of worms and the worms had black heads, they get punished if they don't eat it, and have to miss the next meal. The Sisters ill treat the little ones, drag them around by the ears. One sister very mean to the children.\n\nMoved by Chief John\nSeconded by Councillor Louie John\n\nThat the Indian Commissioner be requested to make an immediate investigation into conditions at the school.\n\nCarried unanimously.\n\nNote: These complaints are misleading. For instance, about the \"mush\" being full of worms, on questioning Mrs. Paull and inviting her to go to the school with me to examine the rolled oats she said this happened two years ago. William Baker has since placed another child at the school, which does not bear out his complaint. If Father Plamondon, who is Chaplain at the school, has made such statements, he should make them to the Reverend Principal. \"Brother Dave\" is a disturber. He formerly was practically the principal of this school and his actions were most irregular. He is not now a \"brother\" and was discharged some time ago, but lives near the Reserve and is undoubtedly supplying intoxicants to the Indians and generally causing trouble. Have reported separately on this matter.\n\nVancouver, B.C. Jan. 31st, 1940.\n\nThe school question has been settled, for the time being, and the Indians withdrew their resolution later. I advised them to discuss the whole matter with the Reverend Principal, who has promised to make all necessary changes.\n\nF. J. C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-11\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant regarding truancy at Sechelt and Squamish Residential Schools, I am afraid your solution of the trouble with reference to the three boys mentioned is not practical.\n\nNone has a home to which he can be sent and in any case, we should immediately have an epidemic of truancy as that is what the pupils want to do, viz, return to their Reserves.\n\nI shall have to find some other way of dealing with them if all the other schools are full.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that I received a phone call on Saturday afternoon, the 2nd instant, that James Matrall, aged 13, and Donald Johnson, aged 9, left Sechelt Residential School on the 1st instant, and have not been seen since. I immediately notified the police and everyone likely to see them, including coast-wise shipping masters and naval patrol boats, and commenced an intensive search of the district myself. As their Reserve is at North Vancouver, the inference is that they would walk to the nearest point to North Vancouver and then steal a row-boat and attempt to row across Howe Sound.\n\nOn the 3rd, I followed the roads and on the 4th and 5th, I used a fish-boat and examined the coast line. Monday was particularly heavy weather with continuous rain and fairly big seas, and if they attempted the trip in a row-boat that day, it might have proved fatal. On Tuesday (yesterday), the weather moderated and search was continued without success, and I returned to Vancouver last night. They would probably travel at night to avoid detection. The Reverend Principal thought the truants might have been harboured by a former acting-Principal of the School, then known as Brother Dave, but who has since become a layman, David Gelpin. I found him in a bunkhouse or a logging company, but he apparently had nothing to do with the disappearance of the boys. This was the only clue suggested by the School.\n\nThe boys carried a quantity of turnips and carrots but would be in no danger or starvation, as they would probably break into one of the many summer cottages, where they would find canned food, and, of course, they may be still hiding in such a place. They told the other pupils they would go to North Vancouver and hide under the Squamish Council house, but they have not arrived in North Vancouver, and I put no faith in that report. The parents say they will commence searching today, but do not appear unduly alarmed. I will make a further search, but the Indian Commissioner suggested I report their disappearance to you at this time.\n\nB/DH.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.G.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the action you have taken in endeavouring to locate James Nattrall and Donald Johnson who truanted from the Sechelt Indian Residential School. It is hoped that these boys will be found.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 6th instant notifying you that two boys had run away from Sechelt residential School, I beg to advise that they were found by a Union steamship official on Bowen Island, and have been returned to the School unharmed. They had done as expected, that is, they walked to the nearest point to North Vancouver and then stole a row boat, but on account of bad weather put in at Bowen Island summer resort, intending to continue their trip to North Vancouver when calmer weather prevailed.\n\nThey did not leave Sechelt until Wednesday, having lived in a vacant house since the previous Friday, which explains why I did not locate them during the period from Saturday to Tuesday when I was searching for them.\n\nThis affair has had one good effect. The School authorities claimed that once the pupils leave the School grounds, they are no longer their responsibility, and it is the Agent's duty to locate them. The Indian Commissioner has written to the Reverend Principal advising him that this is incorrect. I am surprised that although there are many men at the School, no effort was made to send out a search party - this has happened before when pupils have become truants.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 387-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nMarch 15, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received two communications recently from Indian Agent Ball with reference to the truancy of two boys from the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are pleased to note that these boys did not suffer any mishap and that they have now been returned to the school.\n\nMay I point out that when pupils truant from an Indian residential school the Principal should immediately advise the Indian Agent who will give every possible co-operation in locating the truants. However, this action does not relieve the school management of responsibility. As soon as it is discovered that a pupil has truanted the Department expects the school management to put forth every possible effort to locate the truant, even though this will require travelling some distance from the school. We have had, in the past, some cases that have resulted fatally due in great part to the fact that the school management did not concern themselves with locating the pupil immediately following the discovery of truancy. I feel certain that in future the management of the Sechelt Indian Residential School will strictly comply with the wishes of the Department as outlined above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E. J.

Both Major McKay and Captain Barrie have spoken to me in very favourable terms of Father McGrath and I feel sure that his appointment will meet with their approval.

He came to the school when conditions were most unsatisfactory, and was instrumental in improving matters considerably. I appreciate Father Cornell's kindly co-operation at all times and hope he will find Parish work at Penticton less arduous. His health was not very good at Sechelt, and he is no longer a young man.\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON VANCOUVER AGENCY FOR AUGUST 1940.\n\nSechelt Residential school re-opened this month with Rev. Fr. McGrath, O.M.I., the former vice-principal, as principal. The Indians are all pleased to have him back at the school, as he was quite popular there among pupils and parents also. One of his first troubles was with the manual training instructor, who was promptly dismissed.\n\nF.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nAugust 4, 1942.\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Bldg.,\n165 Sparks St.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nFor sometime past Father Michael Murphy, Principal of William's Lake School, has found the work somewhat too much for his strength. I have, therefore, named Father McGrath of Sechelt School to take charge of the school at William's Lake.\n\nFather Dunlop, who has had several years experience with the Indians at North Vancouver both on the reserve and in the school, has been named to succeed Father McGrath as principal at Sechelt.\n\nI feel sure that both these appointments will find favour with your Department and I will be glad to have the approval for same.\n\nWith my kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Scannell O.M.I.\nPROVINCIAL.\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1942.\n\nDear Father Scannell:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, the following appointments are approved:\n\n1. Williams Lake Residential School\n   Rev. J. McGrath, O.M.I., as Principal to succeed Rev. M. Murphy.\n\n2. Sechelt Residential School\n   Rev. H. Dunlop, O.M.I., as Principal to succeed Rev. J. McGrath transferred to Williams Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\nOblate Order,\n151 Laurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1942.\n\nE.A.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the recommendation of the Church authorities the Department has approved the transfer of Rev. J. McGrath, O.M.I., from the Sechelt Residential School to the Williams Lake (Cariboo) Residential School.\n\nHe will be succeeded as Principal of the Sechelt School by Rev. H. Dunlop, O.M.I. Please give the latter every possible assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nre: Sechelt Indian Residential School\n\nFor many years the situation regarding school matters at Sechelt was quite unsatisfactory. Unfortunately the school is built on the Reserve with the Indians living all around it and the slightest complaint of a pupil to its parents was magnified until the situation became quite serious at times, and one of the staff was actually assaulted by the Indians when he was on the Reserve. The Indians were sometimes justified in their complaints, which should have been easy enough to adjust but unfortunately some Principals seemed to resent the Agent's presence, although this was rather implied than actual.\n\nHowever, the whole situation was suddenly cleared up with the appointment of the Rev. J.M. McGrath, M.I., as Principal. The change in the Indians was immediate and almost magical, as he appeared to have won them over within a month of taking charge. The pupils emerged from their downcast and sullen appearance into a happy lively crowd and this also seemed to improve their health. Father McGrath had not the slightest difficulty in controlling them, and has never been compelled to inflict corporal punishment. Although he appears stern and aloof actually his whole time is spent in keeping the school running smoothly, and the children contented. The pupils are well fed and well clothed and their interest is held every hour they are awake, there is none of the former situation where one would see groups of the pupils huddled together in the playground listless and uninterested and doing nothing.\n\nOccasionally I have given the parents an opportunity of making complaints by asking how the school was getting along. Not only were no complaints ever made, but I received unusually favourable comments from the adult Indians. Father McGrath invariably invited me to the school for discussions on school matters whenever I visited the Reserve, and we were able to talk over any difficulties which arose, and settle them on the spot.\n\nI was greatly disappointed to hear yesterday that Father McGrath is being moved from the School. The loudest complaints came from the Indians, the school being closed at present, and I know the pupils will be bitterly disappointed when they return. It will be a tragedy if we revert to the former state of affairs. We now have the confidence and full support of the Sechelt Indians, and I had hoped to see this continue at least for a few years more until they have forgotten their old objections and antagonism to the School.\n\nFrom many years experience, I can say quite frankly that really successful school principals are not large in numbers and at Sechelt especially it requires more than a competent principal; it needs one who can obtain the fullest confidence of the Indian people. I do not know the reasons for Father McGrath's removal but if there is anything that can be done to retain him at Sechelt at least for a few years longer, I know it will be in the best interests of the Sechelt Indians, and that is, or should be, our main object.\nI would appreciate it, therefore, if you would kindly support this request to have the Rev. J.M. McGrath retained at Sechelt, especially during these difficult times when the Indians as well as whites are under the mental strain of war conditions, and any trouble on the Reserve about the School would be even harder to handle on account of these conditions.\n\nIt is unnecessary, I presume, in face of the above, to say that I personally would deeply regret Father McGrath's departure from this Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ball recommending the retention of Reverend Father J.M. McGrath, C.M.I., as Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, as it is understood that he is shortly to be transferred to the Williams Lake area.\n\nConditions at the Sechelt School have improved considerably under Father McGrath's administration, and it would be highly satisfactory to the Department's officials here if arrangements could be made with the Oblate Order to have Father McGrath continue as Principal at Sechelt at least until conditions become more settled.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nAugust 12, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing letter from Indian Agent Ball recommending the retention of Rev. J.M. McGrath, O.M.I., as Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 6th instant, the Department has already approved the transfer of Father McGrath to the Principalship of the Williams Lake School.\n\nThis transfer was recommended by the Provincial of the Oblate Order and, as you are aware, it has not been our practice in the past to refuse to transfer a Principal when a recommendation to that effect is received from the responsible church authorities. I am assured by the Provincial of the Oblate Order that Rev. Father Dunlop is a very capable man and I trust that he will be able to continue to do the good work that Mr. Ball states Father McGrath has done at Sechelt.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON VANCOUVER AGENCY FOR MONTH OF AUGUST 1942.\n\nA regrettable change of Principals was made at Sechelt Indian Residential school this term. I visited the school on the 3rd and 31st.\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nMuch of the month was spent in the office, and not many Reserves were visited. On the 8th I went to Sechelt Residential School and Reserve where rather extensive plumbing work is being done. The piping throughout the School is in very bad shape, and a full report will be sent in this matter later. While at the School I turned in the fire alarm unexpectedly, and in $2\\frac{1}{2}$ minutes the school was cleared roof being called and all hose and stirrup pumps were ready for action. This exceeds by $1\\frac{1}{2}$ minutes the previous record. The new hose recently supplied already saved its value within a week of its arrival when it was used to put our a bush fire which would undoubtedly have destroyed some of the new houses. The bigger boys are all A.R.P. fire fighters and have been well-trained. The nearest house to the School recently caught fire, spreading to the trees and menacing the School only 100 feet away, and the boys had the situation under control very quickly. The A.R.P. squad is equipped with stirrup pumps, and they are extremely proud of their A.R.P. steel helmets and jackets.\n\nFred J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nThere was a complaint made about a girl being injured in the kidneys by corporal punishment at Sechelt Residential School, and I was surprised to hear it, although the child and mother both appeared to be telling the truth when I questioned them at length. However, upon investigation, it turned out to be much different in fact. The child's mother had struck the girl. However, the doctors say it is a tubercular condition with no sign of injury. These complaints appear alarming and unless nailed at once, soon become fantastic in their implication.\n\nFred. J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Sechelt Indian Residential School, has asked if the closing date this year can be made June 30th, re-opening September 1st. The school has heretofore used the dates June 15th and August 15th, but the proposed dates would be more suitable.\n\nIt will be understood, of course, that by June 15th the school will have been in session 10 months. The Principal asks if you will please authorize this change of dates, without loss of grant.\n\n[F.J.C. Hall]\nIndian Agent\n\nFB/C\nOttawa, May 14, 1945.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball, Indian Agent,\n416 Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the summer holidays at the Sechelt Residential School being taken during the months July and August, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Per capita grant for the Sechelt School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWould it be possible to have the per capita grant of the above school raised from the present rate of $170.00 per year to $180.00?\n\nIt has always been the policy of the Department to base the rate allowed for a school on the distance from the railroad and the general transportation difficulties. Although Sechelt is only thirty odd miles from Vancouver, it is very difficult of approach because there is no motor road and transportation by boat is a difficult problem in itself.\n\nI am ready to admit that comparisons of rates allowed for various schools is not always the proper kind of argument to use in having the rate for any particular school changed, but I cannot see why the schools in the same territory and of easier access receive the $180.00 rate, and that it is refused to the Sechelt school.\n\nMoreover, Sechelt is situated in a very rough country where there is not even pasture for milk cows and hardly any land at all for gardening purposes. All this contributes to the high cost of living and with its present rate, it is very difficult for the Principal to make both ends meet.\n\nHoping that you will consider this request and allow the increased asked for, which after all, will not mean very much in the general Indian budget, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 17th November, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant requesting the per capita grant rate of the Sechelt Indian Residential School be increased from $170. to $180.\n\nI discussed your letter this morning with Mr. Hoey and it is regretted that we cannot see our way clear to increase the per capita rate of this school at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Increase in grant for the Sechelt School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of November 17th last, regarding the above matter. Since writing to you, I have had another letter from Reverend Father Dunlop, O.M.I., Principal, in which he informs me that the use of pasture for the school cows has been cancelled, as the Veterans Land Act have taken over the farm. This makes the operation of the school all the more difficult and really, obliges us to ask you to reconsider your decision.\n\nI admit that the changing of the per capita rate for any school is a serious problem but you may want to assume this responsibility for the Sechelt School, as there is no other institution in the Department so poorly provided with farm and garden facilities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nDec. 1, 1945.\n\nSPECIAL DELIVERY.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nWelfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWould you kindly forward the balance of the quarterly check immediately. I have not sufficient funds on hand to meet my obligations and I do not wish to have an over-draft on the school account again this month.\n\nI am sure you are aware of the fact that it has become increasingly difficult to operate in the smaller school these past few years. The bonus and extra grant provided by the department has certainly been a real help to us and has been greatly appreciated, but it has not equalled the enormous rise in the cost of living. Anyone in a position similar to a school principal knows that the cost of living has risen much more sharply than the figures and statistics published by the Dominion Government on this question indicate. For example a pair of shoes may cost little more than they did before the war but the depreciation in quality is astounding.\n\nIn addition to the rise in the cost of living, Sechelt is entirely dependent on transportation by water. To everything purchased there must be added a freight charge of $4.50 per ton on tonnage shipments. If less than a ton, which invariably is the case, the freight may run as high as double that amount. Moreover we have no pasture for our milk cows (The Japanese farm we had for two years has been taken over by a returned man); we have less than one acre of very poor sandy soil for a garden. Hay laid down in Sechelt is thirty six dollars per ton.\n\nIt would require the ingenuity of a Philadelphia lawyer to keep this place on an even keel. Lack of funds handicaps me in so many things I would like to do for the children.\n\nIn addition to the balance of the quarterly grant I should like to ask if you could possibly arrange for an increase in our yearly grant. At present we are on the same footing as big school with farms attached and in close proximity to big centres, yet we must exist entirely on the $170. provided by the department. On the other hand we have not been given the same consideration as the other Sea Coast Schools.\n\nThanking you for your past kindnesses, I am\n\nYours very truly\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 837-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 8, 1945.\n\nDear Father Dunlop:\n\nI desire to refer to that section of your letter of the first instant in which you request that the per capita rate at the Sechelt Residential School be increased. I have brought this request to the attention of the Director, who intends to consult the Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.F. Dunlop, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSechelt, B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver\n\nI am in receipt of a request from the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, for assistance in purchasing a new Sound Projector for visual education of pupils. The projector used until recently, was purchased in 1941, and is reported to be completely worn out, after considerable repairs were made to it last year. It is now in Vancouver. The machine required is a 16mm Victor Sound Projector, costing $491.00. This price is a reduction of over $100.00 from the ordinary retail price, as no duty is charged when sold for School use, and there is also a trade discount.\n\nThe sum of $250.00 is requested from the Department towards the purchase price, and the difference will be met by the School in cash and trade-in allowance for the old machine, from which parts can be reclaimed.\n\nThe value of visual aids to study is of sufficient importance to justify my recommending that this assistance be given if funds are available.\n\n(H.E. Taylor)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAA.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of August 26th, advising that the Sechelt Indian Residential School are seeking assistance to the extent of $250.00 towards the cost of replacing their motion picture projector which was purchased in 1941 and is now stated to be completely worn out.\n\nWhile the application is referred to you for whatever consideration you can give to it, it is not understood how the old machine could have become so completely worn out with only occasional use over a five-year period.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, September 19, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nVisual Education\n\nReference - your 215-14-5087 of September 5, 1946.\n\nWe have done considerable research into the whole question of visual education during the last two months. It has been decided to set up in the province of Manitoba an experimental unit in visual education. When film strip machines are available we intend to put them in the residential schools in that province. At the completion of a year we will receive reports from the various principals and teachers as to the success of this type of machine in improving the education provided at these institutions. This province was selected because of the excellent film strip library located in the Provincial Department of Education and rented out to the various schools.\n\nCould you please find out from your Provincial Department of Education if they are maintaining a film strip library there. If so, could you send us a catalogue and list of regulations concerning this library. We would be quite favourable to providing such a machine to the Sechelt Indian Residential School. However, we do not intend to provide a motion picture machine for our schools for the following reasons:\n\n(a) Lack of trained operators,\n(b) Expensive repairs required by these machines,\n(c) Expensive rental of films.\n\nHowever, on the appointment of your new school inspector, this subject can be gone into thoroughly insofar as it concerns British Columbia.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 167-18-5 (W.

I have written the Provincial Department of Education asking if a film strip library is maintained by them but I have not yet received a reply.\n\nFor D. M.

We have not added any hours of class but have simply rearranged the classes:\n\nBoys' and girls' in all grades take class together. All the children, boys and girls go to class from 9:00 A.M. to 11:30 A.M. and from 1:30 P.M. to 3:30 P.M. The girls take sewing from 4:00 to 5:30. The boys take woodwork at this time. There is no class on Saturday. Study on Sundays from 11:00 to 12:00 and from 4:00 to 6:00.\n\n**********\n\nCHANGES IN STAFF.\n\nWe were all sorry to say goodbye to Sister Anna Maria, Sister Mary and Sister Antoinette, who left us this term to take up work elsewhere in the Province. We wish them every success and happiness in their new duties.\n\nThis year the new Superior of the Sisters is Sister Matilda, who comes to us after many years of teaching experience in St. Mary's parochial School; Sister Stanislaus comes to us from St. Edmund's parochial School and Sister Lawrence who comes to us from William's Lake Indian School.\n\nSister Stanislaus teaches grades 3, 4, 5.\nSister Lawrence teaches grades 6, 7, 8.\nSister Mary of the Sacred Heart teaches grades 1 and 2.\nSCOUT RALLY\n\nFOR LORD ROWALLAN\n\nBY DAVE FRAZER.\n\nOn October 25th Father Principal took us to Vancouver to see our Chief Scout, Lord Rowallan.\n\nThe rally was held at Brockton Point in Stanley Park. There were about six hundred Boy Scouts and Cubs altogether and about five hundred Girl Guides and little Brownies.\n\nWe Boys Scouts and Girl Guides were lined all around the park for about half a mile.\n\nAs the Chief Scout drove around in his car we all cheered. After he got off and came to talk to the King's Scout. Afterwards he came and talked to Father Principal, then he came over and talked to our troop. We were shy. So have a picture of him talking to our troop.\n\n**********\n\nKEEP SMILING LOUIE.\n\nWhile we were in Vancouver at the rally Louie Lewis became sick. After we came home he got real sick. The Doctor sent him to the Hospital. He has been there over one month. Chins up Louie and we hope you will soon be back with your troop.\n\n**********\n\nHallowe'en was an exciting time. We were all thinking how we were going to dress.\n\nWhen evening came we dressed up and when we were ready we marched up to the stage behind the boys band. We marched around the stage about four times so Father could judge our costumes. The boys dressed up our dog \"Butch\". He looked funny with pants on and he won the first prize. Rose Peters and Esther August won on the girls side.\n\nAfter that we had funny tricks on the stage and candies. We had ghost pranks too. The little children were frightened of the ghost.\n\nWhen we finished our apples and candies we sang a hymn. Then Father told us there would be a picture show next night. We went to bed happy.\n\n**********\n\nThe girls were glad to see Sister Anna Maria who paid a visit to the school last week.\n\n**********\nT.B.\n\nTESTS.\n\nBY WALLY MARK.\n\nWe had a tuberculin test last week. Everyone in the school was tested. It didn't hurt much but some of the little kids were afraid.\n\nAll the children who were positive had to get an X-ray. Nurse Gerry did the tests, Nurse Bullock did the x-rays.\n\nIn a month or two we will know how they turned out.\n\nBANQUET FOR MR. TAYLOR. (BY A.JEFFRIES)\n\nDuring October a banquet was held for Mr. Taylor, our new Agent.\n\nThe day before he came we decorated the senior class room with red and white and blue streamers. The tables were brought up from the dinning room. They were covered with white table cloth and fancy dishes and flowers.\n\nThere were eight guests at the head table Mrs. Taylor was one of them.\n\nFour girls did the serving. They were Violet Williams, Sue Mitchell, Mabel Jackson and I. The Girl Guides and Boy Scouts were in uniform.\n\nAfter the banquet Father Principal gave a speech to welcome Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor spoke to show his thanks. He gave us a holiday.\n\nThen the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts gave Mr. Taylor the \"Scout Salute\". Then we sang, \"For he's a jolly good fellow\".\n\nLater in the evening we had a show.\n\n**********\n\nCLASS STANDING (First half of class listed)\n\nGRADE II\n\nChester Peters\nLoretta Joseph\nShirley Paul\nCamie Paul\n\nGRADE V\n\nSue Mitchell\nEster Julian\nDavid Jeffries\n\nGRADE VII\n\nNorman Joseph\nErnest Paul\nMabel Jackson\n\nGRADE VI\n\nTave Frazer\nCatherine Jimmie\nGilbert Joe\nCagney Point\nEmile Jeffries\nWally Mark\n\nGRADE LV\n\nBernadette Joe\nEdna Paul\nLeonard Johnson\nDoris Paul\nTommy Paul\nNora Lewis\n\nDon't forget to let your children know that you saw their name in the class standing.

School, I would advise that the Reverend Father Dunlop writes that he has no objection whatever to the suggestion that his method of dispensing Cod Liver Oil be made known to other schools, through the Indian School Bulletin or through other means.\n\n(H.E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\nSquirrel Cove, B.C.\nJune 5th, 1948.\n\nMr. H. E. Taylor:\n\nWe, the parents of the children at Sechelt Residential School understand this is the end of the Principal's term. So we suggest our Indian Department ask that the Principal's superiors to please leave him at Sechelt school for another term as he has been really taking an interest in our children and we also find him a very understanding Principal with children.\n\nSo we beg our Department to see what can be done for the sake of our children to hold the Principal Father Dunlop for another term:\n\nsigned:\nSchool children parents\nof the Klahoose Band of Indians, Squirrel Cove, B.C.\n\nWritten by: Yours truly,\n\n\"Bill Mitchell\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from the Klahoose Indians living at Squirrel Cove, B.C.\n\nThe Rev. H. F. Dunlop, Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School does not expect to be transferred this year, but you might, nevertheless, like to know that some of the Indian parents appreciate the work he is doing, tributes of this nature being infrequent enough to justify mention.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nAA.\n\nCopy to: W.

Taylor, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant enclosing copy of a letter written by the Klahoose Indians regarding the principal of the Sechlet School.\n\nWe have not received any information to the effect that Father Dunlop will be moved from the Sechlet School at the present time.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nAuditorium-Gym Opened With Gala Evening\n\nSF ALT\u2014The new auditorium and gymnasium of the Indian residential school was officially opened by R. Taylor at the department of Indian affairs at a concert presented by the school last Wednesday night.\n\nCulminating months of rehearsals, preparations, and building, the concert was presented to a capacity audience estimated at 1,500.\n\nFather Dunlop, principal of the school, addressed the crowd prior to the opening ceremonies, and told the audience that the hall was \"a dream we have had here for years.\"\n\nThe hall was officially opened by cutting the ribbon across the curtains on the stage with a pair of gold scissors.\n\nThe stage settings were the most elaborate yet presented at a concert here.\n\nFuture presentations of the evening was the two-act opera, \"Snow White,\" starring Joyce Point in the title role. Pojo, her ever-faithful servant, was played by Doris August, while Esther Julie played the part of the vain and evil queen of poppyland, who tried to do away with poor Snow White in her envious fury. Here of the act, the Prince Henry Orpheus was played by Freddy Louie.\n\nCapitivating the audience in this scene were the seven dwarfs. When they jokingly compared their slowness to the Union Steamship crew, there was big, real laughs of the whole evening.\n\nAnother highlight of the concert was the 18-piece string orchestra of the school. Rendering some very popular numbers, they were called back for three encore.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nGorgeous costumes and elaborate props made the stage settings the best seen at a concert here. All the costumes, from the beautiful girls' gowns to the handsome suits for the male actors, as well as the stage curtains, were made by the sisters and girls of the school.\n\nFather Dunlop, Brother McGourty and the sisters designed the complicated stage props, while the boys helped out in the creative work, for which there was much.\n\nThe stage lights, very effectively employed, added greatly to the productions, especially the colored slides which lighted the stage with different desired colors. All light arrangements were made by Father Dunlop.\n\nA boat ride was arranged by the younger members of the school, proved that they had learned something from the stage. While doing a duet of \"Cruising Down the River,\" Shirley Julia and Junior Joe actually went for a boat ride across the stage.\n\nIn the closing number, Eliza, both and Joe Mitchell, backed up by the chorus did a well-received duet of \"Good Night.\"\nSuperb Concert\n\n(Continued from Page 1)\n\nofficial opening night for the auditorium also marked the fulfillment of a dream for many of the students at the school. Father Dunlop in his opening remarks mentioned especially the two men who had worked so hard for the carpentry work, Mr. Morely and Mr. Temple; Mr. Al Jackson for his assistance on many occasions and many other times; the principal and staff of the Sechelt school for their cooperation; the thoughts of the whole Residential School in wishing Dr. Alan Inglis every success in his new work and expressed their sincere thanks for his work in the school during the past three and a half years.\n\nCREDIT FOR LIGHTING\n\nCredit for the excellent lighting effects went to Father Dunlop himself and also for his untiring work with the small performers and the re-written lyrics for the songs.\n\nAGENT CONGRATULATES\n\nMrs. H. Taylor, Indian Agent with Mrs. Taylor was present and made a short speech congratulating Father Dunlop and the staff of the school on the splendid transformation effected in changing the old building into the new auditorium, calling it an investment in the future that had been made on behalf of the young generation by those who had made a dream become an actuality.\n\nOPENING CEREMONY\n\nThe appearance of little Hazel Pielle, baby of the school, presented the very first occasion to Mr. Taylor for the cutting of the ribbon draped across the curtains marking the opening of a program that would have done credit to seasoned performers. The simple but effective performance was noted for the excellence of the music and the freshness and sincerity of the speech of the young performers.\n\nCLEVER LYRICS\n\nThe first item \"Big Shots and Little Shots\" included Richard Francis, Val August, Roger and Russell Joe and Lloyd Jackson as blacksmith, fisherman, hobo, farmer and big shot, had clever lyrics that were well delivered.\n\nSNOW WHITE\n\nThe operetta, \"Snow White,\" children's stage, and presented with Estel Paul as a convincingly wicked queen and Joyce Paul as Snow White. The queen's charming ladies waiting were Gloria Paul, Anne Jeffries, Sue Mitchell, Doris Jackson, Mahla Jackson and Edna Paul. Dennis August made a mischievous Podglo. The eight dwarfs included Gloria Paul, Gladys and Hazel Joe, Phyllis Mark, Lillian Jackson, Florence Hurst, Shirley and Edna Paul.\n\nDWARFS IN COSTUME\n\nSnow White and all the seven dwarfs were cleverly costumed in sacking and red stockings with beards. Among the dwarfs' number included the Big and Little Shots plus Edwin and Phil Joe and Theo. Thomas.\n\nPANS UNION CLEVERLY\n\nIn the final scene of the play where all her subjects were swearing allegiance to the new queen, Podglo brought the house down. You can count on all of us to follow in your band,\n\nAnd I get there like the Union Band, probably be late.\"\n\nCLEVER PARODY\n\nAgain the lyrics of a popular song were altered to fit the song \"Every Commotion,\" Yvonne Shields and Eva Pielle on the swings and with Victor Johnston and Joe George for motive power and Georgina Johnston and Dolores Joe to balance. \"It's a Grand Night for Swinging.\"\n\nFATIMA CALLS DANCE\n\nThe new dance, \"Buttons and Bows,\" contained more than the usual amount of fun and was danced and featured Clarence Joe, Elizabeth Mitchell, Junior Williams, Eva Paul, Dennis August, Diana Johnston, Joe Mitchell and Verna Hill. The singing made pleasant listening and the very well known square dance was added by Father Dunlop. We understand he is to be paged for the next old time square dance. Clarence Joe, Elizabeth Mitchell and Joe Mitchell with Verna Hill rounded out the numbers.\n\nREALISTIC EFFECTS\n\nThe popular \"Cruising Down the River\" was the third number with the queen's sister Shirley Julian and Clarence Joe realistically cruising and singing by the old accordion as played by Moses Wilson.\n\nEXCELLENT BAND\n\n\"Bowery Boys Rock,\" sung by the queen's maids filled in while the S.T.S. Band played its places the well played numbers. Here again the patient training and the hours of study by the band members paid off. The band alone was worth the trip in the rain to hear.\n\nCHORAL PERFORMANCE\n\n\"You Can't Be True\" was sung by several members of the band to give them time for the preparation of the stage for the finale \"Good Night\" and a better way of saying it could hardly be found than Elizabeth and Joe Mitchell's sweet voiced duet heard against the background of their schoolmates excellent choral singing.\n\nIMPRESSION OF EVENING\n\nFor all it was one of the most enjoyable evenings and most certainly the official opening of the Residential School auditorium will not be forgotten by those who attended.\n\nTHANKS TO STAGEHANDS\n\nCongratulations for their contribution to the lighting effects should go to Cagney and Adam Point\u2014Junior Joe on the main stage and others contributing to Brother McGourty and Sister Rita and her Domestic Science class.\n\nA patient called his dentist for an appointment today,\" said the dentist. \"But I can't take you now. I have eighteen cavities to fill this afternoon.\" Then he hung up the phone, packed up his gold bag and left the office.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nSechelt Indian Residential School\n\nFather Viney, Assistant Principal at Kamloops, is to replace Father Dunlop as Principal at Sechelt.\n\nBernard F.

Davey, M.C.,\nDistrict School Inspector,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSechelt Indian Residential School\n\nDear Bob:\n\nI have answered your letter of July 22 concerning Father Dunlop. I tried to phone Father Birch, the Oblate Provincial, but unfortunately, he is out of town. When I get his address in Vancouver, I will wire you at once so that you can discuss the matter with him.\n\nYou are fortunate to have the English Oblates in the residential schools of British Columbia. They have many fine men in training here, and great progress should be made in the residential schools under them. They also have a number of brothers taking technical courses so that they can teach trades in the residential schools.\n\nBest wishes to Margaret and yourself - I only wish I could visit British Columbia myself, but chances are slim at present.\n\nBFN/AM\nLieut. Col. B.F. Henry, M.B.E.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Bernard:\n\nI have just been told by Mr. Taylor, the Superintendent of the Vancouver Agency, that Father Dunlop is being moved from the Sechelt School. This has been quite a shock and disappointment to me as Father Dunlop is an excellent Principal and of the same calibre as Father Fleury, who you will probably remember, did such a fine job at the Mission Residential School. I do not know whether you are able to do anything in the way of retaining Principals at these Residential Schools but this move following so closely on the transfer of Father Fleury is to be deplored.\n\nOn the weekend prior to the 24th of May I visited the Sechelt School with Mr. Arneil and we were both delighted with the way in which the school was operating. The concert which was put on at that time was equal to anything that I have seen in Provincial or Indian schools. The academic work was also good and this June nine pupils graduated into high school. All this from a school with an enrolment of less than 100.\n\nUnfortunately I have not given reports on this school in the last year so that the Department probably is not aware of the excellent work that is being done at Sechelt. I have purposely omitted doing this because the school has been so well run that I felt my time would be better spent visiting other places. Anything that you can do to retain Father Dunlop would be worth while.\n\nPlease do not feel that this letter is in criticism of Father Viney who I believe is to replace Father Dunlop I have no idea of the ability of Father Viney.\n\nKindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F. Davey, District School Inspector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: File No. 889-1 (E.6)\n\nReferring to letter of the 8th instant from the Chief, Education Division regarding authorized pupilage in Sechelt Indian Residential School and requesting information re dormitory dimensions, I would advise as follows:\n\n1. 2 Senior Dorms. Each 28x29x11  \\[ \\text{Totals} \\]\n   2 Junior Dorms. Each 28x29x11  \\[ 17,864' \\]\n   2 Small Dorms. Each 17x14x11  \\[ 5,236' \\]\n\n\\[ 40,964' \\]\n\n2. There is a built-in circulatory ventilator system in each dormitory. Owing to the mild coast weather, windows are always open, allowing ample fresh air.\n\n3. The School Principal has requested that the authorized pupilage be increased to one hundred, as, apart from pupils now carried in excess of authorized pupilage, there are many applying for admission, and for whom facilities in either Indian or White day schools are unavailable.\n\n4. For a total of one hundred pupils the per capita cubic air space per pupil would be over 400, which, in view of the ventilation might be considered satisfactory.\n\n(H. E. Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nHET/FR\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: File No. 889-1 (E.1)\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise whether or not any decision has been reached regarding increase in pupilage at Sechelt Residential School.\n\n(H. E. Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDH/FR\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-1, part 2)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 27th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Sechelt Indian Residential School\n\nWe have a request from Superintendent Taylor to increase the authorized pupilage at the above school. We have received from him the following information:\n\n1. Capacity of Dormitories - 40,964 cubic feet.\n\n2. There is a built-in circulatory ventilator system in each dormitory. Owing to the mild coast weather, windows are always open, allowing ample fresh air.\n\n3. The school Principal has requested that the authorized pupilage be increased to one hundred, as apart from pupils now carried in excess of authorized pupilage, there are many applying for admission, and for whom facilities in either Indian or White day schools are unavailable.\n\n4. For a total of one hundred pupils the per capita cubic air space per pupil would be over 400, which in view of the ventilation might be considered satisfactory.\n\nOn the basis of 500 cubic feet of air space per child, the dormitories would only accommodate approximately 81 children. At the present time, the\nauthorized pupilage at this school is 90. Do you think we would be justified in asking the Minister for his approval to increase the pupilage to 100, in view of reasons 2, 3 and 4 above.\n\nPP/ST\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Sechelt Residential School\nYour file 887-1 (El) Oct. 27\n\nIn view of the lack of dormitory accommodation at this school I cannot recommend an increase in the authorized enrolment. Dr. Tennant, the Regional Medical Supervisor, Indian Health Services, feels that most of our Residential schools are badly overcrowded and that there is serious danger of the spread of communicable diseases when the space between the beds in dormitories is so limited. You will recall that a year ago we had a number of cases of Tuberculosis at the Kuper Island Residential School which were apparently contracted from the admission of one child to the school who was a contagious case. The unfortunate occurrence at the Kuper Island School has convinced me of the necessity of avoiding overcrowding.\n\nW.S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended ..................................................193......\n\nPrincipal ...........................................................................................................\n\nDated ..................................................193......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ........................................................................................................\n\nDated at ..................................................this ..................................................193......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Vancouver Agency**\n\n**School at Sechelt B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended June '30 1941**\n\n### REPORT of the Sechelt Residential School\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATES OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0214            | Jeocelia Paul | 8   | 1   | 25   | Port Alberni   | 1                 | Dom.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the current per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending March 30th, June 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended September 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 3rd 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCT 6 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRepl.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sashelel Residential School for the Quarter ended December 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan. 2nd, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended March 1943.\n\nPrincipal H. L. Dunlop\n\nDated April 1st, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDated at this 9th April 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sackville Residential School for the Quarter ended March 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 2, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Vancouver B.C., this 6th July, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal H. L.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept 30th, 19...\n\nPrincipal: H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Benhelt Residential School for the Quarter ended Mar. 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal M. L. Dunlop\n\nDated April 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APR. 22, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Saskehat Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: H. L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19..............\n\nPrincipal.................................................................H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet or the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Jan. 4, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Seal]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SECHELT RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended Mar. 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Mar. 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: A. J. Dewdney\n\nDated: Jan 2, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, see another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SECHILTE RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: A. L. Dunlop, D.M.\n\nDated: JULY 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDoreen Heelas\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver this July 15, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 3, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver this 12th October 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sachelt School for the Quarter ended... 31, 1946...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Jan. 2, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal H.

ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper places.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly grant capital. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated at Vancouver B.C. this July 3rd, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 1, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver, BC\n\nthis Oct. 1, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver this 5th January 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 268             | George August  | 10  | 1   |      | Sechelt         | 1             |                  | Manual Training       | 1/9/45                    | 2270       | Sardis - March 2.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SECHELT RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 1948.\n\nPrincipal H. L. Dunlop\n\nDated OCTOBER 2ND 1948\n\nNOTE: Having checked the date of entrance of the girls against the records it was found that errors had crept in re same.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan. 3rd, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver this 6th January 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 2nd, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver this 4th of July, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sechelt School for the Quarter ended September 1949.\n\nPrincipal: L. S. Smith\n\nDated: Oct 5th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: D. H. Clark\n\nDated at Vancouver B.C. this 20th October 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1950.\n\nPrincipal: L. W. Smith\n\nDated Oct. 10th 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nDated at Vancouver this 13th October 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3603\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1920.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDate: Jan. 13, 1921\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver BC\n\nthis 19th January 1921\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the Sechelt Residential School**\n\n**School at Sechelt**\n\n**on

I have today received a tender from the general contractors, a copy of which I herewith enclose, for constructing pediment on roof of passage, also for snow guards on roof of main building, snow slides from chapel roof would in our opinion fall clear of skylight, the same price would apply, viz. $12.00, should you think it necessary or advisable to have guards placed here also.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, January 31st, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Tebb,\n\nWith further reference to the water supply for the new Indian Boarding School at Sechelt, I have to request that you obtain prices from as many firms as possible, in addition to the two already submitted by you, for the installing of the tank, etc., in accordance with your specification and sketch which was submitted to the Department with your letter of October 30th last.\n\nIf Johnson Bros. and Messrs. Baynes & Horie are still willing to carry out this work at the prices quoted by them, please advise.\n\nThe delay in arriving at a decision regarding the water supply at this school was unavoidable and I hope that when I hear from you we will be able to come to some decision regarding same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(J.

Baynes & Horie's price of $37.40 for the construction of a pediment on the passage leading from the building to the chapel, also their price of $12.00 for the placing of a snow guard on the roof of main building for the protection of the sky-light.

C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRE SECHELT INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the septic tank, which has been put in exact accordance with the details, you will notice that the concrete baffle-plate does not connect with the top of the tank, but leaves a space of several inches, so the air is not sealed between the syphon tank, and the liquefying or digestor tank, it would appear that considerable odor would escape through the vent, this would be offensive and may prove dangerous from a health standpoint as it is it could be compared to a vent from a cesspool, further I have always understood that for perfect disintegration it is necessary to exclude, as far as possible, all pure air from the digestor tank, this could be done, in this case by bricking up the space above the baffle-plate and cement plastering on each side.\n\nI have taken up this question with Mr Henry Crombie who has had a wide experience with septic tanks, he says, it is absolutely necessary in order to break up and fully digest all solids and the paper that this space be closed, when this is done you will have a perfect water seal; the cost if done now would be ten dollars. ($10)\n\nAwaiting your instructions, I am.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSechelt, B. C.

The Provincial Boiler Inspector has examined and approved the installation, in this inspection the boilers were subjected to a pressure of 30 lbs. C. W. P. The heating arrangement works very satisfactorily, the radiators on ground and first floor warming up with little more than vapor, those in the basement with one pound of steam, the covering of pipes is proceeding.\n\nThe plumber will finish his work in a few days, I have procured a pump and intend to test all the plumbing supply pipeing and the hot water storage tank under a C.

Many of these tanks have been in operation for long periods and have given absolute satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArthur R.

The list of furniture for the new school was sent to Ottawa last October and we did not hear yet whether it is approved or not.\n\n3. The land (about 30 acres) which has been given to the school by the Indians should be surveyed and fenced.\n\n4. As no farm can be had, some additional ground should be granted for vegetable purpose.\n\n5. A meat house and cellar ought to be built at the place of the present temporary building occupied by the boys, on top of which rooms could be fixed for the engineer.\n\n6. A new barn is urgently needed; the old one is actually falling to pieces.\n\n7. A greenhouse would be very acceptable.\n\n8. Connection to the cottage and barn for electric light could be made with the new building. (electricity would be sparingly used everywhere.)\n\nHanded Mr. Scott\nBy John West\nFeb. 3rd '22\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 4, 1932.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum handed you yesterday by Rev. Father Welch regarding the Sechelt Indian Boarding School, I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. Water Supply.\n   The question of a water supply for this school is under consideration, and we are in communication with Inspector Tebb with reference to the installing of a satisfactory and economical water supply for the building.\n\n2. School Furnishings.\n   With reference to the furnishings required for this school, orders for same were placed some time ago and will be delivered at the school before the end of this month.\n\n3. Fencing.\n   The school authorities ask that the farm, approximately 20 acres, be surveyed and fenced. They also ask for some additional ground. The approximate cost of the fencing would be about $900.00.\n\n4. A Meat-house and Root-cellar.\n   A meat-house and root-cellar, with room over for the caretaker, are asked for. This could probably be erected for, approximately, $1500.00.\n\n5. Barn.\n   A new barn is required as the old one is falling to pieces. From information given by Rev. Father Welch, I would estimate the cost of the barn to meet the requirements of this school, at $2500.00.\n\n6. Greenhouse.\n   They intimate that a greenhouse would be very acceptable. The estimated cost of which would be about $3000.00.\n\n7. Wiring Principal's Residence.\n   They ask that the Principal's residence and proposed barn be supplied with electricity from the electric light plant now installed at the school. I would estimate the cost of wiring and installing the light in Principal's residence at $300.00.\n\nWith reference to the meat-house, root-cellar and barn asked for by Father Welch, I would suggest that we communicate with Building Inspector Tebb, and ask him to submit a rough sketch of the requirements and the accommodation that should be provided in these buildings.\n\nRegarding the wiring and connecting up of the Principal's house with the electric generator at the school, Mr. Tebb might be asked to obtain prices for this work and submit them to the Department for your consideration.\n\nRegistered Architect.\nVancouver, B.C., 23rd January, 1922.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n- Re Sechelt Indian School -\n\nWe herewith enclose our Account of $271.44 for casing beams, and trust the Department will overlook the fact that we have no written order for this work as an extra.\n\nWhen word came through Mr. Tebb that the beams were to be cased, we were then at work on the ceilings and had we waited to take up further the question of price &c., it would have meant quite a delay, besides adding considerably to the cost.\n\nTrusting you will give this reasonable consideration,\n\nWe are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWMH/IW\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVANCOUVER, B.

The generator was running at too high a speed, so a new pulley has been ordered, this will delay this work a few days.\n\nThe painters will finish in about ten days time.\n\nA part of the furnishings ordered from Messrs Mc Lennan & Mc Feely, have been received, also a part of the desks, ordered from Messrs Clark & Stewart.

February 23, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRE WATER SUPPLY FOR SECHELT INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of January 21st, in reference to the water supply for the new Indian Boarding School here, would say on the 2nd inst. I sent out six requests for figures on this work, so far I have only received one reply, that from the Canadian Pipe Company. I also submitted a specification to a Mr. Burg, I think however that he is in some way affiliated with Johnson Bros. I enclose herewith these two Tenders. The tenders of Johnson Bros., and Baynes and Horie are still good.\n\nI am forwarding the enclosed tenders rather than delay any longer, as the New School cannot be occupied until this work is completed, under present conditions we are unable to get water to fixtures on the first floor.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nThe water for the old Sechelt School was supplied through a pipe connected at a distance of one thousand feet from the building, to a main which supplies the Indian village with water. This point is sixty feet above school grounds. When taps are turned on in the Indian village, most of the water in the pipe is consumed and drawn past the connection that supplies the school with water.\n\nIn order to ensure an adequate supply of water for the new Sechelt School, it will be necessary to build a wood stave tank approximately 13' x 13' x 10\", and make the necessary repairs to the existing pipe line.\n\nMr. Tobb was asked to obtain competitive prices for this work, and has submitted the following:\n\n- Baynes & Horie, Vancouver, $2,083.00\n- Johnson Bros., Sechelt, $1,780.00\n- Canadian Pipe Co. Ltd., Vancouver, $1,750.00\n- O. Burg & Co., Wilson's Creek, $1,700.00\n\nMr. Tobb's estimate of the cost of the work was $1,800.00 and I am of the opinion that O. Burg Co.'s price of $1,700.00 is fair and reasonable for the work, and beg to recommend that it be accepted.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTO MR. SCOTT,\n\nA letter has been received from Reverend Father Welch, in which he asks that a small cottage be erected for the accommodation of the Chaplain of the new Sechelt Indian Boarding School. He has enclosed a rough sketch with his letter, showing the accommodation required and estimates the cost of the building at $1,000.00.\n\nThe cottage which is now occupied by the Chaplain, he states, has been condemned as unfit for human habitation.\n\nI have examined the sketch submitted and am of the opinion that a building erected to provide the accommodation shown would cost in the neighbourhood of $1,500.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 3)\nFebruary 27th,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nLast week I paid a visit to Sechelt, and I was much pleased with every detail in the new school. The furniture is now arriving and by Easter the building should be ready for occupation. Is there any chance of having you down for the opening? I have been taking it for granted that the School would be able to accommodate the Chaplain. On close inspection however I find that this is not the case, and would therefore suggest that the Department erect for him a small bungalow in the vicinity, at a cost of $1000.00. As he resides at Sechelt for the exclusive benefit of the school and the children I feel sure that you will consider my request a very reasonable one.\n\nThe little cottage which he now occupies has been condemned as unfit for human habitation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

This includes the wiring in Basement. You will note the enclosed Tenders are based on that ruling.\n\nThe Jenkins Electrical Co., have not been up to look over the job and I think their Tender is about $50.00 too low. Laverock had a man look over the proposition, I think this tender decidedly too high.\n\nI enclose herewith these Tenders, also a copy of specification, and rough plan sent out.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSechelt, B.C. March 21, 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nTHIRTY NINTH REPORT OF PROGRESS ON SECHELT INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAll Beds Mattresses etc. are set up in place, the School Desks have been fastened down in the Girls School Room, those for the Boys School Rooms will be installed as soon as I receive your instructions regarding the Double Desks on hand; The Chairs etc. received in P.E. have been put together and to-morrow I intend to furnish these where same were marred in shipment: The Kitchen Range has been connected to the Range Boiler, and the 3\" above pipes, ordered from McLennan, McFeely & Co., these will be set up as soon as received, as I understand the Staff intends to use the kitchen and pupils dining room; on account of not being able to get water to lavatories on the first floor, these cannot be used, so I do not think the building will be formally opened, or fully occupied until the service is completed.\n\nThe furnishings are tardy in arriving, have had no advice or any merchandise from J. Oliver & Sons Ltd. of Ottawa, and McLennan, McFeely & Co. are still short on their order, I am in communication with them, in regard to same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe # 177517-5a.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 9th, I have today mailed to you, under separate cover, a sketch for Barn 35'x 38', containing stalls for 10 Cows, and one Horse, also Calf pen, maternity stall, and feed room.\n\nI have shown the Floors, manger, and gutters, in concrete, as the beaches here are composed of gravel, and sand, mixed in the proper proportions, to make the best concrete obtainable by simply adding the cement and mixing, so concrete under local conditions, would be very little, if any more expensive, than wood floors and joists, more especially as few forms are needed.\n\nRegarding the Meat House, and Root Cellar, Kindly refer to sheet No. 2 of list of additions requested by the staff, and mailed by me on September 19th, which describes this building and to which is attached a sketch of building, and its relation to the new school, the only change suggested in this sketch is, that two small rooms be partitioned off the seed room, for accommodation of Engineer, and Gardener, as sleeping rooms.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nVancouver, B.C., 23rd March, 1922\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n- Re Sechelt Indian School -\n\nWe have received our Bonds and deposit cheque for which accept our thanks.\n\nIf in order, now that the Contract is completed we wish to express our appreciation of the business like promptness and attention all our enquiries and communications have received, and to the Architectural Section for the clear and workable plans supplied us, as we rarely find so few snags in a job of that size.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBaynes & Horie\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 29th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 23rd instant and am pleased that you found satisfaction not only in the plans and specifications, but also in your dealings with the Department.

Murray Brothers, who supplied the boiler, have had it inspected already.\n\nI would suggest that the boiler should be registered for annual inspections but that the fees for the inspection should be paid by the management of the school.\n\nPlease let me hear from you on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The work would have been carried out months ago, but a lot of correspondence and delays were caused in arriving at an economical and satisfactory solution of the water supply system for this building.\n\nIs there no way in which the work could go ahead and avoid unnecessary delay in occupying the building?\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegistered Architect.\nApril 12, 1922.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nThe Honourable Charles Stewart,\n\nWe have just about completed a new Indian Boarding School on the Sechelt Reserve, British Columbia. The installation of a water supply was not included in the original contract, and as soon as the Department had ascertained the necessary data, tenders for this installation were called for, with the result that the following four tenders were received:\n\n- Raynes & Horie, Vancouver, $2,085.00\n- Johnson Bros., Sechelt, $1,760.00\n- Canadian Pipe Co., Ltd., Vancouver, $1,750.00\n- O. Burg & Co., Wilson's Creek, $1,700.00\n\nThe estimate of the architect in charge of the work, Mr. Tabb, was $1800.00, and our own architect therefore recommends the acceptance of the lowest tender, that of O. Burg & Company for $1,700.00. Funds are available from the vote for Indian Education, and with your approval I shall submit the necessary memorandum to Council, accepting this tender.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSechelt, B. C. April 19, 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFORTY SECOND REPORT OF PROGRESS ON SECHELT INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe twenty six double desks, in use in the temporary school rooms, have been converted into single desks to conform with the new ones supplied, and are now installed in the new class rooms, the broom cupboards are finished, and work commenced on towel rails in the pupils lavatories.\n\nWith reference to the Lighting Plant, would say, the Generator appears to be of ample capacity to handle all the lights in the building; but the supply is not powerful enough to maintain the voltage at 110, with all lights burning, the voltage will fall to 74\u00bd. The Engine will stand up to load and maintain the voltage at 110, with about two thirds of the lights in use, and it will be a rare occasion that more than this number will be required at one time, if such occasion arise that more than two thirds of the number of lights are needed, it will be necessary to draw on the batteries.\n\nI have received advice from J. Oliver & Son that the furnishings ordered from them have been shipped.\n\nThe water proposition, is the only thing remaining to prevent the whole of the building from being occupied.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\n6th of April, 1922.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou will remember that on 27th of February, of this year I suggested that the Department should put up a small bungalow at Sechelt for the use of the resident Chaplain.\n\nAs I then pointed out the new School will be unable to accommodate him, and that in consequence a separate dwelling should be provided for him by the Government.

I have taken this up with The McLennan, McFeely Co. and insist on either a water front, or a new coil being installed.\n\nThe Portable Bake Oven arrived and is set up, and the stove pipes for it are on order, it went together in good shape and I do not anticipate any trouble with it as it seems perfect.\n\nThe carpenter started work this morning, putting in the broom cupboards, under the basement stairs.\n\nHave had no advice of shipment of Furniture ordered from J.

We are going to try and make a drive to raise enough money for this purpose.\n\nNow I know that in Sechelt your Department has built a lovely school, and our Directors, in talking the matter over, and with a view to have our plans as perfect as possible, are asking your Department to lend us for consultation the plans of the school referred to. I will undertake to take every care of the papers sent.\n\nWe do not want to copy them, but we want to take out of them what might be suitable for us, and to take advantage of the efficiency of the schools built by you.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nForty Seventh Report of Progress on Sechelt Indian Boarding School\n\nRe the New Water Connection for School\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRegarding the installation of the new Tank and pipe line, I wish to report, since same was connected up twenty days ago, there has been an ample supply of water for all domestic requirements, and pressure to give reasonable protection in case of fire.\n\nThe pressure by the gage is 127 lbs. at level of school yard with all outlets closed, the pressure drops to 122 lbs. when one of the fire hose is in use, and will throw a stream of water onto the roof about half-way to the ridge, from the ground.\n\nAt the present time the Y is set to deliver 10 gallons of water per minute to the supply tank, for school purposes, this appears to be a large amount being 14,400 Imperial gallons per day.\n\nIt is essential for the growth of vegetables to use sprinklers, the ground is little more than sand, there are usually two sprinklers in use, these are of ordinary size, about 3/8\" discharge the two use 13\u00bd gallons per minute, these with laundry and domestic requirements draw heavily on the reserve and at times practically empties the tank, but as stated before to the present there has been no shortage of water, only the loss of a few pounds pressure.\n\nAt the suggestion of Mr. Bitchburn, who went over the system with me I am adjusting the Y to give the school an increase of two gallons, making a total of 12 gallons per minute to the school, as I am particularly anxious to have an adequate reserve on hand at all times for fire protection.\n\nThe installation is a good job, and the working of the system up to expectation, although I under-estimated the quantity of water required by the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe Sechelt Indian Boarding School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached hereto please find report of working of new supply system for water to Sechelt Indian Boarding School.\n\nThis report has been delayed on account of the many leaks which developed when the pressure came on; this trouble was confined mostly to the tangle of pipes in the yard and gardens, many of these pipes were laid by using pipes which passed through the fire of last year and leaked badly under the increased pressure; considerable difficulty is experienced in locating these leaks, as on account of the nature of the soil, unless the crack or hole is not on the upper side of pipe water will not show at the surface of the ground, so in some cases whole lines have had to be dug up.\n\nUnder the old system, when there was little or no pressure, the mains had accumulated considerable quantities of sand and scale, this was loosened by the high pressure, and increased volume water and carried to fixtures of the new building.\n\nThe leaks above referred to have been repaired by me with the help of the Engineer, I have also cleaned out all supply pipes to fixtures and placed new washers throughout the entire building, so everything is now in good shape.\n\nI understand Mr. Ditchburn has taken up with you the advisability of placing an outside hydrant, with hose and ladders so same can be carried up on to the roof of buildings.\n\nThe only further suggestion I can offer to improve this installation is that a Pressure Reducing Valve be placed in the domestic supply pipe, reducing the pressure to 60 lbs. on all the fixtures, retaining the full pressure on Fire Lines and Gardens, I recommend this as washers have to be perfect, to hold 127 lbs. pressure and will otherwise require frequent renewals.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nJune 30, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd inst., with reference to the Sechelt School, and am very pleased to hear that the water system is giving satisfaction.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I beg to inform you that you are authorized to have a Pressure Reducing Valve installed and a domestic supply pipe in order to reduce the pressure to 60 pounds on all fixtures, and retaining full pressure of 127 pounds for fire lines and gardens.\n\nWith reference to the placing of an outside hydrant, I would ask you to be good enough to obtain prices for this and submit same to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Tubb\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that on the 15th ultimo I attended the opening of the Sechelt Indian School and availed myself of the occasion to say a few words to the large gathering of whites and Indians showing what the Department were doing in the way of endeavouring to educate the Indians of British Columbia, illustrating my remarks by giving figures to show what it was costing the Government of Canada in this regard. I spoke very plainly to the Indians as to their apparent lack of appreciation of what was being done in their behalf and told them not to pay so much attention to agitators who go among them leading them to believe that the Government were not doing anything for them. I asked them to help the school as much as they possibly could, more particularly in allowing their children to remain in the institution for the full school term.\n\nI was very pleased to see such a comfortable building, practically complete in all its appointments and the Reverend Principal and the Sisters feel very proud of their new home.\n\nI met Mr. Tebbs, the Inspector of Works, on the ground and went into many matters with him. I feel that he has fully looked after the interests of the Department to see that good value was received from the contractors for the money expended. I think it would be advisable that he should be kept employed for a further two months as there are a few things that will require some attention.\n\nThe building is practically fireproof from within and there is ample fire-fighting appliances such as hose and fire extinguishers, but I believe it would be well to install a hydrant on the outside of the institution to cope with any fire that might possibly take place from the outside, for the roof of the building must be watched for the future owing to the possibility of a bush fire taking place in the woods adjacent to the school or sparks from the chimney. At present there are no means for reaching the roof and the pressure from the one-and-a-half inch hose is not sufficient to throw the water any further than a few feet above the eaves. I would therefore, recommend that Mr. Tebbs be instructed to procure the necessary pipe and valves for a hydrant to be located at a suitable point on the right-hand side of the building. The work of making the connection can be done by Mr. Brown, who is employed by the Sisters as engineer. He is a competent man and a complete set of plumbing and machinist's tools have been supplied for his use. He is also a carpenter. It will also be necessary to purchase 200 feet of one-and-a-half inch cotton hose with couplings and nozzle. To reach the roof I would recommend that two short, removable ladders be either purchased or constructed, one to reach from the ground to the flat roof.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nof the laundry and the other from this point to the roof of the passage to the Chapel from where a short stationary ladder should be constructed to reach the roof of the main building on which chutes might be nailed for easy climbing. Should a fire take place on the roof it could be quite easily controlled by one person with a hose of the length mentioned.\n\nMr. Tebb was to look after the making of sufficient benches for the dining rooms. I think it would be well that some pews should also be supplied for the chapel. Mr. Tebb could get up his own design and have the ends and seats cut at Vancouver and the pews could be put together on the premises. It is appreciated that you have already stated that the Department has not undertaken to supply pews but in view of the fact that pews were furnished for the chapel at the Kuper Island School the Sisters of the Scholast school feel that they should be accorded the same treatment.\n\nThe water supply is none too good\u2014plenty for the domestic requirements of the building but there are at present four acres of land under cultivation. The soil is nothing but sand though produces excellent crops if watered. To get results a number of stand-pipes have been laid and garden hose with sprinklers attached are used to afford a system of overhead irrigation. I found a number of these stand-pipes near the valley being worn out and I therefore wired to Victoria for one dozen half-inch hose bibbs to replace those out of commission. These will be found included in the account for the general hardware supplied to the school. In order that the water might be conserved as much as possible I directed that some of the stand pipes should be cut out and the sprinkling done from more central points in each garden plot. There will then not be so many of the taps to get out of order. I also ordered that the watering of the gardens should be done either in the early morning or in the evening to do away with loss through evaporation. As you are aware no doubt, the service to the school is through one-and-a-half inch pipe from a tank installed on the hill above the school but I found that this tank had never filled since it was erected, thus showing that the flow of the pipe is being used to its capacity. Later in the season when water is not needed for the gardens the tank will, no doubt, fill up. However, it is intended to clear up more land to put under crop and the need for water will then be greater than it is at present. It may therefore be necessary in the near future to provide for a greater supply from the springs or other source by the installation of a larger pipe to replace the one in present use which is a three inch one to the point of diversion to the school. Mr. Tebb informed me that two lengths of this three inch pipe was in a leaky condition and I would therefore recommend that he be empowered to obtain two new lengths and have these connected up. The force of water, however, may be increased by cutting off the supply from the Indian village to the Whittaker interests.\ninterests. This water the Whittaker people have been allowed to use through a private arrangement between the Indians and themselves. I understand the Whittaker people pay $200 to the Indians\u2014this money to be used on the upkeep of the church on the reserve. The Whittaker interests include Sechelt hotel, store and a number of summer cottages. If their supply were cut off entirely the water, no doubt, would back up from the Indian diversion into the three inch main and cause a stronger flow into the river on the school. I spoke to Mr. Whittaker on this matter and informed him that it might be necessary to terminate any arrangement he had with the Indians but he asked, if possible, not to do anything this year as they anticipated having a joint water system for all interests of Sechelt undertaken next year. We will, however, be able to see how the present system works out during this season.\n\nAll the furnishings, etc., which I was authorized to purchase reached the school in good order, to which, however, were added eight chamber pails. These had been included in a requisition for drugs sent me by the Principal but I purchased them locally at the same time as the general furnishings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nJuly 17, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA report has been received from Mr. Bitchburn, with reference to a recent visit made to the new Sechelt Boarding School. He has brought several matters to the attention of the Department, and I would ask you to advise me on the following:\n\nThe installing of one or two hydrants on the outside of the institution in order to cope with any fire which might possibly take place from the outside. With reference to the installing of the hydrants Mr. Bitchburn states that Mr. Brown who is employed by the sisters as engineer, is competent and capable of making the installation if the Department will furnish the material. Kindly obtain and submit to the Department prices for the hydrant or hydrants and piping required, also for 200 ft. of 1-1/2\" cotton hose with couplings and nozzle.\n\nTwo short removable ladders are required to reach from the ground to the flat roof of the Laundry, and two other from this point to the roof of the passage to the Chapel, and a short stationary ladder should be constructed to reach the roof of the main building. With reference to this matter, you may arrange to have the ladders built.\n\nMr. Bitchburn recommends that the Department furnish the school with pews for the Chapel. Kindly obtain prices and submit same to the Department for a few pews of economical design. Mr. Bitchburn also states that two lengths of 3\" pipe are required to replace those in leaky condition. You may purchase them and have them installed.\n\nKindly give these matters your immediate attention and submit prices as soon as possible.\n\nArthur R.

Tenders for Hydrant and the necessary pipe will be in any day now and will be submitted to you, this also I am willing to install if you so desire.\n\nThe new Range Boiler has been put in place and connected up, this was made necessary by the first boiler developing defects, as stated in my previous letter.\n\nThe Water System is working splendidly, and although the drought still continues, there has been an ample supply of water.\n\nConstant watchfulness, and repeated instructions are exercised and given by the staff, on the proper use of the toilets yet in spite of these, at times some of these are choked by large pieces of paper or other material, up to the present time it has been possible to clear them with cup-pump, today one resisted this and I will have to lift the bowl, the sewer is clear, but obstruction is lodged in trap of bowl, otherwise everything is in good shape.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nAugust 3, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you under separate cover three blue print copies of plans also specifications which have been prepared for the Chaplain's cottage in connection with the new Sechelt Indian Boarding School.

P. inlet and 1\u00bd\" hose connection. Price $30.50\n\nThe Canadian Fairbanks Ltd.\n1 # 2 Standard Yard Hydrant, with 3'6\" bury for 1\u00bd\" supply main, 2 connections for 1\u00bd\" Hose, Hole with Valve, below ground. Price $75.00. Have written to ascertain if the Crane hydrant is fitted with valve below frost line, this is essential. There will be required to install the hydrant 65' of 1\u00bd\" galv. pipe, price about 21\u00a2 per foot.\n\n1 1\u00bd\" T \" \" 40\u00a2\n2 1\u00bd\" dart unions \" \" 144\u00a2 each\n\nIn reference to installation, I am quite willing to do this myself, and shall be glad to have Mr. Brown to assist me. While I remain in the employ of the Department I am always willing to put on overalls and do any work where same is desired.\n\nWith reference to the ladders, I think they can be purchased cheaper than they can be made here, as material would have to be secured in Vancouver, and freight charges would be practically the same as on finished ladders. I have written to ALL-RIGHT Ladder Co. for prices, added to your list one Roof Ladder with hooks for ridge, roof is too steep pitch, to walk on with safety. Kindly confirm this addition, also if you think it advisable to have ladders painted red and stenciled, For Fire Only.\n\nIn regard to the Pews for Chapel, have prepared detail and called for competitive prices on same.\n\nThe Wood pipe required is two lengths of 2\" to replace some badly decayed, this is near the intake, will attend to this.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nForty Ninth Report of Progress on Sechelt Indian Boarding School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe seats for sewing room, as per Mr. Ditchburn's instructions, have now been completed and installed in place. There are 10 in number; in design they are a settee, but without arm rests, the ends and center supports are framed up; the seats are solid and shaped for comfort; backs are of strips finished with roll at top; the finishing consists of a coat of stain and two or varnish.\n\nRegarding the choking of closet mentioned in my report of the 18th instant, would say, when I removed the bowl I found that two apples had been thrown into it; these had lodged in the trap and had to be broken up before they could be removed, as this happened in one of the boys toilets I took the opportunity of showing each boy in turn the obstruction while still in the trap by using angle mirrors, after which they were given a lesson in use and abuse of modern plumbing which I think will be remembered.\n\nSome time ago I mentioned that the staff were furnishing and I had agreed to build a work table for the kitchen; this has been completed; it is enclosed underneath with three doors, and all the pots and pans used in the kitchen are stored within; it is provided with a drawn metal top, or work board, and furnished with a drawer for the Kitchen Cutlery.\n\nRegarding the pressure reducer, authorized by you, I obtained prices from two of the dealers, and ordered from The Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co. Ltd. I will forward these tenders with invoice when same is received and checked; the fittings arrived yesterday; the installing will receive my immediate attention.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nNew Westminster\n\nAGENCY.\n\nNew Indian Boarding School at Sechelt, B.

Tabb.\nInspector of Construction.\nAugust 16, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st inst. with reference to the installing of a hydrant at the Sochelt School, I beg to say that you may accept the price quoted by Crane, Limited, providing you are satisfied with their hydrant. You may also purchase the necessary piping required.\n\nWith reference to the ladders required for fire protection, if you are satisfied that they can be purchased more economically built up, you may make arrangements to purchase same and if possible, obtain competitive prices.\n\nIn purchasing the ladders you may have one installed on the roof as suggested in your letter. It would also be advisable to have the ladders painted red and stencilled on same \"FOR FIRE ONLY\".\n\nI would ask you to be good enough to have everything completed at the Sochelt School before the end of this month as your services as Inspector of Construction will expire on that date. I may say that the Department is exceedingly well satisfied with the services rendered by you in connection with this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArthur R.

He had died years ago. The school as we have it today is the outcome of his devoted labors. Others have worked and worked zealously for the Indians, but it was he who laid the Christian foundation broad and deep on which they have built.\n\nFifty years ago the Sechelts heard of the French missionaries and sent for one of the Fathers to teach them the true religion. Father Drouin as he then was went among them. He found several tribes, long distances apart, all speaking the same language and all asking for instruction. Sechelt was chosen as a central point where the different tribes could gather on the great festivals of the year. Only thirty miles from New Westminster, it could be easily reached, and yet in those days it was far enough away for the Indians to be secluded and by themselves. The place is of great natural beauty. The coast here makes a half circle around the bay. There is a long, sandy beach from which the land slopes gently up to the foothills, while from the shore there is a superb panorama of the mountains of Vancouver Island rising thirty miles away above the water.\n\nAfter the Indians had become Christians, and the church (not the present beautiful structure, but an earlier building) had been completed, the Bishop brought from France the Sisters of the Instruction of the Infant Jesus. He called a meeting of the Sechelt Indians and explained his plan. He did not want their children to grow up ignorant of everything except hunting and fishing and logging. For this reason he had brought from France devout women who were ready to give their lives to teaching them. This, however, could not be accomplished without a building fit to house both teachers and pupils, and the school could not be had unless the Indians themselves were willing to build it.\n\nThese words made the hope for impression, and the Indians built the school under the superintendence of the Bishop. It was a frame building sufficiently large for their immediate needs, and it served its purpose well from 1904 to 1916. In the latter year there was a veritable epidemic of fires among the Indian schools, and Sechelt did not escape, for one night fire broke out in the laundry, and before it was discovered it had destroyed much of the entire school building and destroyed. Happily no lives were lost, but the Sisters now had to live in a building not much better than a hovel, and which was made to serve as dormitory, school room, dining room and kitchen. Their courage did not fail and they determined to remain where they were until such time as they could have a new school.\n\nThey waited for six years, but everyone who sees the large and imposing brick building which now stands on the hill overlooking the village knows they did not wait in vain. The school has cost the government at least $140,000. It accommodates about eighty pupils and is supplied with a heating plant and electric light throughout. The chapel is of good proportions and there is a large hall with a stage for entertainments. Taken all in all, the new school is worthy of the Department that has built it, and must come as a reward to the Sisters for the years of poverty and self-denial in which they elected to live after their arrival.\n\nThe day chosen for the formal opening of the school was Corpus Christi, and the Mass would be at Sechelt from the different reserves for the procession of the Blessed Sacrament. These gath-\nJuly 11, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welch,\n\nI have to thank you for the copy of the \"Monthly Bulletin,\" with an account of the dedication of our new school at Sechelt. I am very much pleased to learn that you had such a successful opening, and I must particularly thank you for your references to myself. I hope the school will be very successful. We have money in the Estimates for erecting a bungalow there, and we will hope to complete it at a reasonably early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n2331 Maple Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you very much for the loan of the plans of the Sechelt Indian School, which you forwarded to me on the 7th of July, and which I have kept safely until now.\n\nI want to thank you for your courtesy in permitting my Building Committee to go over these plans, and I am deeply grateful to you for the same.\n\nI suppose if we decide to send our Committee up to Chilliwack to view the new building, we have your permission to visit the School in Sardis.\n\nThanking you again, I am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nSupt.\nOctober 9th 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to thank you for the return of the plan of Sechelt Indian Boarding School loaned you some time ago.\n\nWith reference to the proposed visit of your Committee to the Sardis School, I would say that the Department is pleased to grant you permission to visit this school. I may say for your information, that only a portion of the proposed new building has so far been erected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. J. SOUTH, Esq.,\nSupt. Children's Aid Society\nof VANCOUVER,\nCorner Hastings & Main Sts.,\nVancouver - B. C.\nOctober 9, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 30th, enclosing tenders for the bungalow for use of the chaplain of Sechelt Boarding School, the prices as submitted are considerably more than the Department is prepared to spend on a building for this purpose.\n\nWhen the matter was first brought to the attention of the Department, and the sketch submitted, it was estimated that the cost would be in the neighbourhood of $2000.00, and I would ask you to be good enough to advise me after consulting with the Reverend Principal, if the plans and specifications could be modified in order to reduce the cost to the original estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nArthur R. Tebb, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nSechelt - B. C.\nReferring to Departmental Letter dated the 23rd of September, No. 177517-4, I note that the Department is not prepared to purchase sewing machines for the use of the Sechelt Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn a communication dated the 4th of October, No.122050-5 the Department informs me that an order has been placed for two machines for the Squamish Mission Boarding School.\n\nThe sewing machines are very necessary at the Sechelt Boarding School, as the girls are taught dressmaking, and if the machines are not supplied, it is very difficult for the teachers to carry on their work, for besides the regular lessons in sewing, there is a considerable amount of mending etc., which the elder girls do for the boys and younger girls.\n\nIn view of the above, I would respectfully recommend that two sewing machines be purchased for the Sechelt School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

We are today placing an order for these machines with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, here. The machines ordered are described in the catalogue of the above company as No. 2 - 3 Drawer - 127-3-G.O. and are supplied this Department at a discount of 40% on the retail price.\n\nYou will be notified from the nearest branch office of the company when these machines are available and you should then furnish the necessary shipping instructions.\n\nThe accounts, in duplicate, will be forwarded to you. You should attach them to proper voucher forms, certify and send them to the Department, so that payment can be made.\n\nThese machines are being supplied on your recommendation and report that it would be difficult for the teachers to carry on instruction in sewing to the girls if the machines were not supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Twenty-five additional single desks are now needed, which it is hoped will be ordered without delay.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Melh. O.M. 9.\n\nP.S.

We have a damp sometimes a chilly climate but never really cold, after a resident here for almost thirty years I have never seen the thermometer down to zero.\n\nI will give below the usual construction of one and two storied houses and bungalows in general practice here, and while it does not enter the same class as your specification, it is plenty good enough for the purpose, and will stand and wear well without extensive repairs.\n\nNote where no change is suggested the original specification will be followed.\n\nEXCAVATION. Page 9\n\nExcavate to a depth of 24\" below grade level for the basement, and below this level dig trench for footings 10\" wide and 6\" deep, construct footing course of concrete as specified, on the said footings construct foundation walls 6\" thick and 30\" high, of concrete as before specified, all piers shall have similar footing courses extending 2\" on all sides of finished pier. In case of the fireplace footings shall extend 6\" on all sides and be of 8\" in depth.\n\nBasement Walls\n\nOn foundation walls, including the cross partition wall, lay sill of 2\"x4\" properly bedded in cement mortar and fastened to foundation wall in the usual manner, on which erect 2\"x 4\" studding at 2' centers with doubled 2\"x 4\" plate on which will rest the floor joists, all corners to be diagonally braced with 2\"x 4\" cut in between studding and securely nailed, on outside of basement walls, lay 1 x 8\" shiplap securely nailed to each studd with two 2\u00bd\" nails, cover with one thickness of tar paper with joints well lapped, cover outside to ground floor with No 2 xxx shingles laid 5\" to the weather.\n\nThe cross basement wall to have shiplap similarly nailed on the excavated side.\nMATERIALS Page 11\n\nsubstitute Fir for the spruce specified.\n\nSheeting Page 12\n\nEliminate the inside sheathing, lathing direct on studding.\n\nROOF Page 12\n\nIn place of shiplap, except where it will show at the projection, substitute 1 x 6\" roof boards spaced 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" apart. This is preferable to close boarding where as thin a shingle as xxx is used, as it gives them a better chance to dry out. Dispose of rain water by placing rock pit at each down pipe, said rock pit to extend 12\" below basement floor, or by tile drain discharging on road.\n\nStorm Windows. Page 14\n\nStorm windows not necessary, not used on the coast, screen windows and doors can be dispensed with, few flies or mosquitos, and the sand flies pass through screens.\n\nDOORS Page 14\n\nShould be 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" jambs.\n\nHook Rails Page 15\n\nAs there are no closets, provide and fix where directed 20 feet of 6\" hook rail and hooks.\n\nHardware Page 15\n\nInside Doors may be hung with 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" butts as specified, Outside Doors 4 x 4\"\n\nLATHS Page 16\n\nSubstitute fir for spruce as specified.\n\nFURNACE Page 18\n\nThe Chaplain seems partial to the Pipeless Furnace; personally I have not seen them in operation, but no doubt Mr Orr is conversant with them, if they are satisfactory it would save $100.00 on this item alone.\nGUARANTEE Page 19\n\nThis guarantee not necessary as it could not be demonstrated on account of the mild climate.\n\nLOCAL VENTING Page 21\n\nI think this will not be necessary where only one or at visiting time, at most three persons will be occupying the building.\n\nWater Service Page 21\n\nWith the pressure we have here \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\" or even \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\" supply pipe would be sufficient for all purposes.\n\nDoor Bell Page 23\n\nAn ordinary rotary door bell or an electric bell operated by a dry cell would meet all requirements, as there is no kitchen, and would do away with the necessity of a transformer.\n\nWith the before mentioned changes this building could be completed for $2500.00 possibly a little less.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, November 2nd., 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn March last cheque No. 4011 for $153.50 was sent to you covering the following items, namely $2.00 for stationery and $1.50 for postage stamps, and the balance $150.00 being your February salary for thirty days instead of twenty-eight days at the rate of $6.00 a day, making an overpayment of $12.00.

I am enclosing herewith Contract Forms in duplicate and would ask you to have same executed and returned to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the inspection of this work, I would ask you to see that the building is erected in accordance with the plans and specifications, also to issue the necessary Progress Certificates to the Contractors. The Department will pay you at the rate of one day per week for this work, that is: $6.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D.

C.\nMr. Perry,\nIndian Agent,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to our conversation on Sunday last regarding the trouble in connection with the sewerage system of the new school here, would say I have carefully examined same, and find the trouble is due entirely to the filter basin being unable to absorb the great amount of water entering it, first through septic tank, second the storm water from roof and areas of building, and third from seepage, as filter is placed on lowest point of school grounds a good portion of the heavy rains, of the last three weeks, falling in proximity to it eventually find their way into said filter basin.\n\nThe filter basin, in my opinion, is very small to care for the amount of sewage water entering it through the septic tank and was made four feet deeper than the plan called for as by boring we found a strata of coarse gravel at this depth, this under test carried off or absorbed 14000 gallons of water in twenty four hours, but this was in the dry season, now when the ground is saturated water appears to flow into it as fast as absorbed.\n\nEffect on Septic Tank.\n\nAs filter basin, for the time being, does not absorb the water discharging into it, but rises to the level of the surface of the ground, water backs up discharge pipe into the septic tank raising the water in it to same level and interfering with the functioning of same, in fact converting it into a cess pit, so when sewers are flushed in the school almost crude sewage is forced into filter basin, and at times rising to surface of ground causing odors and consequently endangering health; there is also a further danger from water backing into discharge end of main sewer from the school, causing same to block or choke putting the whole system out of commission, and causing expense. I have taken it on myself to have an open ditch dug to lower water in the filter, and through it in the septic tank, in order to prevent the above referred to block, this is an emergency measure and cannot long remain.\n\nThere are two ways to remedy this condition permanently, first by constructing a pipe drain from discharge of septic tank to salt water below low tide mark, this would be expensive, the distance is about 800 feet, and would require a deep cut near sea front.\n\nThe second remedy would be to construct a filter basin 20' in diameter by 12 or 14' deep at a point about 75' south of present site, this would bring it over a raise of ground to a lower level and near the brow of the hill; storm water could be diverted by pipe to discharge directly over brow of hill, relieving filter of this. Rough estimate of cost First Scheme $1000.00, second $300.00\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Arthur R. Tibb,\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a report received by me from Mr. Arthur R. Tibb, who was the Inspector of Construction of the Indian Boarding School at Sechelt, which was completed last year. During a recent visit to this institution, Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Schools, and myself found that the septic tank at this school was not working satisfactorily, in fact its condition was a menace to the health of those in residence at the school. I met Mr. Tibb and requested him to thoroughly examine the system and report to me at his earliest convenience. This, Mr. Tibb has done and I would ask that the Department give immediate attention to this report, as conditions at Sechelt will not likely improve as the warmer weather comes on.\n\nThe Department's Officials at Ottawa, who give special attention to these matters will be in a better position than myself to make a recommendation as to the proposals outlined in Mr. Tibb's report.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in this matter,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

January 20, 1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe Sechelt Indian Boarding School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEarly in the present month the filter basin in connection with the drainage system of the new school showed signs of not being able to care for all the water entering it, the condition was accentuated by excessive rains, so when Mr. Perry, the Indian Agent from Vancouver, was here on the 7th, inst., he asked me to investigate it and report to him, this I did on the 10th, instant and since that time I have heard nothing in this regard.\n\nOn the 9th, the water had risen above the outlet end of the main sewer from the school, and as there was serious danger of same becoming clogged I had a ditch dug about 2' deep from filter to the brow of hill, this lowered the water in septic tank and removed the danger of blocking the sewer, but it is imperative that something be done at once. The ditch is carrying off between five and six thousand gallons of foul water per day.\n\nI herewith enclose a copy of report sent to Mr. Perry.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. MCLEAN,\n\nIt has been reported that the filter bed used in connection with the septic tank at the Sechelt Indian Boarding School is not large enough to properly absorb the discharge from the tank. This is caused by the excessive amount of rain water and also by the low-lying nature of the ground.\n\nIn order to remedy this condition, it will be necessary to construct a filter basin 20' in diameter by 12 or 14' deep at a point about 75' south of present site; this would bring it over a rise of ground to a lower level and the storm water could be diverted by pipe to discharge directly over the brow of the hill, relieving the filter of this amount.\n\nThe approximate cost of carrying out these very necessary extensions would be approximately $300.00 and I beg to recommend that Mr. Tebb who is acting as Inspector of Construction on this work be authorized to have this filter basin constructed at once.\n\nUnless the existing conditions are remedied before spring, the present situation will be a great menace to the health of all those residing at the school.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, January 30, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th inst., with reference to the filter basin in the drainage system of the new Sechelt Indian Boarding School, I beg to advise you that you are authorized to construct a filter basin 20' in diameter by 12 or 14' deep, as outlined in your report of January 16th. Arrangements should also be made in the alterations to the system so that storm water will not come through the septic tank. It is noted that the cost will not exceed $300.00.\n\nIf materials are required, competitive prices should be obtained, and a memorandum attached, when submitting the accounts, showing the names of the firms asked to quote and prices quoted.\n\nIn the employment of labour, time sheets should be kept and forwarded to the Department, along with the necessary vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(J.

The soil is nothing but sand though produces excellent crops if watered. To get results a number of stand-pipes have been laid and garden hose with sprinklers attached are used to afford a system of overhead irrigation. I found a number of these taps leaking, the valves being worn out and I therefore wired to Victoria for one dozen half-inch hose bibs to replace those out of commission. These will be found included in the account for the general hardware supplied to the school. In order that the water might be conserved as much as possible I directed that some of the stand pipes should be cut out and the sprinkling done from more central points in each garden plot. There will then be less chance of the taps to get out of order. I also ordered that the watering of the gardens should be done either in the early morning or in the evening to do away with loss through evaporation. As you are aware, no doubt, the service to the school is through a one-and-a-half inch pipe from a tank installed on the hill above the school but I found that this tank had never filled since it was erected, thus showing that the flow of the pipe is being used to its capacity. Later in the season when water is not needed for the gardens the tank will, no doubt, fill up. However, it is intended to clear up more land to put under crop and the need for water will then be greater than it is at present. It may therefore be necessary in the near future to provide for a greater supply from the springs or other source by the installation of a larger pipe than the one at present, which is a three inch one to the point of diversion to the school.\n\nMr. Tebb informed me that two lengths of this three inch pipe was in a leaky condition and I would therefore recommend that he be empowered to obtain two new lengths and have these connected up. The force of water, however, may be increased by cutting off the supply from the Indian village to the Whitaker interests. This water the Whitaker people have been allowed to use through a private arrangement between the Indians and themselves. I understand the Whitaker people pay $500 to the Indians---this money to be used on the upkeep of the church on the reserve. The Whitaker interests include Sechelt Hotel, store and a number of summer cottages. If their supply were cut off entirely the water, no doubt, would back up from the Indian diversion into the three inch main and cause a stronger flow into the diversion for the school.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Whitaker on this matter and informed him that it might be necessary to terminate the arrangement he had with the Indians but he asked if possible, not to do anything this year as they anticipated having a joint water system for all interests of Sechelt undertaken next year. We will, however, be able to see how the present system works out during this season.\"\nnot they had ample water throughout the season and I am just in receipt of a reply stating that during the dry weather the water was somewhat short although they were very saving with it. She stated that the supply tank had never been filled and would only have an average of two or three feet of water in it in the mornings and in the evenings it would be quite empty. This all goes to show that it is absolutely important that the valve in the pipe-line at the boundary of the reserve and the Whitaker property should be kept permanently closed and Mr. Whitaker should be informed that it will be impossible for him to obtain any further supply from this reservoir and then if he is prepared to co-operate with a flume line from Wilson Creek the Department might consider the advisability of participating in such, for I believe that it would be a much more dependable system and better water.\n\nI am fully of the opinion that the shortage at the school was on account of the Whitaker interests being supplied. This Company has a number of summer cottages, a hotel and store, all situated at the extreme end of the pipe-line and naturally take the water which would otherwise back up from the valve and keep the reservoir filled.\n\nWHD/W.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, including an excerpt from a letter from Mr. H. Whitaker, General Manager of the Sechelt Seaside Resort Company, of Sechelt, B.C., relative to the water supply for the Sechelt Indian School and the Indian houses on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that apparently Mr. Whitaker's letter to you is the outcome of an interview I had with him when at Sechelt in July last at the time of opening the new school at that place when I pointed out to him that, in all likelihood, it might be necessary to terminate any arrangement he had with the Indians for using water from their supply. Attached hereto is a paragraph from my letter to you of 7th July last dealing with this question.\n\nThat portion of Mr. Whitaker's letter quoted in your communication would lead me to believe that he has taken up with the Department the question of putting in a larger system than we have at the present time, as he uses these words: \"Your engineers, I understand, advised drawing the supply from the adjoining creek, but either through shortness of funds or shortsightedness on the part of someone in your Department, no action was taken and what money was spent, was, in my opinion, thrown away.\" In this connection I may say that when Mr. Hydes Morley was Superintendent of Works at the Sechelt School he did look into the possibility of obtaining a greater supply of water from a creek known as Wilson Creek and he appeared to be of the opinion that it would be advisable for the Department to put such a system in operation and then sell the water to the Sechelt Seaside Resort Company, adjoining the reserve on the north, and the people at Belma Park, adjoining the reserve on the south. I pointed out, however, to Mr. Morley that the Department were not in a position to carry such an undertaking out in view of the fact that any license to use water obtained from the Provincial Government was appurtenant to lands, the title of which was held by the applicant, and the only way water could be obtained from Wilson Creek to supply the various interested parties would be for some kind of a joint undertaking to be put into effect, each person taking out a license for their requirements and participating in the construction of the flume. As such a flume would necessarily have to pass through the Indian reserve and apparently the water system then in use for the school and the village was ample for the time being I considered it was up to some of the other interested parties to make the first move.\n\nThat there is not sufficient water for the Indian school, the village and the Whitaker interests has been proved, as since the receipt of your letter I wrote to Rev. Sister Gabriel, the Principal of the School, to ascertain whether or not\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6459, file 887-5, part 3)\nnot they had ample water throughout the season and I am just in receipt of a reply stating that during the dry weather the water was somewhat short although they were very saving with it. She stated that the supply tank had never been filled and would only have an average of two or three feet of water in it in the mornings and in the evenings it would be quite empty. This all goes to show that it is absolutely important that the valve in the pipe-line at the boundary of the reserve and the Whitaker property should be kept permanently closed and Mr. Whitaker should be informed that it will be impossible for him to obtain any further supply from this system, and then if he is prepared to go ahead with a flume line from Wilson Creek the Department might consider the advisability of participating in such, for I believe that it would be a much more dependable system and better water.\n\nI am fully of the opinion that the shortage at the school was on account of the Whitaker interests being supplied.
