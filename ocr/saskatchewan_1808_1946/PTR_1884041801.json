MAVETY.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\n\nTHE EASTERN QUESTION.\n\nIt is very advisable in order to counteract the morbid tendency of our minds caused by the recent contemplation of our immediate concerns, that we should occasionally cast our eyes abroad over matters of more widespread interests. Although the policy of the Imperial Government in the Eastern Hemisphere cannot fail, when we remember how much depends thereon, to watch it with interest. It is a matter of no surprise what an atmosphere of ignorance, or at least inaccuracy, prevails concerning our relative position to Russia, among men who only judge by hearsay and are not fairly well educated and informed. We have all a general impression that our position in the East has been meretricious, when we hear that Persia is not now so by this time as it was in days of yore, owing Merv. Those who take any interest in the gradual advance of Russia through central Asia, descend to the conclusion that the vast Indian domain must feel indebted to Col. Barnaby for his ride to Khiva. It is this stealthily, but sure advance that has rendered the control of the Amur and the Suez Canal of such vital importance to English interests, and out of that have arisen troubles in the Soudan. The concentration of public attention upon our own northern provinces has caused the annexation of Merv to pass comparatively unnoticed, and yet it is very curious that it should happen at this juncture. That England has been active and persistent about each step of this advance, we all know, as also the assurance given some three years ago by Mr. Giers that Russia neither desired nor had any reason for the occupation of Merv. The ease with which Russia repudiates her most solemnly ratified agreements has come to be regarded as a matter of course, and probably the fact that the Turkish treaty might have invited this annexation, thrills her with a glow of conscious virtue in accordance with her officially expressed desire of every possible chance of entering India is through Afghanistan, and Herat is the key of India, for whosoever possesses it commands the direct roads to the passes by which commerce can enter by an invading army from the west. The precipitous character of the lofty range of Paropamissus renders the approach to Herat from the northern boundary of Afghanistan by an army and its necessary equipment almost an impossibility, unless at a point where nature has provided a passaging for the outlet of a river. That river, which has been provided for the Murghab River, upon which stands all that now represents the once great city of Merv, is what constitutes the chief reason for the present rush of such advantage to any power desirous of commanding Herat. That Russia is working patiently and always keeping her designs on British India steadily in view, has disclosed an easier route for the transportation of near future war orders from them to Herat and so to India, an entrance on the north of Afghanistan by the possession of Merv, seem of less importance than formerly, but yet it is not easy to see why Herat should make the command of either by one and the same power of less consequence to us. Doubtless owing to the difficulty of carrying the vast provisions necessary to an army as would be required to invest Afghanistan and seize Herat, through the desert from Khiva to Merv, the alternative and much easier route should be chosen. Such a movement would take more space than we can spare, but we may briefly mention that it starts from Michailovsk, a post recently established by the Russians on the Amu Daria. The 320 miles of railway necessary to connect that port with Astrakhan on the Persian frontier are being rapidly constructed. A glance at a map will show that Herat, now on Herat road, which Herat stands under the new name of the Tejend to Sarakhs, which the map places only some 250 miles from Astrakhan, will be within the Russian territory and will not long prove an obstacle to the occupation by a power like Russia, as soon once there the command over Herat is ours, and so to India. It is clear, therefore that it behoves us to soon command the road to India, as the friendship of the Amur. The Afghans, as we know to our cost, are not to be trusted, and we must be on our guard, as we know every lazy man owes his life to the regular police. Address: The Hon. Mr. WAGGONER, Rochester, N.Y.\n\nCASE OF GRAIL.\n\nThe question of the annexation of the Eastern Provinces towards Manitoba and the North West Territories has been so decided that there has been a natural if unwritten alliance between the Government, and any party who may be disposed to oppose it, is dangerous. It is therefore with mingled feelings of surprise and regret that we have witnessed the attempt of Manitoba to steal march on the west, or, as they phrase it, to extend their jurisdiction, heretofore at least exercised by prairie governments, to the extent of permitting the present Government to extend her boundaries so as to include that part of Hudson's Bay, which speaking, speaking of which, we have heard so much, is our own. A gentleman of leisure, etc., contribution to the \"Daily News,\" Toronto, entitled \"The Adventures of a widow.\" Another gentleman of leisure will write, among other subjects, papers, a short description of a tourist by him during his recent visit to Europe.

I thought he looked rather pale and thin. What's the matter with Mr. Peck? He looks as though he had eaten too much cold-water plant. I asked the grocer if Mr. Peck was ill. He said yes, and explained that Mr. Peck had been working late at night, and had not eaten breakfast. I thought it was strange that Mr. Peck should be so pale and thin.

SPROAT,\n\nPrince Albert District, N.W.T.\nHANGED AT LAST.\n\nThe prisoners pay the penalty of their crime. The criminals confess their guilt.\n\nRiviere, N.W.T., April 3.\u2014John and Grace Stoddard were hanged here this morning at 9 o'clock for the murder of an old man named McCarthy, committed on the 14th day of last month. The prisoners were accompanied to the scaffold by their spiritual advisers, Bishop H. W. Haggard, Col. Haggard, and others, including a guard of eight mounted policemen. The prisoners made a full confession of their guilt, and acknowledged the justice of their sentence. After the usual formalities had been observed, the prisoner was hanged, and the executioner, who was masked, by a patrician's leave, cut down and the condemned body fell some feet. Death was almost instantaneous.\n\nBEFORE THE FINAL SENTENCE.\n\nThe prisoner appeared to think that the authorities would not execute them, but on getting the coffin this decision was dispelled. They also made a request to telegraph back to their father asking for the bodies after the sentence of the law had been carried out. They urged upon the executioners great clemency. While they stood upon the drop, they repeatedly knelt down and held before them the prisoners. Their punishment even by the reformed and hard-pressed population is considered just, and will produce a most salutary effect.\n\nTHE WRITERS' CONFESS.\n\nThe substance of the written confession signed by the prisoners is as follows:\n\nOn the 14th of June the prisoners went to the house of Mr. McCaffrey on the morning next, about nine o'clock, finding the house locked inside into which they entered. They then left; but returned at six o'clock and found the door of the main entry house. They advanced to his living room, where they heard a noise behind the house, but desisted and went outside; and John struck him three times more and finished him. He then took the body and placed it in the house, and dragged the corpse to the bluff where it was subsequently discovered.\n\nMISSING.\n\nMissing\u2014so many are missing, The old as well as the young. The weak alike with the strong. Missing\u2014our loved ones wander, We never know how or where, And perhaps sightlessly As smoke fades into the air. Missing\u2014a man; it may be A citizen famed and well known, Who to the world is but a name As stones in the pool a stone. Missing\u2014our care and riches, So sadly are we at a loss. We know not the loved ones left us, But know not whether they went. Missing\u2014at day time or night time, And under the stars or the sun; They cannot tell us what they know, As water flows from the rock below.\n\n\"The Montana Frontier.\"\n\nA common cause medical work for ladies only.

The dearth of senators in the Senate chamber, owing to the failure of the government to fill the vacancies of Treaty, but directly evade the request of the petitioners, must refer to the fact that the latter, leaving the country in a perturbed state, the administration says he expected the Dean to go to the territory west and the Manitoba Indians, they say, are much loitering on the case in their introductions.\n\nAMERICAN.\n\nSt. Paul, April 6.\u2014The Chicago Milling Company has shipped wheat into St. Paul from a special consignment of twenty-one cars of grain grown in Montana, and three cars of potatoes.
