McMillan & Co.'s large flour mill, St. John's College, the school, the Roman Catholic and Protestant institutions of our town. During the afternoon he received a large number of calls and was entertained by the Hon. J. E. H. Shortt and his family. He also dined at the Island home by Major Shortt and the officers of H. R. F. His Honor also called here on the north side of Qu'Appelle with the object of inquiring into the matter of certain persons who were living there in connection with the war which took place in the east. He visited the farm of Mr. H. R. F. McMillan, where he met the Hon. Robert McMillan, who had been sent to the Indian Agent, Brisco, to investigate the matter. Mr. McMillan went down to Qu'Appelle to see the Indian Agent at that point.

a.m., 4 a.m., 3 a.m., 2 a.m., 1 a.m., 12 m., 11 p.m., 10 p.o\nLet us see how we can gather from these writings as to the nature of this organization that existed at the time. And first let us have the fact. All authority authority was in the beginning; given by our Lord himself to the elect apostles, and to no others. There is no sign whatever of any supremacy of any one over the others. \"The Apostles' administration of the church's gifts\u2014Moloney's Administrations of the Holy Spirit, p. 44. As we have already seen, the Lord gave them the power to ordain, and the power to teach and to hand and unto him (to be exercised by the members of the church). What for the deaconess of those powers the presbytery had been given them that the Holy Ghost had made them over into all truth; and our Lord himself, during the great forty days had given them the keys of the kingdom of the Kingdom of God. And then we find they acted as men who had received this power from their Lord.\n\nThey laid the foundation of the church on the day of Pentecost by baptizing the believers who came seeking who believed. It was in their doctrine and their fellowship that this infant church was most attentive. It was they who then took the field, possessed and sold them for the common fund, brought the proceeds that they had received, and placed them when Ananias and Sapphira acted deceitfully and kept back part of the price, they were struck with the discipline in a manner that should be a terrible warning to others. When necessary for the protection of an adulterer or other sinner, they excommunicated the disciples together to choose men that they might think most fit for the office, but when the seven were thus chosen it was the Apostle who \"when they had prayed, laid hands upon them.\" When others baptized converts, the Apostles came and laid their hands upon them, saying, \"Ye know the Holy Ghost? When Saul had been miraculously converted and yet the disciples did not believe him, he was so afraid that he might openly be pretending to be a disciple, Barnabas went out to meet him and brought him to the Apostles. But those who were to decide, and he was with them, coming in by the way, cast lots among them. He makes it seem to have received his commission as an Apostle directly from God. For the same reason, according to the 13th chapter of Acts would seem to have been more of a commission to that end than any other given to them than an ordination to the Apostleship. After this the Acts of the Apostles tell us nothing of the history of St. Paul. Shortly after this we read that as Paul and Barnabas went through Lystra, Iconium, Derbe, Antioch, and Thessalonica, they ordained their elders (presbyteros) by laying on of hands. This is not indeed a direct mention of bishops. We read of them in the eleventh chapter, where the disciples at Antioch sent word to Barnabas and Paul to come to them. They came and gathered the church together, and said, \"Ye know how that from the beginning, when God divided us by the lot, to take care of the Gentiles, and you to take care of the circumcision, so that the word of God came to you first; for as much as ye have been faithful in the Lord, now we send you also to them. For as much as we have heard that God has given them the grace of faith, as well as ours. Now therefore send us away, that we may go to the Gentiles, and you to the circumcision.\"\n\nTimothy and Titus, we learn that these were ordained to their offices by the laying on of hands. Timothy was ordained by Paul, whose oversight and superintendence they owed; that they had charge of portions of Christ's flock, that they should be set apart for special matters, and that with the Apostles they were maintained by the offerings of the church. Paul is one having authority over them, summoned the elders of the church at Ephesus to Miletus, and he thus exhorts them\u2014\"Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\" He reminds them how he had labored lest he be a burden to them, how he had not spared all things love them so as laboring ye ought to support the weak and so rendering the glory to God. He tells them how he knew it was his blessed duty to give to receive. Evidently there was a danger even then of worldly gain in their work. Very similar in the exhortation of Paul to the Ephesians, he says\u2014\"I have heard of thee of the faith which thou hast in me, which thy fathers delivered unto thee, if thou continue in the same manner of life and not be\u6539\u53d8\u3002\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of ONE DOLLAR, with the object of enforcing the payment of every papering out in paid, than if we took the chances of collecting accounts at a higher figure.

It promises to be a greater success than last year, as many more are preparing to appear in costume. A number of prizes are offered for competition.\n\n\u2014Mr. H. Gibbon, Superintendent of Government telegraph lines in the North-West, is in town. He has started his intention of opening his head-quarters from Battleford to Qu'Appelle, where he will erect a telegraph station. The cost is estimated in the town of about $10,000 of public money in the year.\n\n\u2014John Kapp, Superintendent of Government telegraph lines in the North-West, is in town.

The wheat crop last year, and that a number of teams will have to be hired here to assist in gathering the crops at Qu'Appelle by the fall harvest.\n\n\u2014On Tuesday last, B. Battery R.C.A., was paraded in front of the barracks for the purpose of hearing read out the sentence of the court martial on Gunner Murphy, who, it will be remembered was tried some time ago for having stolen ten or fifteen cents worth of the provisions at the Christmas day. The sentence was very severe, imposing a fine of $100. The prisoner left Qu'Appelle under escort by the train Tuesday morning.\n\n\u2014The Valette seems serious, but at our journal remark that Fort Qu'Appelle is a suburb of town. It is not so, for the late book of telegraphs says that this town is named Qu'Appelle Station and our suburb is called Fort Qu'Appelle. Everyone at the Regina office recognizes the fact that this place is registered as Qu'Appelle Station, northern suburb of Fort Qu'Appelle. Our contemporary also says it is only eighteen miles between the town and the fort. This makes no mind the more of a suburb of the town when the railway station is located there. The Valette seems to come to a business with the outside world. The Valette also says for the second time that the news is true, but taken from The Pioneer. It has appeared in other papers. The editor says that he was the fourth to hear it, not the second, as he had been on the other side but once, which shows the disavowal of the non-official papers in saying from the very beginning of the Pioneer's existence of God, without being overcome by its worldliness which she knows to be contrary to God; but rather sanctifying the church by the authority of God who founded it; or if the nation rejects her as his helper she can walk alone, knowing that he has given her power and authority independent of all human circumstances. It will be seen that the doctrine of one from whom I have already quoted (Canon Ashwell): \"The evidence of the gospel is so easy to be understood, the ideas that there is after all some supernatural, mysterious and wonderful thing in grace and goodness in the full and entire adherence to the Apostolic model. The Apostles handed down to us a complete system of doctrine from Christ and not on man. It was a church whose creed was delivered to them by the Lord, and which did not change or vary from the apostolic deposit. It was a church having sacred men filled with spiritual grace from God above, not men responsible for the deposit of truth from the church with which you join or I may join. It is impossible to realize what the church once was, or is now, without a ministry commissioned from on high with that awful sense of responsibility which the apostolic succession lays upon the souls of those who enter it. In a word it was a church built up on the foundation of the Rock, and not upon the sand of human opinion.\" And to it is given the proud and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and Christ, who loved the church and gave himself for it, may we not, should we ever forget it?\n\n\u2014Pleasant Forks.\n\n\u2014In the spring of 1889, two brothers, Thomas and Richard Paine, with their families left the county of Durham, England, for Eastern Canada. After spending three years in Hamilton, they came to this part of the North West, and eventually settled on January 18, 1890, near Pleasant Forks, about twenty miles from Fort Qu'Appelle. For three years they have used their energies to establish homes, and success has so far attended their efforts that they are now comfortable and prosperous. In these efforts, Mrs. T. Paine has taken a most important part. Early in the spring of 1890, Mr. Paine had been through halibutpoise to her husband, helping him to bear the burdens of life, and to endure the hardships of a pioneer life. Her untiring zeal, her unceasing kindness, and benevolent spirit, have been a constant comfort to them. Their house being close to the trail from the P. M. Church, Fort Qu'Appelle, they have not been obliged to send their children to any school, nor have they shared in the hardships of pioneer life. Mrs. Paine died on the 20th Jan. On Monday, the 25th, a numerous company of friends assembled at her home to pay their respects to the memory of the deceased, some of them having come a distance of fourteen miles. While the service was conducted in a very impressive manner by the Rev. C. S. Smith, who came from Fort Qu'Appelle to preach a sermon having special reference to this sad event. Much sympathy was expressed by all who were in any way acquainted with them.\n\nTHE CRADLE.\n\nAt Pleasant Forks on January 25th, the wife of Mr. H.
