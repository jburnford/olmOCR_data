It is the duty of each section to:\n\n- To have under its control and supervise the schools of the section, and make from time to time such regulations as may be deemed necessary for their government and discipline, and for the carrying out of the provisions of the Act.\n- To arrange for the proper examination of teachers, the recognition of certificates obtained elsewhere, and for the withdrawal of teachers who fail to come up to the standard required by law.\n- To select all the books, maps, and globes to be used in the schools under its jurisdiction, to approve or reject the work of school boards, provided however that in the case of books, maps, and globes religious and moral teaching is emphasized by the Board of Education.\n- Each section of the Board has an Executive officer or superintendent of schools, who acts also as secretary of the Board of Education, has the general supervision of the schools of his section, and also as a public visitor in the schools. In order to form school districts, a \"proposed ordinance\" requires a petition to the Lieutenant Governor in the manner provided. The petition must be published for two weeks in the local press, if opposed by five heads of families returning officers is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor and a vote taken in the district. The Lieutenant Governor may not receive any such report (a legally attested report of the returns of the vote) shall be proclaimed by proclamation direct the district or otherwise as may be the ordinance. If the wishes of the majority of the legally qualified voters of the polling division as expressed at the Poll. The expenses of taking the vote is defrayed out of the money granted to the holder of the Lieutenant Governor by those demanding the vote, the same required to such as the Lieutenant Governor may deem sufficient to cover the expense.\n\nIn Manitoba, in forming school districts where municipalities are unorganized, a petition of at least five rate payers of the district is sent to the Board of Education, such petition having been for two weeks posted at the office of the district. The districting Board may decide finality on question in dispute and objections brought forward. The Board of Education also decides all questions between the Councils of Municipalities in the formation of school districts within such municipalities. The formation and limits of districts are announced in the officials gazette.\n\nIn Ontario in unorganized districts on petition of five heads of families a district is formed by the Superintendent Magistrate or District Inspector of Schools.\n\nWith regard to trustees and other officers of the District School Boards the North-West proposed Ordinance, the Manitoba and the Ontario School Acts are very similar. Our new Ordinance, however, requires the trustees to act as inspectors of the schools, and to report to the same to the Lieut. Governor. This does not seem to be right, and when the Ordinance comes up again before the Council, we trust that a clause will be introduced providing for the appointment of at least two general superintendents of education for the Territory, one to take charge of the Roman Catholic and the other of the Protestant schools, with distinct inspection under them.\n\nIn regard to the provisions for the Board of Education Act is very complete, but in many respects they cannot be adapted to our present situation at this early stage of development. The Manitoba law though not so complete, gives us the greatest satisfaction.\n\nThe control of teachers and all arrangements concerning their duties, qualifications, the books to be used by them, examinations for promotion, etc., are left to the Board of Education. The teachers and schools are supervised by the superintendents, who report to the Lieutenant Governor on all the schools within their jurisdiction. In our province the Ordinance is a most justifiable indication of the profession of school teachers. There are a few specified duties for them to perform, but there is no provision for testing their qualifications, for making a profession, or guarding against incompetence or inefficiency, for so important a work. The whole success of the Ordinance, the character and efficiency of the schools, entirely depend upon the qualifications and character of the teachers. We call Mr. Oliver's attention to this defect in the Ordinance and trust that it will be remedied. With regard to aid to schools our proposed Ordinance provides a grant of assistance to schools having an average attendance of ten at least. According to the Manitoba Act, the Government grant is divided between the Roman Catholic and Protestant sections of the Board of Education, in proportion to the number of children between the ages of five and fifteen inclusive, residing in the various Protestant and Roman Catholic school divisions.\n\nIf the schools are in a satisfactory condition, the Board then makes to every school in its district an annual grant according to a scale of seven cents per pupil annually. The residue of the Provincial Government appropriation remaining is again divided among all the schools upon the basis of average attendance of pupils as shown in the reports of the superintendents from non-attending returned by the teachers.\n\nOur Ordinance proposes to refuse Government assistance to any teacher whose salary shall amount to less than $500 per annum, notwithstanding whether this is a wise course. The effect would simply be to deter men of first class ability from devoting themselves to teaching as a profession.\n\nWe shall return to this subject in another issue.\n\nROBERT THOMSON,\n\nSign & Ornamental Painter.\n\nDecorative Painting a Specialty.\n\nJUST RECEIVED AT THE MEDICAL HALL.\n\nVictoria Hypophosphites,\nVictoria Buchu and Uva Ursi,\nVictoria Carbolic Acid Soap,\nBurdock Blood Bitters,\nBurdock Pills,\nHagyard's Cough Balsam,\nHagyard's Yellow Oil,\nDirect from the Manufacturer.\n\nTERM CARD\n\nJ.

Men of shades of opinion in this city are anxious that wheat products of the North West have to reach a sea port by rail route of 2000 miles, against a route of only 1000 miles, and it is not at all unlikely, that the present agitation will lead to the construction of a rail route from Edmonton via Fort Macleod and Lethbridge, which will be not more than one third of what it is to an Atlantic port. With such a route, the North West territory would no longer be bound, and it would become the interests of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to have as many connecting links with the south as possible, not as outlets for our produce, but as inlet for the products of the North-western States which would find their way to market via the Hudson's Bay route. All other grievances which farmers now complain of, would then be found to rest very lightly upon the North West.\"\n\nHANLAN'S LITTLE JOKE.\n\nMr. Hanlan took advantage of the absence of Mr. Maclean to put our machine forward for a mill.\n\nA.

It is called the \"Poveshell Body Steam Heater.\" The apparatus is a small affair consisting of a copper boiler under which is placed a stove. The boiler is fitted in a nickel box, and balanced something like a compass, so that, no matter what position the stove may be in, the boiler and lamp will always remain in their proper vertical position. The entire apparatus is so small that it can be carried in a pocket. When the stove is lighted, the water in the boiler is heated and circled around rubber tubes which run around the body of the stove, and around the back and below the boiler. The circulation of the warm water keeps the body warm over a considerable distance. A safety valve and escape for a higher pressure of steam than the affair is designed to carry is provided. If the house the lady's maid can light the lamp, which, by the way, is gauged to show the pressure of five or ten hours, \"my lady\" walks outside in the presence of strangers and warranted to be kept warm during the promenade.\n\nThis would be a very convenient appliance for the North West this cool weather. Which of our merchants will enter into the manufacture? We are surprised there is not much danger of getting up too much steam of any kind in this country, so the safety valve is hardly necessary, although an explosion would be caused in the badly indicated.

The question of the route has been discussed extensively, and an important feature in the undertaking is whether the railway should be constructed on the east side of Lake Winnipeg, where the land through which the work would be done would be more adapted for rail road building, but also when opened up would be more suitable for agriculture.\n\nWe refer to the route via Wabigoon, Fort Frances, better known as the \"Pine Route,\" from a correspondent Mr. Nelson of Selkirk, who has visited the country with the surveyor and whose testimony is strong in favor of the western route.\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to some important factors which may be considered in the selection of the route. The easternmost part of Lake Winnipeg appears to be York Factory, Churchill or their vicinity. In the first place, the route via Wabigoon is the shortest. Supposing no natural obstacles existed, it is shorter than the route via Fort Frances by thirty miles, increased by transportation costs. Natural obstacles such as the east coast of Lake Winnipeg may be seen existing at Lake Winnipeg. The country is one mass of granite and basaltic rocks, often intersected by streams running in all directions, with muskeg in the intervening spaces. There is but little agricultural land along the eastern banks of the river, and this can only extend back a quarter or half a mile from the banks. The soil is poor, the land is not productive, and of poor quality, while giving a greater yield than eighteen inches of soil to the thousand feet of land. The route goes to the Thompson River, the Hayes River, and the St. Mary's River, and the Hayes River over all the rivers flows away from the line of railroad, so that the lands are not available for settlement, and cannot be utilized for distant markets at a reasonable cost. In fact the route is very similar to the old Portage Route, and the route for the east side of Lake Winnipeg is a railway route to the Hudson's Bay via York Factory. But the main objection to it is that it might be eighty miles shorter, assuming all other natural obstacles can be overcome without touching the route by curves and tunnels.\n\nThe west side of Lake Winnipeg is altogether different. In the first place, the country is good land, by far the largest portion of the country being good land similar to that in the Red River Valley, or Lake Manitoba. It is capable of supporting large agricultural settlements, and the soil is productive; there is good farming land throughout, although wet from want of drainage. It also contains huge tracts of timber, situated at a low level, and therefore stumps have very little rock formation. Besides that there is a river running through the whole country, two rivers to cross which are of any magnitude. All the rivers crossing the route, within the limits of land included in the contract would be in a position to feed the railway, and especially in this case the little Red River, the Hayes River, and the Thompson River.\n\nThe fact of tapping these two rivers above Winnipeg, in itself, an immense inducement for running the railway across Lake Winnipeg, and for utilizing them the whole Saskatchewan country and that of Lake Manitoba. The railway will allow connection by water with the rail road. Perhaps you are not aware that Lake Winnipeg is connected by a river which will permit a steamer drawing three feet of water to travel its length and up to Edmonton. I have said nothing of Lake Winnipeg, but it must be appreciated by anyone on looking at a map, that the effect of water would be useless, either as a feeder to the line or as a side line, and therefore the river would be useless for the construction. The latter fact would make the construction of the railway easier, and therefore the cost of navigation, and Norway House and Seine Falls at the foot of navigation, would be saved. The railway would be laid across a portion of the line quickly and cheaply, so that construction could proceed at a much faster rate than the river would allow.\n\nWhat then becomes of the northern route?\n\nIf the Hudson Bay route was only practicable, there was nothing of English origin ready to be used in the construction, and there are hundreds of miles of main line enterprise. It is perfectly astonishing the amount of money that has been spent by the people of the Old Country. Every Englishman who can get hold of a map of Canada, and who has heard of the work of the Hudson Bay navigators are being interested in all sides. It is felt in London that the possibility of the route is a great opportunity for our own people a great opportunity in which those English capitalists speak about this country, and the great things in store for us. All we want to do is to take advantage of it, and to take the most of our opportunities, we will come out all right.\n\nThe C.P.R.\n\nThe Work That Must Be Done in the West.\n\nMajor Rogers has submitted his official report concerning the work of the C.P.R., from the junction of the Canadian Pacific Railway with the Rockies to the second crossing of the Columbia.
