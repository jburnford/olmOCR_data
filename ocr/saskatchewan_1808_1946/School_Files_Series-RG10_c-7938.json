The Barn is 50' x 100' with a lean-to 30' x 100'. It contains grain & hay storage, threshing floors & silo.

Sirs\u2014\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the following telegram\u2014\n\n\"Boys play house destroyed by fire midnight of 21st writing full particulars origin of fire unknown.\"\n\nYour report should contain full particulars as to the property destroyed and its value.\n\nPolicy No. 9474796, issued by the Royal Insurance Company, through their agent at Stratford, Mr. G.G. German, in favour of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for $40,550.00 distributed on the buildings in connection with the Mt. Elgin Institute, contains an item of $100.00 on the boys' waiting, clothing and wash room, the one destroyed, and it would be well for you to report the loss to Mr. German at once, so that steps may be taken to have the claim adjusted.\n\nYou should have full particulars in your office showing the amount expended on this building in the way of repairs and improvements.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

The building was vacated and light put out at 7:30 and under supervision by officers at nine and ten. The fire breaking out at 11:20 p.m. The fire originated in the pantry, store, north end, which being used as a store for flax, straw, etc., kept under lock and was not known to have been entered since Monday morning last when the boys' Sunday uniforms were put away. The great play when entered was found free from fire, as this room alone contained the only fuel in the premises, said pipe entering the chimney into the ceiling. It was done low so the fire could have originated from the premises.\n\nThe fire was then broadcasted at 9 p.m., a fire brigade was called. Officers and pupils promptly responded. A bucket brigade was formed under the command of Mr. Brown and proved so efficient as to extinguish the fire in the building in which it originated.\n\nThe fire was checked and put down, no losses and no damage. The fire was very large and active, fortunately the fire was small and the fire brigade was able to get the fire under control before it spread to other buildings.

There is some $1500 of an unexpended balance of the current year's appropriation for this school, and the Department would like you to state, after a thorough examination of the premises, what are the most necessary requirements of this institution.\n\nThe Principal suggests that the boys' play-house be rebuilt and that the approximate cost would be about $2000.00. If the full amount of insurance is recovered, this would leave about $800 to be deducted from the appropriation.\n\nYou will be good enough to furnish a detailed estimate of the cost of rebuilding the play-room according to the Principal's suggestion and state what other repairs or improvements should be made at once out of the unexpended balance, and what expenditure it would require to be provided for to put this institution in an up-to-date condition. In your report you should enumerate the different buildings that need repairs.\n\nJ. G. Ramsden, M.A.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institute. Communication has been had with Rev. Mr. George, the Principal, and he informed me he has been expecting a cheque for that amount from the Department for repairs and improvements, the vouchers for which had been forwarded to the Department sometime before the burning of the Recreation Hall.

Main or administration building, painting etc $300.00, Roof for pigery $200.00, Concrete in blocks and lumber in barn $300.00. This would leave an unexpended balance of $500.00 which he purposes expending on the larger barn making it correspond with the 45 X 80 barn to complete this work it will take approximately $500.00 more. The $1700.00 above referred to also includes the estimate for roofing, heifer and corn barn. With reference to other improvements that are required, will say that a play house 30 X 50 feet, built in T shape brick and properly equipped will cost $2500.00 against this or to this account is $1200.00 to be derived from insurance on old building. There should be a plan submitted for this and probably it might as well be built by tender as there are a lot of necessary works to keep the Superintendent's staff busy for two years.\n\nAn addition to the kitchen at a cost of $500.00.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJuly 26th., 1908,\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to report as follows on the needed improvements required at Mt. Elgin Institute as a result of my inspection last week.\n\nBoys' Play House. This building was burnt down last fall and the insurance upon it $2500 was paid to the Department. Mr. George says, since then the boys have no place to go in wet weather except to the Laundry which is of course quite unsuitable. With $700, in addition to the insurance money I think a very suitable building could be erected and it is very much needed.\n\nBig Barn. This building is very large and well adapted for storing hay and grain and stabling cattle below, but it has evidently been built a great many years ago, judging by the appearance and style of timber used in it. Many of the upright timbers are filled with dry rot, and worm eaten, the roof rafters are not properly braced, and the roof itself leaks along the ridge boards. The main joists in many places are sprung, and if a\n\nThe Secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\n\nOttawa-\na heavy wind should strike it at a certain angle it is very doubtful if it would stand firm. In spite of no appropriation being made Mr. George was working at it when I was there. New timbers have replaced some of the most dangerous old ones, a new floor on part has been laid, a new silo 14 X 40 is to be put in and the roof covered with metallic shingles. He proposes to build stalls in the basement, with cement floors. To do this work he estimates that the material alone will cost $1000, and if he can get a grant for this amount he will be well pleased. I think the expenditure would be quite justified, and that the improvements are necessary.\n\nWoodshed & Slaughter House. This is a portion of what I understood Mr. George to call the Implement Sheds. A grant was recently made to cover this with metallic shingles but more expense was incurred than the grant covered, as they shingled the remaining portion of the building, but Mr. George says it has all been paid for. The slaughter house has not been fitted up, but he wants to do this as in the cold weather they butcher all their own meat and have not a suitable place to do it in. For putting up the slaughter house he wants $300 and for painting and repairing the building he wants $500. The immediate necessity for this did not strike me very forcibly, but the extra work has been done to the roof and the value is there, so if he were allowed $500 for the work I think it would be advisable.\nKitchen. The kitchen for the officers and family is far too small, and badly situated for fresh air in the summer time. Both windows and the door face a wall not 20 feet away, which prevents a free circulation of air; the kitchen corresponding to the centre part of a capital E. Then there is not pantry room. It is proposed to add to this kitchen an addition of about 14 X 20, and up to the main roof, only three walls being required. This would provide a meat room in the basement, a large airy kitchen with two good pantries on next floor, an additional room upstairs and on the third flat accommodation for water tanks. This I consider is a great necessity. The fire protection is not adequate. There are only two water tanks now holding about 2800 gallons in all, which in the event of a fire would quickly be emptied. When I was there they were not full, though the water could be heard flowing in from the pump. I think the main is strong enough to keep any number of tanks filled, and the source of supply as a result of Mr. George's tile drains for collecting the water from the springs on the hill side, seems unlimited. He told me he was afraid to place any more tanks in the attic on account of the weight.\n\nIf however this kitchen were built, it would be an ideal place to place extra water tanks, $900 is Mr. George's estimate which I think under the mark.\nImplement Sheds. These are at present open and the contents exposed to the weather. It is desired to have them moved further away from the main building, past the orchard, and repaired. $800 would be required for this work.\n\nWork Shop. For the purpose of giving the boys more instruction in manual work, better shop facilities are required. The present building would require removal, it being Mr. George's intention to isolate all his buildings as much as possible to avoid danger from fire. A work shop is also required for ordinary everyday repairs, and improvements. He generally has a carpenter employed all the year round. For improvements under this head $1000. would be required.\n\nCarriage House. $600 is asked for to place this building in shape. At present it is too small to permit driving in and unhitching inside.\n\nTo sum up the estimated cost of all the improvements required:\n\n| Item                  | Cost     |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Play House            | $5000.00 |\n| Big Barn              | 1000.00  |\n| Wood Shed & S. H.     | 200.00   |\n|                       | 500.00 (painting & repairing) |\n| Kitchen               | 900.00   |\n| Implement Sheds       | 800.00   |\n| Work Shop             | 1000.00  |\n| Carriage House        | 600.00   |\n|                       |          |\n| **Total**             | **$8700.00** |\n\nLess insurance\n\n$8700.00\nMr. George informed me that if he could choose his own time for doing this work, he could save a great deal in cost of labour, as there are some seasons when labour is cheap, and he can utilize much of his own help, but at other times it would cost a great deal. He suggests that the Department give a general approval of his improvements, and he would lay out his plans accordingly. He further suggests that the work be extended over say three years and payment made accordingly. For instance this year he would build and pay for:\n\n- **Play House** $700.00 and insurance\n- **Big Barn** $1000.00\n- **Woodshed** $500.00 painting and repairing\n\nTotal: $2200.00\n\n- **1908 Kitchen** $300.00\n- **Implement Shed** $200.00\n- **Slaughter house** $200.00\n\nTotal: $1900.00\n\n- **1910 Work Shop** $1000.00\n- **Carriage house** $600.00\n\nTotal: $1600.00\n\nIn regard to the Barn and Play house I think these should be attended to at once, the former because it has to be ready for the crops and the latter for the boys in wet as well as in cold weather.\n\nThe buildings belonging to the Department should be maintained and kept in good repair, and I must say I was surprised at the general appearance.\nof old age which attached to nearly all the outbuildings.\n\nSome 300 to 400 head of cattle are wintered there and stable room should be ample, besides barn room for feed. The cow stables already completed are models of cleanliness and convenience and if those to be built are equal to them, nothing more can be desired in that respect.\n\nFor the reasons above mentioned I beg to recommend that the improvements stated receive your approval and that the necessary funds be provided.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The crops are now ready for harvest and the season is favourable for gathering. However, the harvest has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nIn order to make it possible to harvest the remaining crops, I respectfully request your assistance in providing the necessary equipment and supplies.\n\nI am confident that with your support, we can overcome these difficulties and ensure a successful harvest.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe you had better complete the materials first expecting to receive work regarding the same. If it is not your intention to go through with this work this year kindly advise me at once so I cannot afford to complete the work as necessary, and urgent written assurance of repayment for the cost of the materials used.\n\nI am sure you & I have always been anxious to give you notice of any improvements done under my management, but unless I can do this work during the spring and summer season, or if I expect between May and August, I will require to add from twenty to twenty-five per cent to the value of the work, such as that which I have already done, to keep pace with the demand.\n\nKindly let me hear from you at the earliest possible convenience and be assured that I am willing to assist in every way possible to complete the work as soon as possible.\n\nI am the Yours, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 37, 2000.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., calling attention to the urgency of the repairs needed to the Mt. Elgin Institute, and in reply I beg to say that the Rev. Mr. Morrison, Superintendent of Mohawk Indian schools, when in Ottawa about ten days ago, said he would write you for a rough sketch of the proposed new Play-house, showing the style of building required and the probable cost, including the heating system.\n\nUpon receipt of this information you will receive definite instructions. You may send in accounts for the money expended by you in repairing the barn up to the present and you should state the probable cost of completing that work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt by last mail of a letter from Mr. S. Hunter informing me of your decision regarding the sale of the Indians' property for the fiscal year. Playhouse $1000\nBig Bear $1000\nSled $200\nPainting $50\n\nIn further add, you are asked $300 more and also amount of insurance to be received from the building board, and asked me to give you the exact amount. You have always been looked after by the Department and did not pass through my hands. My memory is hazy, but I believe the valuation was some $224 which I suppose was covered by insurance. I called up Mr. J. G. German, I think he was a member of the Royal Commission, and he informed me that the amount of insurance paid by that company was $300; further than this I had no other source of information.\n\nMr. Hunter asked me to forward plans and specifications of Playhouse as soon as I had them. I have no plans prepared. I started the preparation of such some months ago but my health was not good and could not complete them. If the amount is $300 plus the insurance paid, and that insurance is taken I will have net $270 for Playhouse which I can use as a small sum amount to meet the necessities of the case.\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The weather has been favorable and I have been able to make progress. I am confident that I will be able to finish the work by next spring.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the plans and specifications for your review. If you agree with them, I will proceed with the construction immediately. If not, please let me know so that we can make any necessary adjustments.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 2, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRe repairs and rebuilding at Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nThese matters have been before the Department for some time and when Mr. Supt. Smith of Brantford was instructed to go to Huncey some time ago he was directed to make a personal examination of the premises and state what was absolutely required and the probable cost.\n\nMr. Smith's report is on No. 1 of this file, herewith and you will see that he places the providing of the play-house first on his list of requisites. The former play-house was destroyed by fire and since then the boys have no place to for recreation in wet weather. The old building contained lavatories and lockers for clothing and they cannot get on without it during the winter months.\n\nRepairs to the big barn are placed next in importance and as Mr. George had to make use of it he has gone on with the work there. The wood-shed and slaughter-house need to be attended to this fall. The other improvements in the order mentioned can stand.\n\nThe cost of the immediate requirements was placed at $4,700.00, to meet which there is available the insurance money for the play-house and the balance would be taken\nfrom this year's appropriation. Mr. Smith's estimate for the total cost of improvements needed to make the school a first-class institution is $8,000.00.\n\nMr. Ferrier when here not long ago said that this could be extended over three years and all that would be required immediately would be to provide for the three most important items above mentioned.\n\nA letter has just been received from the Principal, who was asked by Mr. Ferrier to furnish a sketch and specifications of the new play-house, in which he proposes to utilize the old shop and reconstruct it as a play-house and gives it as his opinion that the work could be done for about $3500.00 and that it would furnish better quarters when completed than a new building at the same cost. He gives the particulars of what he proposes to do with the building in the letter above referred to, which is turned out herewith.\n\nIf plans and specifications have to be prepared for a new building and tenders called for, it will be too late to do anything this season. Mr. George is thoroughly competent to carry on the work suggested by him and I would recommend that he be authorized to proceed at once, as Mr. Smith, Inspector Ramsden, Mr. Ferrier and the Principal are all unanimous in their opinion as to the necessity for the play-house. I know of my own knowledge that the school cannot be successfully carried on without this building, as there is no other place to use for the purpose available at present.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 2)\nOttawa, Sept. 9th., 1908.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nAfter reading Mr. George's letter of the 26th of August I think we might allow him to transform the Implement Shed into a Playhouse. There is no special appropriation for this work at the Mt. Elgin School but I think we could spare $3500.00 from the general appropriation, which, supplemented by the amount received from the Insurance, namely, $1249.87, will give us $3749.85 for expenditure during this fiscal year which should suffice to provide a Playhouse and the repairs to the big barn. Whatever else is done will have to be temporarily supplied by the Church authorities.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, September 11, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to the question of rebuilding and repairs at the Mt. Elgin Institute I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion to utilize the old shop and have it removed and reconstructed as a play-house and you may at once proceed to carry out the work as outlined in your letter of the 36th ult. The cost should not, however, exceed your estimate and should include the installation of the heating plant and lavatory and bathing facilities for the boys.\n\nYou should report from time to time on the progress of the work and forward accounts for material and labour as the work of reconstruction proceeds.\n\nThe Department can only advance $2,500.00 in addition to the amount of insurance on the old play-house, namely, $1,349.63 for this season's repairs and improvements, including the work already done on the barn and the rebuilding of the play-house. If any further work is done this year, its cost will have to be temporarily borne by the Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. T. George,\nPrincipal,\nMt.

In your letter, you mentioned that the painting was not yet finished, but I have since learned from Mr. Smith that he has completed the work and that all the materials have been delivered and secured abroad. The other paintings I would like to see when they are finished attached to the walls of the museum will only be displayed after having paid for them.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the invoice for the materials purchased.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 23, 1908.\n\nMr. Benson:\n\nI have examined the sketch plan of Recreation building for the Munsey Institute as requested by you.\n\nThe plans appear to be suitable for the purpose, but are not complete, and there is no specification describing the work or material as used except in a general way. This makes it difficult to find the cost of doing the work.\n\nIt will be necessary to make alterations in the finished plans giving additional strength to ground floor, providing the work is done as suggested by the Principal.\n\nThe entrance to basement is also objectionable in my opinion.\n\nThe cost if built as outlined by the letter from Principal George will be about $4500 to $5000, and if built with steel beams under first floor and made semi-fireproof will cost considerably more.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, October 12, 1906.\n\nTo Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nAfter considerable correspondence had with Mr. George, Principal of the Mt. Elgin Institute, regarding the rebuilding of the play-house destroyed by fire, he submitted a proposition, in which he suggested that the old shop could be remodelled, if removed, and furnish better quarters than a new building at the same cost. His suggestion was approved of and he was instructed to go on with the work.\n\nAfter that he changed his mind and recommended the erection of an entirely new building and submitted a sketch plan, which our Architect states would cost about $4500 to $5000, and if built with steel beams to make it semi-fireproof would cost considerably more. As this estimate is double the amount available, nothing can be done till the question of providing funds is settled. If the Department decides to put up a new building, the Methodist Church most likely would finance it on condition of repayment.\n\nAs Mr. George is so changeable in his ideas, I think that the Department should send Mr. Ogilvie there to see what is best to be done. There is no doubt that a new recreation building is needed and it should be an up-to-date one to round off the school premises, which should be a credit to the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We purchased all materials as economical as possible and each one has been paid by C.M. in full monthly or weekly. You will notice a number of projects have been completed. We have also purchased a new poultry house which has been completed.

The Department will not consider payment of the account submitted until satisfactory explanations are furnished for the large expenditure which has been incurred.

As you paid the account, you should attach each receipted account to a voucher form. If each account is not rendered in duplicate, you should make a copy so the Department requires all accounts to be in duplicate. All accounts should be certified by you. In view of the fact that you settled the said accounts and, therefore desire payment to be made in your own favor, it is necessary that the merchants' accounts be received before submission to the Auditor General.\n\nI may remark in a general way that it is not necessary for you to pay accounts for expenditure which has been authorized. If accounts are made out in detail and in duplicate and attached to voucher forms and certified by you, payment will be made without delay after receipt at the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

It must not be forgotten that these institutions are conducted for the instruction of the girls in domestic employments. The laundry work of such a large institution would no doubt be arduous for the younger girls, but when they arrive at a certain age they should be taught how to properly cleanse wearing apparel and bedding.\n\nIt is trusted that you have not endeavored to negotiate with the contractor for the change which you recommend without further reference to headquarters. While no comment was made on your offer to pay the cost in excess of $450.00, if the steam laundry plant were allowed, it is not thought advisable to accept your offer.

They concluded that an outside fire escape would not be the case. They would provide a memo of visit for the purpose to leave the building at their own pleasure unless they were secured first-door lock. They also stated that their usefulness in a sudden emergency. The doors leading from the dormitories into the inner halls are closed from the Office side with a thumb latch. This can be opened almost instantly and...\nhope instructed the officers most emphatically that in case of fire their first duty is to open their doors and allow the people to escape through the passage that No is the proper mode of exit. The halls are large and there are four doors from these halls. Two each side of Building No own hallways are narrow, crowded and all the doors often jammed and are locked at night.\n\nAs you know all the buildings are lighted with coal oil lamps, and herein lies the real danger. The danger from burning in the lamps is also very great, even when the utmost care is exercised.\n\nNow may I suggest that instead of us all likely there a small alarm placed in our Laundry about what it would cost to provide fire escape would furnish a dynamo that could be run by this alarm plant.\nAnd as the main building is already wired, it would be possible at a reasonable cost to light the whole place by electricity. This would also allow the lack of fire to spread into inside a few lights around the yard in the winter time.\n\nIt would be of much better value in matters of discipline.\n\nHoping this may meet with your favour,\n\nConsideration\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We should furnish plans and specifications, if necessary in each case, with an estimate of cost, which would be laid before the Church authorities. So long as the changes proposed are reasonable and in accordance with the spirit of the schedules and the contract they must carry them out if they are to receive the increased grant. \"A plentiful supply of pure water\" includes lavatories and there is nothing essential omitted either from the schedules or the contract. The purpose in asking you to examine the buildings and report is to secure uniformity and to obtain information which will enable the Department to demand from the Churches what is required to bring the schools up to the standard.\n\nIf there is any other point upon which you are in doubt, I wish you would let me know before proceeding further.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Accountant.\nFile 16501-5A.\n\nOttawa, February 13, 1911.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nChief Accountant,\n\nIn my interview with you on the 10th instant respecting the re-classification of the Industrial and Boarding Schools it was proposed that you make a ruling with respect to the school buildings which now have established a system of outside closets, which, if properly located and in no way contaminating the water supply, would, providing the buildings were in every other way satisfactory, be considered sanitary and rank in the first class according to the strict interpretation of your schedule.\n\nThis matter was evidently overlooked in your memo. of the 11th instant and as it might prove contentious I wish to have your ruling before making the inspections.\n\nArchitect.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Ogilvie,\n\nSchools of the first class must be provided with a sanitary system of water closets.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Pedley:\n\nI visited the Mount Elgin School on the 15th and 16th ultimo with a view to deciding what recommendation I could make as regards the future financial arrangements for the administration of this school under the new Agreement.\n\nThe Capital expenditures at the Mount Elgin School have been contributed by the Indian Bands interested, the Department and the Methodist Church, the latter having spent over $18,000 in the last 9 or 10 years. If the property were considered to belong to the Church authorities, we could pay them $100 per capita per annum, and they would have to make the necessary improvements. But it is clearly impossible to take this view as the land on which the buildings are erected is a part of the Indian Reserve, and as both the Indians and the Department were largely interested in the erection of the building. I think, therefore, we should consider that the Government owns the property and make the necessary improvements. By this decision the Church will only be entitled to $80.00 per capita per annum.\n\nWe should assume the payment of the rental for farming property. In order that the dairy farm in connection with the school...\nmay be properly conducted, they require about 800 or 1000 acres and part of this has to be rented from individual Indians and others. I will have accurate information in a few days as to the actual amount of the rental paid.\n\nIn going over the buildings with Mr. Ferrier and Mr. McVeity, we decided that it would be better to rebuild the Boys' Building. This was destroyed by fire and we still hold the insurance which now amounts, with accumulated interest, to $1365.75. In this building will be situated the shower bath which could be used by both boys and girls on special days set apart for their use, and lavatories and closets for the boys as well as a large play-room. It is not necessary to have the lavatories for the boys in the Main Building because they do not wash in the morning until after their work is done before they go to breakfast.\n\nThe school-room accommodation in what is called the Annex will be sufficient, as the large room now used for a chapel in the Main Building can be used as a class-room from time to time if necessary.\n\nThe water closets in the dormitories should have cement floors under and surrounding them and there are some necessary improvements to be made in the girls' lavatories and water closets in the basement (as detailed by Mr. Ogilvie in his report) as the accommodation is by no means sufficient.\n\nThe Laundry Building also requires to have some\n3.\n\nsome changes.\n\nAll the buildings should be heated by a central steam plant as the present furnaces do not heat the buildings properly in cold and windy weather. There is ample accommodation in the building for 120 or more pupils and if the upper dormitory is used the number to be provided for should be placed at that figure. There are 60 on the waiting list for this school.\n\nFire escapes should be provided for the dormitories in the Main Building.\n\nWhen these improvements are made the school will be a credit to the country as the management is everything that could be desired.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nOttawa, 4th April, 1911.\nSir,\n\nI have to advise you that careful consideration has been given to the classification of the Mt. Elgin School under the proposed new Agreement. The school is situated on property, the title of which is not in the Church; and the capital expenditure on the buildings have been made jointly by the Indian Bands interested, the Government and the Methodist Church. Under these conditions it seems impossible to class the School as belonging to the Government and it has therefore been decided to place it in Class \"B\" with a per capita grant of $80.00 per annum. The Department will, therefore, take over all responsibility for necessary additions and improvements to the buildings. The changes contemplated are:- the erection of a separate building for the boys to replace that lately destroyed by fire, with such improvements as will meet the needs of the case; the conversion of the different heating systems in the building into one central plant for steam-heating the whole group of buildings; the water closets in the dormitories should have cement floors under and surrounding them and there are some necessary improvements to be made in the girls' lavatories and water closets in the basement as the accommodation is by no means sufficient. The laundry building will also required to be altered and improved. Five escapes will be provided from the dormitories in the main building. With slight alteration in the attic the building will easily accommodate about 150 pupils, and it is proposed to provide for the payment\n\nRev. P. E. E. Shore, M.A., B.D.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

All accounts have been settled monthly on a cash basis, goods have been purchased at a fair market value, and the cattle and products of the farm sold at fair market prices. The management of the milk cows is worthy of mention. The Institute has been kept in meat, butter and milk and the cream sold has averaged over $1 a month. The profits on the sale of the live stock have been good. Mr. Fritz has returned to the Mission Room; the $500 voted him by the Board for cattle in 1909 all accounts are paid up to date, and there is a balance of $137.50 in the bank.\n\nYEAR ENDING MARCH 1911.\n\n| Description | Amount |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Cash on hand, April 1, 1910 | $1,480.21 |\n| Missionary Society | 10,003.00 |\n| Sale of Cattle | $222.65 |\n| \" horses | $117.00 |\n| \" hogs | $140.53 |\n| \" from Farm and Garden | $265.06 |\n| \" Sundries | $131.36 |\n| Annuities | $60.47 |\n| Rent from Indians | $16.66 |\n| Salaries | $4,068.09 |\n| Clothing | $1,159.65 |\n| Food | $1,907.66 |\n| Fuel and Light | $55.84 |\n| Building and Repairs | $180.71 |\n| House Equipment | $751.96 |\n| Farm & Garden stock | $881.59 |\n| Transport freight, etc. | $23.26 |\n| Extra labor | $230.00 |\n| Miscellaneous | $99.90 |\n| Balance in Bank, March 1911 | $25,151.65 |\n\nTHE FUTURE MANAGEMENT OF THIS INSTITUTE.\n\nI paid a visit to Ottawa and discussed the basis of a new agreement with the Deputy Minister and the Superintendent of the Education Department. Two propositions were under consideration:\n\n1. The Church to make certain needed repairs to bring the school into Class \"A.\" This would involve an outlay of about $8,000, and keep the place in repair five years to year. This would involve about $1,000 a year, and the Government would give a grant of $100 per pupil for 100 pupils.\n\n2. The Government to make all needed repairs and in so doing provide accommodation for 125 pupils, and keep the entire plant in repair; also pay the rents, which have averaged $900 per year for the last seven years, and give the management $60 per pupil.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 2)\nup to the number of $25.\n\nIt was arranged by the Department that Mr. Scott should meet me at Muncey and decide on the proposition we would accept.\n\nThe second proposal was accepted and the contract will be made out by the Department. This, with good management, will place the Institution on a self-supporting basis.\n\nThe following are the needed repairs to place the school in Class \"A\":\n\n1. Fire Escapes - Pole,\n2. The closets in the four dormitories to be set in cement and enclosures made,\n3. A Boys Building - to provide class rooms, boys' recreation room - boys' wash room, bath-tube and shower baths, and lavatory,\n4. More bathing and washing accommodation for the girls,\n5.

The Department has no funds at present with which to undertake the work, but desires to have these plans and specifications in readiness in order that, should funds be available at a later date, the work can be authorized. You will understand that my intention is to convert the present hot water heating system in the main building into steam and also for heating the Annex.

The Department is desirous of installing shower baths and other bathing facilities which can be used by both the boys and girls in this building. You should also draw Mr. Hoth's attention to any alterations or improvements in the laundry building and the proposed alteration in the dormitory flats in order that he may prepare plans and specifications for attending contractors. The Department has received a communication from Chas. Robertson. It appears you expressed the opinion to him that the Department might have a heating plan worked out at Head-quarters, but the purpose of placing the work in the hands of Mr. Robertson is that he may present such a plan. You should also bring Mr. Robertson's attention to the installation of fire escapes at both ends of the building from the dormitories, of the kind that are used together with steel poles at the necessary height.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

If we took our plans prepared by someone else, he could carry through the building operations as long as he was engaged in sketching & ground floor plan, his work would be doing the drawing of the elevations & the dimensions by Mr. Ogilvie. As to plans dealing with Mr. Ogilvie's new aid anything we have to say to preparing plans under, he doubts the result following plans prepared for him.

Elgin Institute I have to inform you that it has been thought advisable not to proceed with the erection of the Boys' play-room this summer but to postpone that until next year.\n\nIt is thought to be a matter of great importance to remodel the heating apparatus before next winter. At present the main building and the annex are heated by separate hot water furnaces, but the one in the main building is inadequate and does not heat the building properly. What we propose to do is to change the hot water system into a low pressure steam system and heat the group of buildings from a central boiler station, including the proposed new building for the boys' play-room, which I have just mentioned, when it is erected. The cubic contents of this building would be about 63,000 cubic feet, and from this the Steam-Fitters can tell what the strength of the boilers should be. It is highly desirable, therefore, to have a proper heating plan, with an estimate of the cost, in order that the work may be undertaken at as early a date as possible - with a guarantee that it will be completed before it is necessary to use it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.

Mr. Robertson has had several times his figures run on the book, but seems to fail. Enclose over $5 per head yesterday, also Mrs. Ross, both agree with me that it would be better to ask you for an appropriation to send away $300 which it can be done much less.

The provisions of the Public Works Act apply to this case as the work \"can be more expeditiously and economically executed by the officers and servants of the Government,\" and the estimated cost of the work is $8000.00 which brings it below the limit of $8000.00 mentioned in the Act.\n\nAsst.

The amount expended should be within $8000.00 and it is hoped that you will be able to make the changes in a thoroughly satisfactory manner for this amount. You may, therefore, purchase two furnaces and have them connected with the present hot water system in the main building. You may also have an examination made of the heating apparatus in the Annex and if necessary replace the furnace there. By reference to Departmental letter of the 15th of April you will see that \"the water closets in the dormitories should have cement floors under and surrounding them and there are some necessary improvements to be made in the girls' lavatories and water closets in the basement as the accommodation is by no means sufficient.\" A decision has not been arrived at as to what the desired improvements are in the girls' lavatories and water closets in the basement basement, and this question should receive some consideration before anything is finally decided.\n\nYou are also authorized to purchase a Gasoline Engine to run the dynamos. The Gasoline Engine should be purchased from Mr. J. C. Waterworth, of Glencoe, (Box 16), who offers to supply an 8-Horse Power Engine sufficient to operate 100 lights for $400.00 and the old Engine.

Elgin East. We are very confident in guarding against the possibility of an accident. The greatest danger we have now arises from the fact that if necessary our electric lights shall burn about 9 o'clock and the common lamps are added into use. Also in the lower kitchen before the lights come on the place often turns dark. In the case of premises lamps how to be used remains dark during the night. This could all be overcome by installing a small simple battery such as Mr. Agarrie spoke of when visiting us. The cost would be little for anything more than five two-foot batteries so much better than lamps.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This was very necessary and enables them to keep their fuel dry as well as the preparation of it under cover during stormy weather.\n\nThe work done as enumerated above, so far as I could judge in its completed state, is satisfactory and the old chimney flues to which the boilers are connected, although contracted, are apparently giving satisfactory results.\n\nThe boilers installed are of sufficient capacity to heat the new wings which it is proposed to erect to enable the to successfully operate the school under the new contract.\n\nArchitect.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These boilers would be large enough to heat new addition. There is no round boiler or boilers large enough without putting in three that would heat the building.\n\nThe above square boilers are made by the American Radiator Co. of Brantford and handled by the following firms, Pease Fdy. Co., Dominion Rad. Co., Gurney Co., Gurney Tilden Co. and others.\n\nThe above work done in a first class manner for the sum of FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ($1415.00) DOLLARS.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNoble & Rich.\nWe hereby propose to remove the present heating boilers and install two #937 Gurney Hot Water Boilers, having a gross capacity of 3500 sq. ft. radiation each, in the Mt. Elgin Institute, and connect the same with all the present radiators by means of new mains and returns. Said mains and returns to be of the quality Canadian or American manufacture.\n\nAll fittings to be of best quality cast iron and to be free from all defects.\n\nProvide boilers with feed cocks for filling system and draw off cocks for emptying boilers.\n\nConnect the boilers to the chimney by means of heavy galvanized iron smoke pipe. Said smoke pipe to have necessary bends and elbows.\n\nThe boilers to be covered by means of asbestos plastered net less than 1\u00bd inches thick.\n\nAll mains to be properly supported by means of adjustable hangers.\n\nAll mains and returns to be coated a grey or other suitable color.\n\nAll work to be left in good shape and done in a workmanlike manner.\n\nAny pipe fittings & valves now in building are to be used and the balance to become your property, and the two present boilers to become our property.\n\nFor the sum of $1400.00\n\nAny to be paid as the work progresses. Balance when the job is completed.\nSome time ago I sent you\na letter for Mr. Simpson and\nMrs. Sterling Plummer\nof the Calgary Institute. Although\nI did not hear from them again,\nI have heard that they have\nreceived the money.

S. R. McVitty, and after going into the matter carefully with him we have come to the conclusion that the machines manufactured by the Toronto Laundry Machine Co., Ltd., will give the best satisfaction, quality, price, etc., considered.\n\nFor your information we are enclosing herein the necessary sheets from their catalogue, showing the washers manufactured by them illustrated on pages 32 & 33 together with extractor illustrated on page 46.\n\nYou will note that complete descriptions are enclosed and Mr. McVitty asked us to state that in his opinion the machines in question would give the proper satisfaction. We might add that he was anxious to have the Safety cover included on the extractor for several reasons.\n\nAgain, you will note that the washer has a Galvanized case with brass cylinder. A cheaper washer is made with wooden case, but for Sanitary reasons alone Mr. McVitty thought that the Galvanized washer would be very much better. Outside of this the requirements call for twelve tubes, and Mr. McVitty thinks that the cypress wood tube would be best for this purpose. They are not as high priced as Enamel or Cement tube, but his experience with cypress together with our own in the same woods, has taught that this wood is practically indestructable. We figure the total cost of the machinery at Toronto approximate $860.00. Added to this will be the freight to Hunney and the cost of installation. You will realise that it is impossible for us to give you a definite\nfigure on the installation, but wish to state that this will be done at the lowest possible price.\n\nMr. McVitty advises that a certain amount of shafting will be necessary also piping, etc.\n\nWe wish to state further that we guarantee the total cost of the work ready for use will not be over $750.00.\n\nWe might add that Mr. McVitty is very anxious to have the machinery installed at once, and if you will kindly give us the necessary instructions we shall be very pleased to go ahead and see that the same is installed without any delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHOMAS BROTHERS LIMITED.\n\nW. J. Thomas\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 2)\nToronto Metallic Washers\n\nMost laundrymen have learned by experience that the better the appliance the better the work, and with that truism established it is a recognized fact that the washroom, the foundation for good work, must have the best washing machines that can be constructed. The Brass Washer has been constructed to meet every requirement. A fault of the ordinary Washer is that excessive loads weaken its parts. The Brass Washer is impregnable and the solidity precludes the possibility of wear, thus giving superior durability.\n\nFrom the sanitary standpoint this Washer is an ideal invention. Cleanliness is a paramount requisite in the washroom. The wood washer is an absorber and accumulator of the unclean dregs of the washing process; it holds the scum that rises to the surface and creates a condition detrimental to producing good clean work. The Brass Washer prevents all such difficulties, is easily cleaned, stays clean longer and cannot retain dirt or impurity. We furnish these Machines in either galvanized case and iron ends with brass cylinder, or wooden case with brass cylinder, or brass case and brass cylinder. Our Sterilizer or Disinfecting Washers are finished in the same first-class manner.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF TORONTO METALLIC WASHERS\n\nThe OUTER CASE is constructed of two sheets of No. 10 gauge galvanized steel. These sheets are fabricated and rolled before being galvanized which insures them against the possibility of rusting by reason of the edges and openings being raw and which are not protected by the galvanizing. These sheets on all end movement machines are the full half circumference of the outer case, while on the Elevated Movement Machines the lower sheet extends from the front opening for two-thirds of the circumference. On all types of Toronto Metallic Washers these sheets are inserted into a slot cast in the iron heads. The two heads are drawn up tightly against the sheets by means of bronze tie bolts, \u00bd inch diameter.\n\nThese sheets are NOT RIVETTED as they used to be in the older type of machine and a special water tight slip joint is provided where the upper and lower sheets meet both at the front and rear of the machine. These joints are self locking and are not riveted or bolted. To remove the upper half of the outer shell requires the loosening of only a few bolts in the flanges where the upper and lower parts of the cast iron heads are joined together.\n\nA reference to the several half tone engravings will illustrate this system, and they also show combination head with the legs cast all in one piece. The bands upon the outer case are of galvanized iron and the sliding doors on all Metallic Washers are made of No. 14 hard sheet brass with bronze handles. These brass doors are the result of years of experience, and have proved a solution of the difficulty usually experienced with galvanized doors, which on account of their constant use commence to rust inside the slides as soon as the galvanizing wears off, with the result that the doors after a short time become very stiff in sliding backwards and forwards.\nToronto Metallic Washers\n\nCYLINDER. The cylinders of all Toronto Metallic Washers are constructed of No. 13 half hard sheet brass with the perforations doubly embossed. Each cylinder has seven formed sheet brass ribs through which are passed \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch truss bolts for securing the galvanized cast iron trunnions. The brass sheets on each end of the inner cylinder are 1-16 inch in thickness of hard sheet brass the full diameter of the cylinder. The galvanized cast iron trunnions have inwardly projecting flanges on the inside of which the brass sheets forming the cylinder are securely riveted. On all machines over 50 inches in length two doors are provided on both the inner cylinder and the outer case. The doors on the inner cylinder having hinges, catches, leeks, etc., all of solid brass.\n\nGEARS. The gears are all machine cut from solid castings and are protected with gear cases as shown in the several illustrations. These machines are all fitted with the Toronto lever handle, bottom discharge washer valves with full three inch opening. The water inlet is three inches and the steam inlet one-half inch. The Standard Machines are fitted with the discharge on the right hand end and the water and steam inlets and gauge glass upon the left hand end, but these may be reversed if we are so instructed when the machine is ordered.\n\nREVERSING MOVEMENT. The header is of our well-known type and is clearly shown in the several cuts. This is one of the most simple headers in use today and consists of about a dozen pieces, including the belt loops.\n\nJOURNALS. The main or cylinder journals are three inches diameter by eight inches long of phosphor bronze made to standard gauge and templet and may be renewed without removing the cylinder from its case.\n\nSterilizer Washers\n\nThe above specifications also cover our Sterilizer Washers, which are designed for disinfecting as well as washing the goods. These washers are provided with heavy doors and clamps for securely fastening the same, and are provided with an opening for a four inch diameter ventilating pipe, which should be connected with the chimney or carried outside of the laundry room to carry off the odors from the goods while cleaning them. The construction of this machine is such that the goods may be washed at a high temperature, thereby thoroughly disinfecting them.\nToronto Metallic Washers\n\n32 inches Diameter. Brass Cylinder.

As a matter of fact we are very much surprised that no accidents have happened owing to the state that the Machinery, etc., is in.\n\nNow, in addition to the machinery which was ordered to be installed, we find that a 500 gallon cypress water tank 3'4\" in diameter by 6'5\" high, ought to be installed, together with one only double acting power driven pump for pumping used water back to washers, should be installed.\n\nThese items are necessary because very often during the summer months the supply of water is very limited and owing\nTo the large quantity used in washing, the water must be saved to a certain extent, and the above will be necessary in order to do this.\n\nNow of course it is not necessary to act on our suggestion in this matter, but we feel that if you wish to fit up this Laundry so that it will be in shape for the next ten years you ought to do something of the nature suggested by us, as well as tear out a lot of old fittings, shaffing, etc., which it is positively dangerous to use at the present time.\n\nNow, we find that if you wish us to do all of this together with special tank and pump, that the total cost of the work will be $750.00. If of course you do not wish us to supply work and labor, together with new fittings, which really are badly needed, and which were not figured on in the original estimate, that of course we come within the limit of $750.00 set by you.\n\nNow, we think that in our humble estimation that the matter is urgently needed, and if you desire we shall be very glad to have you take up the matter with our Mr. McVitty, asking him his opinion on the matter.\n\nWe await your prompt reply in the matter, as we are prepared to go ahead at once with the contract.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWIT/B.\n\nTHOMAS BROTHERS LTD.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institute and paid by cheque No. 2037.\n\nI am\nSir\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 15, 1912.\n\nI have the honor to report that as instructed by your official letter of the 3rd instant I proceeded to Muncey for the purpose of inspecting the work on the additions to the Mount Elgin Institute and have to report that I went to the building from St. Thomas with the contractor, Mr. A. Poreford and after having the basement excavations levelled for the footings and the forms set, the contractors commenced laying the concrete footings of the girls' wing; the work on footings of boys' and girls' building being completed on Thursday last.\n\nThere is no material on the ground for the balance of the form work, I learned, however, after arriving in St. Thomas that the car would be received that day and the material immediately removed therefrom to the building site. The construction of the forms would be immediately proceeded with.\n\nThe material used for the concrete is river gravel (no broken stone being available), this is slow setting if sufficient care is taken in preparation of the good concrete. The mixer in use, however, is very efficient and the measure of the materials is by hand to avoid mistakes and in this way requires constant and careful oversight to ensure satisfactory work.\nand I would, therefore, recommend that an inspector be immediately employed in constant supervision, at least, until the concrete walls are completed and as Mr. McVitty is residing there and has had considerable building experience and will undertake the supervision at a per diem allowance of five dollars ($5.) covering all his expenses I would recommend that he be employed.\n\nWhile in St. Thomas I interviewed the several subcontractors with respect to materials, specified to be used in the building, particularly as several changes are requested owing to the difficulty of obtaining some of the materials there, it is proposed, however, to use even better materials than those specified and I informed them that the official consent of the Department would be given to them for these changes.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, 19th July, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department consents to the substituting of hard maple flooring as specified for the class-rooms, etc., in the addition of the Mount Elgin Institute in place of the pine flooring specified to be used in the upper floors; also that permission is given to use hard yellow pine posts in place of hardwood specified and that slate may be used for the covering of the roof in place of the Bestonlate specified, provided that this can be procured and put on in place, more advantageously. Consent is also given for changes in arrangement of radiation as discussed by Mr. Ingraham of Messrs. Ingraham & Davy, the sub-contractors for the heating and Mr. Oldmore by reducing the boiler one size and increasing the number of the valves on mains. It is understood and agreed that no extra cost is incurred in the changes suggested herein and that permission is granted only to accommodate the sub-contractors, the materials desired to be used by them being more available under existing conditions. Permission is also granted to use angle iron of equal bearing capacity to that specified for the building of fire escapes. If the sub-contractors desire to use this instead, without increasing cost, the fire escapes may also be erected with passage behind ladders as suggested by you to Mr. Galtie when in St. Thomas on the 14th instant. You should also note that walls of coal-room under porch in north wing are to be done as shown on plans instead of 85\u00b0 marked in figures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. A.

The suggested extension can be made by carrying out the angles of verandah at each side of main entrance, square instead of following the lines of the front of building.\n\nTo provide the additional space asked for, utilizing the material now in verandah and that specified for the extension, will probably cost $150. or if new and larger posts and piers are put in $300. If an entirely new and heavier verandah designed on modern lines and corresponding with the building in appearance, is built, the cost will be about $800. or $900. In either case the extra room provided will be about equal, the added space being about 162 sq. feet.\n\nI would recommend that the modern verandah be provided if funds are available and if insufficient for that purpose, that the first plan be adopted.\nThe Principal also asks to have the old six inch main drain carrying the sewage from the buildings to the river replaced with ten inch tile owing to constant obstruction through insufficient size in the smaller drain.\n\nThe estimated cost of 1,000 feet of ten inch tile delivered at Muncey station f.o.b. will be $300. The cartage from station and laying of tiles will probably be done by the school free of cost to the Department.\n\nI would recommend that the new drain be provided.\n\nArchitect.\nMt.

It has since been decided to provide for the addition of two floors.\n\nThis is no provision at present for sleeping accommodation, but the present system is fed from cold water tanks, and these are lower than the attic floor. The upper floors of the new wings will have access of egress in case of fire, so as to permit a change in the nature of the contents of the building without risk. In order to provide the attic window, the walls had to be built over the very wide course, allowing to the main building and footed to the ground.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The work is now complete and we have paid him $500. We are now requiring the extra work. The $500 will be covered by the extra work we are asking for.\n\nWe need to arrange for soft water tanks in the water house since there is no way to get water from the new wings, and from the back of the main building which is at present running into the creek. The soft water is very much needed for bathing and would also improve our water supply which is quite limited.

The amount of your account is \u00a3745.00 net \u00a3768.00.

McVitty, Principal\n\nMuncey, Ont. April 10th, 1913\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 3rd inst., permit me to say,\n\n1. The work was absolutely necessary. Practically nothing had been done to the Principal's apartments for years.\n\n2. My wife intended having a few friends visit her in the Spring, and wanted her house at least decent. She has, since coming here, served this school in almost every capacity, from matron to cook, as necessity demanded, and without a cent of remuneration.\n\n3. The carpenters were on the ground, they had the flooring left over and offered it at mill prices laid down here. Mr. Brown, who has done practically all the painting and decorating for years, was about to move to Detroit, we had barely time to get the work done before he left. It is almost impossible to get really good workmen to come out here when there is so great demand for them in the city.\n\n4. All this came upon me suddenly, and had I waited for permission of the Department, these men would have been gone and we could not have got the work done. I simply did what is often done, in fact what often has to be done, do the thing that is necessary and hope for the best in the matter of having it recognized.\n\nSince the new arrangement was entered into, we have spent hundreds of dollars on small necessary repairs which we\nhave not reported at all.\n\nWe know our action, in this case was irregular, therefore as a penalty upon ourselves, we offered to pay half the account. At the present time we are painting the barns and stables, the paint has cost us about $130.00, and we are paying good wages to our mechanic to superintend the work. It is a great job and the Department ought to feel proud of the plant here. Neither a Government or Church can afford to be identified with a broken down affair.\n\nGive us a good generous settlement of this matter, paint and all, and we will promise faithfully not to offend again.\n\nAsk Mr. Inspector Mc.Gibbon, who has been here recently, what he thinks of the work being done.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI return herewith the vouchers amounting respectively to $62.50 and $102.95 which you submitted in connection with work done at the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute. If you have paid the accounts the voucher should not be made out in your own name. If you make payment the account from each firm should be receipted. The Department prefers to have all accounts made out in favor of the parties who do the work or furnish supplies.\n\nIt is observed that you had the ironing tables made by Mr. Ponsford instead of having the work done by the carpenter at the school, as suggested in official letter of the 3rd April.\n\nIt is not altogether clear that the purchase of the steel tank and fittings was authorized in official letter of the 3rd April. You should state for what purpose these last mentioned articles were supplied by Mr. Gray. The voucher for the tank and fittings should give fuller information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your favour of the 16th inst., permit me to say:\n\n1. I am sorry for the mistake made by our book-keeper in making the voucher payable to me. I did not notice it in signing the voucher. I am most anxious that all such accounts be paid directly to the parties concerned, and I assure you there is no personal motive for paying them any other way. You certainly seem not to understand that many people do work for the Department, who cannot afford to wait until the account passes through the regular course before getting their money. Money is scarce, and men cannot wait so long. Even a large firm like Ingram & Davey, of St. Thomas, will often ask for a cheque on account; I have done so many times without a cent of gain to myself or the School, but to oblige these men. You may depend upon it; I wont do so any more.\n\n2. The tables were made in factory by machinery, and turned over to us in rough state. Our carpenter finished and painted them.\n\n3. In official letter of April 3rd, 1912, you state, the Department approves of, viz:- \"One large steel tank for water reserve\". This, Messrs. Ingram & Davey made to order, and placed in small room over engine room at laundry. It was found that the hard water tank, at present in use there, had to have a new bottom. Rust had eaten through, so we sent for material, and kept the men on the job until it was finished. This will be an additional item.\nMt. Elgin Industrial Institute\n\nS. R.

S. R. McVitty, the Principal, submitted accounts amounting to $462.20 for flooring, painting and decorating done to that portion of the building occupied by the Principal as a residence. No authority had been requested nor granted for this work and the Principal was written to on the 3rd of April and asked for explanations as to why the work was undertaken without authority. He replied on the 10th of April giving an explanation and adding that he had spent in the neighbourhood of $150.00 in the purchase of paint for the painting of the barn. This expenditure also was without authority. You will see that the Principal had thus expended about $600.00 without the authority of the Department and payment has been so far withheld.\n\nI think there is no doubt that the work done on the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nthe Principal's residence was necessary. Mr. J. K. McLean, who recently visited the reserve, remarked to me upon his return on the splendid appearance of the barns and stables since they had been painted. I would, therefore, recommend that payment of the account already submitted be made and that the Principal be instructed to forward a properly detailed account for the material used in the barn; both these payments to be made on the distinct understanding that in future no expenditure of this kind will be undertaken without the express authority of the Department, if it is to be called upon to make the payment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, and of the account therewith submitted for expenditure in connection with the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, and in reply I have to request that you will state why, if it was intended to ask the Department to settle the said account, authority for expenditure was not requested before the work was undertaken. The account aggregates \u00a3482.80 and the Department cannot undertake the question of the settlement of this large expenditure in view of the fact that the expense was unauthorized. At the same time, I may say that the Department appreciates the desire of the authorities in charge of the school to have the buildings and grounds of the Institution in good condition, and no objection would be made to a small expenditure for necessary work, provided that the need for the same had been reported and authority granted before the work was undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. S.R. McVitty,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nPrincipal of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute,\nMuncey, Ont.\nIn reply to yours of the 3rd Inst., permit me to say,\n\n1. The work was absolutely necessary. Practically nothing had been done to the Principal's apartments for years.\n\n2. My wife intended having a few friends visit her in the Spring, and wanted her house at least decent. She has, since coming here, served this school in almost every capacity, from matron to cook, as necessity demanded, and without a cent of remuneration.\n\n3. The carpenters were on the ground, they had the flooring left over and offered it at mill prices laid down here. Mr. Brown, who has done practically all the painting and decorating for years, was about to move to Detroit, we had barely time to get the work done before he left. It is almost impossible to get really good workmen to come out here when there is so great demand for them in the city.\n\n4. All this came upon me suddenly, and had I waited for permission of the Department, these men would have been gone and we could not have got the work done. I simply did what is often done, in fact what often has to be done, do the thing that is necessary and hope for the best in the matter of having it recognized.\n\nSince the new arrangement was entered into, we have spent hundreds of dollars on small necessary repairs which we\nhave not reported at all.\n\nWe know our action, in this case was irregular, therefore as a penalty upon ourselves, we offered to pay the account. At the present time we are painting the barns and stables, the paint has cost us about $150.00, and we are paying good wages to our mechanic to superintend the work. It is a great job and the Department ought to feel proud of the plant here. Neither a Government or Church can afford to be identified with a broken down affair.\n\nGive us a good generous settlement of this matter, paint and all, and we will promise faithfully not to offend again.\n\nAsk Mr. Inspector Mc.Gibbon, who has been here recently, what he thinks of the work being done.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nS.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the Mount Elgin Institute there is an apartment of three or four rooms set apart as an hospital. The walls and floors are in a deplorable condition but could be made sanitary with an expenditure of probably less than $100.00. Mr. McVetty is willing to supply the necessary furniture and fittings as soon as the Department remodel the interior.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nW.H. Woods.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn accordance with instructions I visited the Mount Elgin Institute on June 26th.\n\nI looked carefully over the new wings on the main building and found everything in good order and am satisfied that a good job has been made. All the buildings and surroundings are in a splendid condition and are a credit to the Department and to the management of the school.\n\nThere are a few matters in connection with the Institute which I wish to bring to your attention. Some months ago the Hobbs Hardware Company supplied some glass for the school and the account was forwarded to the Department. In the meantime the firm drew at sight on the Principal and he honoured the draft. When the cheque was drawn by the Department it was sent to the firm and returned by them, but up to the present time Mr. McVitty has not been reimbursed. He should be paid this money as it is a legitimate charge against the Department.\n\nOttawa, July 16, 1913.\nThere has been considerable correspondence also in regard to the boiler. You will recollect that Mr. McVitty was instructed to purchase a boiler for the laundry from Messrs. George White and Sons. This firm, however, did not have a suitable boiler in stock and advised him to go to Messrs. E. Leonard and Sons. As the matter was extremely urgent Mr. McVitty made the purchase from the last mentioned firm without authority from the Department. Up to the present time the Department has not paid the account and has informed Mr. McVitty that he will have to settle with the firm in question. In connection with this matter and that of certain materials for repairs to the Principal's residence, to which I shall refer later on in this report, I think Mr. McVitty has had a good lesson and that in future he will not make any purchases or incur any expenditure of this kind without the express authority of the Department and I would recommend that the boiler be paid for. There is no question as to the reasonableness of the price.\n\nMr. McVitty also incurred an expenditure of some $600.00 in flooring, painting and papering the Principal's residence and flooring the officers' dining room. These rooms were floored in soft wood before and the oak flooring put in by the Principal has added greatly to their appearance and will last for years. There is no doubt that the\nthe repairs made by Mr. McVitty were quite necessary, but he again made the mistake of doing this work without getting authority.\n\nThe painting of the stables so far as it has been done has added very greatly to their appearance and will also be a protection against the weather.\n\nI may add that the Methodist Missionary Society spent approximately $1600.00 in new furnishings for the Principal's residence and it was quite natural, therefore, that the general appearance of the rooms should be in keeping with the furniture.\n\nI would recommend also that the accounts in connection with the residence be paid and also for the material for the painting of the barns.\n\nI was very much impressed with the great improvement in the management of this school since Mr. McVitty took charge. There is no doubt that he is an able manager and performing a useful work for the Department in the education of the Indian children attending the Institute. Their farm is one of the best in the province and, as I said before, the buildings and surroundings generally are a credit to all concerned.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nMr. Pedley -\n\nWith reference to Mr. McKenzie's memorandum of the 16th July - I agree with him that the accounts which are now before the Department, amounting to $402.30, for unauthorized expenditure for the Mount Elgin Institute, should now be paid.\n\nI believe that there are some accounts which have not yet come to hand, which brings the amount up to $500.00.\n\nIn regard to the payment for the boiler - Mr. McVitty's error in this matter was in purchasing without authority from a firm not on the patronage list. There is no doubt as to the necessity of the purchase. The reason just mentioned is the only one which prevents us paying the account, as the purchase of the boiler was authorized.

Mr. McVitty has submitted receipted accounts for this expenditure, and all the work and material charged for went into the school building. In addition to this there is the account of Leonard & Sons for a boiler for the laundry for $220.00. This purchase was authorized, and he was instructed to purchase from George White & Son, but as they could not supply it, they told him to buy from Leonard & Sons. The painting of the stables cost $150.00 more, but was not authorized, and accounts therefore have not been received. A cheque was sent to the Hobbs Manufacturing Company in payment of their account and returned to the Department as they had already been paid by Mr. McVitty.\n\nAs the Department has recognized this account there is no reason why payment to Mr. McVitty should be withheld.\nOttawa, August 14, 1913.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMount Elgin Accounts.\n\nThe following accounts were not authorized, but were paid by Mr. McVitty.\n\nJ.W.

Dr. Roche -\n\nLast winter and spring Rev. S. R. MoVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, Muncey, Ont., without authority from the Department contracted the following liabilities in connection with repairs to the institute:\n\n- J.M.

He also authorized the expenditure of $150.00 for painting the stables; this has not been paid for.\neither by him or by the Department.\n\nHe was authorized to purchase a boiler for the institute from Geo. White & Sons, London. This firm had nothing on hand that would suit the purposes of the institute, so they recommended him to Messrs. Leonard & Sons, from whom the boiler was purchased at a cost of $220.00.\n\nThe institute belongs to the Government and the expenditure incurred has gone to the benefit of the building. Mr. McVitty's attention has been called to the fact that this expenditure was unauthorized, but he states that the work was absolutely necessary in the interests of the Department, and that while he admits being somewhat irregular in incurring this expenditure without authority, he thinks he should be re-embursed for the money which he has paid, and that the unpaid accounts should be settled by the Department. The building has been inspected by one of the officers of this Department, and he states that the work done was necessary and has greatly added to the appearance and condition of the building.\n\nThese accounts were before Hon. Mr. Crothers\nlast spring when he was Acting Minister, and he\ndesired that they should stand for further consideration.\nIt is now some months since the expenditure was incurred,\nthe building has received the benefit of it and I\nwould recommend that the accounts be paid. The total\namount is $990.20.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDuplicate Copy of Telegram to be mailed to Party to whom Addressed as Below.\n\nBelow Please find Duplicate Copy of Telegram sent You this date, and of which You will please consider this our confirmation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

Especially does he seem to think that we need a new floor through the entire building, as the one in it has become worn and has cracked in several places, which is not at all sanitary.\n\nThis, of course, will bring his estimate up to considerably more than what I had thought of.

Last week we were forced to stop work in the laundry, water was done, and the supply from the rams has not been sufficient to keep the large tank in the attic going.\n\nThis week we have reached a climax, one pipe, leading from the ram pits to the building, has burst, and leaks all the water. We are digging up the pipe, which is in place, 5 ft. deep. We have not found the leak yet, but may have to dig up the whole distance. There is in the ram pit a third feed pipe used as overflow. By laying a half inch pipe from the ram pit to the building we could put a third ram on this third feed pipe, and now that the trench is almost all dug out, will you kindly supply us with sufficient half inch pipe, and we will put it in. The labour is 3/4 of the cost.\n\nThen, I find on taking the levels that a supply of water sufficient for the laundry could be brought by gravitation by laying 600 ft. of 2\" pipe to a man hole at the head of the\n\nIndian Affairs.

We found it necessary to have his tinsmith come up and repair some caveloughing that was leaking and damaging the brickwork. At the same time one of the large tanks in the main attic sprung a leak. Fortunately there was very little water in it, else it would have seriously damaged the lower ceilings.

This was a very heavy and difficult job, our own mechanic worked with him for several days.\n\nThis explains the item for tin and tinsmithing.

The fire was started by little Isaiah Muskrat letting off a firecracker under a pile of straw. (Some one had given the pupils fire crackers on Friday, at our picnic). He had it in a little tin can, and thought he was hiding where no one would see him. I was at home myself, and every officer was right here. We saw the fire inside ten minutes after it started. Hundreds of people, including almost every Indian in the neighbourhood, were with us in a very short time. The utmost we could do was to save a couple of horses, and a few other animals. We lost about twenty-five head in all, including a very valuable horse.\n\nOur greatest effort was to save the annex and main building. We did so by beating the fire back from the woodshed and laundry, both of which were on fire several times.\n\nI never saw men work harder than the Indians did until every bucket of water was exhausted. We also had a\nsmall chemical engine, which we purchased some time ago. It proved of great service in beating the fire out of the laundry and wood shed roof, and a great pile of wood stored in the yard near the shed.\n\nSo great was the danger to the main buildings at times that the consensus of opinion led us to remove a large part of the contents out into the lawn, but, at the most crucial moment the wind veered from the East almost due North, and this, of course threw the flames in the opposite direction, and so our main building, annex, and laundry are practically unhurt, and school is going on as usual.\n\nThe children feel very sorry for what has occurred, (I have sought in every way to impress them with the seriousness of it), and were rejoiced to learn this morning that we hope to re-build our barns right away. They love the animals, especially the cows. I was much touched with the pleading of some boys not to sell the cows. They knew them every one by name, and some boys risked their lives in getting a few out of the burning buildings. The greater part of the cows had just come up to the barns for milking, but were not tied up, so they escaped.\n\nOf course all our implements, machinery, and tools, also harness, hay, straw, and about 1000 bus. of grain were destroyed.\nMt.

Our crops will be upon us soon, and, to lose them would almost drive us to the wall.\n\nI am writing representatives of several firms, to give us information as to the best kind of barns, probable cost, etc., all of which I will submit to you at the earliest moment.\n\nI made my report to the Department on Wednesday morning. I hope it will clearly show there was no wilful act, or even neglect on the part of anyone in the matter. I called the boys all together on Saturday morning, and had them destroy all the firecrackers I could find, also warned them of the danger. Isaiah had some hidden away. He is a very small boy, and only in school a short time, and I feel sure did not intend any wrong.\n\nAgain thanking you\n\nI am, Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nVery sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Then it is also a difficult task to find any employment for the boys who did this stable work, and when out of school, they are disposed to slip off to the village, or over the Reserve.\n\nI am not sure as to amount of insurance on the buildings, I hope it will be sufficient to erect new ones. My thought is, we should have barns a reasonable distance apart. Brick or cement foundation, and steel frame, siding, and roof.

Reading through the specifications we are unable to find any mention made of the interior barn fittings and apparently this part of the specifications has been omitted from our set. You will understand that we are not in a position to give a tender on the complete barn, but we can supply all interior fittings that will be required, such as the galvanised cow stalls, pens, horse stalls, feed and litter carrier conveyor outfits, hay conveyors, etc., You will no doubt be insisting on galvanised fittings all through on this job and in connection with this, we are pleased to say that we have not, as yet, seen any advance in the price of our galvanised cow stalls, notwithstanding the fact that extraordinary advances have been made in the price of galvanised pipe during the past few months. We are able to keep our prices down owing to the fact that we have our own galvanising plant.\n\nIn your specifications covering the interior cow stall fittings, you will require to mention the style of a stall that is required, there being several different styles of stalls, which we ourselves are offering for sale.

They are very complete in every way, and, I believe, will be very suitable. It was very good business indeed to have a choice between wood and steel truss. It prevents monopoly. But I would respectfully suggest, that, unless the difference in price is very considerable, the steel truss is much to be preferred, if for no other reason than a sentimental one. The wooden truss is an old affair, and never looked upon favourably by farmers. The steel truss is much more modern, and sounds much better. The barns will, no doubt, cost a good deal, and the name steel truss barns \"sounds big\".\n\nThe plans prepared by Mr. Ogilvie will, undoubtedly, cost more than the sketch submitted by me. They are much more complete, and two buildings are larger.\n\nIf any tender is accepted by the Department, it might be well to wire the fact to the party concerned. Days count for much just now.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nConstruction of Reinforced Concrete Pavements and Roadways\n\nBy H. S. Doyle\n\nWithin less than a decade steel has received recognition as an important factor in the construction of country roads and city pavements. Steel constantly finds its way to the front ranks of new uses, and none the least of these is the road builder. In the United States and highways, combining with concrete, steel, in the form of drawn wire, is rapidly taking a place in the engineering programme which contemplates a greater permanence to the already determined solidity of Portland cement. The main advantage promised by reinforced concrete over ordinary concrete lies in the fact that it can be laid at an average price of $1.10 to $1.25 per square yard. Excluding the most of maintenance, which is lower for concrete than for any other type, and assuming the life of all types of permanent pavements to be the same, a saving in the first cost can be obtained by the use of reinforced concrete that could be used to pay for at least 50 percent of the total replacement cost when such replacement becomes necessary. Thus, at 4 percent compound interest for twenty years, will amount to the original cost of the pavement, or in other words, the cost of a new pavement. Although the cheapest and best of other types, the original cost of the latter will construct a high class reinforced concrete pavement and replace it at the end of twenty years.\n\nThe comparative cost of various types of pavement in a number of American cities according to the best available data is contained in the following table. The showing is very much to the advantage of concrete pavements. The question of economy refers to the average life of a pavement, or, in other words, to the length of the period after which the pavement must be replaced, regardless of the labor and material that have been required to keep it in good condition during that time, the subject is connected here with main\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe chief reasons for the use of wire mesh steel reinforcement in the construction of pavements and roadways are the unsatisfactory foundation or subsoil, and consequently the tendency toward the formation of cracks due to the soft yielding subsoil only can be prevented by the use of a proper amount of reinforcement. In this case, the tensile force is used to add strength to the concrete slab. Under average conditions the question of expansion and contraction presents merely a number of difficulties. It is now very well known that concrete will contract and expand under changes of temperature and also that the cement during the setting up of tension causes the concrete to shrink. This means that the pavement moves over the subsoil, the movement in itself causing the setting up of tension.\n\n### Comparative Costs of Various Types of Pavements\n\n| Location       | Year | Average Cost Per Square Yard |\n|----------------|------|------------------------------|\n| Montezuma, Wash. | 1911 | $12.75                        |\n| Richmond, Ind.   | 1908 | $12.50                        |\n| Panama, Cuba     | 1909-07| $12.60                      |\n| Sumnerville, Mass.| 1903 | $12.50                        |\n| Toronto, Ont.    | 1904 | $12.50                        |\n| Denver, Colo.    |      | $12.50                        |\n| Chicago, Ill.    | 1905 | $12.50                        |\n| Chicago, Ill.    | 1906 | $12.50                        |\n| Chicago, Ill.    | 1908 | $12.50                        |\n| Mason City, Iowa | 1909-10| $12.50                      |\n| Columbus, Ohio    | 1909-12| $12.50                      |\n| Cedar Falls, Mich.| 1911 | $12.50                        |\n| Wayne Co., Mich. | 1910 | $12.50                        |\n| Wayne Co., Mich. | 1911 | $12.50                        |\n| Trenton, N.J.    | 1911 | $12.50                        |\n| Le Mars, Iowa     | 1904 | $12.50                        |\n\n*Average for four or five years prior to 1911.*\n\n### Estimate of Life of Various Types of Pavements\n\n- Cedar block on 6-in. concrete base: 15 years\n- Cedar block on 6-in. gravel base: 15 years\n- Brick on 6-in. concrete base: 15 years\n- Brick on 6-in. gravel base: 15 years\n- Slab on grade on 6-in. concrete base: 15 years\n- Granite on concrete: 15 years\n- Macadam: granite top dressing: 15 years\n\nWhile it is admitted that all estimates cannot be taken typewise for granted, the above statement was shown comparative values. On this same basis it is safe to estimate the life of a pavement approximately to be 35 years for heavy traffic, 25 years for medium traffic, and 15 years for lighter traffic. A comparison of the various publications on various types of pavement in comparison with other types unquestionably will lead to the conclusion that under average conditions a concrete pavement comes the nearest to the ideal.\nThe chief reasons for the use of wire mesh steel reinforcement in the construction of pavements and roadways are the unsatisfactory foundation or subsoil, and expansion and contraction due to the soft yielding subsoil only can be prevented by the use of a proper amount of steel reinforcement. In this case the reinforcement is used to add strength to the edges of the concrete slabs. Under average conditions the question of expansion and contraction presents the greatest difficulty. It is now generally known that concrete will contract and expand under changes of temperature and also that the cement during the setting period will contract to a marked degree. This means that the pavement moves over the subsoil, this movement in itself causing the setting up of tension or compression stresses depending upon whether it is a case of contraction or expansion of the material. Although the concrete is capable of a certain amount of tensile value it has been found advisable to eliminate this value in concrete computations. For this reason steel reinforcement is placed in the pavement to take care of at least some portion of the difference of the temperature stresses.\n\nIn the construction of the two-course pavements, the top course of concrete has a very much richer mixture than the base, and since richer mixtures will expand and contract under temperature changes, and will contract during setting to a greater extent than a normal mixture, there will be created a plane of weakness between the two courses which often results in the splitting out of the top course from the base. The following diagram illustrates very clearly how the use of a light reinforcement that is slightly tamped into the base prior to the placing of the top course, and therefore prevents the separation of these two courses. Additional stresses occur because of the fact that especially during hot weather the top or exposed portion of the pavement has a temperature considerably in excess of the under surface.

A summation of the various qualifications of a concrete pavement in comparison with other types unquestionably will lead to the conclusion that under average conditions a concrete pavement comes the nearest to the ideal.\nThe proper thickness for a pavement depends largely upon the amount and kind of traffic it will be required to carry. Although the condition of the foundation and the amount and position of the reinforcement used may require a certain minimum thickness, it will generally be advisable to make a total thickness of six inches on residential streets, and seven inches on business streets. In any case, however, depending on the type of pavement the wearing course should be at least one and one-half inches thick. These figures are considered good practice, but it should be remembered that they do not allow for a sufficient amount of reinforcement.\n\nFor reinforcing concrete pavement a woven wire reinforcement is the best that can be used. In order to form such an economical construction, using loose bars, it would be necessary to space them at a distance which would not give a satisfactory distribution over the steel. Small wires spaced from eight to ten inches or more apart cannot be used, since they would result in comparison with a woven wire reinforcement having an equal and close spacing of the members. Therefore, the use of a reinforced concrete pavement of gold drawn wire properly tested to give uniform results. It has a minimum ultimate breaking strength of 85,000 pounds per square inch, and is made up of solid or stranded longitudinal members properly spaced by means of diagonal cross wires so arranged as to form a series of triangles between each longitudinal and cross member. The longitudinal members are invariably spaced four inches apart, the cross wires either two inches or four inches apart, thus providing either a 2-inch or 4-inch triangle. Longitudinal members and cross wires are used in order to provide the cross-sectional areas of steel required to meet the requirements of the job.\n\nReinforced concrete pavements and roads have all the desirable features, namely: maximum rigidity, cost and maintenance, durability, attractive appearance, fireproof qualities and fire-resistance\u2014fire. These factors have been realized in a number of American cities. A few of these municipalities, with the cost of construction are given below:\n\n| City          | Cost (per square Yard) |\n|---------------|------------------------|\n| Plymouth, Wis.| $1.35                  |\n| Sheboygan, Wis.| $1.25                |\n| Fond du Lac, Wis.| $1.25            |\n| Milwaukee, Wis.| $1.25                  |\n| Hamtramck, Mich.

The construction is practically what has been specified for Mount Elgin with the exception that the design is a little different on the outside.\n\nAs regards the stable doors for the basement. We make these with a solid wooden core, end panelled, and thoroughly covered with galvanized iron on both out and inside as well as the edges, having in mind to produce a door which the dampness will not in any way affect, and as these doors are giving universal satisfaction, we are wondering if it would not be agreeable to the Department if we were to substitute these in place of what have been specified. We, of course, could paint these doors any color desired.\n\nIn asking for this we would not be effecting any saving as we think that our door is really more expensive to construct than those shown on your plans, but we are particularly anxious to please Mr. McVittie, the Superintendent, and feel that our doors would meet the case to best advantage. Please let us know your decision after you have considered this matter.

Scott, Deputy Superintendent, we have this morning received from Mr. Ponsford copy of your letter of August 3rd, and your blue print of amended detail of upper end of the trusses supporting purlins, etc.\n\nWhen Mr. Ponsford placed contract with us, it was with the stipulation that we rush this work in every way possible; consequently we had our Draughting Department work overtime to make up necessary details and we have spent a lot of time in endeavoring to locate the steel necessary to make the trusses, and have put part of the work underway, and if it is now necessary to change from the previous details which you sent us it simply means that the whole work will be held up for several weeks as it will be necessary for us to wire and cancel orders for material, and then proceed to get up entirely new details for the steel work as well as for the wood work so this amended detail of the upper end of the trusses would necessitate the entire changing of the plans for both the steel and wood. It would change the length of every member in the truss.\n\nKnowing just how urgently these buildings are required, we sincerely hope that you will not insist on the amended details referred to being complied with. However, if they must be complied with, we would thank you, on receipt of this letter, to wire us tomorrow morning by eleven o'clock. The sooner you wire us the less expense there will be in connection with this changing. You, of course, understand that we have already put a lot of expense on this job having proceeded on the former plans sent, and if you now ask us to amend your former details, we understand that we would be entitled to charge for the extra time necessary to make revised drawings and details, and furthermore, you can appreciate, as we have already intimated, that it would hold up the job for at least two to three weeks. If we do not hear from you by eleven o'clock tomorrow morning, we will understand that you have decided to allow this job to go.\nahead on the original details supplied us for these trusses. We can assure you that we have had a wide experience in building these steel trusses for barns, and you may depend on our providing a construction which will give satisfaction and be entirely satisfactory to your Superintendent Mr. McVittie, whom we understand has charge of this work.\n\nWe experienced some little difficulty in getting the sway bracing in position shown on the former details, but finally overcome this without serious difficulty or extra expense.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE METAL SHINGLE & SIDING CO., LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\n\nCD/P.\nMr. L.D.

No extra cost.\n\nSpecifications call for cow and calf barn and horse stable being ceiled with matched lumber. The Preston people who are building the superstructure offer to substitute metal for wood. No extra cost. This would be much better as a precaution against fire.\n\nMr. Ogilvie sanctioned both changes, and asked me to forward the matter to you for confirmation.\n\nI also pointed out some few things which need attention, and could be readily done when the men are here:\n\n1. Several arches in main buildings have loose brick.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMt. Elgin Industrial Institute\n\nS. R. McIlvay, Principal\n\nMuncey, Ont., 191\n\n2. A number of chimneys are off, causing defective roof.\n\n3. Our gasoline engine, which has been running dynamo for about 4\u00bd years needs some repairs. The belt is completely worn out; a new one would cost $30.00.\n\n4. One section in the main boiler is leaking; will need repairs.\n\n5. Considerable tile will need to be laid around outside foundation of new buildings, and then into main drain.\n\n6. About 40 rod of galvanized wire fence will be needed around the yards and front of orchard.\n\n7. Cement walk should be laid from main building to cow barn and laundry for girls. They get their feet wet in winter.\n\nSome of this work will need an expert. All that we can do we will do gladly, Department furnishing the material.\n\nThe total cost to the Department would not exceed $300.00 (two hundred dollars) perhaps much less. If authorized, I will exercise fullest economy, and furnish the Department receipted bill for each item.\n\nThere is also a most unsightly old building standing near the laundry. It was formerly used as a poultry house, now as ice house. It ought to have a foundation, and then covered with galvanized iron. It is a fire trap at present. Mr. Ogilvie took a note of it. It could be done new for about\nOttawa, September 24, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 13th instant in reference to change of foundation walls of stock barn on west and north sides from concrete to hard burned brick, similar to that specified for horse barn; also the ceiling up of the cow barn and horse barn with galvanised metal instead of wood sheathing as specified. The above changes are approved and are to be made without extra expense.\n\nThe Department also approves of the setting of the lower arches in brick work in main and extension building, also the replacing of the slates on the main building which have been broken and have fallen from the roof.\n\nA ceiling should also be placed in the metal ventilators over chimneys in boys wing and braced to standards which support the ventilator roof, these to be formed of 1 x 1 firmly secured to post and together.\n\nWith respect to the leaking section in the main boiler, this should be examined to ascertain if the fault is in the section or the packing between. If the section is faulty it will be necessary to procure a new one, and if the fault is with the packing it may be necessary to take the boiler apart and reset.\n\nRev. R.S.

Suitable belt to be purchased as economically as possible and should not exceed $30.00, the price stated.\n\nWith respect to the tile to be laid around the outside of the new building; as these are on the hill side it would scarcely appear necessary with the concrete foundation and floors to use tile in the soil there, but will be considered when fuller information has been submitted by you in respect to this.\n\nThe forty rod wire fencing with posts and gates to replace that destroyed by recent fire and necessary to properly protect the barnyard and orchard, etc., may be purchased and the labour erecting done by the school.\n\nWith reference to the concrete walks asked for, there is no doubt considerable brick, gravel and broken cement from the burnt building, which might be used for the walks, and would answer the purpose as the hard surface raised would shed the water and prevent the formation of mud.\n\nThe old poultry building now used as an ice house is in such a dilapidated condition that it is not considered advisable to build a new foundation under and put in condition the superstructure as it would be more economical to build a combined ice-house and refrigerator which would more adequately meet the requirements of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n6 latches Dandy No.128-2 Galv. page 256\n60 brackets No.1x3l. page 50\n26 \" for ends No. 2x3l page 50\n16 No. 278-A cable pulleys 4\" diam.

Gurney Ltd.,\nFoundry etc.,\nToronto, ONT.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn the Fall of 1911, you, per Messrs Ingram & Davey, installed a hot water heating system in this School. One boiler leaked from the first. We thought it was from the joint between sections. It became intolerable last Winter. We have had it taken out by Messrs. Ingram and Davey's men. We find the section is porous from a large number of sand holes. We have had to order a new section.\n\nI think, inasmuch as this was defective from the first, you are entitled to furnish us this section free. We will gladly ship you defective one for examination, if you so desire.\n\nOur loss through waste of fuel has been much greater than yours. We should have discarded it at once, but the plumber said \"Oh, it will take up after a while\". It got worse all the time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would be a very simple, and not expensive thing to connect the four radiators on the north wall of the Main Building to the system in the new wing. This would insure warmth to the boys in these two dormitories, especially to the small boys in the upper one.

All have been repaired satisfactorily.\nWe found that the lining in the eavestroughing on the main\nbuilding is completely gone, can push your fingers through\nit any place. (It has been up 20 years). We now find that\nseveral places we thought were the result of holes in the\nroof, are the result of water running through the eavetrough\nand down the walls. Last night it poured down the wall\nin the prayer room and over the floor, also down the wall\noutside. This condition would be disastrous to the\nbuilding, especially when the frost comes.\n\nKindly instruct us, as winter will be here in\na few days.\n\nAgain, we find the boiler in the boys' wing\nis capable of much more work than it is doing at present.\nWe also find it is very difficult to heat the boys' dormitory\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is a very good door in many respects, but exceedingly heavy. All our openings are large, and most doors open out. Mr. Ponsford and I both think these heavy doors will, with rough handling, break the hinges and pull out the door jams. We both much prefer, for our use here, a first class wooden door, painted and finished in first class manner.\n\nThe Preston people agree to make the change without any extra cost to the Department, yet would very much prefer putting on their own door.\n\nWe hope you will sanction the change. I am quite sure it will be much more satisfactory. Unless we receive a wire to the contrary, we will proceed with the doors.

The attendance is larger, and the demands are much greater than formerly.\n\nWe are, at present, resorting to many primitive methods to keep the buildings at all sanitary, also to find sufficient water supply for bathing etc. So, after carefully going over the whole situation, I submit herewith a rough sketch of what might meet requirements of both ice house and water supply.\n\nIce house shown is copied from a sketch sent me by Mr. Ogilvie. The red lines indicate present laundry building, well, fence, play ground, etc.\n\nNow, I am not at all sure that it would be possible to undertake this at the present time.

It is ordinary field tile, and has given much trouble. It gets stopped up about twice a year. We opened it up a few days ago, and had Dr. Woods inspect it. I am enclosing herewith his report. Several times the water has backed up into the kitchen, causing a dreadful condition of things, so we have purchased from Messrs. Ingram and Davey, the necessary material, and are having the drain made sanitary, all unskilled labour being done by the school. The cost will be kept at the lowest point consistent with a good job.\n\nNeedless to say the conditions prevailing when Dr. Woods made the inspection required prompt attention, and so we were forced to act before securing the consent of the Department. We hope this will be forthcoming in due time.\n\nI am Dear Sir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nNov. 12th, 1918.\n\nRev. A. R. Witty\n\nNunney, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Witty,\n\nYesterday I made an examination of the kitchen sinks and the drainage therefrom as there were complaints of not only foul odors from them but also of sewage backing up and seeping through the kitchen floor. Upon being dug up the drain proves to be composed of ordinary field tiles which allow the sewage to escape. As there is no provision for arresting grease and as the pupils are possibly more careless than adults would be in the matter of allowing solid materials to reach the drain, it soon becomes blocked when it has to be dug up.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nThis is very unsanitary and cannot be too strongly condemned.\n\nThe tiles should at once be replaced with impervious soil pipe, there should be a grease trap and provision should be made for cleaning out the drain if it does become blocked.\n\nI neglected to say that it was to the sinks in Mount Elgin Institute to which this letter refers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.H. Woods.\nOttawa, November 24, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in reference to obstruction from the kitchen, also enclosing report of Dr. W. H. Woods, of Mount Brydges, Ont., on conditions there.\n\nIn reply I have to say that your action in reference thereto is approved, as the maintenance of the premises in a thoroughly sanitary condition at all times is necessary.\n\nThe material used should be vitrified salt glazed drain tile laid in cement joints cemented full hub and watertight, and the cost to be as economical as possible for first class work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.

All, save one, were duly authorized, and have been kept quite within the estimate. The ensuing repairs were an absolute necessity, and urgent.\n\nAs the expense to the Department has been quite large this year, we are doing many things for which we are not sending in bills. For instance, we erected one additional silo, cost $300.00 (three hundred dollars). Doors for cement wall west side of yard cost $10.00. A six foot high board fence along the entire east side of the yard cost $110.00.\n\nAll above were quite necessary. We just mention these items to show we are not entirely selfish in seeking help.\n\nOur School is in a most prosperous condition, and our staff more efficient than ever before.

McVitty, Principal\n\nMuneg, Ont., Febry, 8th, 1916.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn these days of disastrous fires, the fact that the old part (that is, the portion erected in '05) of our main building is wired according to old methods is getting on my nerves. All wires are strung along under floors, and in partition walls. There is great danger of rats, of which there is quite a few in the building, destroying the insulation.\n\nA fire starting in the floors or walls would spread throughout the building instantly. 140 people are sleeping in it every night, so we might easily have a terrible disaster.\n\nMessrs. Ingram and Davey, St. Thomas, did the electric work on our new barns. They have a splendid man, who is entirely trustworthy, and I presume they could do it right away. The cost should not be so very great.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. H. McVitty\nOttawa, February 18, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the electric wiring in the Mount Elgin Institute, and in reply to inform you that the wiring referred to was installed there within the last few years under your supervision, and presumably in a good, safe and satisfactory manner, and as 95% of the wiring in existing buildings throughout the country is without the conduit covering and is considered reasonably safe under ordinary precautions, the expenditure necessary to re-wire the main building there, which would be a considerable amount, cannot be authorized until an estimate has been obtained covering the cost of installing the service in conduit, as well as the total approximate expense of expenses to floors, ceilings, walls, dormitories, etc.\n\nThe estimate may be in the form of a tender for the whole or portion of the work, but must include all of the work necessary to leave the work complete and in satisfactory condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mr. Brittain, who installed the lighting system, went over it very carefully, and made it safe as such wiring can be made.\n\n3.

Elgin Industrial School, and in reply to request that you will have the wiring system inspected by Messrs. Ingram & Davey, electricians, and report to the Department. In their report it will be necessary to take into consideration the fact of the electricity being developed in the Institution and without storage facilities, the energy being developed and used as required, stating also as to possibility of danger from lighting between the dynamo and building, also as to the type and position of distributing board, type of fuses used, etc., and position of cabinet and distributing boxes within the building, if any.\n\nThe report should clearly show the conditions throughout so that the safety and effectiveness of the installation may be determined.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

McVitty,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn March 7th, we had our man make a thorough inspection of the electric wiring of the main building of the Institute, as per your instructions. We also had the Hydro Electric Inspector go over the building, as we did not like to take all the responsibility on ourselves, a copy of his report you will find attached.\n\nOur man reports that the wiring is in a bad condition, and not at all safe. The joints are not soldered nor properly taped, and are very poorly made. The wires are not properly insulated, and run through the wood joice, without Porcelain tubes, also the wire is very old, and the rubber insulation dry, and hard. The wires are not properly fastened with knobs, and are lying on the wood lath. Also at the Panel the wires are only stuck in the lugs loose, where they should be soldered in.\n\nThis is very dangerous, and is apt to cause a fire at any time, also the style of wiring is not good, as both wires of the circuit should run direct to the distribution centre, which it does not. This is very bad practice.\n\nWe find the wiring in the new wing of the main building in very good condition, and consider same perfectly safe.\n\nHoping that our report will be satisfactory to all parties concerned, and that we may be favored with your valued order, of putting the wiring in your building in first class condition, we remain,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nINGRAM & DAVEY, Limited.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply would say we know of no extra work in connection with our part of the work.\n\nWe included in our estimate the taking up, and laying down again, of all floors, where it was necessary to lift them for the wiring. Therefore, our figure includes fully, the taking up of all floors, and replacing them as before, and we know of no extra work that would likely turn up during the progress of this work.\n\nWe therefore feel you can advise the Government that our price included everything in connection with the installation.

S. McVittie,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs per your request I visited your institute in order to determine the best system of wiring. I would recommend that all wiring be done in conduit and lighting be distributed with ten circuits divided as follows:\n\n2 circuits in basement, 3 on first floor, 3 on second floor and 2 on third floor. This will give a maximum of 660 watts per circuit. For service would recommend 2 No. 6's. The question was asked as to the size of wire to be used for the different lighting circuits. For this I would recommend No. 14 owing to the fact that we stipulate the number of watts permissible on any one circuit. If the above recommendations are carried out I assure you that your system of lighting will be most efficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is so important that we do the right thing.\n\nI was down in the ram pit today, and it occurred to me that it might be quite possible to put a small gasoline engine there, and pump the waste water from the rams. There is an extra pipe from the building. If the two large tanks in the attic could be kept full all the time, we could get along splendidly. (One of these tanks is leaking, so out of use.) The surplus, or waste water from the rams would be quite sufficient. Possibly we would need to deepen the catch basins, and extend the drains into the bush.\n\nWe have a deep tank in the laundry yard at present, which holds 3000 gals., but we pump it out in a very short time. It makes me suspicious about storage.\n\nThis latter suggestion, as to small engine and pump in ram house would be very inexpensive, and is well worth considering. Then, it would give us pure, fresh water all the time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMOUNT ELGIN INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE\n\nS.

That in order to gain sufficient supply, drains will have to be extended back into the hills a considerable distance. A new catch basin built to get elevation, and a two inch pipe laid about 100 yds.\n\n2. It will cost 17\u00a2 per cubic foot to build tank after all material is put on the ground, and excavating done.\n\n3. I am satisfied that the engine, at present running the electric light, can be utilized for pumping.\n\n4. The tank might be placed in the Laundry yard, near where the engine house now stands.\n\nAn estimate of cost would be about as follows:\n\n1. Extension of drains, piping, & building a catch basin $300.00\n2. Cost of pump ----------------?\n3. Cost of clutch pulley, and belt for engine ------?\n4. Piping from tank to main building -------?\n5. Cost of cement and reinforcing for cover of tank ------?\n\nI greatly wish you could come up and go over the situation. Water is absolutely necessary.

Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 18th and 20th ultimo with estimate of cost for the building of the cistern tanks in the Mount Elgin Institute, and in reply to inform you that the estimate of Messrs. Ingram & Davey for the building and installing complete in the school, two tanks of 16-gauge galvanised-iron, properly rivetted and soldered with necessary reinforcing to secure satisfactorily; also the repairs to middle tank, ensuring a thoroughly water-tight and satisfactory job, for the sum of $175.00, should be accepted, and the work completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. S. R. McVitty,\nPrincipal\nMt. Elgin Institute,\nBuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, October 3, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 24th and 25th ultimo in reference to water supply and note the information contained. There is one thing which is not clearly shown and which we discussed, that is the probability of procuring a supply of water in a tank at the school by gravitation, which could be pumped into the tanks into the building and provide temporarily for a better water supply. It does not appear possible at this time to finance the larger problem, that is the putting in of a complete fire-protection plant consisting of hydrants around the building with stand pipe inside, yet it would be well to determine exactly what plan to adopt so that any work now done would become a part of the complete system when this is undertaken. In this connection I think it would be well to ascertain if an adequate supply of water in the storage tank could be obtained by gravitation or by syphonage from any of the existing gathering basins, and if this be possible, it would be better to utilize this plan rather than the pumping of waste water from the ram, which will entail considerable expenditure for the pumping, and should be avoided if possible.\n\nThe 6000 gallon tank might be utilized temporarily for the supply, if there can be kept full by gravitation and the system enlarged later.\n\nRev. S.R. McVitty,\nPrincipal, Mt. Elgin Institute,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6266, file 468-5, part 3)\nProviding the gravitation or the syphonage system is not available, then we will have to secure a supply from the ram pit. This will afford us a temporary supply for the building, but cannot provide any fire-protection such as should be available there where so many persons are housed under your care.\n\nIt is noted that you are not entirely satisfied as to the feasibility of a storage tank system. I can assure you, however, that when properly constructed, these are practically waterproof and entirely reliable as a storage supply.\n\nProviding the supply is to be pumped from the ram pit in the ravine, you should state whether the pump-house could be erected immediately over the present pit or if it will be necessary to divert the water to one side and erect the pump-house there.\n\nThis with any other information which you may obtain should be forwarded to the Department as soon as possible, so that the matter can be given full consideration and a solution obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.M.,\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\nOct. 18th. 1913\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe water supply for Mount Elgin Institute is totally inadequate at the present time; they are flushing closets for the dormitories on the first and second floors by carrying water up in pails. I am told that this condition of things obtained all summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Woods.\nOttawa, September 20, 1917.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAn application has recently been made for new water tanks for the Mount Elgin Institute, the old ones having become useless through corrosion from length of service, the water escaping having caused considerable damage to the wall of room below. Before authorizing new tanks, the Principal has been requested to have an estimate prepared showing the cost of providing similar tanks to replace the old ones.\n\nThe water service at the school is very unsatisfactory as now provided, as they are entirely dependent in the building for a supply from tanks erected on the attic floor and piped to the fixtures on several floors and which, whilst supplying their immediate requirements, does not afford any fire protection.\nThe existing water supply is now obtained from hydraulic pressure, the water being gathered into storage basins and conducted to hydraulic rams which force the water into the tanks in the attic. With this system, about one gallon out of every twenty passing through the hydraulic engine, reaches the building, the balance providing the motive power for elevating the water to the tanks.\n\nAn adequate supply of water for all purposes from the present source of supply, can be provided by either of two methods.\n\n(1.) Depending on the present equipment up to its capacity and pumping the additional amount required direct into tanks from well near building.\n\n(2.) By diverting a portion of the water from gathering-basins by gravitation to reservoir near building and elevating by power-pump into tanks in building or into pneumatic tanks.\n\nThe first plan will be the less costly to install, but whilst providing a satisfactory supply of water for the building, does not provide fire-protection.\nThe second plan will provide better water, (as there is less danger from surface contamination) and in sufficient quantities for their purposes, including fire-protection, as with an ample reservoir with exterior hydrants and interior stand pipes with power pump system, an adequate protection from fire would be obtained.\n\nThis would also be possible by the use of the pneumatic tank system, but to a lesser degree depending on its capacity.\n\nThe estimated cost of the first plan would be \u00a31200.00 to \u00a31500.00.\n\nThe second plan would be considerably greater in cost, but more economical in the end, in as much as an efficient fire-system and water-supply is assured, viz., a 30,000 gallon exterior reservoir, interior tanks or pneumatic pressure, exterior hydrants and interior stand pipes, in addition to pump and engine, costing, probably, about \u00a33500.00.\nThe estimates are tentative only, as I have no accurate data, and am depending on my memory for quantities ascertained in 1911 and on the condition of the pipe line now supplying the water, which I believe to be in good condition.\n\nAs an abundant supply of good water is an absolute necessity in a public institution such as this, as is also adequate fire-protection, I would recommend for your consideration the erection of system No. 2 as being in the best interests of the school and the Department.\n\nArchitect.\nMOUNT ELGIN INDUSTRIAL FARM\n\nS. R. McVITTY, SUPERINTENDENT\n\nMuncey, Ont.\n\n1. A pneumatic tank, capacity of say 1000 gals. Engine and pump could be used to elevate water in buildings or else, and elevated tank, such as you see at some railway stations, could be used. Each as auxiliary to present hydraulic system, and either one would serve as an immediate supply in case of fire, until the engine could be started pumping into the mains.\n\nI am sure the expenditure for proposition No.2, would not exceed the estimate of $500.00, namely $1,300.00; and the fire protection secured would be worth the total amount not to speak of the improvement in sanitary conditions.\n\nAs the need is so pressing, and the time before frost etc., it is so short, and as our men and boys are so busy storing roots, raising tobacco, etc., we are taking the liberty of hiring Indians at $1.25 per hour on this job, until such time as the Department may authorize this expenditure.\n\nI will personally see that each man hired renders just and fitting services for wages paid.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nS.

Very many thanks for prompt assistance rendered us in the hour of danger and difficulty.\n\nWe are getting along splendidly carrying out authorized improvements as rapidly as possible.\n\nHave read over Mr. Ogilvie's memorandum very carefully, and feel satisfied that proposition No. 1 would not meet the needs of the case. A well would be quite useless in drought of Summer, even for domestic purposes; not to speak of fire. We would pump it dry in a day.\n\nOn Saturday, our Head Teacher, mechanic, and myself made a most careful examination of the whole source of water supply. We are fully satisfied that an abundance of pure water can be obtained by\u2014\n\n1. Lifting, and cleaning out the drains already laid, but which are now choked with quick sand.\n\n2. Extending feeders to these drains, and possibly placing a larger tile in mains, and using tile now in use to extend drains.\n\nThere is a little ridge or embankment between the source of water, and the catch basin which feeds the runs. The tile through this part is down about 10', and is so filled with sand as to divert the water in another direction. These drains would serve the two-fold purpose of gathering the water, and draining the farm at the same time.\n\n3. There will also need to be a suitable culvert laid, to convey water from these cuttings to reservoir in the yard.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Inst.,\nMuncy, Ont.\n\nAs per your request I visited your institute in order to determine the best system of wiring. I would recommend that all wiring be done in conduit and lighting be distributed with ten circuits divided as follows:\n\n2 circuits in basement, 3 on first floor, 3 on second floor and 2 on third floor. This will give a maximum of 660 watts per circuit. For service would recommend 2 No. 6's. The question was asked as to the size of wire to be used for the different lighting circuits. For this I would recommend No 14 owing to the fact that we stipulate the number of watts permissible on any one circuit. If the above recommendations are carried out I assure that your system of lighting will be most efficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDistrict Inspector.\nThe Secretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 27th last you wrote the Rev. S. R. McVitty,\nPr. Mt. Elgin Institute, Muncey, Ontario regarding our bill,\nwhich included the contract for wiring the institute, amount-\ning to Four Hundred and Fifty ($450.00) Dollars, together with\nextras amounting to $166.24. Total amount of our claim\n$616.24.\n\nPrincipal McVitty replied to this letter on July\n31st last stating that the Hydro Inspector had made demands\non us which we had not anticipated, and in view of these facts\nhe hoped the Department would give us a generous settlement.\nAfter this recommendation we have been expecting your cheque\never since, and in case further information is required regard-\ning the extras we will try and explain as fully as possible how\nwe arrive at this amount.\n\nIn the first place about March 2nd, 1916 we received\nfrom Principal McVitty a request to send a man down to look\nover the building in order that this work could be gone into\nthoroughly. We suggested that we take the local Hydro Inspector\nwith us, believing that we could give you a more accurate\nreport. We did this, and enclose you a copy of his report. On\nJanuary 29th we received from Principal McVitty a copy of a\nTelegram signed J. D. McLean, as follows:\n\nElectric wire Muncey Institute to be #12 wire in\nconcealed conduit. Exposed work will not be permitted. You\nor your assistant to inspect work without charge. Final inspect-\nion to be made by Hydro Electric Inspector, who must pass same\nbefore payment. Please note there was no specification to work\nto. You simply asked for estimate for the repairing of the\nwiring in the main building. We therefore had to leave it with\nour man and the inspector as to what was to be done.\nOn April 13th, 1917 we sent you our figures as follows: We will rewire this building all in conduit for the sum of $450.00, or we will rewire the basement in conduit and wire the upper floors in knob and tube for the sum of $325.00. This work to be done to comply with the Hydro Electric Inspector and with first class workmanship and number one material used throughout.\n\nIn your letter to Principal McVitty under date of May 9, 1916 you mention in awarding Ingram & Davey, Ltd., the tender for this work at $450.00 to be done in conduit. You state, this price is to cover all work necessary in the installation, including all cutting and repairs to walls, ceilings, floors, decorations, etc complete. On April 28th however we received a copy of your letter of April 28th to Pr. McVitty stating no action could be taken however until an estimate had been submitted for all repair work necessary in connection with this installation, and the placing again of the building in a complete state. We replied to this letter on May 2nd, copy of this letter you have, and part of it is as follows:\n\nIn reply would say we know of no extra work in connection with our part of the work. We included in our estimate the taking up and laying down again all floors, where it was necessary to lift them for the wiring. Therefore our figure includes fully the taking up of all floors, and replacing them as before, and we know of no extra work that would be likely to turn up during the progress of this work.\n\nWe therefore feel that you can advise the Government that our price included everything in connection with the installation. We therefore wish to point out however that should any new fixtures be required of course that would be additional, but we understood from our Mr. Swackhammer who was in charge of the work that you intended to use your present fixtures.\n\nIn the first place we wish to draw your attention to the local inspectors report. You will please note nothing is mentioned about fixtures and the present wire used.\nwith same, and neither our man or the inspector took into consideration this part of the work. They were called to report on the wiring, and our price was based on this report. After the wiring was done the inspector refused to allow us to use the present old code wire for the fixtures, and ordered our man to put in new material.\n\nHere is where our man in charge of the work made a mistake, when he did not stop and have it thoroughly understood that this part of the work was not included in the Tender. This man was not the man who figured the work, but was the man in charge of the work on the building. He was told the fixtures in the building at that time were of no use, and he went right on and put in the proper new material, which was made up mostly of new lamp cord, sockets, insulating joints, R. L. Balls chain and labor to put these up, as we understood the fixtures for the main building and basement comprised mostly cord drops, and this was what the material was used for, and bill for same we sent you, and are again attaching a separate bill for the extras, showing the different items used for this purpose.\n\nRegarding the Panel Board, the inspector thought the old one would do, but it was found out during the work that it would not answer, as Mr. McVitty knows. In making up the new bill for extras we have included the labor and board separate with the work of installing the Panel Board. You will therefore see the balance of the extras are not a big item.\n\nIn the first place the contract was altogether too low, and if you had other figures we feel sure you will find that we took the job altogether too cheap. However, this is our loss, and we are not asking anything more on the contract, but we do ask to be paid for the extra work done on which we did not figure. Even with the contract and extras combined the whole job is only a little over six hundred ($600.00) Dollars, and we assure you this is very low, and would not leave us any profit at the full price.\nWe trust you will take this up with the Department at once and trust they will see their way to pay our claim in full at once. This work has been done many months, and in addition to the amount the interest on this amount would be quite an item, which naturally makes it all the worse.\n\nIn addition we paid the Railway charges and also the inspectors' time several times in order to give you a thorough report and to see it was done properly, for which no charge was made by us.\n\nTrusting you will give this your immediate attention we beg to remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before doing this, however, it will be necessary to amend one of the items which is evidently a clerical error, viz., board 4 days man and helper $7.50 per day = $30.00. This should be explained and the error corrected.\n\nWhen your reply has been received the matter will be given immediate consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Dr. Sands wrote you she was unmanageable. That is not her trouble. Ward is sixteen, his mother died when she was a baby, and there was no one to give her the care she needed, when she entered her teens. And so she got from five to ten days before her mind and during her period of illness, he became partly insane, and is not accountable for her actions. As she grows older and stronger, I think the black spells will gradually grow less. For eighteen days when she was under the spell, I never went to bed, not knowing what would happen, but when the spell passed, a better-balanced girl came.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Susan M.

General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWe have just about completed our water system. I am sending you, under separate cover, sketch showing extent and character of work done. Everything has been purchased save gasoline engine, and I would greatly like the consent of the Department to use our present engine as indicated, and apply the price of a four horse engine, on the purchase of a Delco Lighting System to be used in the Main Building.\n\nThe system will cost $600.00 installed. We will pay the $300.00 out of school funds. To install, we will simply connect at switch entering the Main Building, and will not disturb wiring in any possible way. We would use present dynamo for street and barns and engine for pumping water.\n\nMy reasons for suggesting this change are as follows:\n\n1. During the dark days we need a few lights in lower kitchen, halls, and girls' playroom all the time. This means lighting and carrying around of lamps by the pupils.\n\n2. So need a few lights in main halls all night. This means lamps, matches, etc.\n\n3. There are times, especially in cold weather, when it is difficult to get the gas engine started promptly in the morning. This, again, means running for lamps, etc., and once in a while the engine will stop, belt slip, or some other little thing happen when pupils are coming in to supper, and, again, it is\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 3)\nTamps, matches, etc.\n\nAll this greatly increases the danger of fire. In matters of fire in a building of this kind the great concern must always be prevention.\n\n1. To run the big engine just for a few lights is too expensive.\n2. Our present dynamo is 110 volt; and this would mean a very large and expensive battery, if we attempted that solution. Besides, the Dynamo has been running steadily about eight years, and of course will soon show effect of wear.\n\nThis all brings me back to the purchase of Dolco plant as the best and easiest solution. It is fully guaranteed, will be installed on free trial, will give all lights necessary for Main Building. It's storage battery provides 20 lights for 16 hours - more than we would ever need. It will cost about one-half for running expense. It will greatly reduce risk of fires by doing away entirely with matches and lamps. It will not cost the Department any more than to purchase engine for pumping. We will provide the extra $300.00\n\nI know of several Dolco plants lighting farm premises, and, in every case it is giving best of satisfaction. They use a low voltage lamp, but offer to exchange lamp for lamp with us.\n\nOur large engine would run barn lights from 7 to 8 am., and from 3 to 6 pm., and at same time pump all water needed.\n\nI hope I have made the matter sufficiently clear, and that the Department will approve of the suggestion, and, at least, permit a two weeks trial pf plant, as suggested by the Dolco people.\n\nPleased to say our total expenditure for water system will not exceed amount appropriated.\n\nI am, Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted, however, that no provision has been made for outside fire-hydrants for the protection of the building, into which the water can be pumped direct in case of fire, although this may have been arranged for by you, but not shown on the plan.\n\nA report showing the completed work to date, with the results obtained, should be at once sent in that the conditions may be fully understood.\n\nWith reference to the lighting system in the school, I quite understand that night-lights would be an advantage, and as it is believed the lighting system proposed would supply these more economically than to provide storage batteries in connection with\n\nRev.

Ingram and Davey & Co., Thomas, which account is dated the 5th February, and is for galvanized tank etc., installed at the Mount Elgin Institute. Kindly see that details of the charges of $23.40 and $17.56 respectively in the said account are furnished. This is necessary for purposes of audit.\n\nI also return Messrs. Ingram and Davey's account, (one copy) of the 25th January, and I beg to point out that the addition thereof is incorrect. According to the figures shown in your account the total amount should be $207.06 not $237.06. Kindly have the necessary correction made.\n\nI may add that the charge of $28.85 for installing second hand closet etc., appears high. The time the men were employed and the rate charged by the hour for their work should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The fences will have to be put up before the cattle get out, as all our wheat and spring crops turned to dust, yet we will of course do the building which will cost us several hundred dollars but much work the Dep.\nOttawa, April 12, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, in which you report that when the big ice jam in the river at Dalhousie gave way it swept away practically every rod of fence on the river flats in connection with the Mount Elgin Institute and state that you will do the building of the fences, but must ask the Department for a grant for material.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may expend the amounts mentioned by you for the necessary posts and wire for rebuilding the fences, viz., $100.00 for posts and $200.00 for the wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to official letter No. 13001/3 dated 16th inst., I permit me to say I fear I was not explicit enough in my request for rope for hay forks. I think we are quite clear in our understanding that all buildings, farm, etc., are the property of the Dept. All live stock, farm implements, tools, grain, etc., belong to the school management. When new barns were erected the contractor supplied ear tracks, rope, etc., as part of barn equipment, for these the Dept. paid and they are your property. All are in splendid repair, save the rope which has broken several times and is thereby very dangerous, and cannot possibly be used again, the risk is too great.\n\nIf we were terminating our contract with the Dept. there would be no thought whatever of taking any part of barn equipment with us. Why should we be asked to purchase it now. I am sure the Dept. does not want to discriminate against us in any way. Some few years ago the Dept. refused to place desks in our new school-room and thereby put the school management to about $200.00 unjust expense. These desks are fastened to the floor and are part of the building as much as doors are and should be paid for by the Dept. same as you are doing in other schools of this kind. All we ask is a square deal and I feel sure that after looking into the matter you will not only authorize purchase of necessary rope but also ask for bill of desks paid by us some time ago.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before making the purchase you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers and purchase from the one quoting the lowest price.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose you a communication addressed to the Secretary of the Department from Mr. McVitty re their needs at Munsey. What they really require there is the Carpenter Shop fitted up. He estimates this at $2000. I think this would make a very good job of it.\n\nThey also need a building for a Boys' Playroom, and an Assembly Hall above it. The cost of this would be about $10,000.\n\nThe supply of drinking water, too, is not at all satisfactory. It is pumped into the Building by a hydraulic ram. The supply is not sufficient at times to keep the ram working. The result is inconvenience for the want of pure water. I have suggested to Mr. McVitty that a grant of $500. ought to be made for the digging of a well and installing a pump. The depth of this well is quite problematical, but I think that it ought not to have to go deeper than the bed of the river for a good supply, which would be about 60 feet at the most.\n\nThere should also be a grant made of about $500. for general repairs.\n\nI trust that this programme will receive the best consideration possible in the next estimates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF.MT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir James Lougheed -\n\nThe Mount Elgin Industrial school, situated at Muncey, Ont., is the property of the Department. I may state that some of the Indian bands of Ontario contributed towards the cost of erecting the original building. This school serves the Methodist children of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec as well as some others. It is a very excellent school, one of the best conducted in the country.\n\nThe principal has asked for the erection of a combined workshop and play-house at an approximate cost of $10,000.00, or as an alternative proposition an expenditure of about $2,000.00 on their present workshop, which would provide for a new foundation, flooring and siding inside and out.\n\nWhile I recognize the great need of the combined workshop and play-house, I do not consider this an opportune time to undertake any extensive building. I am, however, disposed to comply with the principal's request and make the necessary repairs to the present workshop. The building is a splendid frame and if properly repaired now would serve its purpose for many years. The principal, Mr. McVitty, is a thoroughly practical man and I feel confident that the repairs, if authorized, would be carried out in a most satisfactory manner. I would, therefore, ask for your authority for the expenditure of the amount above mentioned, payment to be made from the school appropriation for the current year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 17, 1920.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nWith reference to the repairs required to the present workshop at the Mount Elgin Industrial School, I beg to advise you that you may carry out the repairs as outlined in your letter of October 27th. The cost of the work must not exceed $2000.00.\n\nWhen purchasing any materials required for the work, competitive prices must be obtained and submitted to the Department when sending in the accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nReverend S.R. McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMuncey, Ont.\nRe: Supply of Water.\n\nAs the supply of water from the south hydraulic ram has failed, it is necessary to use the water from the west hydraulic ram for drinking and culinary purposes. This supply is not adequate for all purposes, and it cannot be safely increased by the water in the stock watering tanks. The water in these tanks, though apparently excellent, I do not think that it would be safe to mix it with the water from the hydraulic rams. I would, therefore, respectfully recommend that a well be sunk in the school yard and the water from it used to supplement the supply from the west.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of August 11th, I beg to advise you that the Department approves of the necessary repairs being made to the generator used in connection with your electric lighting plant. It is noted that the estimated cost is $500.00. You may also carry out the minor repairs to floors, screen doors, windows and curtains, hinges, at an estimated cost of $100.00. If any materials are required, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. G.H.

I regret to report that we found much more needed than we had anticipated. Outside stairs leading to the Senior school room, also the one leading to the Officer's dining room are quite unsafe and will have to be replaced by new ones. Several window and door arches have loose bricks, and the foundation of the upstairs pantry is bulging out and must be replaced. Some plumbing is needed and quite a bit of eavestroughing.\n\nWe found wire on door and window screens old and broken. Practically the whole building has had to be done over. We deemed this absolutely necessary owing to a serious epidemic of typhoid in vicinity. We want to make every portion of the building nearly fly proof as possible. There are 100 typhoid patients in the Hospital for the Insane at London at the present time, and many deaths. So we are having all water tested before the return of pupils September 1st.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We did not get the work done before winter set in, and cannot do it now, so hereby request that we be permitted to use the money to purchase material for new floor for our laundry. The present floor is very old and sagged in the centre, resulting in laundress and girls standing in water most of the time.\n\nOur plan is to put down a first class floor, slightly elevated in the centre, with a suitable gutter around the outside. This would insure dry standing place for those working. The cost will be about $200.00 for material, and not above $250.00.

Our own man has done his best. The local agent has been here twice and says it is beyond him, and advises calling an expert from head office Toronto. I have taken upon me to do this, as the present lighting is impossible.\n\nSometimes right at supper, or when whole school is assembled for homework, we are plunged into darkness, and then you can imagine.

The need is very great. I could mention a large number of children in this part of Ontario who are really neglected. Several of them children of ex-service men. We are overcrowded here now, and cannot admit anymore.\n\nMr. Abraham has already taken or sent up to the Soo about fifteen pupils, who really should be under our care. It is a long way to send them, and cuts them off from their own people.\n\nMr. Ferrier's estimate of $75,000.00 is too high. Building is much cheaper, and I am quite sure a suitable building could be erected for $40,000.00. We do not need a palace, but comfortable suitable quarters. The superintendency could be carried on from this office, without additional expense, and the resources of our farm and farm equipment would be available at first cost.\n\nIndian Affairs.

R. McVitty, Principal\n\nMuncy, Ont. May 4th, 1922\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring a recent visit of Mr. Russel Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, we went over with him a large number of items needing attention at the Mt. Elgin Institute. Much more needs attention than we at first thought, and that notwithstanding the fact that we have already expended the amount authorized by official letter No. 155001-5 dated April 11th.\n\nBoys and girls dormitories need burlap and paint, also both main halls. Plumbing in both sides needs considerable attention. In several places the eavestroughing is entirely gone, and the water running down the walls and into the basement. There's much plastering and brick work needing attention. The total necessary expenditure for upkeep will be at least $1000.\n\nMuch of the work is that of an expert tradesman, and cannot be done by the school. I would request therefore that these necessary expenditures be authorized, competitive prices secured, and the work done under the supervision of your local Agent or myself, and all accounts submitted to the Department for payment.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours etc.\n\nS.

May 9th, 1922\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I respectfully urge upon the Department earliest possible action on my request of the 4th instant, for the following reasons?\n\n1. Our policy of doing without things ever since the early days of the war has let the school plant go down below par.\n\n2. The good name of the Department, who owns the buildings, is at stake as well as ours, and from present indications we are going to have a lot of visitors this summer. The General Protestant Ministerial Association of the city of St. Thomas and neighbourhood, with their lady friends, purpose visiting us about the middle of June. We also expect a large number of visitors attending the Methodist Conference in London. Also a Convention of Indian workers later on in the summer.\n\nIf permission is granted, we would do our utmost to have these repairs attended to before the folk visit us.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. R. McVitty\nOTTAWA, May 11th, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letters of the 4th and 9th instant, requesting certain authority in connection with the repairs needed at the Mount Elgin Institute. You may arrange to have the repairs to the plumbing and sewers-toughing attended to. This work should be done as economically as possible and in the purchase of materials the instructions in official communication of the 11th instant should be observed.\n\nYou are authorized to have minor repairs of this type attended to at any time. Accounts, properly certified and in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI have noted that your estimate for the total expenditure in connection with upkeep will be in the neighborhood of $1,000 for this fiscal year. This includes an item of $300 authorized by communication of the 11th instant. The Department cannot give you further authority for major repairs, such as building or painting of dormitories and halls, and general repairs to the plaster and brick work. For each of these two requests, you should forward separate estimates as to the amount of material required, and the cost of the outside labour that you will have to hire. Authority can then be granted, if the Department sees fit for such item, and no accounts of considerable size will be presented at one time.\n\nYou should keep a personal supervision over the work being done, and make every effort to keep the expenditure as low as possible. The Vote for Indian Education has been largely assigned for the coming fiscal year, and all work must be performed as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

At that time I pointed out to the Department the advisability of having the metal ornaments on top of each of the three towers grounded by suitable wire. No steps were taken to do so. This summer a prominent builder was visiting us and was amazed that we should allow a day to pass without having ground wires attached. We did not in any way draw his attention to the matter.\n\nOn Wednesday night last, a furious electric storm swept over this District. The main tower was struck and quite shattered. This took place in the night. Fortunately it did not catch fire, else the building would undoubtedly have been destroyed and possibly some lives lost.\n\nWe notified the Insurance Company; Repairs should be made soon as possible, and most assuredly the wiring should be done at earliest possible moment.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Manager of the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society has written to me regarding the building used as an industrial and residential school by your Department situated on the Mount Elgin Industrial Farm, Township of Caradoc, County of Middlesex. I understand that this building has been struck by lightning and the Manager suggests that the building should be equipped with a lightning rod.\n\nThe rodding of buildings for protection against lightning has received attention of this Department for some time, and we are fully convinced of the adequacy of the protection thus afforded.\n\nThe loss of farm buildings in the province of Ontario during the last two or three years has been a very serious drain upon the agricultural portion of the community. So far as the insurance people are concerned their rate is varied to meet the hazard so that it is not a material consideration from their standpoint what the losses are. There is, however, the loss to the community from the needless destruction of property and the loss to the individual over and above the insurance because, as a rule, farm buildings are inadequately insured.\n\nI thought I would write you regarding the matter in order that if you are considering the question you might be able to have this building more completely protected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Insurance.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institute,\n\nI have been to Muncey in connection with claim for damage by lightning to the building insured under the above numbered policies. I have made arrangements with A.H. Ponsford, contractor of St. Thomas, to repair the damage immediately.\n\nAs this building was struck in precisely the same place something over a year ago I think that it would be a necessary precaution for you to have this building properly equipped with lightning rods otherwise there might be a serious conflagration or probably loss of life as the building apparently is in an exposed position and the tower with the iron finial seems to attract lightning.\n\nIf you decide to have the lightning rods put on I would be pleased if you would advise me as soon as possible as the Insurance Companies are somewhat anxious.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRTO/AS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You might do well to inquire from these dealers if any is still available. If this fails you, the best procedure would be to communicate direct with the F. P. Weaver Coal Company, of 263 St. James St., Montreal, who are offering carload lots of Pennsylvania crushed Anthracite, also from buckwheat up to $5. The union this last time quoted is $4.50 per ton. Mine has been obtained. If you are unsuccessful in securing the coal desired at a later date this Department might be of some assistance. We might arrange to purchase for you, and the expenditure would be deducted from the per capita grant.\n\nI have yours of the 9th instant, informing the Department that the Delco batteries are no longer of any value. If you will offer prices from the local agents and from the Delco Products Co., 175 King St. East, Toronto, this Department will submit them to the Purchasing Commission for Mr. McVitty's use and instructions will be given without delay. The Deputy Superintendent General has authorized this expense, in view of your urgent representation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. S. R.

In this connection, I intend to place before our General Board of Missions the advisability of a building being constructed on the Muncey Institute property, believing that such an institution could be managed much more economically by the staff of that Institute than by any other provision that might be made at present. The overhead charges for the managing of such an institution would be largely met by its being connected with, and under the management of the Principal of, the Muncey Institute.\n\nI am taking this course, believing that such a proposition would meet with the approbation of the Department of Indian Affairs. If there are any objections that could be offered to this plan, would you kindly favor me with the same. Such would prevent any wrong impression being conveyed to our General Board of Missions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Some of these are children of deceased soldiers.\n\nWhen the matter of providing such a residential school was under consideration by our Board of Missions at its recent session, a resolution was passed endorsing this proposal and urging upon the Department of Indian Affairs the necessity of establishing such a school at Muncey as soon as possible.\n\nI trust that this matter will receive the favorable consideration of the Government and that an appropriation of from $35,000 to $50,000 will be made at the next session of Parliament to erect such a school.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.

Two of these were in the building before the two new wings were built, and the Principal informs me that they did very good work for what was expected of them at that time. When the new wings were built the one on the North end had a furnace installed to heat the new portion. The South wing was plumbed up and connected with the two furnaces that originally heated the older part of the building. The result is that during cold weather and high winds the portions of the building where the wind strikes are not even habitable. During the time I was there the Principal's private rooms could not be used, and the Principal's wife informed me that ever since the South wing was built the only place she had where she could sit in comfort was the office, beside the stove that has been installed there.\n\nPennsylvania coal is being burned in the Institute and all that the furnaces will take was crowded into them during the time I was there, and I am free to say that I discovered it is absolutely impossible to heat the buildings. I could make recommendations as to what could be done to ensure proper heating, but as it is near Ottawa, I think it would be well to send an expert to look over the whole situation and let him suggest the best solution for the entire problem of heating.\n\nA system of lockers in the Boys' Playroom, in which to keep school clothes in order that they may change before going into the classroom, is a necessity. - Estimated cost about a couple of hundred dollars.\n\nA portion of the staff kitchen and pantry is a small\naddition to the rear of the building and is cracked from the main building and bricks and stones are tumbling out of the end of it. It should be pulled down and a larger addition built in its place. This larger addition might comprise a pantry and staff dining-room. If this were done, the present staff dining-room could be used for a staff sitting-room, which they are without at present. - Estimated cost about $1,000.\n\nA new three-even range is required in the pupils' kitchen. - Estimated cost about $600.00\n\nAnother matter that should receive the attention of the Department is the condition of the road just at the point where the School farm and the Reserve meet. There is a sharp turn there, which is very dangerous, the grade being very high and the road being narrow, and at the present time covered with slush. There is a great danger of autos and rigs slipping off into the ditch. It might be well for the Department to communicate with your Agent regarding the matter. The estimated cost would be about $300.00.\n\nThe old building that is used for two dwellings, hospital quarters and one class-room should be renovated, and one end of it, where a family now dwells, could be added to the hospital accommodation. This would give ample room for all the sick. When I was there a number were ill with the \"flu\". It would have been better if some of the worst cases could have been isolated from the others. I suggest this change inasmuch as the Agent is occupying one end of the building, and I understand the Department is contemplating building a home for the Agent in the village of Muncey. When this move takes place, the renovation and changes could be made. - Estimated cost about $250.00.\n\nIf it were possible, I would like to have in the supplementary estimates an item of about $5,000.00 for Muncey.\n\nThere are a number of improvements that can be made by new furniture and new machinery on the farm, which have been postponed during the last few years on account of high prices. I feel sure that the Management is prepared to spend between $3,000.00 and $4,000.00 in this direction, and I hope that the Department will be able to provide the above sum, so that a thorough job may be made of the heating plant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 4)\nOttawa, March 3, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. Mr. Ferrier has made certain recommendations involving an expenditure of roughly $5,000 at the Mt. Elgin Institute. He has been informed that, at the present time, the Department is not prepared to ask for a supplementary appropriation for Indian education, and that the improvements to the heating plant and the addition at the rear of the building may have to be postponed until the next calendar year.\n\nIt may be possible to find funds for certain other requirements mentioned by the Rev. Mr. Ferrier. Will you please report on the need of a system of lockers in the boys' playroom and estimate the probable cost. Further, intimate whether the present range in the pupils' kitchen will meet the requirements for another year, or until funds can be provided.\n\nIf a residence is provided for the Indian agent and the old building to the rear of the institution is entirely released for school purposes, the Department would like an estimate of the cost of renovation. A communication is being addressed to Mr. Agent McGookin, relative to the road at the school corner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. B. R.

I have noted that roughly $5,000 is required for plant at this institution.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that it is not the present intention of the Department to ask for a supplementary appropriation for Indian education for the coming fiscal year. It may be necessary to postpone the improvements to the heating plant and the addition to the rear of the building, until the next calendar year. In the meantime, the Department Architect at the first opportunity will visit Muncey and will inquire into these needs.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. McVitty is being instructed to make recommendations in connection with a system of lockers in the boys' playroom and a kitchen range, and I am writing to Mr. Agent McGeekin regarding the road at the school corner. Further, if a residence is provided for the agent, arrangements will be made for the renovation of the old building in the rear of the institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Our promotion and High School Entrance Examinations are fully equal to those of neighboring \"White Schools.\"\n\nThe Government and the Church are showing us every consideration, and have already planned large improvements for next year, but what fills our hearts with hope is the really marvelous awakening of the Indian people themselves to the advantages of a higher and better education. Many Indians have seen and felt this for years. All seem to see it now. Several boys who ran away from school years ago have recently returned of their own accord, and are earnestly seeking an education.\n\nThe time has come for a real advance; but there must be perfect understanding and agreement as to methods. We have decided therefore to hold a Conference on Indian Education at this school on Thursday, June 28th, commencing at 10 o'clock a.m.\n\nWe hope to have a representative each from the Government and the Church, and most cordially invite each Indian Council in Ontario and Quebec to send a delegate, a forward-looking man, who knows what his people want. We will entertain these delegates well, show them the school as it is, and then sit down together and plan how to make it better.\n\nOn Friday, 29th June, we will hold a great School picnic on the School grounds. There will be refreshment booths, games, speeches, community singing, band music, and lots of other good things. Just one whole day of feasting and fun. At its close pupils can go home for Summer holidays.\n\nAll \"Old Pupils\" are especially invited. Come and meet your school friends of other days.\n\nYours for better times,\n\nS. R.

Additional Hospital accommodation is absolutely necessary. We are greatly handicapped for lack of room during present epidemic. Then our heating apparatus, good as far as it goes is quite inadequate, especially since the South Wing was added. We are using a number of stoves all over the building, some of them attached to ventilating flues which were never intended to be used as chimneys.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that the Dep. send up a competent man to look over the situation, at as early a date as possible. Possibly Mr Orr could add this to his next visit to Brantford.\n\nHoping for an early and favorable consideration of whole matter,\n\nI am Dear Sir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nS. R.

If fire took place, and lives were lost, all concerned would be called upon to face a very serious situation. Then again we are violating every rule of the Underwriters Association.\n\nWe will continue to exercise every possible precaution, and will remove all stoves at earliest possible moment, so as not to give the Dep. any undue anxiety, but \"never again\".\n\nHaving placed this matter fairly and honestly before you, the responsibility must rest where it properly belongs.\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(see your letter of Oct. 11th 22 which was the best you could do for us and brought no results). It was absolutely impossible to get it. We did secure two cars of semi-hard rubbish for which we paid $7.00 per ton cash, and now we cannot get even that and have been compelled to accept a car of soft coal at $15.00 in car lot. The result of it all is that with present furnace capacity driven to its very utmost, we could not keep the building above freezing point. We have been forced therefore, to erect stoves in different parts of the building, some of which are attached to ventilating flues into which timbers protrude. The danger of fire is so great that I have made a personal inspection of the entire building last thing almost every night this winter.\n\nWe have in all about sixty cases of \"flu\", a large number have developed pneumonia. Some no doubt as result of the coldness of their dormitories. A few are in the hospital, and some boys of over 15 years have been moved to the south side and are being nursed in same ward with girls of similar age.\n\nIndian Affairs.

March 1st, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWhile at the Junoey Institute recently I had occasion to go over the school and I felt sure that I found the children in good healthy condition with the exception that there was an epidemic of flu. The dormitory and school rooms were clean and tidy and the dining-room was also in first-class condition.\n\nWhile inspecting the Girls' Sewing room Mr. McVitty pointed out that the steam heating system was not adequate to bring the heat in the room up to the point where it would be safe to keep the children in and he pointed out an auxiliary stove which he has placed in the room. This stove vents into the school ventilation system. I consider this a very dangerous thing as, if the pipe caught on fire there would be nothing to prevent the building from burning up as the floors and other timbers protrude into the ventilation system. If the building burned down from this cause, we would not be able to collect any insurance as this is strictly against the policy of the Insurance Company.\n\nI would recommend that the next time Mr. Scott visits the Institute, that he visit the Junoey Institute and make a report in regard to this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. H. Abraham\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.; Litt., D., R. H. Abraham,\nDept. Supt. Gen. of Ind. Aff., Agr. Rep. Dept., I. I. A.,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI hereto report that in Wednesday, 28th instant, in accordance with your instructions, I made an inspection of the heating system at the Mount Alvin Institute.\n\nThe building is heated at present by a hot water heating system in which three Jurney-Oxford cast iron sectional boilers are used. Two of the boilers used in the main building are located at one end, and the third is located in the addition, and, owing to the great length of pipe it is impossible to satisfactorily heat the institution. In many of the rooms the temperature cannot be kept above the freezing point. I may say that during my visit yesterday, the weather was very cold with a strong wind blowing and I found practically the entire building very uncomfortable, although good fires were being kept in the heating boilers.\n\nFor an institution of this kind hot water is not the most satisfactory and economical system of heating. The only way to provide this building with an adequate heating system would be to convert the present hot water system into a low pressure steam system. In doing so, all of the existing radiators and most of the piping could be used. It would be necessary, however, to provide a new boiler room in the center to the rear of the main building, and install a steam boiler. A new chimney would also be required as the existing ones are altogether too small to provide the necessary draft for the boiler.\n\nWith reference to the boiler-room, I would say that the institution are rather cramped for accommodation in the way of staff living rooms and suitable sleeping quarters for Indians who visit and remain over night at the institution. If the new boiler room was erected, the additional accommodation could be very economically provided over the boiler room.\n\nThe estimated cost of placing in this building a satisfactory system of steam heating would be approximately $1000.\nThe Reverend Principal has advised me that unless some arrangement is made to heat the building next winter, it will be impossible for him to keep his staff, also that there has been considerable sickness at the institution during this winter which was caused by the present unsatisfactory heating system.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, April 5, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nRelative to funds for a new heating system at the Mt. Elgin Institute, I beg to state that I have discussed with Mr. Orr the possibility of postponing a certain building activity at another institution, and I believe funds can be found for the required work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School\nS.

He made a very careful examination of the whole situation, and no doubt his report will reach you in due time. May I respectfully emphasize the following facts-\n\n(1) I do not think it would be possible to retain our staff another winter under present conditions.\n\n(2) Our recent \"flu\" and pneumonia epidemic will cost the Dep. about $400.00, besides the suffering of the pupils and the great tax upon the school staff. It was at least intensified, if not actually caused by coldness of their dormitories.\n\n(3) The only place to which our Officers can take a friend is their bed rooms or the staff dining room. When parents come from a distance to see their child-ren, we have no sleeping accommodation for them, and same is true of threshers and others who remain over night. All this could be easily remedied by adding two stories above the proposed heating plant.\n\nWe are hoping for a very favorable consideration of these facts. This school is serving a very large constituency and its failure would mean much.\n\nI am Dear Dr Scott,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS. R. McVitty\n\nIndian Affairs.

And here is the answer.\n\nThe big answer.\n\nIts Wherefore\n\nHERE then, is a Cast Iron Twin Section boiler with a 50 inch grate, that is just the thing for low pressure, heavy duty jobs that have always been met with tubulars.\n\nNo need to point out to you that they cost less and do more than tubulars.\n\nThey do more on less coal.\n\nThree men can erect this Twin Section Boiler quickly on account of its sectional construction.\nThe Twins\nTheir Ease of Set-up\n\nOne of the twins, or half sections, doesn't weigh as much as a full section of our regular 10 inch Boiler. You know what that means in ease of handling and set up. Always, two men with a monkey wrench and a screwdriver have been able to set up a 30 incher.\n\nOne man more is all you need with this Big Twin.\n\nThere are no right and lefts to the twins. The one section, by turning, is either a right or left.\n\nThink what that means\u2014no chance of mix ups. No getting of a section up on the base, only to find out it's wrong.\n\nYou can't go wrong on our Twin Boiler. The twins are nipple connected at top and sides and joined at the rear with a 3 inch pipe. See Page 10.\n\nErection starts with the front sections. A seal-tight-strip goes over the space between the sections on the front and back, making a finished air-tight job.\n\nThe sections are twins and so are the grates. Although the grate surface is 50 inches wide, no single grate is longer than 24 inches.\n\nThink what that means in ease of handling, ease of set up and ease of replacement.\nThe Economy\n\nMules, boilers and automobiles are a good bit alike. They each have their balky points. For example; many an auto maker who had a wonderful engine of a certain given cylinder bore, when he increased it, the power developed was not in proportion.\n\nThe old law of diminishing ratios started in upsetting things.\n\nThere is a point where a boiler can be too large, as well as too small, to be economical. Mr. Burnham has been designing boilers for over 40 years. It's as much a hobby with him as golf is to others. When he started designing the Big Twin, he figured that the closer he stuck to the proved economy features of our single section Boiler, with its side flue openings and three times back and forth fire travel, the better the boiler would be. Some of us wondered if he wasn't making it so big that Old Man Diminishing Ratio might step in. But Mr. Burnham has a boiler sense, that's so sure it's almost uncanny.\n\nHe declared it would steam better than any boiler he had designed.\n\nAnd it does.\n\nIt's tests showed a very high evaporative power per pound of coal burned.\n\nShort Tie Bolts\n\nEach section is snugged-up to its neighbor by short tie bolts.\n\nThere are two at the top and one on each side.\n\nTheir arrangement is shown in the line sketch below.\nShort Grates\n\nOne of the best features in this Twin Section boiler is that each twin has its own twin grates. Take a look at the illustration above, and you see that each grate bar extends only half the width of the boiler. The base divisions show the width of a single section. Each division carries four grates, two on either side of the centre support.\n\nThe grates on each side work half at a time or four shakes for the whole shake down.\n\nHere at last is the solution to warping grate bars on big boilers; also the difficulty in handling one huge bar weighing never less than 100 pounds, making replacing a most difficult task.\n\nThese bars weigh not more than forty pounds and are only 24 inches long.\nThe Rear End\n\nAll operating parts even to the damper handle, being on the front of the boiler, there is nothing on the back but the reversible smoke box and the connection pipe between the section twins, which equalizes the two sides of the boiler.\n\nThis pipe is equipped with a draw-off plug.\n\nSmoke Box Reversible\n\nBy simply loosening four lugs, the smoke box can be swung around so the pipe can be connected at either side as well as at the top. By shifting the damper plates it can be connected at the back.\nTherefore\n\nHere, then, is just the boiler for apartment houses, moving picture theatres, schools, churches and public buildings where tubular boilers have been used.\n\nBeing made in sections, no special opening has to be left in the building for its installation. It costs considerably less than tubulars. It will do everything a tubular of same capacity will do, and do it on less coal, and with less attention.\n\nIt has lower upkeep with its total absence of tube replacements and the long life of the short length twin grates.\n\nIn making these flat comparisons against the tubular, we can do it with perfect consistency as we make tubulars. It always has been our policy, however, to sell a man the thing that will best serve him.\n\nFor low pressure work from 4,000 up to 20,000 square feet of radiation, the Cast Iron Twin Sectional Boilers, we heartily recommend.\n\nA Few Installations\n\nA Particularly Interesting Installation Instance\n\nIt might be of interest to you to have a non-technical report upon the performance of your 50 Series, 9 Section Low Pressure Steam Heating Boiler, rated at 9775 square foot capacity which I recently specified for the Ballaglia Theatre, Troy, New York.\n\nThe heating proposition is installed as a Dunham Vapor System with indirect mechanical heating for the Auditorium, employing plenum chamber under Automatic Control.\n\nHeated air is discharged through Bicakly Mushroom heads located in Auditorium floor, and ventilated air is removed by Bicakly Roof Pan Ventilators.\n\nThe fifteen heating stacks containing 1000 square feet of heating surface through which steam is forced by blower. Approximately 3000 square feet of direct cast iron, wall and floor type radiation is used throughout theatre proper and apartments included in this Theatre Building. For the above system I required a free steaming boiler.\n\nThis heating plant has been run on two ounces of vapor. The automatic damper regulator has been set at this point and the pressure so maintained. I have run the steam pressure up to 8 pounds in 15 minutes by opening up drafts on the boiler, with full load of direct radiation on.\n\nThe performances of the boiler are very satisfactory as to\u2014\n\n1\u2014Fuel Consumption\n2\u2014Steaming Capacity\n3\u2014Delivery of Dry Steam\n4\u2014Steady and Copious supply of steam\n5\u2014Extreme simplicity of running and controls\n\nAs to quality, design and workmanship the boiler is high class throughout; your grate design is extremely good, making replacement of grate bars, when required, remarkably easy; arrangement of flues and fire travel speak for themselves in performance of boiler.\n\nCastings throughout are true and very heavy.\n\nThe six section, same type boiler installed at this plant has not been required as yet, although we have had below zero weather.\n\nWhen the indirect stack is used excessively, possibly the service of this other boiler may be required.\n\nTrusting that the above facts may be of interest to you, we are,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) R. W. M. CLARKE\nTerms and Shipping Information\n\nTHE BOILER PIT To obtain the best results it is advisable, whenever possible, to deepen the Ash Pit, either by making a raised foundation under the boiler or by excavating and making a brick or concrete floor under the boiler. This will permit of better draft and consequently improve combustion. Such a sub-pit will also prevent, to a considerable extent, any chance of the grate bars burning out, due to the accumulation of ashes.\n\nGUARANTEE These boilers are guaranteed only to the extent of furnishing new castings for any found defective in manufacture. They are conservatively rated according to accepted standards, but on account of the varying conditions surrounding their installation, we do not guarantee our boiler except as specified above.\n\nSHIPMENT Boilers are shipped from factory. We deliver everything in perfect condition to the freight companies. Our customers must look to the carriers to recover any loss or damage to castings. Do not pay the freight until you have examined the goods and checked up quantities. If any damage or shortage, insist on Agent writing it on your receipt.\n\nREPAIRS When ordering repair parts it is important that you give us the Serial Number of the boiler. This will avoid delay in filling the order and will insure the correct pattern being sent.

We asked the Department to add to this extension a second and third storey. To this you consented. Your architect pointing out at same time that the loss of light and ventilation to portion of main building covered by the extension was a serious matter.\n\nA visit to the Mohawk School last week convinced us that we were making a mistake. Light and ventilation are a necessity. We now request that you dispense with the second and third stories requested and use the cost of same, say about $2900.00 in making following absolutely necessary repairs to present plant:\n\n1. To eavestroughing on main building. In many places water is streaming down the walls.\n\n2. New floor in pupils dining room. Present one has been down 28 years.\n\n3. Raise laundry chimney about 12'. No draft at present.\n\n4. Clean up and plaster room where old hot water boilers stood, making it a play room for small girls.\n\n5. Certain other minor repairs such as plastering, papering, etc.\n\nTotal not to cost more than the estimated cost of two stories now discarded.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS.R.

I saw it again shortly after, and it was running as usual. Next thing we knew it was a wreck. On taking it apart we found a broken pin in the piston head had caused the trouble.\n\n(1) The batteries recently purchased are alright.\n(2) The machine itself was an early type and imperfect.\n(3) It has been in constant use for seven years.\n(4) We paid $600.00 on original cost out of school funds.\n(5) The plant would have had to be moved into new building, so all things considered it might be worse.\n\nWe have shipped the remains to Electric Systems 173 King E Toronto. We would suggest that a new generator be purchased, the remains of which could be applied on price of same. We would greatly appreciate your action as darkness is disastrous here.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. R. McVitty.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The workmanship and material so far installed are in full accord with the specifications, and the Reverend Principal is well satisfied with the conduct of the men about the building.\n\nAn effort is being made to have the boiler set up and connections made in order that the building can be heated by the middle of next week.\n\nArchitect.\nMemo: Mr. MacKenzie.\n\nWith reference to Mr. McVitty's telegram received last week, regarding the Electric Light Plant at the Mount Elgin Institute, I beg to say that the Delco Plant which has been in use for several years is completely worn out, and it is necessary to have same replaced by a new outfit. Mr. McVitty asked me, if at all possible, to arrange to have some equipment installed other than the Delco as this firm have given him no service since the outfit was installed.\n\nIn company with Mr. McVitty I visited in London the offices of the Canadian General Electric Co., the Northern Electric and the Fairbanks Morse Companies, and found that the Fairbanks Morse Co. were the only firm who were in a position to install immediately a new plant. I therefore placed an order with them for a Gasoline Engine and Generator. This outfit will be considerably cheaper than the Delco plant which was formerly installed, simpler in operation and will I believe have a longer life and give better satisfaction. They promised to ship the plant from the Toronto factory immediately, and have it installed at the school today.\n\nIt is important that the installation be made as soon as possible as the school is without light and it is very dangerous to have the children going about from room to room with lamps.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 5)\nOctober 10th, 1926\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have just recently visited the Mount Elgin Institute at Nancey, and find that a very serious situation has arisen regarding the water supply.\n\nAs the Department is no doubt aware, the water for the main building, the laundry, and all that is required for the stock in the stables, has been supplied by tile drains which drain the land over hydraulic rams, and the supply has been sufficient for the last sixteen or seventeen years. This year the rainfall has been very light, and every drain but one has dried up, and this one has such a small stream that it is not sufficient to keep the ram in operation. The result is that all the water that is required for the Institute for every purpose has to be hauled from the river, which is proving a very laborious method of supply. If rains come early this fall, and in sufficient quantity, the situation may be remedied. This, of course, is problematical.\n\nOne of two methods might be adopted for furnishing the water supply. The first would be to install a pump in connection with the river water and pump the supply from the river. The second would be to bore a well. I have made inquiries regarding deep wells and visited the one nearest to the Institute, which is two miles away. This one is 207 feet deep. If a well were bored, the gasoline engine now installed in the laundry would solve the problem of power. The cost would be the boring of the well and installing of a pump. By this method the tanks that supply the main building could be reached through the present stand pipe, and the water required for the barns and stables could be pumped into the tanks that have been in the past supplied by hydraulic rams, the water graduating from these tanks to the barns.\n\nI would like to hear from the Department concerning this matter, for I fear the result of having\nto face winter in such an Institute with no other method of procuring water than by hauling it from the river.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Ferrier\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Oct. 23, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, reporting on the water supply at the Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department is asking the Rev. Principal to secure an estimate of the cost of having the well bored and a pump installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, Oct. 23, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. T. Ferrier has drawn the Department's attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the water supply at the Mt. Elgin Institute. I should be pleased if you would have an estimate prepared, showing the cost of having the well bored and a pump installed. The Department understands that the gasoline engine, now installed in the Laundry, would furnish the necessary power for the operating of a pump. You should also indicate whether this method of securing a supplementary water supply is recommended by yourself and the local experts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. S. B. McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMt.

Some are beginning to fear that either the Chicago drainage scheme or recent earth shocks have something to do with lowering the water about 10'.\n\nHoping for a return to normal conditions we have been drawing water from the river for several weeks, but as yet no sign of improvement. All ordinary wells in the district are dry. Deep wells, about 200', are still efficient.\n\nHave consulted deep well borers. Had one come here. All think water can be secured at 200'. They are all so busy it seems almost impossible to get a well down at present, but would like permission to take such steps as necessity may demand, still hoping that a good rainfall may restore normal conditions.\n\n1. We could use present engine and stand pipe.\n2. A well costs about $5 per foot.\n3. I presume a pump would cost a couple of hundred dollars. All would depend on depth of well.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We would like to have these Clauses interpreted by the Department.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDOUBLE\n\nFor Use in Hotels, Boarding Houses, etc.\n\nPARTICULARS:\n\n| No. | Size of Foundation | Size of Firebox | Length of Wood Firebox | Height to Cooking Surface | Cooking Holes | Shipping Weight, Square Inches |\n|-----|--------------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n|     | Inches             | Inches         | Inches                 | Inches                   |              | Lbs                           |\n\n159-50 24x21x14 49x35 46x21 17x13 7 25 30 6x9 745\n259-50 24x21x14 96x35 95x21 17x14 7 25 30 12x9 1,510\n\nFull Covers or with Ring Cover over fire, and French plates.\n\nFor dimensions and instructions for ordering, see page 10.\n\nKE 8\nCONSTRUCTION:\n\nBody: The Body is constructed of Heavy Steel Plate specially selected and tested. To assure rigidity the Body is reinforced with angle iron and closely riveted with steeple-headed rivets driven cold, by hand. The inside of the body and the outside of bottom is alumized, preserving the steel from rust.\n\nCooking Surface: The Top is of heavy Cast-iron, solid and durable\u2014the surface doubly burnished by the McClary special process.\n\nFirebox:\n\nGrates: The Triple-Bar Grates are powerfully constructed to meet the intense heat and hard wear to which they are subjected. Made from our specially moulded cast iron\u2014three-sided so that the side can be used separately, thus prolonging their life threefold.\n\nLinings: The linings are of pure firebrick, a fabric with extraordinary power of resistance against the destructive effects of the gases from the coal. The bricks are standard size; when worn out after years of service they can be immediately replaced with bricks available locally. Skilled help is also unnecessary when replacement is being made.\n\nOvens: The top of Oven is provided with a heavy cast-iron stiffener, which adds to the rigidity of the entire Range. The bottom of the Oven is of heavy-gauge steel.\n\nOven Door: The Oven Door is made from Heavy Steel Plates with wrought-iron frame, reinforced at corners, which hold it firm and rigid. As will be seen from illustration, the drop type is used, with heavy, well-made holders to enable the door, when open, to withstand any weight required of it.\n\nDoors: All other doors are of well-finished cast-iron mouldings and are carefully assembled to swing easily and fit snug when closed.\n\nBottom: The Bottom of the Range is constructed of Heavy Steel Plate, riveted and securely bolted.\n\nSmoke Box: The Smoke Box is bolted to the body, thus it can be readily removed when it is desired to move the range through an ordinary sized doorway.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nThe Army is built on the principle of one oven to one firebox and can be supplied with any number of units to meet the largest requirements. Each unit\u2014the oven and firebox\u2014can be fitted solidly together with a special plate provided for that purpose. The top of the Army is interchangeable, the number of covers or French Plates provided at the discretion of purchaser.\n\nThe Burnished Top: The special burnishing process which the cooking top undergoes, renders the surface free from any irregularities and ensures a clean, bright, sanitary surface. The process also toughens the material and gives an extremely well finished surface, pleasing to the eye. A glance at the measurements will demonstrate the exceptional size of the cooking surface\u2014this is a feature much appreciated by the chef and his helpers.\n\nA large sectional ring cover immediately over the fire is supplied with the French Plate top\u2014this permits a utensil of any size to come into direct contact with the fire.\n\nOvens: The Oven is well proportioned and uniformly heated, interior well finished and smooth.\n\nAn additional reinforcement for the top of the Oven is provided through the lining of same with highest quality asbestos. This asbestos is heat-resisting and protects the steel top from direct contact with the heat\u2014it thus prolongs the life of the steel and also tempers the heat when it is at its greatest intensity, so it insures from the firebox.\n\nFlue Construction: The flue construction effectively carries the heat all around the oven. The heat passes over the top of the oven, down the end and the inside of the bottom, passing up the flue at the back of the Range\u2014top, side, bottom and back are, therefore, evenly heated.\n\nEverything in the Army Range is rigid and tight-fitting\u2014there are no loose joints, as they are made perfectly tight with Asbestos Wool; this effectively prevents escape of gases, fumes, etc.\n\nThe Range is operated from the front, and dampers are so provided as to be easy of access to the operator.\n\nThe Cooking Surface of the Single and Double oven Army can be supplied with full covers or with ring Cover over fire and French Plates.\n\nFor dimensions and instructions see page 10\n\nKE7\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School\n\nS.

This is so small we have to run it continuously, and it is already showing bad effects.\n\nDon't be in any hurry settling with Sagette for heating. Have had first real test this cold snap, and it is not very satisfactory. We won't complain until we are sure the fault is not in operating.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the outfit that we decided, when I was last at Muncey, would be best suited for your requirements.\n\nWhen the account is forwarded to you for this plant I would ask you to please certify to it and forward it to me. I explained to the representative here that the account should show the cost only of the plant they are now installing, and that no notice is to be taken in making out the account that is to be presented to the Department of the plant first installed. I would be glad to hear from you as soon as they have made the change if same is satisfactory.\n\nI notice your remarks with reference to the heating plant and I am sorry to hear that it is unsatisfactory. When I made the last inspection of this work it appeared to me that everything was in good shape, and I cannot see why the installation is not giving good satisfaction. If there is any trouble it must be some minor detail that can be very easily overcome. I understand that Mr. Baldwin of the Dunham Heating Co., Ltd., inspected this work and was well pleased with the installation. I will withhold final payment from the contractors until I have heard from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMount Algin Inst.,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nR.

These Ranges are heavily constructed to stand the hard usage in the large kitchens of Hotels, Clubs, Restaurants, Steamboats, Camps, and Institutions where the quantity of work to be done is heavy, they have gained for us the reputation of being the best Range of their kind, Manufactured in Canada, and have many distinctive features which are found on no other make of French Ranges. Built for up or down draught. The bodies are built of the best quality heavy Sheet Steel, with Top Frame and Panels of the best quality Heavy Grey Cast Iron. The sides of ovens next to the firebox are heavy cast iron, which do not burn through as found with the steel side ovens. The Sliding Dampers which operate from the front below the ovens allow you to regulate the heat in the ovens just as required. The Fireboxes may be fitted with our flat sliding, or oscillating grates both for hard coal as shown on page 9. All fire-boxes and flues are lined with the best quality Fireclay Bricks. Ranges are supplied with double High Shelf or High Closet as desired.\n\nWaterfronts are fitted, not on the side of the oven, but across the back end of the fire-box, which is a decided improvement, as the side waterfront invariably spoils the adjoining oven for baking purposes.\n\nIllustration of our Standard Waterfront is shown on page 9 and has heating capacity for a fifty gallon boiler. All Ranges larger than No. 20 are composed of separate sections of 4 feet each, having 1 fire and 1 oven 22x28x16 inches. Trimmings are finished Bright Steel or Nickel Plates as desired.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, requesting authority to have several rooms in the main building at the Mowin' Kl, In Indian Residential School papered, the cost of which, as stated by you, will not exceed approximately $150.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work done. You should purchase the paper and other material required, competitive prices, if possible, being obtained. The work should be done by any labour, and, if necessary, the services of a competent man may be engaged. The staff at the school should assist as far as possible. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for all labour employed. It is, however, understood that any work done by the staff or pupils will be without charge to the Department. Under no circumstances is a contract to be let for the performing of the work, as it would be necessary to obtain an Order in Council approving of the same. You will be good enough to see that the work of papering the rooms and any cleaning required is done as cheerfully as possible.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the paper or other material, and time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Our men and boys, all paid by the school, are very busy in harvesting and could not possibly undertake the work. It really needs expert workers, and I would therefore suggest that if possible the Department send up a man to look over the whole matter or else make a reasonable appropriation and have it done by day labor. I will gladly give my own services free of cost and if required will superintend the work, purchasing all material at competitive prices and keeping time sheets of labor.\n\nHoping for earliest possible action,\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Some parts have never been painted during the fifteen years we have been here, others look quite faded.\n\nFor sanitary reasons, for economic reasons, and because the visiting public always expects a Government owned plant to be strictly up to date; I must earnestly request the Department to authorize a much more liberal grant than we asked in our former letter.\n\nI make all the more free to ask this since I have just learned that a class of eleven pupils sent up for high school entrance have all passed, several with honors. Our promotion examinations this year showed marvellous success in class room work, and we have secured the services of a third teacher for next year at a cost of about $1000.00. We are steadily aiming at better things, and feel sure the Department will be a willing partner to a really great forward movement in our school work.\n\n(1) All six dormitories need a coat of paint.\n\n(2) The senior school room needs one coat of paint, and the junior and intermediate rooms two coats each.\n\n(3) Both play rooms need two coats of paint.\n\n(4) The prayer room needs one coat of paint.\n\n(5) The hospital needs a coat and the portion of the old building or the annex which we purpose turning into additional hospital space, needs some burlap on the walls and two coats of paint throughout.\n\nIndian Affairs.

An atmosphere of comfort and progress is in evidence in every department which I have time and opportunity to investigate. Yet while every attention is being made by the management to secure the intellectual welfare and health of the resident pupils, I would be remiss in my duty if I failed to point out the very inadequate provision for preventing loss of life in case of fire.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott;\n\nIn the hope of securing a more prompt reply I am venturing to approach you personally on a question of vital importance to our school.\n\n1. The tremendous slump in the price of farm produce is cutting our income almost in two. Which means either a less efficient staff of teachers and instructors, or a lower standard of living for the pupils, as I am warned by Dr. Manning that missionary money is very scarce, and there is little hope from that source.\n\n2. We have a splendid herd of about 60 T.B. tested dairy cows, and are forced to sell our cream for a mere trifle above cost of production. Yet really first class butter is difficult to obtain, and still a high price. We have no dairying facilities other than that used on an ordinary farm. I would like very much to start a small creamery of our own for the following reasons.\n\n(1) We would reap the full profit from our herd.\n(2) We could afford to give our pupils more butter than at present.\n(3) We could manufacture our skimmed milk into cottage cheese, which would make an excellent extra for pupils' table.\n(4) We could give our girls a thorough training in first class butter making, and would greatly please the hundreds of farmers and farmer's wives who visit the school.\n\nThe cost of equipment would be about as follows:\n\n(1) Small boiler $250.00\n(2) Churn and worker $200.00\n(3) Vat $125.00\n(4) Refrigerator $400.00\n(5) Some sundries $25.00, about $1000.00 in all.\n\nI think we could make the boiler serve the purpose of the domestic heater promised us by Mr. Orr, and which would cost about $125.00, and the school has been in need of a refrigerator for years. So these facts taken into account the cost of dairy would be about $300.00. The other things we should have in any case.\n\nOur school is filled to capacity. Prospects brighter than ever. We have a splendid staff, and now just ask what help can you give us in this proposition.\n\nHoping to receive your very generous consideration,\n\nI am, Dear Dr. Scott,\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. R.

McVITTY, Principal\n\nMuncey, Ont., October 17th 1924\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe are in very great need of a cold storage plant of some kind for preservation of milk, butter, and meat during the warm weather. We have nothing whatever of the kind, save a small refrigerator for the upper kitchen.\n\nWe are compelled all through the summer to pay retail price for meat, and yet have lots of cattle we could slaughter if we had suitable cold storage.\n\nI drew the attention of both Mr. Ferrier to this condition, during their recent visit. Rev. Ferrier recommended a certain type of building that would cost for material about $500.00 Other men who have large experience say they would prefer a Grocer and Butcher refrigerator, that would cost about $300.00. The refrigerator would use less ice, and would serve our purpose. But our need of either one is urgent.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McVITTY, Principal\n\nMuncey, Ont., October 17th\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nDuring Mr. Perrier's recent visit to our school I drew his attention to the fact that the four soft water tanks in pupil's dormitories are leaking. Three of them are entirely out of commission, which means there is no water for washing in pupil's lavatories, save as it is carried in in pails.\n\nI have asked for competitive prices on 18 gauge galvanized tanks, 5 feet in diameter by 7 feet in height. Lewis and Holmes, St. Thomas ask $75.00 each tank, F. O. B., St. Thomas, and Messrs Brownlee of London, $50.00 per tank, F. O. B. London. There will be a little extra for connecting up.\n\nI would recommend that the latter tender be accepted, and the tanks installed as soon as possible.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 5)\nOttawa, October 20, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the renewing of the four soft water tanks in the pupils' dormitories at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of 4 new tanks and the installation of same. We note that you have obtained competitive prices and that the lowest price received is that of Messrs. Brownlee, of London, who quote $50 per tank, F.O.B. London. The Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $225 in the purchase of the tanks and the cost of connecting them up with the water system. When the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the tanks and the work of installing the same.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date regarding the need of a cold storage plant for the preservation of milk, butter and meat during the warm weather. We note that you prefer a grocer and butcher refrigerator, that would cost about $300. We have no funds available at the present time, but you should bring this matter to our attention early in March, next, when consideration will be given to the authorizing of having the refrigerator installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Ferrier states that it is necessary to the satisfactory conduct of the school that a supplementary water supply be provided.\n\nYou are authorized to engage a competent driller, who will dig a 4 inch well and provide casing, at $2.50 per foot. You may also have a drop pipe and working barrel with fixtures complete installed, at an estimated cost of $1.35 per foot. It is understood that you will be responsible for fuel for the drilling engine and for the board of the men who are engaged in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to the well that you were authorized to have sunk some time ago, I beg to advise you that the Architect of the Department, who visited your institution yesterday, has reported that it would be much more satisfactory to install a larger pipe from the existing water supply to the building and place the pump on the building end of the supply pipe.\n\nThe question of sinking a well and finding water is very uncertain, and in all probability after expending money on the sinking of the well it would prove unsatisfactory, whereas the installation of the larger pipe, as mentioned above would give us good water supply system for the building, leaving nothing in doubt.\n\nIt is noted that you are installing a two inch pipe from the well to the school, at a cost to the Department of 60 cents per foot.\n\nYou may, therefore, proceed with this work and endeavour to have same completed before the ground freezes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McVITTY, Principal\n\nMuncey, Ont., January 15th 1923\n\nIn reference,\n\nGovernment of Canada, Affairs,\n\nIndian, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a request to make. We have been purchasing clothes and\n\nlinen, which have been supplied for laundry room to date, (I think)\n\nbeen purchased at 14 cents each and delivered at 16 cents\n\neach. I have heard from some friends that there is a new and more\n\nefficient method, yet cheaper in expense.\n\nI have seen such machines used out in the\n\nEast River town full. They cost a trifle over $30.00 each,\n\nI believe. Their price was much lower than competitors.\n\nWill you kindly authorize purchase of one,\n\nto conduct our Laundry until it is installed.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS.R. McVitty\nOttawa, January 17, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the present condition of the galvanised tank which holds the water supply for the laundry at the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School. It is noted that you request authority to purchase a new tank, as the old one is completely rusted out and is not worth the expense of repairs.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a tank of the same type as Messrs. Brownlee installed in the dormitories. We note that the cost will be slightly in excess of $60.00 for 16 gauge iron and that this price is much lower than that of other dealers. Please forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase. If the school staff are unable to install this tank, you may engage the services of a competent man to do the work. Time sheets in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. S. R. MoVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMt. Elgin Res. School,\nMuncy, Ont.\nMount Elgin Institute\nMuncy, Ontario\nJanuary 29th\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAt the time of our diphtheria epidemic last fall the disease invaded the house of our farm instructor. One of his children took it, then his wife who died in a few days leaving him with four small children.\n\nWe have done all we could to help him out, paying his funeral expenses and etc., and he has bravely carried on. His children have been scattered among relatives since their mother's death, and I believe there is a chance of getting a housekeeper and wishes to see his children here again.\n\nI was all through his house today. It really needs repainting inside and outside. Not only because it is so shabby, but with a lot of loose paper it is most unsanitary. There would be much risk to his little children returning, and through them to the whole school.\n\nThe kitchen has never been plastered. Just bare lath, and the living room floor is wretched. Pine boards about 10\" wide, which have been in use probably twenty years.\n\nI would respectfully request therefore, that for sanitary and economic reasons a new floor be put in the living room, the kitchen plastered, the inside woodwork painted, and the walls covered with a clean serviceable paper. The total cost not to exceed $200.00.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Indian Residential School. In reply I have to authorize you to expend the sum of not more than $200 for interior decorating and for a floor in the living room.

Our second farmhouse has been vacant for about two years and was sadly out of repair. Windows broken, paper off and generally dilapidated. I felt I could paper the downstairs, parlor, diningroom and kitchen, and still keep inside our grant of $200.00.\n\nWe would have been able to do so, but alas, soon as we began to clean off the dirty old paper, down came the plaster ceiling in both parlor and diningroom.\n\nWe purchased a beautiful fir ceiling for both rooms as per invoice for $32.00. Put it on, shellaced and varnished it. The expert labor doing so was $20.00, making an outlay of $50.00 more than grant. But we have made a splendid job of both houses instead of one. Both are now occupied.\n\nHad I stopped to get the extra authorization the trip back would have had a second trip to and from Glencoe, about twenty-two miles.\n\nFor approval, I am, etc.,\n\nS.R.

There is no drainage whatever from girl's outside toilet, which means a miserable cess pool at times. 30' of 4\" tile should be put down connecting with main sewer.\n\n2. A frame garage stands in girl's play ground. It is unsightly and too near main building. It provides a shady corner for dark evenings. It should be removed to a suitable place, put on a proper foundation and painted.\n\n3. An outside slop basin for the lower kitchen is too near door. It should be removed 50' and connected with main sewer by suitable trap and tile.\n\n4. Board fence 6' by 130', separating girl's play ground from wood and laundry yard is completely down and out. It should be replaced by a new fence.\n\n5. Thirty rod of wire fence enclosing orchard, bee and poultry yard has served over 20 years. It is completely done, and should be replaced with hog and cattle proof wire fence.\n\n6. A large wood shed attached to laundry building should be straightened, and put on blocks, and the side facing the main building painted. Also some repairs to roof, which is leaking badly.\n\n7. The posts bearing clothes lines in the laundry yard should be replaced. Several are down and wires sagging.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret that I cannot authorize any expenditure in connection with labour and for all materials required for the work you have outlined.\n\nYou are authorized, however, to purchase 360 ft. of 4\" tile for the drainage from the outside girls' toilet and from the outside slop basins. A suitable trap may also be purchased for the basin. You may secure 1000 ft. of lumber suitable for fencing the girls' playground and 30 rod of hogproof wire fence for the orchard, etc. The other materials needed, as well as all labour costs, will have to be met from per capita grant or other funds. Before making purchases, please secure competitive prices, and when you are submitting certified accounts, in duplicate, in favour of the firms awarded the business, support them with memos showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Perhaps\nusing a Steam Pipe and Receiver.\n\nMr. Laughton was looking to see if we could find it and he\nthought it might be better to put on a new Attic Vent Box in place\nof the old one and connect up the two (2) pipes in the\nSouth School room and connect up one more pipe (to new dormitory)\non the ground floor on the backside.\n\nWe propose to furnish and install one (1) 7\" Round Hot-water\npipe in place of present boiler coil and boiler connection and new supply\npipe to the three (3) radiators, same pipe to same coil length for\na sum of $23.00\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A steam-fitter from London has offered to do the work complete for $523.00. Our Mr. Orr recommends that authority be directed.\n\nNo funds were specifically provided for this replacement but as they can be found, I wish to recommend that the expenditure be authorized.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have also received a communication from Eppett & Co. of London, in which they offer to supply and install, one No.7, round hot water boiler, covered with asbestos cement and equipped with new stove pipes to connect up the three radiators and cover pipes to same with hairfelt - all for the sum of $525.00.\n\nYou may accept this offer and when the work has been satisfactorily completed, submit a voucher in duplicate showing in detail what has been done for the price agreed upon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

Before we can place an order for the new desks required, it will be necessary for you to state the sizes and the number of each size required. I enclose herewith for your information a page from a catalogue of manufacturers of school desks which will show the sizes and ages of the pupils each size will accommodate.

They are now using several tables, and double desks to augment present seating. This greatly spoils the appearance of the class room, so will not require any rear seats for this room.\n\nWe need six rows of seats for Intermediate room, each row consisting of seven seats each.

Eggett and Co had a little latitude in material and time in bringing the job up to date, believing that they had spent the time specified in account and supplied the fittings charged I.C.K. their statement, without reading a second time the original authorization. I now find the contract was quite specific. It was from a hurried reading of the closing paragraph I got the impression.\n\nI took the account as returned, up to Mr. Eggett himself, and asked him to take it up with the men. He now returns the amended account which I herewith submit.\n\nWhen they informed me that the north school must have two additional radiators to bring it up to standard; I believed that it was the intention of the Department to have the heating made satisfactory, so told them to go ahead and do so. I knew perfectly well that if they once quit the job it would be very difficult and much more expensive to get them back again. And what is even more important this furnace heats two class rooms, hospital and Mr. McCookin's residence, all of which were being used without heat and were getting to be extremely cold.\n\nOur mechanic and I have gone over the work and find he extra fittings charged have been supplied and were absolutely necessary. Time charged was excessive, but when we remember that these workmen brought out these heavy radiators in their own car, one each morning; thereby saving freight and time and certainly endangering their car, it mitigates the offence.\n\nI do not believe Mr. Eggett was a party to the excessive charge, and most certainly I was not. It got past me.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He thinks our fire protection is not at all up to standard for a building in which 150 people sleep.\n\nWe have gone over the matter very carefully together, and both think that in addition to the very strict preventative measures carried out by our staff, (I make a personal examination of kitchens and furnace rooms almost every night before retiring,) the Department should place about one dozen good sized fire buckets and about half a dozen fire axes in certain strategic parts of the building, and about half a dozen substantial flash lights at the doors of officer's rooms, in case of wiring be destroyed by fire discovery of fire.\n\nThese articles to be strictly the property of the Department and to be used in emergency only. Our safety lies in prevention and we must be prepared to meet an incipient fire, once under way we would be absolutely helpless. The fact that a store and residence in our village were wiped out Saturday morning, the house occupied half naked, makes us a bit nervous.\n\nWe also need some repairs for cow stanchions in barns, some glass, locks, electric bulbs. About $100.00 in all.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of November 17th, last, requesting that a supply of desks be furnished to complete the seating equipment in the senior and intermediate rooms in the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, I beg to say that we are placing an order with the Glove Furniture Co. Ltd., Waterloo, Ont., to ship addressed to you at Muncey, via C.P.R., the following school desks, viz:\n\n- 22 No. 1 Single School Desks,\n- 12 No. 2\n- 12 No. 3\n- 2 No. 1 Rear,\n- 2 No. 2\n- 2 No. 3\n\nThe total aggregate price quoted by the above firm F.O.B. Muncey, Government sales tax included, is $302.16. The desks will be shipped in a knocked down condition, all parts complete. Ink wells are to be supplied with each desk.\n\nThe above firm have been requested to forward their account, in duplicate, to you, and when the desks arrive, if in good condition, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nThe above order includes 10 No. 1 desks for the senior room and sufficient desks for 6 rows of 6 desks each with rear seats for the intermediate room. I would suggest that the desks for the intermediate room be arranged with 2 rows of No. 1 desks with rear seats, 2 rows of No. 2 desks and 2 rows of No. 3 desks. It is hoped that these desks will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. P. R. McVitty,\nPrincipal\nMount Elgin Indian Res. School,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAast.

I believe it could be turned upside down and rebottomed at about one third the cost of a new tank.\n\nOur mechanic can save connections, but could not do the rebottoming. I would greatly appreciate authorization to have this work done at once. Our needs for domestic purposes and fire protection are very great.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The fencing on such a large farm subject to Spring flood is necessarily a large item. The item of glass is comparatively small with so many children and so many windows. The lumber is for pupil's boxes in both play rooms, for certain doors and stairways. The fairly large item of paint is intended to cover downstairs kitchen and dining room, boys and girls play rooms and dormitories. We think this is necessary for sanitary reasons as well as for general appearance and upkeep of building. The stove lining is for double range in pupils kitchen. We have been forced to use soft coal, which has entirely used up present linings. All work will be done by the school and strictest economy exercised.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institute. As you have been informed, our funds are extremely limited and I regret it is not possible to authorize the purchase of all the materials listed by you. You may purchase wire, staples, nails, posts and slats to repair the fences and a lining for the kitchen range, at an estimated cost of $87.50.\n\nThe Department does not allow glass for repairing windows. We ask the school management to make replacements in this connection. I regret that I cannot authorize the lumber, paint and other items at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. D.

Mr. McVitty's letter of the third of May and the Department's reply of the 7th regarding the necessary repairs to the Mount Elgin Institute, I beg to report that I was at the Institute on Monday of this week and Mr. McVitty showed me where the repairs were needed, and I would certainly recommend that the items as mentioned in his list be authorised. Some of the rooms are very badly in need of repairs to the plastering and painting. They expect to receive several important delegations at the Institute this coming summer and are very anxious that the building present a neat and tidy appearance. I explained to Mr. McVitty that funds were very limited but he stated that if these repairs were allowed that he would not press for the ice house, for which provision is made in the estimates to the amount of $1,500.00.\n\nThe amount of material necessary for the repairs would cost approximately $200.00 and the school, of course, would perform the necessary labour.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, May 17, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 3rd instant and my answer of the 7th inst., Mr. Orr reports that there are special reasons why it is advisable to undertake all the repairs at this time. The Department was considering the provision of an icehouse, which, I understand, can be postponed. Some funds are therefore available and you may purchase the materials listed under cover of yours of the 3rd instant, after securing competitive prices if possible. The glass for windows cannot be allowed. Your estimate of $211.50 should not be exceeded, if possible. It is understood that the labour will be without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. S. A. McNally,\nPrincipal,\nMt.

This would take the place of a private plant, and would be much less expense to the Department all things considered, than supplying and keeping in shape a Deice or Turbine-Horse system.\n\nThe cost to the school would be about $95.00 per year, which is less than cost of oil and fuel for present plant, and of course the service would be very much better.\n\nI presume the present plant could be dispensed with, save the batteries which are about done and would have to be replaced this fall. I think the cost of batteries alone year in and year out would be quite equal to the service charge asked by the Hydro people. And then every few years a new generator and engine would have to be provided.\n\nThe Hydro people undertake all responsibility for service for $64.84 per year, and we pay for current used, about $16.00 per year. I think the proposed circuit would be very beneficial to both the Department and the School management, and I sincerely hope we can get it through.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 468-5, part 5)\nUsers of power in your township will be required to sign a contract with the Township, and may choose, with certain limitations, classes of service outlined as follows:\n\nClass I - Hamlet service includes service in hamlets, where four or more customers are served from one transformer. This class excludes farmers and power users. Service is given under three sub-classes as follows:\n\nI-A Service to residences where the installation does not exceed six lighting outlets or twelve sockets. Use of appliances over 600 watts is not permitted under this class.\n\nI-B Service to residences with more than six lighting outlets or twelve sockets, and stores. Use of appliances over 750 watts permanently installed is not permitted under this class.\n\nI-C Service to residences with electric range or permanently installed appliances greater than 750 watts.\n\nSpecial or Unusual loads will be treated specially.\nClass II - House Lighting - Includes all contracts where residences cannot be grouped as in Class I. This class excludes farmers and power users.\n\nClass III - Light Farm Service - Includes lighting of farm buildings, power for miscellaneous small equipment, power for single phase motors, not to exceed 3 Horse Power demand, or electric range. Range and motor are not to be used simultaneously.\n\nClass IV - Medium Single Phase Farm Service - Includes lighting of farm buildings and power for miscellaneous small equipment, power for single phase motors, up to 5 Horse Power demand, or electric range. Range and motor are not to be used simultaneously.\n\nClass V - Medium 3 Phase Farm Service - Includes lighting of farm buildings and power for miscellaneous small equipment, power for 3 phase motors, up to 5 Horse Power demand, or electric range. Range and motor are not to be used simultaneously.\nClass VI - Heavy Farm Service - Includes lighting of farm buildings and power for miscellaneous small equipment, power for motors up to 5 Horse Power demand, and electric range, or 10 Horse Power demand without electric range.\n\nClass VII - Special Farm Service - Includes lighting of farm buildings, power for miscellaneous small equipment, power for 3 phase motors from 10 - 20 Horse Power demand, and electric range.\n\nClass VIII - Syndicate Outfits - Includes any of the foregoing classes which may join in the use of a syndicate outfit, provided the summation of their relative class demand ratings is equal to the Kilowatt capacity of the syndicate.\n\nThe estimates on the cost of power delivered to users as herein set out as been based upon certain assumptions, some of which are as follows:\n\nThe construction of the lines shall be undertaken and paid for by the Commission. The farmers in the vicinity of the roads along which the lines pass will assist in the construction and assistance will be paid for at a suitable rate of wage. Lines constructed from the line on the highway to customers' premises will be paid for by the\ncustomer. The Commission proposes to supply the necessary expert labor to direct the construction of the lines and the installation of the equipment. It has been assumed that three farmers per mile of line, or the equivalent, are obtainable as an average for the entire district to be served. The supply of poles at low prices in the district or the vicinity of the district by efforts on the part of those desiring service will result in the reduction of the cost of construction and corresponding reduction in the cost of service. Co-operation resulting in the reduction of cost of construction is desired. The rates herein set out are also based upon a government bonus of 50% of the cost of primary lines constructed on the highway or along the right-of-way.\n\nCharges for power delivered shall consist of two parts, namely, the service charge and the consumption charge. The service charge which constitutes the greater portion of the total cost of power delivered, consists of the operating, maintaining and fixed charges of the lines and equipment required to deliver the power to the users in the district. Consumption charges will be determined by a meter at each customers' premises, which will measure the quantity of power used to which a suitable rate will be applied. This cost can only be arrived at when the amount used has been determined. The rate used in the district will be determined by the cost of power at the transformer station supplying the district. The amount of power supplied to the district will be metered at the transformer station.\nThe meter rates for users in that part of your Township which will be supplied from are estimated as follows:\n\n1. 6\u00a2 per Kilowatt hour for the first 14 hours use per month of customers' class demand rating.\n\n2. 4\u00a2 per Kilowatt hour for all remaining uses.\n\nLess 10% for Prompt Payment.\n\nThe following table gives class demand rating, average monthly kilowatt hours, estimated consumption charge, estimated service charge, and total estimated annual cost for each class:\n\n| Class Name          | Demand Rating | Average Monthly K.W.H. | Est.

They have been adjusted by applying the rates as set out herein.\nFor those unfamiliar with terms used in power measurement, it is to be noted that one Kilo-watt (K.W.) is approximately equal to 1-1/3 horse power (H.P.) or 3 K.W. equals 4 H.P., and a kilo-watt hour (K.H.W.) is the amount of electricity equivalent to one kilowatt used for one hour.\n\nThe rates will be re-adjusted by the Commission from time to time in your district to cover cost. Increase in the average number of farmers per mile or lower cost of power will reduce the annual costs to all.\n\nThe Commission upon request by your Council will send a representative to explain the method of rendering service to rural communities, and will assist your Council in securing contracts with individuals desiring service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Engineer\nHYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER COMMISSION OF ONTARIO\n\nRURAL POWER DISTRICT CORRESPONDENCE\n\nDelaware R.

The Class 4 Contract enclosed will provide sufficient power to take care of all Lighting and small motors or range at Mt. Elgin Institute. Mr. has signed this as Consumer and will pay the Commission for all current used.\n\nIn view of the Institute being slightly over one Mile from Muncey Village to which place the Farmer's Contracts will carry the line it will be necessary for me to provide for that distance in the way of a Primary or Guarantee Contracts which takes care of Primary line without Transformers or Secondary wiring. The amount mentioned on the other enclosed letter of $84.84 per year provides for only one mile of line which would not reach the Institute, therefore one more Primary Contract will cover the distance. Mr. McVitty has not signed these Contracts since no charge for current is made on them.\n\nYou will find this a permanent and economical provision for Lighting at the Institute and will save money in the provision for Electric Lights.

We purchased the roofing and cement at wholesale price, (Account enc'd) This work is now completed and is a first class job. We have built splendid fence around yard and scales, and still have a small balance on hand. A little more than enough to build houses over run pits.\n\nMr. Sexton, Public School Inspector, has just paid us his official visit, and seemed to think there is great need for interior repairs, such as painting boys dormitories, ceiling their reading room, where plaster is nearly all off the walls. Also other minor repairs. The main hall on the north side has not been touched since we came here and is filthy. It needs some burlap and a coat of paint. There is also considerable plumbing needed in the laundry.\n\nWe also need some extensions to our lighting system, giving us light in the yards around main building.\n\nOur mechanic and his boys are already doing this most necessary work, but the bill for material will possibly run up an extra hundred, or hundred and fifty dollars, which I hope the Department will authorize.

In other respects it is the same except that the motor is 1/3 H.P., instead of 1/6 H.P.\n\nIt is automatic, self-oiling, runs easily and quietly and is made so that all valves are accessible. Crank pins are on a 90\u00b0 angle making any dead centres on the plunger stroke impossible.\n\nIt is supplied with either 42 or 82 gallon (wine measure) tanks. It is a splendid pump for clubs, school houses, apartment houses, barns or large residences where water up to 1,200 gallons (wine measure) are required daily. This pump will supply a full stream of water to a garden hose nozzle, wide open, to a distance of 35 to 40 feet.\n\nThe Duplex Pneumatic Pump is supplied connected to a 7-gallon tank in the same manner as the Fig. 1394 Pneumatic Pump as illustrated on page 88. When the Duplex Pump is supplied in this way it takes the figure number 1417. See Table below.\n\n| No. | Size of Motor | Capacity of Pump per Hour | Capacity of Tank | Suction Inches | Discharge Inches | Height Inches | Width Inches | Depth Inches | Code Word | Weight lbs |\n|-----|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------|\n| 1414|               |                           |                 |                |                |              |             |             |          |            |\n| 1415|               |                           |                 |                |                |              |             |             |          |            |\n| 1416|               |                           |                 |                |                |              |             |             |          |            |\n| 1417|               |                           |                 |                |                |              |             |             |          |            |\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRatchet Handle Hydro-Pneumatic Force Pump\n\nFig. 1410\n\nSpecifications are as follows:\n\n- 1-in. x 4\u00bd-in. Brass Lined Cylinder; brass valve seats, and rubber faced valves. Tapped for 1\u00bd-in. suction and discharge pipes; 9 16-in. solid brass piston and heavy brass stuffing nut, suction and discharge pipes can be attached to either side of the pump. Ratchet handle reduces the power required to operate 34\u00bd p.c.m. Fig. 1410 is double acting.\n\nAll air valves easily reached by removing the air dome which is located directly over them, and without disturbing either suction or discharge pipe. Cylinder heads and air dome are attached to the pump by through machine bolts and can be entirely dismantled with an ordinary wrench.\n\nThe air valve is attached directly to the cylinder head, through which air is admitted direct to the body of the pump and forced into the pressure tank through the regular water line, doing away with all independent piping. To regulate the amount of air in tank open air shutoff valve as shown.\n\nNote the support under Cog-gear handle bracket. This is a wedge-shaped flange, connecting to a flange plate located on the floor. This forms a complete support against any strain from pumping. This flange adjusts itself to the pump by sliding backwards and forwards.\n\nThe table below gives the sizes and capacities of our black tanks, suitable for use with this pump.\n\nElectric Welded, Hydro-Pneumatic Black Tanks\n\n| No. | Capacity (gal.) | Size (in.) | Cost (W.) |\n|-----|----------------|------------|-----------|\n| 101 | 5              | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 80             | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 106 | 100            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | Black          | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | Galvanized     | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 150            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | 200            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | 250            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 300            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | 350            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | 400            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 450            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | 500            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | 550            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 600            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | 650            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | 700            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 750            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | 800            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | 850            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 108 | 900            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 109 | 950            | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n| 110 | 1000           | 12 x 10    | $1.10     |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Motor, switch, pump and pressure tank are all mounted on the one base with no protruding parts. Thus vibration is reduced to a minimum, less space is required for installation, and the appearance of the outfit is considerably improved. The solid base and rigid construction of the pump throughout insure long life and freedom from trouble. Piston rod and stuffing nut are brass. Cylinder is lined with seamless drawn brass tubing.\n\nOwing to the high rate of speed of the pump (220 revolutions per minute) a small belt wheel can be used. The belt wheel on the Beatty Pump is only 10 inches in diameter and the pump is much more pleasing in design and much more convenient for home installations than pumps with the large belt wheel.\n\nAs an additional precaution, to insure long life to the system, a safety valve is provided on every pump to protect the pump from undue pressures. Suction strainer in the pump protects it from sediment in the water.\n\nThis system is virtually automatic. It can be installed in the cellar or some other out of the way place and left alone for weeks at a time. A little oil now and then is all that is required to keep it in running order.\n\nNo cheaper, more satisfactory system has ever been devised to provide water on tap for rural homes.\n\nPneumatic Pump with Stand, Motor, Switch and 7-Gallon Galvanized Tank, Fig. 1413.\n\nThe pumping unit used in Fig. 1413 is Fig. 1394, which has already been described on this page and page 87.\n\nFig. 1413 is made for the purpose of replacing the troublesome water motor when used for pumping from a cistern. It also works well for a small, portable pumping unit at a summer home or camp, because the pump has large enough capacity to supply a 1/2-inch pipe with a continuous stream of water.\n\nThe outfit comes complete. The connections between pump and tank are all made. All that is needed is to make the two pipe connections\u2014one to the source of supply and the other to the distributing lines from the tank. The brackets can be either fastened to the floor or attached to the wall, as conditions demand.\nOct. 25, 1927.\n\nMemorandum Dr. Scott.\n\nAs you know the Ontario Hydro Electric Power Commission have run their power line to Muncey and the wires have been installed leading to the Mount Elgin Institute. Before, however, the current can be turned on it will be necessary to make some changes in the wiring of the building, in order to connect up with the Hydro power and to meet the requirements of the Commission. There will also be required some motors for operating the pump, laundry machinery, etc. The cost of this work, including the motors, will be approximately $2,000.00. In addition to the above it will be necessary to thoroughly examine all of the existing wiring in order to make sure that there are no defects. The cost of this is difficult to estimate but I do not think it will exceed $300.00.\n\nMr. McVitty has offered to look after the work, the purchasing of materials required, after obtaining competitive prices, and the installation to be done by employing an electrician and a helper. This I believe would be the most economical and satisfactory arrangement, and as the school is practically without lights, due to the fact that the present storage batteries are in such poor condition, I would recommend that Mr. McVitty be authorized to proceed with the work.\n\nArchitect.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 14th inst., I would say the motor we need is a 7\u00bd horse power, 220 volt, single phase, 25 cycle. All wiring is done ready for it.\n\nOwing to weather conditions it has been impossible to harvest ice this year, and owing to recent heavy rains the last possible chance of doing so is gone. Our grocers and butchers are compelled to install electric refrigeration.\n\nI don't see how we could possibly take care of food for 120 people here without cold storage of some kind. I enclose herewith a tender from the Kelvinator people of London. Have gone carefully into the matter and fully satisfied myself as to efficiency of their system. Their Distributor, Mr. Monigle, is very reliable. Is Mayor of the city for the third time.\n\nIf funds are not available for both motor and Kelvinator, we would prefer the Kelvinator at present. We can manage to get our shopping done, but cannot possibly get along without cold storage. Give us both if you can. If not both, then refrigeration by all means. It is absolutely necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have received a letter from Mr. McVitty, principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, advising that owing to weather conditions it has been impossible to harvest ice for their ice house at the Institute, and that due to the very heavy rains that the last chance of harvesting none. He asks for charity to install an existing refrigerator. The installation would be economical, as they are now connected with the hydroelectric system. The installation could be made for $100. I do not see how the Institute is in need of such cold storage facilities, but I will request that the matter be investigated.\nFeb. 21, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th regarding the difficulty of procuring a supply of ice for your cold storage, I beg to say that you may purchase and have installed an electric Kelvinator or other suitable type of electrical refrigeration. It is noted that the cost will not exceed $400.00.\n\nWith reference to the 7\u00bd h.p. motor required for operating your chopper this is being purchased and will be shipped addressed to you at Inuway.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAs P.

We expect to greatly strengthen our Staff of instructors, and in our sewing room and workshop produce articles of such merit as to win the complete approval of the crowds we expect to visit us at a great Reunion 17th July next, Anniversary Day.\n\nIn this worthy enterprise we respectfully solicit the liberal support of the Department in the matter of improving our buildings and equipment.\n\n1. Our sewing room greatly needs painting and decorating. Also some modern tables and seats. Probable cost of $150.00\n\n2. Our work shop needs about $150.00 worth of benches and machinery used in manual training schools.\n\n3. Our big barns are showing rust, and ought to have two coats of galvanized paint. The pupils can under our instruction do all the side walls, but the roofs are high and very dangerous. For these we would need men used to that kind of work. I presume about $150.00, at 80\u00a2 an hour for outside labour. We can purchase paint at wholesale, about $4.00 per gallon. I think it would take about 50 gallons to go over these barns.\nBrandon Industrial School,\nAugust 22nd, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe repairs needed at the Mount\nThun Institute:\n\nI wrote you on the 11th inst.

At a later date, you should bring to my attention the need of tables and benches in the sewing room, machinery and benches in the work shop and flooring for the hospital verandah. You may purchase, after securing competitive prices, the paint required for two coats on the two large barns. Your estimate of $200 should not be exceeded. You may also engage labour for the roofs; but it is expected the pupils will do the side walls. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. You may also arrange to have the sewing room decorated.

My Assistant, Mr. Strapp, who is an expert mechanic has placed on this old mangle a protective device, which makes it much more safe than formerly.\n\nWe will be compelled to continue the use of this old mangle for pupils' work. At the same time using the new one for finer work. The device attached makes the old mangle as safe, I think, as the new one, and every possible precaution will be taken in the use of both.\n\nI am enclosing herewith vouchers in favour of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., also for Aggett and Co., for installation.

Elgin Institute during the past week, and he reports that the fire protection is not at all satisfactory. Fire extinguishers are being ordered by the Department and there will be addressed to you a separate letter in this connection. You will please test the hose attached to the standpipe in the main building and make any replacements that are necessary. Further, you should add a fire hose to those standpipes where you consider it advisable. A properly certified accountant, in duplicate, should be forwarded in connection with the purchase of hose.\n\nI understand that the nearest Bridge and Iron Works Company is in London, and I have to ask you to immediately arrange for this firm to quote a price for 2 steel stair fire escapes, properly installed on the rear of the building - one on each wing. As soon as you have received this quotation, please forward it for the Department's consideration.\n\nThe Department insists on fire drill at Indian residential schools, and, as soon as the new fire escapes are installed, I know you will carry out our wishes. There is fire hazard in various places in the attic of the school building, and I have to request you to remove any inflammable material which is no longer of use and take other steps to minimize the risk in this portion of the building. Mr. Ferrier noticed an electric iron, and I have to request that the use of this equipment be discontinued.\n\nOur officer reports that the bathing and lavatory facilities for the children are inadequate, and the Department Architect will look into this question upon the occasion of his first visit to the Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Upon receipt of these extinguishers, you should certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nWhen these extinguishers are received, they should be distributed at strategic points throughout the buildings.

It is noted that the T. Eaton Company, Limited, Toronto, quoted the lowest price. If you are satisfied that the article on which they quote would be satisfactory, you may place the order. However, if it is considered that the equipment quoted on by the George N. Hendry Co., Limited, Toronto, would be more serviceable, it will be satisfactory to obtain same from this firm. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the purchase. The quotations which were forwarded are returned herewith, for your information. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, from the firm from which purchase is made. This, you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment, returning the enclosed quotations attached to the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

This reservoir is covered with wooden planks and then with about a foot of earth. Portions of this covering have fallen through leaving holes which are dangerous to pupils whose duty takes them into the yard as well as to others who may run in during their play period. This reservoir should be cleaned out and a new covering placed upon it.\n\nThe smoke pipe of the furnace that heats the junior school room and hospital building is defective; it is 11 in. diameter and about 10 feet long, with two elbows, being close to the ceiling; its defective condition greatly increases fire risk. It should be replaced immediately.\n\nThe taps in the boys' and girls' lavatories are worn beyond repair and are causing great waste of water. This with a water famine in sight is a serious matter and should be attended to forthwith.\n\nWe hereby request permission to purchase the necessary material for these repairs. Our school mechanic with his boys will provide the labor. The total cost of material should not exceed $200.\n\nHoping for an early and favorable reply,\n\nI Am\nYours Respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The lantern can be attached to any 110-volt lighting circuit and it is so simple that even a child can operate it.\n\nA great deal of interesting and educational entertainment can be provided during the long winter evenings by using this Balopticon. Postcards and snap shots, magazine illustrations and comic strips, coins and curios, in fact an inexhaustible amount of illustrative material can be shown and studied to the enjoyment of both young and old. Pictures and reading matter always appear in the correct position from left to right.\n\nCat No.\nERM-13 With 500-watt, 120-volt Ma... and two post card holders.\nAluminum coated screen 6 ft.\nStrip Film Projection\n\nThe printing of individual pictures on standard motion picture film offers an inexpensive method of using pictures for educational and entertainment purposes, but their use makes necessary a specially designed projector or an attachment fitting on a standard lantern.\n\nRealizing that many users of our Balopticons would want to use such material, we have designed an attachment for projecting still pictures from strips of film which can be used with any Balopticon.\n\nHowever, it is likely that many organizations not possessing any projecting lantern at present will be disposed to take up the use of strip film in their religious or educational work, because of the low cost of such pictures, and the ease of handling and transporting. To these purchasers we offer a complete unit film projector, but one so designed that by the purchase of additional parts it can also be used for projecting lantern slides.\n\nModel ABMF\u2014listed on a previous page\u2014is an extremely practical instrument for schools. With a special attachment, slides as well as films can be projected; and with a short focus lens it can be used with a translucent screen under \"Daylight\" conditions.\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School\nMuncey, Ontario\n\nMcVitty, Principal\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Deptmt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter attending the Teachers' Convention held at Strathroy, our senior teacher, Mr. Dodson, is anxious to have a Baloptican for use in the senior schoolroom for the projection of opaque objects. We are enclosing a cut of the model best adapted for this purpose. We find these are in general use in many of the well equipped schools and feel certain that one would be exceptionally helpful to the Indian pupils who learn so readily through the eye. We hope that the Department will be good enough to furnish the school with one of these.\n\nThe school management has already furnished a Steriopictum for slide projection and this is in regular use, but the use of opaque objects through the medium of the Baloptican would greatly extend our field of study.\n\nTrusting that you will give this your favorable consideration,\n\nI Remain\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, requesting that the Department supply a balopticon for use in the senior room at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has never furnished this type of equipment to Indian residential schools.

Davey, Electrical Contractor, Lambeth, Ontario, was paid on the 17th October by official cheque No 4153, drawn for $106.00, which was the amount of the account, after the correction of error therein. The cheque was sent to the address mentioned above, which was the one you gave.\n\nI note you have stated that Mr Davey moved from Lambeth to Palmerston and that he did not receive the cheque. Enquiry for the letter containing it should be made at the Lambeth post-office. The cheque I may say is outstanding. If the cheque can not be located the Department will take into consideration the question of issuing a duplicate upon Mr Davey executing a bond, indemnity, a form for which will be supplied by the Department, but it seems advisable that he should first make enquiries as referred to above, and that report be made to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

We made a complete job of the inside painting, the material for which cost $145. We are now rebuilding the fence around the lawns and boy's campus which has been up for twenty-five years. Many posts (all turned ones) were broken, necessitating new posts and pickets also considerable new wire. The addition of so much new material means that the whole of the fence must be repainted.\n\nIn order to carry out anything like the necessary repairs we would need at least $200, more for material.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will authorize at least this amount.
