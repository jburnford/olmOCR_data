Of Faith in the Holy Trinity.\n\nThere is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body or parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the maker and preserver of all things, visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there are three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n\nII. Of the Word, or Son of God, who was made very man.\n\nThe Son, who is the Word of the Father, the very and Eternal God, of one substance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin; so that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God and very man, who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for the actual sins of men.\n\nIII. Of the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nChrist did truly rise again from the dead, and took again his body, with all things appertaining to the perfection of\nman's nature, wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth until he returns to judge all men at the last day.\n\nIV. Of the Holy Ghost.\n\nThe Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.\n\nV. The Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.\n\nThe Holy Scriptures contain all things necessary to salvation; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an article of faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the Holy Scriptures, we do understand those canonical books of the Old and new Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.\n\nTHE NAMES OF THE CANONICAL BOOKS.\n\nGenesis. Exodus. Leviticus. Numbers. Deuteronomy. Joshua. Judges. Ruth. The First Book of Samuel. The Second Book of Samuel. The First Book of Kings. The Second Book of Kings. The First Book of Chronicles. The Second Book of Chronicles. The Book of Ezra. The Book of Nehemiah. The Book of Esther. The Book of Job. The Psalms. The Proverbs. Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher. Canticles, or Songs of Solomon. Four Prophets the greater. Twelve Prophets the less.\n\nAll the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive and account canonical.\nVI. Of the Old Testament.\n\nThe Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, who feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the law given from God to Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, doth not bind Christians, nor ought the civil precepts thereof of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral.\n\nVII. Of Original or Birth Sin.\n\nOriginal sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the corruption of the nature of every man that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to evil, and that continually.\n\nVIII. Of Free Will.\n\nThe condition of man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and works, to faith, and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do good works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.\n\nIX. Of the Justification of Man.\n\nWe are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by faith, and not for\nour own works or deservings: Wherefore, that we are justified by faith only, is a most wholesome doctrine and very full of comfort.\n\nX. Of Good Works.\n\nAlthough good works, which are the fruits of faith, and follow after justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's judgment, yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and spring out of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree is discerned by its fruit.\n\nXI. Of Works of Supererogation.\n\nVoluntary works, besides, over and above God's commandments, which are called works of supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogance and impiety. For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake than that of bounden duty is required; Whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.\n\nXII. Of Sin after Justification.\n\nNot every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after justification: After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God rise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.\nARTICLES OF RELIGION.\n\nXIII. Of the Church.\n\nThe visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure word of God is preached, and the sacraments duly administered according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.\n\nXIV. Of Purgatory.\n\nThe Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshipping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the word of God.\n\nXV. Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the People understand not.\n\nIt is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church, to have public prayer in the church, or to minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not understood by the people.\n\nXVI. Of the Sacraments.\n\nSacraments ordained of Christ are not only badges or tokens of Christian men's profession, but rather they are certain signs of grace, and God's good-will towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and comfort our faith in him.\n\nThere are two Sacraments, ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.\n\nThose five commonly called Sacraments,\u2014that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction,\u2014are not to be counted for Sacraments of the\nGospel, being such as have partly grown out of the corrupt following of the Apostles; and partly are states of life allowed in the Scripture, but yet have not the like nature of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, because they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.\n\nThe Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about; but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation; but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves condemnation, as Saint Paul saith, 1 Cor. xi. 29.\n\nXVII. Of Baptism.\n\nBaptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference, whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptised, but it is also a sign of regeneration, or the new birth. The baptism of young children is to be retained in the church.\n\nXVIII. Of the Lord's Supper.\n\nThe Supper of the Lord is not only a sign that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another, but rather is a Sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death; in so much that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\n\nTransubstantiation, or the change of the substance of bread and wine in the Supper of our Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\nThe body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after a heavenly and spiritual manner. And the means whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is faith.\n\nThe Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\n\nXIX. Of both Kinds.\n\nThe cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay-people, for both the parts of the Lord's Supper, by Christ's ordinance and commandment, ought to be administered to all Christians alike.\n\nXX. Of the one Oblation of Christ, finished upon the Cross.\n\nThe offering of Christ once made, is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual: and there is none other satisfaction for sin but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifice of mass, in which it is commonly said that the priest doth offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, is a blasphemous fable and dangerous deceit.\n\nXXI. Of the Marriage of Ministers.\n\nThe ministers of Christ are not commanded by God's law either to vow the estate of single life or to abstain from marriage; therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christians, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve best to godliness.\n\nXXII. Of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church.\n\nIt is not necessary that rites and ceremonies should in all places be the same, or exactly alike; for they have been\nalways different, and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's word. Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely doth openly break the rites and ceremonies of the church to which he belongs, which are not repugnant to the word of God, and are ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, that others may fear to do the like, as one that offendeth against the common order of the church, and woundeth the consciences of weak brethren.\n\nEvery particular church may ordain, change, or abolish rites and ceremonies, so that all things may be done to edification.\n\nXXIII. Of the Civil Government.\n\nWe believe it is the duty of all Christians to be subject to the powers that be; for we are commanded by the Word of God to respect and obey the Civil Government. We should therefore not only fear God, but honour the King.\n\nXXIV. Of Christian Men's Goods.\n\nThe riches and goods of Christians are not common as touching the right, title, and possession of the same, as some do falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.\n\nXXV. Of a Christian Man's Oath.\n\nAs we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James, his Apostle, so we judge that the Christian religion doth not prohibit but that a man may swear when the magistrate requireth, in the cause of faith and charity, so it be according to the Prophet's teaching, in justice, judgment, and truth.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCHURCH COURTS.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nOF THE CONFERENCE.\n\nIt is desired that all things be considered on these occasions as in the immediate presence of God; that every person speak freely whatever is in his heart.\n\nQues. 1.

Let those who attend set out as late, and return as early as possible; and in case of changes it is expected that the newly-appointed Ministers and Preachers will be on their respective Circuits not later than the first Sabbath in July; and those who retire shall be held responsible for the supply of the pulpits until that time.\n\n3. Every Preacher on trial who has travelled four years, and been recommended by his District Meeting to the Conference to be admitted into full connection, shall attend the Conference of that year.\n4. Nothing in these rules shall be so construed as to prevent those Ministers from attending the Conference, against whom there lies any accusation or complaint.\n\nFourth.\u2014What Ministers are appointed by this Meeting to represent the District as members of Conference Committees? The Stationing? Church Relief? Sabbath School?\n\nFifth.\u2014Are the young men on trial acquainted with the prescribed course of study, and what books have they read?\n\nThe Reports of Examining Committees are to be presented to the District Meetings for consideration; and their recommendation is to be recorded in the Minutes of the District, to be read at the Conference.\n\nThe Chairman shall also examine every Preacher on trial respecting his acquaintance with the books recommended to him, and the general course of reading which he has pursued during the preceding year. For this purpose every such Preacher is required to deliver to the Chairman of his District a list of the books which he has read since the preceding District Meeting. This list shall be laid before the Meeting, that the senior brethren may have an opportunity of giving to the junior Preachers such advice and directions respecting their studies as may appear necessary.\n\nIn addition to the preceding course of inquiry the following questions are to be put every year by the Chairman to every young man on the District on trial, but they need not be inserted in the District Minutes. It is enough to say that the usual questions were put to the young men on trial and satisfactorily answered; or, if otherwise, to state the case. In the Annual Examination of Candidates for our Ministry, it shall be the duty of the Chairmen of Districts to include the Disciplinary question, \"Do you take snuff,\"\ntobacco, or drams?\" and a distinct answer in the negative shall be required in every case as a condition of continuing on trial, from year to year.\n\n1. Have you now faith in Christ, and are you going on to perfection?\n\n2. Have you attended regularly to private prayer, and to the devotional reading of the Scriptures, and books of a spiritual and experimental kind, in order to keep up devout and lively religious feelings in your own heart?\n\n3. Have you carefully visited the sick under your charge, and others to whom you could obtain access?\n\n4. Have you visited the people at their houses, inquiring into their religious state, praying with them, and administering wholesome counsel; and have you catechised the children of the schools, and those of your friends and hearers, as you have had opportunity?\n\n5. Have you had fruit of your ministry during the year, and are you endeavouring so to state the leading truths of Christian doctrine and experience in your discourses, and so to apply them with affection, and earnestness, and prayer, as to do all in your power to secure success in your work?\n\n6. Answer the following questions in such terms as you would use in stating the doctrines they contain to an inquirer under religious impressions, or in your sermons:\u2014What is Evangelical Repentance? What is Justification? What is Justifying Faith? What is the direct Witness of the Spirit? What is the indirect Witness of the Spirit? What is Christian Perfection? What is the difference between Justification and Sanctification? What is the difference between Justification and Regeneration? What is the difference between Sanctification and entire Sanctification?\n\nLet these points be proved in order by appropriate passages of Holy Writ.\nThe brethren will see the propriety of conducting this part of the proceedings with peculiar deliberation and solemnity, as in the immediate presence of God; and they may enlarge on doctrinal questions as they may deem necessary, so as to lead the candidates to a right understanding, and an appropriate expression of our leading doctrinal peculiarities as a Church.\n\nSixth.\u2014Who have travelled four years and are now recommended to the Conference to be received into full connexion and ordained?\n\nSeventh.\u2014What Preachers are recommended to be continued on trial?\n\n1. Who have travelled three years?\n2. Who have travelled two years?\n3. Who have travelled one year?\n\nEighth.\u2014What Preachers are on the List of Reserve?\n\nWhere the Preacher has been recommended to travel, but not called out into the work in the course of the year, the Chairman shall make inquiry of the Superintendent of the Circuit where he resides, whether he be still deemed a proper person to be employed in our regular ministry; and the result shall be reported to the District Meeting.\n\nNinth.\u2014What Preachers are recommended to be received on trial?\n\nThe Chairmen are required not only to examine very minutely in the District Meetings all persons proposed as candidates for our Ministry, but also to report distinctly in their District Minutes, for the consideration of Conference, the opinion of the District Meetings after such examinations, respecting the health, piety, moral character, ministerial abilities, and educational acquirements, belief of our doctrines, attachment to our discipline, and freedom from debt, as well as from all secular encumbrances.\nQues. 1. How shall we try those who profess to be moved by the Holy Ghost to preach?\n\nAns. 1. Let the following questions be asked:\u2014Do they know God as a pardoning God? Have they the love of God abiding in them? Do they desire nothing but God? And are they holy in all manner of conversation?\n\n2. Have they gifts as well as grace for the work? Have they a clear, sound understanding\u2014a right judgment in the things of God\u2014a just conception of salvation by faith? And has God given them an acceptable way of speaking? Do they speak justly, readily, clearly?\n\n3. Have they fruit? Are any truly convinced of sin, and converted to God by their preaching?\n\nAs long as these three marks concur in any one, we believe he is called of God to preach. These we receive as sufficient proof that he is moved by the Holy Ghost.\n\nQues. 2. How is a Preacher received on trial, and what regulations are observed respecting him during his probation?\n\nAns. 1. Before a Chairman or Superintendent shall propose a Preacher to the District Meeting to be recommended to the Conference to be admitted on trial, such Preacher must first be approved and recommended by the Quarterly Official Meeting of the Circuit or Station on which he resides.\n\n2. Every candidate thus recommended shall attend the ensuing District Meeting, and be examined before all the brethren present respecting his religious experience, his knowledge of divine things, his educational acquirements, his reading, his views of the doctrines of the Gospel, and his regard for Methodism in general.\n\nHe shall also be required to have passed a satisfactory ex-\namination on the subjects prescribed by the Conference, as the preliminary Course of Study.\n\n3. Every person proposed to the District Meeting is then to be asked by the Chairman the following questions, to each of which a distinct answer shall be required:\n\nHave you been converted to God? Have you been pardoned? Have you faith in Christ? Are you going on to perfection? Do you expect to be made perfect in love in this life? Are you groaning after it? Are you resolved to devote yourself wholly to God and his work? Have you been baptised? What are your views on Infant Baptism, and the Lord's Supper? Do you know the Rules of the Society? Do you keep them? Do you take snuff, tobacco, or drams? Have you read the whole Discipline? Are you willing to conform to it? Have you considered the twelve rules of a preacher, as contained in answer to question 2nd, Section IV., Chapter III., especially the first, the tenth, and the twelfth? Will you keep them for conscience sake? Are you determined to employ all your time in the work of God? Will you preach at every suitable opportunity, endeavouring not to speak too long or too loud? Will you diligently instruct the children in every place? Will you visit from house to house? Will you recommend fasting, both by precept and example? Are you in debt? What is your age? Have you good health, and have you a sound constitution? Are you engaged to marry?\n\nDo you sincerely and fully believe the doctrines of Methodism as contained in our Articles of Faith, and as taught by Mr. Wesley in his notes on the New Testament and volumes of sermons?\u2014especially the following leading ones\u2014a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Godhead; the total depravity of all men by nature, in consequence of Adam's fall;\nthe Atonement made by Christ for the sins of all the human race; the direct witness of the Spirit; the possibility of falling from a state of justification and holiness, and perishing everlasting; the absolute necessity of holiness, both in heart and life; and the proper eternity of future rewards and punishments? Will you endeavour fully and faithfully to preach them? What is your religious experience? and what is your call to this work?\n\n4. After the examination the Candidate shall withdraw, and the Meeting shall determine whether he shall be recommended to the ensuing Conference to be received on trial.\n\n5. If it be not convenient for the Candidate to attend the District Meeting, the Chairman with two other Ministers shall examine him as above directed, and report the result to the District Meeting.\n\n6. If a Preacher who has been received on trial, but not into full connection, desist from travelling, he shall be dropped in silence, unless he desist from want of health.\n\n7. A Preacher who marries while on trial shall be dropped in silence.\n\n8. Observe: taking on trial is entirely different from admitting a Preacher into full connection. One on trial may be either admitted or rejected without doing him any wrong: otherwise it would have been no trial at all. Let every Chairman explain this to them on trial.\n\n9. The time for a Preacher to remain on trial shall be four years, at the end of which period, if recommended by his District Meeting, he may be received into full connection.\n\n10. Every Preacher on trial shall pursue the course of study prescribed by the Conference; and before he shall be received into full connection he shall give satisfactory evi-\ndence to the District Meeting, from year to year, of his knowledge of the subjects and books included in such course of study.\n\n11. After four years' probation, and an examination before, and approval by the Conference, he shall be received into full connection and be publicly recognized. If a Preacher who has been received on trial but not into full connection desist from want of health, or is proved guilty of immorality, it shall be stated in the Minutes; but in all other cases his name shall be dropped in silence.\n\n12. All young men taken into the work by Chairmen of Districts, with the consent of the President, before the November Quarterly Official Meeting, shall be allowed the full year.\n\n13. No Chairman of a District, or other Conference officer, shall have authority to employ a married Preacher during the year, with a view to his being received as a Candidate for our Ministry, without the consent of the Conference, or the Conference Special Committee.\n\n14. No District Meeting shall recommend any married Preacher to the Conference for reception on trial, unless he has been previously employed, in case of absolute necessity, in accordance with the foregoing restriction.\n\n15. When a Preacher's name is not inserted in the Minutes, he must receive a written license from the President, or the Chairman of the District on which he resides.\n\nTenth.\u2014What Candidates for the Ministry are recommended to attend Victoria College during the year?\n\n1. Before any Candidate for our Ministry shall be sent to College, his circumstances shall be inquired into by the District Meeting; and when such Preacher on trial is appointed to go to College by the Conference, the Minute of\nthe District Meeting in his case shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Educational Fund Committee. No Candidate for our Ministry shall be sent to College who has not travelled at least one year.\n\n2. When a Preacher on trial is allowed to attend Victoria College, for one or more years, his probation shall extend over five years at least, three of which shall be passed in Circuit work. Any Probationer assisted by the Educational Fund, who, within the period of ten years after Ordination, may wish to withdraw from the Conference, shall be required to refund the amount of aid given him, before receiving a certificate of standing, provided always that this requirement shall not apply to those who retire from ill health.\n\n4. Preachers on trial who have graduated in arts, in any University, shall be exempt from examination in the Conference Course of Study, except in the subjects of Theology and Church History.\n\nEleventh.\u2014What Ministers or Preachers have died?\n\nTwelfth.\u2014Who are recommended as Superannuated Ministers?\n\nThirteenth.\u2014Who are recommended as Supernumerary Ministers?\n\nFourteenth.\u2014Who have desisted from Travelling?\n\nFifteenth.\u2014Who have been suspended during the year; and what is the recommendation of the District Meeting in the case?\n\nSixteenth.\u2014What is the number of our Church Members?

Have all the regulations respecting the Children's Fund been fully carried into effect in the District?\n\nEighteenth.\u2014What is the number of Ministers, Preachers, and Laymen, in the Quarterly Official Meeting of each Circuit and Mission?

Have the Rules of Society been read during the year, and have they been given to the members on trial, according to the Discipline?\n\n5. Do the brethren pay sufficient attention to Pastoral visitation, and the catechising of the children of our members and friends?\n\nSecondly. These important enquiries shall be followed by the reading of the Resolutions of the Conference held in\nBelleville in 1836, (Minutes, page 120,) to be followed with a solemn review of the state of the work of God. And any suggestions for the religious improvement of our children and the members of our Church, and especially for the greater efficiency of our Ministerial labours, are to be entered on the Minutes of the District Meeting, and, when thought necessary, recommended to the consideration of the Conference.\n\nTwentieth.\u2014What Stewards and other Lay Representatives have been appointed by the several Circuits and Missions?

To explain and enforce the General Rules of the Church; which are understood to prohibit our people from employing dancing-masters to teach their children to dance, or sending or allowing them to attend dancing-schools, or parties in which that amusement is practised.\n\n4. To suffer no Love-feast to last above an hour and a half.\n\n5. To remind members from time to time that none are to remove from one Circuit to another without a certificate of membership from a Minister of the Circuit, and to warn them that without such certificate they will not be received into the Church in other places; and also to forward a duplicate copy of such certificate by mail to the Superintendent of the Circuit to which they may be removing.\n\n6.

To see that Mr. Wesley's original rule in regard to weekly and quarterly contributions be observed in all our Societies as far as possible. The rule was published by Mr. Wesley in the Minutes of Conference held in London, 1782. It is as follows:\n\n\"Q. Have all the weekly and quarterly contributions been made in all our Societies?\n\n\"A. In many it has been shamefully neglected. To remedy this\u2014\n\n\"1. Let every Superintendent remind every Society that this was our original rule: Every member contributes one penny weekly (unless he is in extreme poverty), and one shilling quarterly. Explain the reasonableness of this.\n\n\"2. Let every Leader receive the weekly contribution from each person in his Class.\n\n\"3.

To see that Collections for our Connexional Funds be taken up at the following times, viz.:\n   1. Church Relief, in the month of July.\n   2. Contingent, in the months of September and March.\n   3. Educational, in the month of December.\n\n22. To carry out the arrangements made by the Financial District Meeting in regard to the Missionary work on his Circuit.\n\n23. To pay promptly to the appointed Treasurers all money collected for the several Funds at the times directed by Conference.\n\nSECTION IV.\n\nOF THE DUTY OF TRAVELLING PREACHERS.\n\nQues. 1. What is the duty of a Preacher?\nAns. 1. To preach. 2. To meet the Societies, Classes, and general Bands. 3. To visit the sick. 4. To preach in the morning where he can get hearers. We recommend morning preaching at five o'clock in the summer and six in the winter, wherever it is practicable.\n\nQues. 2. What are the directions given to a Preacher?\nAns. 1. Be diligent. Never be unemployed, never be triflingly employed. Never trifle away time; neither spend any more time at any place than is strictly necessary.\n   2. Be serious. Let your motto be, Holiness to the Lord. Avoid all lightness, jesting, and foolish talking.\n   3. Converse sparingly; and conduct yourself prudently with women. 1 Tim. 5, 2.\n4. Take no step towards marriage without first consulting your brethren.\n\n5. Believe evil of no one without good evidence: unless you see it done, take heed how you credit it. Put the best construction on every thing. You know the judge is always supposed to be on the prisoner's side.\n\n6. Speak evil of no one: because your word especially would eat as doth a canker. Keep your thoughts within your own breast, till you come to the person concerned.\n\n7. Tell every one under your care what you think wrong in his conduct and temper, and that lovingly and plainly, as soon as may be, else it will fester in your heart. Make all haste to cast the fire out of your bosom.\n\n8. Avoid all affectation. A Preacher of the Gospel is the servant of all.\n\n9. Be ashamed of nothing but sin.\n\n10. Be punctual. Do every thing exactly at time. And do not mend our rules, but keep them, not for wrath, but for conscience sake.\n\n11. You have nothing to do but save souls: Therefore spend and be spent in this work; and go always not only to those who want you, but to those who want you most.\n\nObserve: It is not your business only to preach so many times, and to take care of this or that Society, but to save as many as you can\u2014to bring as many sinners as you can to repentance, and with all your power to build them up in that holiness without which they cannot see the Lord. And remember\u2014a Methodist Preacher is to mind every point, great and small, in the Methodist Discipline. Therefore you will need to exercise all the sense and grace you have.\n\n12. Act in all things not according to your own will,\nbut as a son in the Gospel. As such it is your duty to employ your time in the manner which we direct; in preaching and visiting from house to house\u2014in reading, meditation, and prayer. Above all, if you labour with us in the Lord's vineyard, it is needful you should do that part of the work which we advise, at the times and places which we judge most for his glory.\n\nSection V.\n\nOF THE ELECTION AND ORDINATION OF MINISTERS, AND THEIR DUTIES.\n\nQues. 1. How is a Minister constituted?\n\nAns. By election of the Conference, and by the laying on of the hands of the President and other senior Ministers.\n\nQues. 2. What are the duties of a Minister?\n\nAns. To conduct all parts of Divine worship, to administer Baptism and the Lord's Supper, to solemnize Matrimony, and in general to perform all the work of a Christian Minister.\n\nNo Minister who ceases to travel without the consent of the Conference, certified under the hand of the President, except in case of sickness, debility, or other unavoidable circumstances, shall, on any account, exercise the peculiar functions of his office, or even be allowed to preach among us; nevertheless, the final determination in all such cases is with the Conference.\nSECTION VI.\n\nOF THE RECEPTION OF MINISTERS FROM OTHER CHURCHES.\n\nQues. 1. On what condition shall we receive those Ministers who may come to us from the Wesleyan Connexion in Europe, the Affiliated Conferences, and the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States?\n\nAns. If they come to us properly accredited from any of those Conferences, they may be received according to such credentials, provided they give satisfaction to the Conference of their willingness to conform to our church government and usages.\n\nQues. 2. How shall we receive Ministers who may offer to unite with us from any seceding Body of Methodists, or from other Christian Churches?\n\nAns. They may be received by the Conference, according to our usages, on condition of taking upon them our ordination vows, without re-imposition of hands, having previously given satisfaction to a committee composed of the Chairman and two other Ministers of the District, and to the Conference, of their being in Orders, and of their agreement with our Church in doctrine and discipline, government and usages; provided also that the Conference is satisfied with their gifts, grace, and usefulness.\n\nQues. 3. How shall we receive Preachers from any seceding Body of Methodists, or from other Evangelical Denominations?\n\nAns. They may be received as Probationers, provided they give satisfaction that they are suitable persons to exercise the office; that they believe in the doctrines, and\napprove of the Discipline, government, and usages of our Church. The Chairman and any two Ministers (members of the Conference) of the District, within the bounds of which such Preacher may be travelling or resident, are authorised to act as a committee on behalf of the Conference, to admit him into our Church; and he may be employed until the ensuing Conference; and if he be recommended by a District Meeting he may be received as a Preacher on trial.\n\nSection VII.\n\nRULES BY WHICH WE SHOULD CONTINUE OR DESIST FROM PREACHING AT ANY PLACE.\n\nQues. 1. Is it advisable for us to preach in as many places as we can without forming any Societies?\n\nAns. By no means: we have made the trial in various places: and that for a considerable time. But all the seed has fallen by the way side. There is scarce any fruit remaining.\n\nQues. 2. Where should we endeavour to preach most?\n\nAns. 1. Where there is the greatest number of quiet and willing hearers.\n\n2. Where there is most fruit.\n\nQues. 3. Ought we not diligently to observe in what places God is pleased at any time to pour out His Spirit more abundantly?\n\nAns. We ought: and at that time to send more labourers than usual into that part of the harvest.\nSection VIII.\n\nOF THE MATTER AND MANNER OF PREACHING, AND OF OTHER PUBLIC EXERCISES.\n\nQues. 1. What is the best general method of Preaching?\nAns. 1. To convince: 2. To offer Christ: 3. To invite:\n4. To build up: And to do this in some measure in every sermon.\n\nQues. 2. What is the most effectual way of preaching Christ?\n\nAns. The most effectual way of preaching Christ, is to preach him in all his offices; and to declare his law, as well as his gospel, both to believers and unbelievers. Let us strongly and closely insist upon inward and outward holiness in all its branches.\n\nQues. 3. Are there any other advices which might be of use to us?\n\nAns. Perhaps these: 1. Be sure never to disappoint a congregation. 2. Begin at the time appointed. 3. Let your whole deportment be serious, weighty, and solemn. 4. Always suit your subject to your audience. 5. Choose the plainest text you can. 6. Take care not to ramble, but keep to your text, and make out what you take in hand. 7. Beware of anything awkward or affected, either in your gesture, phrase, or pronunciation. 8. Do not usually pray extempore above eight or ten minutes (at most) without intermission. 9. Frequently read and enlarge upon a portion of Scripture; and let young Preachers often exhort without taking a text. 10. Always avail yourselves of the great festivals, by preaching on such occasions.\nSECTION IX.\n\nOF THE DUTIES OF MINISTERS AND PREACHERS TO GOD, THEMSELVES, AND ONE ANOTHER.\n\nQues. 1. How shall the Minister or Preacher be qualified for his charge?\n\nAns. By walking closely with God, and having his work greatly at heart; and by understanding and loving discipline, ours in particular.\n\nQues. 2. Do we sufficiently watch over each other?\n\nAns. We do not. Should we not frequently ask each other: Do you walk closely with God? Have you now fellowship with the Father and Son? At what hour do you rise? Do you punctually observe the morning and evening hour of retirement? Do you spend the day in the manner which the Conference advises? Do you converse seriously, usefully, and closely? To be more particular: Do you use all the means of grace yourself, and enforce the use of them on all other persons? They are either instituted or prudential.\n\nFirst.\u2014The instituted are:\n\n1. Prayer:\u2014Private, family, and public; consisting of deprecation, petition, intercession, and thanksgiving. Do you use each of these? Do you forecast daily wherever you are, to secure time for private devotion? Do you practise it everywhere? Do you ask everywhere\u2014Have you family prayer? Do you ask individuals\u2014Do you use private prayer, every morning and evening in particular?\n\n2. Searching the Scriptures by\u2014\n\n(1) Reading: Constantly, some part of them every day; regularly, all the Bible in order; carefully, with notes;\nseriously, with prayer before and after; fruitfully, immediately practising what you learn there.\n\n(2) Meditating: At set times. By rule.\n\n(3) Hearing: Every opportunity; with prayer before, at, and after. Have you a Bible always about you?\n\n3. The Lord's Supper: Do you use this at every opportunity? With solemn prayer before? With earnest and deliberate self-devotion?\n\n4. Fasting: Do you use as much abstinence and fasting every week, as your health, strength, and labour will permit?\n\n5. Christian Conference: Are you convinced how important and how difficult it is to order your conversation aright? Is it always with grace? Seasoned with salt? Meet to minister grace to the hearers? Do you not converse too long at a time? Is not an hour commonly enough? Would it not be well always to have a determinate end in view? And to pray before and after it?\n\nSecond.\u2014Prudential means, we may use either as Christians, as Methodists, or as Ministers and Preachers.\n\n1. As Christians: What particular rules have you in order to grow in grace? What arts of holy living?\n\n2. As Methodists: Do you never miss your Class or Band?\n\n3. As Ministers and Preachers: Have you thoroughly considered your duty? And do you make a conscience of executing every part of it? Do you meet every Society? Also, the Leaders and Bands?\n\nThese means may be used without fruit. But there are some means which cannot, namely, watching, denying ourselves, taking up our cross, exercise of the presence of God.\n\n1. Do you steadily watch against the world? Yourself? Your besetting sin?\n2. Do you deny yourself every useless pleasure of sense? Imagination? Honour? Are you temperate in all things? Instance in food: 1. Do you use only that kind and that degree which is best both for body and soul? Do you see the necessity of this? 2. Do you eat no more at each meal than is necessary? Are you not heavy and drowsy after dinner? 3. Do you use only that kind and that degree of drink which is best both for your body and soul? 4. Do you choose and use water for your drink? And only take wine medicinally or sacramentally?\n\n3. Wherein do you take up your cross daily? Do you cheerfully bear your cross, however grievous, to profit thereby?\n\n4. Do you endeavour to set God always before you? To see his eye continually fixed upon you? Never can you use these means but a blessing will ensue. And the more you use them, the more you will grow in grace.\n\n---\n\nSection X.\n\nOF VISITING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE, AND ENFORCING PRACTICAL RELIGION.\n\nQues. 1. How can we further assist those under our care?\n\nAns. 1. By instructing them at their own houses. What unspeakable need is there for this! The world says, \"The Methodists are no better than other people.\" This is not true in general; but, 1. Personal religion, either toward God or man, is too superficial among us. We can but just touch on a few particulars. How little faith is there among us!\nHow little communion with God, how little living in heaven, walking in eternity, deadness to every creature! How much love of the world! Desire of pleasure, of ease, of getting money! How little brotherly love! What continual judging one another! What gossiping, evil speaking, tale bearing! What want of moral honesty! To instance only one particular: Who does as he would be done by, in buying and selling?\n\n2. Family religion is wanting in many branches. And what avails public preaching alone, though we could preach like angels? We must, yea, every Travelling Preacher must instruct the people from house to house! Till this is done, and that in good earnest, the Methodists will be no better.\n\nOur religion is not sufficiently deep, universal, uniform; but superficial, partial, uneven. It will be so till we spend half as much time in this visiting, as we now do in talking uselessly. Can we find a better method of doing this than Mr. Baxter's? If not, let us adopt it without delay. His whole tract, entitled *Gildas Salvianus*; or, *The Reformed Pastor*, is well worth a careful perusal. Speaking of this visiting from house to house, he says, (p. 351), \"We shall find many hindrances, both in ourselves and the people.\"\n\n1. In ourselves there is much dullness and laziness, so that there will be much ado to get us to be faithful in the work.\n\n2. We have a base man-pleasing temper, so that we let them perish rather than lose their love; we let them go quietly to hell, lest we should offend them.\n\n3. Some of us have a foolish bashfulness; we know not how to begin, and blush to contradict the devil.\n\n4. But the great hindrance is weakness of faith. Our whole motion is weak because the spring is weak.\n5. Lastly, we are unskilful in the work. How few know how to deal with men, so as to get within them, and suit all our discourse to their several conditions and tempers: to choose the fittest subjects, and follow them with a holy mixture of seriousness, terror, love, and meekness!\n\nBut undoubtedly this private application is implied in those solemn words of the Apostle, \"I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom, preach the word; be instant in season; out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering, and doctrine.\"\n\nO brethren, if we could but set this work on foot in all our societies, and prosecute it zealously, what glory would redound to God! If the common lukewarmness were banished, and every shop and every house busied in speaking of the word and works of God; surely God would dwell in our habitations, and make us his delight.\n\nAnd this is absolutely necessary to the welfare of our people, some of whom neither repent nor believe to this day. Look around, and see how many of them are still in apparent danger of damnation. And how can you walk and talk, and be merry with such people, when you know their case! When you look them in the face you should break forth into tears, as the Prophet did when he looked upon Hazael, and then set on them with the most vehement exhortations. O, for God's sake, and the sake of poor souls, bestir yourselves, and spare no pains that may conduce to their salvation!\n\nWhat cause have we to bleed before the Lord that we have so long neglected this good work! If we had but engaged in it sooner, how many more might have been brought to Christ! And how much holier and happier\nmight our Societies have been before now! And why might we not have done it sooner? There were many hindrances: and so there always will be. But the greatest hindrance is in ourselves, in our littleness of faith and love.\n\nBut it is objected, I. \"This will take up so much time we shall not have leisure to follow our studies.\" We answer, 1. Gaining knowledge is a good thing, but saving souls is a better. 2. By this very thing you will gain the most excellent knowledge, that of God and eternity. 3. You will have time for gaining other knowledge, too. Only sleep not more than you need; \"and never be idle, or triflingly employed.\" But, 4. If you can do but one, let your studies alone. We ought to throw by all the libraries in the world, rather than be guilty of the loss of one soul.\n\nIt is objected, II. \"The people will not submit to it.\" If some will not, others will. And the success with them will repay all your labour. O let us herein follow the example of St. Paul. 1. For our general business, Serving the Lord with all humility of mind: 2. Our special work, Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock: 3. Our doctrine, Repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ: 4. The place, I have taught you publicly, and from house to house: 5. The object and manner of teaching, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears: 6. His innocence and self-denial, Herein have I coveted no man's silver or gold: 7. His patience, Neither count I my life dear unto myself. And among all other motives, let these be ever before our eyes; 1. The Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 2. Grievous wolves shall enter in; yea, of yourselves shall men arise speaking perverse things.\nWrite this upon your hearts, and it will do you more good than twenty years' study. Then you will have no time to spare: you will have work enough. Then, likewise, no Preacher will stay with us who is as salt that has lost its savour. For to such this employment would be mere drudgery. And in order to it, you will have need of all the knowledge you can procure, and all the grace you can attain.\n\nThe sum is, go into every house in course, and teach all therein, both young and old, to be Christians inwardly and outwardly; make every particular plain to their understanding; fix it in their minds; write it on their hearts. In order to this, there must be line upon line, precept upon precept. What patience, what love, what knowledge is requisite for this! We must needs do this, were it only to avoid idleness. Do we not loiter away many hours in every week? Each try himself. No idleness is consistent with a growth in grace. Nay, without exactness in redeeming time, you cannot retain the grace you receive in justification.\n\nQues. 2. Why are we not more holy? Why do we not live in eternity? Walk with God all the day long? Why are we not all devoted to God? Breathing the whole spirit of Missionaries?\n\nAns. Chiefly because we are enthusiasts; looking for the end, without using any means. To touch only upon two or three instances. Who of us rise at four, or even at five, when we do not preach? Do we know the obligation and benefit of fasting, or abstinence? How often do we practise it? The neglect of this alone is sufficient to account for our feebleness and faintness of spirit. We are continually grieving the Holy Spirit of God by the habitual neglect of a plain duty. Let us amend from this hour.\nQues. 3. How should we guard against Sabbath-breaking, evil-speaking, unprofitable conversation, lightness, expensiveness or gaiety of apparel, and contracting debts without due care to discharge them?\n\nAns. 1. Let us preach expressly on each of these heads. 2. Read in every Society the sermon on evil speaking. 3. Let the Leaders closely examine and exhort every person to put away the accursed thing. 4. Let the Ministers and Preachers warn every Society, that none who is guilty herein can remain with us. 5. Extirpate out of our Church buying or selling goods which have not paid the duty laid upon them by Government. Let none remain with us who will not totally abstain from this evil in every kind and degree. Extirpate bribery,\u2014receiving anything directly or indirectly,\u2014for voting at any election. Show no respect to persons herein, but expel all that touch the accursed thing. And strongly advise our people to discountenance all treats given by candidates before or at elections, and not to be partakers, in any respect, of such iniquitous practices.\n\nSection XI.\n\nOF EMPLOYING OUR TIME PROFITABLY, WHEN NOT ENGAGED IN PUBLIC EXERCISES.\n\nQues. 1. What general method of employing our time shall we advise?\n\nAns. We advise, 1. As often as possible to rise at four. 2. From four to five in the morning, and from five to six in the evening, to meditate, pray, and read the Scriptures with notes, and the closely practical parts of what Mr. Wesley has published. 3. From six in the\nmorning till twelve (allowing an hour for breakfast), read, with much prayer, some of our best religious books.\n\nQues. 2. Why is it that the people under our care are not better?\n\nAns. Other reasons may concur, but the chief is, because we are not more knowing and more holy.\n\nQues. 3. But why are we not more knowing?\n\nAns. Because we are idle. We forgot our first rule, \"Be diligent\u2014never be unemployed\u2014never be triflingly employed. Neither spend any more time at any place than is strictly necessary.\" We fear there is altogether a fault in this matter, and that few of us are clear. Which of us spend as many hours a day in God's work, as we did formerly in man's work? We talk, talk\u2014or read what comes next to hand. We must, absolutely must, cure this evil or betray the cause of God. But how? 1. Read the most useful books, and that regularly and constantly. 2 Steadily spend all the morning in this employment, or at least five hours in four-and-twenty. \"But I have no taste for reading.\" Contract a taste for it by use, or return to your former employment. \"I have no books.\" Be diligent to spread the books, and you will have the use of them.\n\nSection XII.\n\nOF THE NECESSITY OF UNION AMONG OURSELVES.\n\nLet us be deeply sensible (from what we have known) of the evil of a division in principle, spirit, or practice, and the dreadful consequences to ourselves and others. If we are united, what can stand before us? If we divide, we\nshall destroy ourselves, the work of God, and the souls of our people.\n\nQues. What can be done in order to a closer union with each other?\n\nAns. 1. Let us be deeply convinced of the absolute necessity of it.\n2. Pray earnestly for and speak freely to each other.\n3. When we meet, let us never part without prayer.\n4. Take great care not to despise each other's gifts.\n5. Never speak lightly of each other.\n6. Let us defend each other's character in every thing, so far as is consistent with the truth.\n7. Labour, in honour, each to prefer the other before himself.\n\n8. We recommend a serious perusal of The Causes, Evils, and Cures of the Heart and Church Divisions.\n\nSection XIII.\n\nOF THE RELATION OF BAPTIZED CHILDREN TO THE CHURCH.\n\nQues. 1. Are all young children entitled to baptism?\n\nAns. We hold that all children, by virtue of the unconditional benefits of the atonement, are members of the kingdom of God, and, therefore, graciously entitled to baptism; but as infant baptism contemplates a course of religious instruction and discipline, it is expected of all parents or guardians who present their children for baptism, that they use all diligence in bringing them up in conformity to the\nword of God, and they should be solemnly admonished of this obligation, and earnestly exhorted to faithfulness therein.\n\nQues. 2. What is the relation of baptized children to the Church?\n\nAns. We regard all children who have been baptized, as placed in visible covenant relation to God, and under the special care and supervision of the Church.\n\nQues. 3. What shall be done for the children of our Congregations?\n\nAns. 1. Urge upon all parents the duty and importance of presenting their children to God in the ordinance of baptism.\n\n2. As early as they shall be able to understand, let them be taught the nature, the design, and the obligations of their baptism, and the truths of religion necessary to make them wise unto salvation; let our Catechisms be placed in their hands, and let all who can, read and commit the same to memory; let them be encouraged to attend class, and to give regular attendance upon all the means of grace, according to their age, capacity, and religious experience.\n\n3. Pray earnestly for them, and talk with them at every suitable opportunity.\n\n4. As far as practicable, it shall be the duty of every Minister and Preacher to obtain the names of the children of his congregation, to form them into classes, for the purpose of giving them religious instruction, to instruct them regularly himself, as his other duties will allow; to appoint a suitable Leader for each class, who shall instruct them in his absence, and to leave for his successor a correct list of each class with the name of its Leader.\n\n5. Preach expressly on education. \"But I have no gift\nfor this.\" Pray earnestly for the gift, and use every other means to attain it.\n\n6. Whenever a baptized child shall, by orphanage or otherwise, be deprived of Christian guardianship, the Superintendent shall ascertain and report to the Leaders' Meeting the facts in the case; and such provision shall be made for the Christian training of the child, as the circumstances of the case admit and require.\n\nSECTION XIV.\n\nOF PUBLIC WORSHIP.\n\nQues. 1. What direction shall be given for the establishment of uniformity in public worship among us, on the Lord's Day?\n\nAns. 1. Let the morning service consist of singing, prayer, the reading of a chapter out of the Old Testament and another out of the New, and preaching.\n\n2. Let the afternoon and evening services consist of singing, prayer, the reading of one or two chapters out of the Bible, and preaching.\n\n3. Let the Lord's Prayer also be used on all occasions of public worship in concluding the first prayer, and the Apostolic benediction in dismissing the congregation.\n\n4. In administering the ordinances, let the form in the Discipline be used.\n\n5. Let the Society be met, at least once a quarter; wherever it is practicable, on the Sabbath-day.\n\nQues. 2. Is there not a great indecency sometimes practised among us, viz., talking in the congregation before and after service? How shall this be cured?\nAns. Let the Ministers and Preachers enlarge on the impropriety of talking before or after service; and strongly exhort those that are concerned to do it no more.\n\nSection XV.\n\nOF THE SACRAMENTS.\n\nBAPTISM.\n\n1. Let every adult person, and the parents of every child to be baptized, have the choice either of sprinkling, pouring, or immersion, and wherever practicable, let the ordinance be administered in the public congregation.\n\n2. Re-baptism, whether of those baptized in infancy or adult age, is entirely inconsistent with the nature and design of baptism, as set forth in the New Testament.\n\nTHE LORD'S SUPPER.\n\nQues. Are there any directions to be given concerning the administration of the Lord's Supper?\n\nAns. 1. Let those who have scruples concerning the receiving of it kneeling, be permitted to receive it either standing or sitting.\n\n2. Let no person who is not a Member of our Church be habitually admitted to the communion, without examination, and some token given by the Minister.\n\n3. No person shall be admitted to the Lord's Supper among us, who is guilty of any practice for which we would exclude a Member of our Church.\nSection XVI.\n\nOF THE SPIRIT AND TRUTH OF SINGING.\n\nQues. How shall we guard against formality in singing?\n\nAns. 1. By choosing such hymns as are proper for the congregation.\n\n2. By not singing too much at once; seldom more than five or six verses.\n\n3. By suiting the tune to the words.\n\n4. By often stopping short, and asking the people, \"Now! do you know what you said last? Did you speak no more than you felt?\"\n\n5. Do not suffer the people to sing too slowly. This naturally tends to formality, and is brought in by those who have either very strong or very weak voices.\n\n6. In every large Society let them learn to sing; and let them always learn our tunes first.\n\n7. Introduce no new tune till they are perfect in the old.\n\n8. Recommend our tune book. And if you cannot sing yourself, choose a person or two at each place to pitch the tune for you.\n\n9. Exhort every person in the congregation to sing; not one in ten only.\n\n10. The singing and all other parts of public worship are under the control and direction of the Superintendent of the Circuit.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nOF MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nTHE ORIGIN, DESIGN, AND GENERAL RULES OF OUR UNITED SOCIETIES.\n\n1. In the latter end of the year 1739, eight or ten persons came to Mr. Wesley, in London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of sin, and earnestly groaning for redemption. They desired (as did two or three more the next day) that he would spend some time with them in prayer, and advise them how to flee from the wrath to come, which they saw continually hanging over their heads. That he might have more time for this great work, he appointed a day when they might all come together, which from thenceforward they did every week, namely, on Thursday, in the evening. To these, and as many more as desired to join with them, (for their numbers increased daily), he gave those advices, from time to time, which he judged most needful for them; and they always concluded their meetings with prayer, suited to their several necessities.\n\n2. This was the rise of the United Society, first in Europe and then in America. Such a Society is no other\nthan \"a company of men, having the form and seeking the power of godliness; united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love, that they may help each other to work out their salvation.\"\n\n3. That it may the more easily be discerned, whether they are indeed working out their own salvation, each Society is divided into smaller companies, called Classes, according to their respective places of abode. There are about twelve persons in a Class, one of whom is styled, The Leader. It is his duty,\n\nFirst. To see each person in his Class once a week at least, in order,\n1. To inquire how their souls prosper.\n2. To advise, reprove, comfort, or exhort, as occasion may require.\n3. To receive what they are willing to give, towards the support of the Ministers, Preachers, Church, and Poor.\n\nSecond. To meet the Ministers and Stewards of the Society once a week, in order,\n1. To inform the Minister of any that are sick, or of any that walk disorderly and will not be reproved.\n2. To pay the Stewards what they have received of the several Classes in the week preceding.\n4. There is only one condition previously required of those who desire admission into these Societies,\u2014a desire to flee from the wrath to come, and be saved from their sins.\n\nBut wherever this is really fixed in the soul, it will be shown by its fruits. It is therefore expected of all who continue therein, that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation,\nFirst. By doing no harm, by avoiding evil of every kind, especially that which is most generally practised,\u2014such as:\nThe taking of the name of God in vain.\nThe profaning of the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein, or by buying or selling.\nDrunkenness, buying or selling spirituous liquors, or drinking them, unless in cases of extreme necessity.\nThe buying and selling of men, women, and children, with the intention to enslave them.\nFighting, quarrelling, brawling, brother going to law with brother; returning evil for evil, or railing for railing; the using many words in buying or selling.\nThe buying or selling goods that have not paid the duty.\nThe giving or taking on usury, i.e., unlawful interest.\nUncharitable or unprofitable conversation; particularly speaking evil of Magistrates or Ministers.\nDoing to others as we would not they should do unto us.\nDoing what we know is not for the glory of God,\u2014as:\nThe putting on of gold or costly apparel.\nThe taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the Lord Jesus.\nThe singing those songs or reading those books which do not tend to the knowledge or love of God.\nSoftness and needless self indulgence.\nLaying up treasure upon earth.\nBorrowing without a probability of paying, or taking up goods without a probability of paying for them.\n\n5. It is expected of all who continue in these Societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation.\n\nSecondly. By doing good, by being in every kind merciful after their power, as they have opportunity, doing good of every possible sort, and, as far as possible, to all men.\nTo their bodies, of the ability which God giveth, by giving food to the hungry, by clothing the naked, by visiting or helping them that are sick or in prison.\n\nTo their souls, by instructing, reproofing, or exhorting all we have any intercourse with; trampling under foot that enthusiastic doctrine, that \"we are not to do good, unless our hearts are free to it.\"\n\nBy doing good, especially to them that are of the household of faith, or groaning so to be; employing them preferably to others; buying one of another; helping each other in business; and so much the more, because the world will love its own, and them only.\n\nBy all possible diligence and frugality, that the gospel be not blamed.\n\nBy running with patience the race which is set before them, denying themselves, and taking up their cross daily; submitting to bear the reproach of Christ, to be as of the filth and offscouring of the world; and looking that men should say all manner of evil of them falsely for the Lord's sake.\n\n6. It is expected of all who desire to continue in these Societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation.\n\nThirdly. By attending to all the ordinances of God,\u2014such as:\n\nThe public worship of God.\nThe ministry of the word, either read or expounded.\nThe Supper of the Lord.\nFamily and private prayer.\nSearching the Scriptures, and\nFasting or abstinence.\n\n7. These are the general rules of our Societies; all of\nwhich we are taught of God to observe, even in his written word, which is the only rule, and the sufficient rule, both of our faith and practice. And all these we know his Spirit writes on truly awakened hearts. If there be any among us who observe them not, who habitually break any of them, let it be known unto them who watch over that soul, as they who must give an account. We will admonish him of the error of his ways. We will bear with him for a season. But, if then he repent not, he hath no more place among us. We have delivered our own souls.\n\nSECTION II.\n\nOF THE BAND SOCIETIES.\n\nTwo, three, or four true believers, who have confidence in each other, form a band:\u2014only it is to be observed, that in each of these bands, all must be men, or all women; and all married, or all unmarried.\n\nRules of the Band Societies, drawn up December 25, 1738.\n\nThe design of our meeting is to obey that command of God, Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.\u2014James v. 16.\n\nTo this end we agree,\u2014\n1. To meet once a week at least.\n2. To come punctually at the hour appointed; unless some extraordinary reason prevents.\n3. To begin exactly at the hour with singing or prayer.\n4. To speak, each of us in order, freely and plainly, the true state of our souls, with the faults we have committed\nin tempers, words, or actions, and the temptations we have felt since our last meeting.\n\n5. To end every meeting with prayer, suited to the state of each person present.\n\n6. To desire some person among us to speak his own state first, and then to ask the rest in order, as many and as searching questions as may be, concerning their state, sins, and temptations.\n\nSome of the questions proposed to one before he is admitted among us may be to this effect:\n\n1. Have you the forgiveness of your sins?\n2. Have you peace with God, through Our Lord Jesus Christ?\n3. Have you the witness of God's Spirit with your spirit that you are a child of God?\n4. Is the love of God shed abroad in your heart?\n5. Has no sin, inward or outward, dominion over you?\n6. Do you desire to be told of your faults?\n7. Do you desire to be told of all your faults, and that plain and home?\n8. Do you desire that every one of us should tell you, from time to time, whatsoever is in his heart concerning you?\n9. Consider! Do you desire we should tell you whatsoever we hear concerning you?\n10. Do you desire that in doing this we should come as close as possible, that we should cut to the quick, and search your heart to the bottom?\n11. Is it your desire and design to be on this, and all other occasions, entirely open, so as to speak without disguise and without reserve?\n\nAny of the preceding questions may be asked as often as occasion requires; the four following at every meeting:\n1. What known sins have you committed since our last meeting?\n2. What particular temptations have you met with?\n3. How were you delivered?\n4. What have you thought, said, or done, of which you doubt whether it be sin or not?\n\nDirections given to the Band Society, December 25th, 1744.\n\nYou are supposed to have the Faith that overcometh the world. To you, therefore, it is not grievous,\n\nI. Carefully to abstain from doing evil; in particular,\n   1. To neither buy nor sell anything at all on the Lord's-day.\n   2. To taste no spirituous liquor, no dram of any kind, unless prescribed by a physician.\n   3. To be at a word in buying or selling.\n   4. Not to mention the faults of any behind his back, and to stop those short that do.\n   5. To wear no needless ornaments, such as rings, earrings, necklaces, lace, or ruffles.\n   6. To use no needless self-indulgence.\n\nII. Zealously to maintain good works; in particular,\n   1. To give alms of such things as you possess, and that according to your ability.\n   2. To reprove those who sin in your sight, and that in love and meekness of wisdom.\n   3. To be patterns of diligence and frugality, of self-denial, and taking up the cross daily.\n\nIII. Constantly to attend on all the ordinances of God; in particular,\n1. To be at church, and at the Lord's table, and at every public meeting of the Bands, at every opportunity.\n\n2. To use private prayer every day; and family prayer, if you are the head of a family.\n\n3. Frequently to read the Scriptures, and meditate thereon. And,\n\n4. To observe as days of fasting or abstinence all Fridays in the year.\n\n---\n\nSection III.\n\nOF CLASS MEETINGS.\n\nQues. 1. How may the Leaders of Classes be rendered more useful?\n\nAns. 1. Let each of them be diligently examined concerning his method of meeting a Class. Let this be done with all possible exactness, at least once a quarter. In order to this take sufficient time.\n\n2. Let each Leader carefully inquire how every soul in his Class prospers: not only how each person observes the outward rules, but how he grows in the knowledge and love of God.\n\n3. Let the Leaders converse frequently and freely with those who have the charge of their Circuits.\n\nQues. 2. Can anything more be done in order to make the Class Meetings lively and profitable?\n\nAns. 1. Change improper Leaders.\n\n2. Let the Leaders frequently meet each other's Classes.\n\n3. Let us observe which Leaders are the most useful; and let these meet the other Classes as often as possible.\n\n4. See that all the Leaders be not only men of sound judgment, but men truly devoted to God.\n5. As a general rule let no Leader have charge of more than one Class.\n\nQues. 3. How shall we prevent improper persons from insinuating themselves into the Church?\n\nAns. 1. Give Tickets to none until they are recommended by a Leader, with whom they have met at least three months on trial.\n\n2. Give trial tickets to none but those who are recommended by one you know, or until they have met three or four times in a Class.\n\n3. Read the rules to them the first time they meet.\n\n4. Private members in connection with other Evangelical Churches, or with any seceding body of Methodists, who make application for admission into our Church, may be received by the Ministers on the Circuit as members without the usual term of probation.\n\nQues. 4. What shall we do with those members of our Church who wilfully and repeatedly neglect to meet in Class?\n\nAns. 1. Let the Chairman, or one of the Preachers, visit them whenever it is practicable, and explain to them the consequence if they continue to neglect, viz., exclusion.\n\n2. If they do not amend, let him who has the charge of the Circuit exclude them, (in the church), showing that they are laid aside for a breach of our rules of Discipline, and not for immoral conduct.\n\nQues. 5. How often shall we permit those who are not of our Church to be present at our Class Meetings and Love-feasts?\n\nAns. Let them be admitted with the utmost caution, and, to the Love-feast, not without a note of admittance.\nSECTION IV.\n\nOF MARRIAGE.\n\nQues. 1. Do we observe any evil which has prevailed in our Church with respect to marriage?\n\nAns. Many of our members have married with unawakened persons. This has produced bad effects: they have been either hindered for life, or have turned back to perdition.\n\nQues. 2. What can be done to discourage this?\n\nAns. 1. Let every Minister or Preacher publicly enforce the Apostle's caution, \"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.\"\u20142 Cor. vi. 14.\n\n2. Let him declare, whoever does this will be put back on trial for three months.\n\n3. When any such is put back on trial, let a suitable exhortation be subjoined.\n\n4. Let all be exhorted to take no steps in so weighty a matter, without advising with the most serious of their brethren.\n\nQues. 3. Ought any woman to marry without the consent of her parents?\n\nAns. In general she ought not. Yet there may be exceptions. For if, 1st. A woman believe it to be her duty to marry; if, 2nd. Her parents absolutely refuse to let her marry any Christian, then she may, nay, ought to, marry without their consent. Yet even then, a Methodist Preacher ought not to be married to her.\n\nWe do not prevent our people from marrying persons who are not of our Church, provided such persons have the\nform and are seeking the power of godliness; but we are determined to discourage their marrying persons who do not come up to this description. And even in a doubtful case, the member shall be put back on trial.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION V.**\n\n**OF DRESS.**\n\n*Ques.* Should we insist on the rules concerning dress?\n\n*Ans.* By all means. This is no time to give any encouragement to superfluity of apparel; therefore, give no tickets to any till they have left off superfluous ornaments. In order to this, 1. Let every one who has the charge of a circuit read the thoughts upon dress, at least once a year, in every large society. 2. In visiting the classes, be very mild, but very strict. 3. Allow of no exempt case:\u2014Better one suffer than many. 4. Give no tickets to any, who, in their mode of dress, exceed the plainness and moderation enjoined in the New Testament.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nOF BRINGING MINISTERS AND MEMBERS TO TRIAL, AND OF INSOLVENCIES AND THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nOF THE TRIAL OF MINISTERS AND TRAVELLING PREACHERS.\n\nQues. 1. What shall be done when a Minister or Preacher is under report of being guilty of some crime expressly forbidden in the word of God, as an unchristian practice, sufficient to exclude a person from the kingdom of grace and glory?\n\nAns. 1. If the accused be the President of the Conference, the Co-Delegate\u2014or in his absence the Chairman of the District on which the President resides\u2014is required to select a Committee of at least five Ministers to investigate the case, and shall preside at the trial.\n\n2. The presiding officer shall furnish the accused, in due time, with an exact copy of the charge, or charges, and specifications in writing, and the time and place of trial.\n\n3. If the accused be the Co-Delegate, a Missionary Secre-\ntary, or a Chairman of a District, the President of Conference\u2014or in his absence a Deputy appointed by him, who shall be a Chairman of a District\u2014shall select the Committee to investigate the case, and shall preside at the trial.\n\n4. If the accused be a Minister, or a Travelling Preacher, then,\u2014\n   1. Let the Chairman, in the absence of the President, call as many Ministers as he shall think fit\u2014at least three\u2014and if possible bring the accused and the accuser face to face.\n   2. If the person be clearly convicted, he shall be admonished, reproved, suspended, or dealt with as the Committee may judge expedient, until the next ensuing District Meeting.\n   3. If the accuser and the accused cannot be brought face to face, but the alleged delinquent evades trial, it shall be received as presumptive proof of guilt, and out of the mouth of two or three witnesses he shall be condemned. Nevertheless, in that case, as well as in all others, the District Meeting shall examine into it; shall dispose of the case as it judges expedient; and shall report to the Conference, where the whole matter shall be finally determined.\n   4. If a Minister or Preacher be charged with immorality between the time of holding the District Meeting and the Conference, a Committee chosen as above directed shall investigate the matter, and shall have authority to admonish, reprove, or suspend the offender until the Conference, when the case shall be finally determined.\n   5. If there be a difference between any of the Ministers or Preachers, the respective parties shall choose two Ministers; and the Chairman of the District on which the respondent resides, with the four Ministers so chosen, shall be the final arbitrators to determine the matter in dispute.\n6. In case of dispute between a Minister or Preacher and any one of our members, relative to matters of secular business, the Chairman of the District shall recommend an arbitration, over which he shall preside, consisting of a Minister or lay member of our Church, chosen by each of the parties; which two persons thus chosen shall call a third member or Minister, to whom the matter shall be referred. In case of the failure of this arbitration to satisfy either of the parties, the dissatisfied party may proceed against the other before our regular Church courts.\n\n7. If any Minister or Preacher shall have contracted debts which he is not able to pay, let the Chairman appoint three judicious Ministers to be a Committee of inquiry into the circumstances of the supposed delinquent, and if, in their opinion, he has acted dishonestly, or contracted debts without a probability of paying, let him be reproved, suspended, or disposed of as the Committee may judge expedient, until the next ensuing District Meeting.\n\n8. In every case of equality the Chairman shall have a casting vote.\n\nQues. 2. What shall be done in cases of improper tempers, words, or actions?\n\nAns. The person so offending shall be reproved by his senior in office. Should a second transgression take place, one or more Ministers or Preachers shall be taken as witnesses. If he be not then cured, he shall be tried at the next District Meeting.\n\nQues. 3. What shall be done with those Ministers or Preachers who may hold, and disseminate publicly or privately, doctrines which are contrary to our Articles of Religion?\n\nAns. Let the same process be observed as in cases of gross immorality; but if the Minister or Preacher so offend-\ning do solemnly engage not to disseminate such erroneous doctrines, in public or in private, he shall be borne with until his case be laid before the next Conference, which shall determine the matter.\n\nQues. 4. What shall be done in case any Minister or Travelling Preacher follow a trade, or be engaged in any secular business?\n\nAns. If any Travelling Minister, Preacher, or Missionary be employed in, or carry on any trade, he shall, on proof thereof, be excluded from the Itinerant Plan; as we judge such pursuit of private emolument is incompatible with our Ministerial duties. No Minister or Preacher who will not relinquish his trade of buying and selling, though it were only pills, drops, or balsams, shall be considered a Minister or Travelling Preacher any longer. Selling our own books is an exception.\n\nSection II.\n\nOF THE TRIAL OF LOCAL PREACHERS.\n\n1. When charges are preferred against a Local Preacher, the accused and the accuser shall respectively choose two Local Preachers, or other official members on the circuit; or, in the event of either or both parties refusing to make the necessary choice, the Superintendent shall name such persons as he may deem proper, being official members, to constitute the Committee, and shall, with the said Committee, try the accused preacher, and they shall have authority, if he be found guilty, to admonish, reprove, or suspend him, till the ensuing Local Preachers' Meeting, or Quarterly Official Meeting, when the whole matter shall be determined.\n2. The Superintendent shall, on receiving a complaint against a Local Preacher, send a copy of the charge, or charges, and specifications, to the person accused, with the name of the accuser or accusers, before he calls a Committee to examine into the charge; and shall have a casting vote in case of equality.\n\nQues. What shall be done in cases of improper tempers, words, or actions?\n\nAns. The person so offending shall be reprehended by the Superintendent. Should a second transgression take place, one or more faithful friends shall be taken as witnesses. If he be not cured, he shall be tried at the next Local Preachers' Meeting, or Quarterly Official Meeting of the Circuit, and if found guilty and impenitent he shall be expelled from the Church.\n\nQues. 2. What shall be done when a Local Preacher fails in business, or contracts debts which he is not able to pay?\n\nAns. 1. The Superintendent Minister shall appoint three judicious members of the Church to inspect the accounts, contracts, and circumstances of the supposed delinquent; and if, in their opinion, he has behaved dishonestly, or contracted debts without the probability of paying, he shall be suspended until the ensuing Local Preachers' Meeting, or Quarterly Official Meeting, which shall examine into, and determine the case.\n\n2. In every case, a Local Preacher under censure, or suspension by the Local Preachers' Meeting, or the Quarterly Official Meeting, shall have the right of appeal to the ensuing District Meeting, by giving notice of his intention to do so at the time of such suspension.\nSection I.II.\n\nOF THE TRIAL OF MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH.\n\nQues. How shall an accused member be brought to trial?\n\nAns. 1. Before the Society of which he is a member, or a select number of them, in the presence of the President, Chairman, Minister or Preacher, in the following manner:\n\n\u2014Let the accused and the accuser be brought face to face; but if this cannot be done, let the next best evidence be procured. If the accused person be found guilty, by a decision of a majority of the members before whom he is brought to trial, and the crime be such as is expressly forbidden by the Word of God, sufficient to exclude a person from the kingdom of grace and glory, let the Minister or Preacher who has the charge of the Circuit expel him. If the accused person evade a trial, by absenting himself, after sufficient notice given him, and the circumstances of the accusation be strong and presumptive, let him be esteemed as guilty, and accordingly excluded. Witnesses from without shall not be rejected.\n\n2. But in case of neglect of duties of any kind, imprudent conduct, indulging sinful tempers or words, or disobedience to the order and discipline of the Church:\u2014First, let private reproof be given by a Minister, Preacher or Leader. On a second offence, the Minister, Preacher or Leader, may take one or two faithful friends, and if there be acknowledgment of the fault and proper humiliation, we will bear with him for a season. On a third offence let the case be brought before the Society, or a select number, and if there be no sign of real humiliation, the offender must be cut off.\n3. If a member of our Church shall be tried and convicted of endeavouring to sow dissensions in any of our Societies, by inveighing against either our Doctrines or Discipline, such person so offending shall be first reproved by the Superintendent of his Circuit, and, if he persist in such pernicious practices, he shall be expelled from the Church.\n\n4. Nevertheless, if, in any of the above-mentioned cases, the Superintendent differ in judgment from the majority of the Society, or the select number, concerning the innocence or guilt of the accused person, the trial, in such case, may be referred by the Minister or Preacher to the ensuing Quarterly Official Meeting.\n\n5. If there be a murmur or complaint from an excluded person, in any of the above-mentioned instances, that justice has not been done, he shall be allowed an appeal to the next Quarterly Meeting: except such as absent themselves from trial, after sufficient notice is given them;\u2014and the majority of the Members of the Meeting present, shall finally determine the case.\n\n6. In all cases of trial the Chairman of the Committee shall cause exact minutes to be taken and recorded of the charges, testimony, and examination, together with the decision of the Committee: which record, when read and approved, shall be signed by the Chairman, and also by the members of such Committee who are present, or a majority of them, and be preserved among the official documents of the Circuit.\n\n7. On any dispute between two or more of the Members of our Church, concerning the payment of debts, or otherwise, which cannot be settled by the parties concerned, the Superintendent of the Circuit shall inquire into the circum-\nstances of the case, and shall recommend to the contending parties a reference, consisting of one arbitrator chosen by the plaintiff, and another chosen by the defendant, which two arbitrators so chosen, shall nominate a third,\u2014the three arbitrators being Members of our Church.\n\nIn all cases of arbitration, the report thereof shall be handed to the Superintendent of the Circuit.\n\n8. But if one of the parties be dissatisfied with the judgment given, such party may apply to the ensuing Quarterly Official Meeting of the Circuit for permission to have a second arbitration appointed; and if the Meeting see sufficient reason, they shall grant a second arbitration, in which case each party shall choose two arbitrators, and the four arbitrators shall choose a fifth, the judgment of the majority of whom shall be final; and any person refusing to abide by it shall be excluded from the Church.\n\n9. And if any Member of our Church shall refuse, in case of debt or other disputes, to refer the matter to arbitration, when recommended by the Superintendent of the Circuit, or shall enter into a law-suit with another Member before these measures are taken, he shall be expelled, unless the case be of such a nature as to require and justify a process at law.\n\n10. The Superintendents of Circuits are required to execute all our rules fully and strenuously against all frauds, and particularly against dishonest insolvencies, suffering none to remain in the Church on any account, who are found guilty of any fraud.\n\n11. To prevent scandal, when any of our Members fail in business, or contract debts which they are not able to pay, let two or three judicious Members of the Church inspect the accounts of the supposed delinquent; and if he has\nbehaved dishonestly, or borrowed money without a probability of paying, let him be expelled.\n\n12. Whenever a complaint is made against a Member of the Church, for non-payment of debt\u2014when the accounts are adjusted and the amount ascertained\u2014the Superintendent shall call the debtor before a Committee of at least three, to show cause why he does not make payment. The Committee shall determine what further time shall be granted him for payment, and what security, if any, shall be given for payment; and in case the debtor refuses to comply, he shall be expelled; but in such case he may appeal to the Quarterly Official Meeting, and their decision shall be final. And in case the creditor complains that justice is not done him, he may lay his grievance before the Quarterly Official Meeting, and their decision shall be final; and if the creditor refuses to comply, he shall be expelled.\n\n13. After such form of trial and expulsion, such persons shall have no privileges of Society, or Sacraments in our Church, without contrition, confession, and proper trial.\n\n14. In all judicial proceedings, arbitrations, or committees of inquiry, involving the standing, or Church relation, of any of our Ministers or members, the President, or a Chairman of a District, or a Minister, or Preacher shall preside.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTEMPORAL ECONOMY.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nOF THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CONFERENCE, &c.\n\nThere shall be one Conference in Canada, which shall meet once a year.\n\nQues. 1. How are the Districts to be formed?\nAns. According to the judgment of the President and Stationing Committee.\n\nQues. 2. How are Circuits and Missions to be formed?\nAns. By the Stationing Committee, on the recommendation of the District Meeting; provided nevertheless, that circuits supporting their own ministers or preachers shall not be divided till such divisions have been approved of by their respective Quarterly Meetings, and their approval signified in writing by the Recording Steward; or, otherwise, by a two-thirds vote of the Annual District Meeting, when the Stewards are present.\n\n3. On the Division of a Circuit, no minister who has travelled successively the three preceding years on such Circuit shall be appointed to either part of it\u2014nevertheless,\nthis rule shall not apply to those places which may be transferred in adjusting the work by the District Meeting, which transfer has been sanctioned by the Stationing Committee.\n\nSECTION II.\n\nOF THE SALARIES OF MINISTERS AND PREACHERS, AND THE ALLOWANCES TO THEIR WIVES, WIDOWS, AND CHILDREN.\n\n1. The salary of a married Minister shall be $240 per annum, and his travelling expenses.\n\n2. The salary of a Preacher on trial shall be $140, and his travelling expenses.\n\n3. A Minister's salary after he is received into full connexion and ordained, shall be $180 per annum, while he remains single.\n\n4. No reduction shall be made in a Minister's salary during the year, in the event of the death of his wife.\n\n5. Each child of a Travelling Minister, born after the father was received into full connexion with the Conference and ordained, shall be allowed $30 per annum until 18 years of age\u2014if not otherwise provided for.\n\n6. The children of Superannuated Ministers shall receive from the Children's Fund according to the provisions of that fund.\n\nScale of Allowances to Superannuated Ministers, and the Widows of Ministers who have died in the Work.\n\n1.

Ministers who retire temporarily from the work, on account of ill health or accident, while they receive from the Superannuated Ministers' Fund, according to their years of service, shall not be precluded from receiving aid, to such amount as the Conference may recommend, from the Contingent or Missionary Fund, as they may have been engaged in regular or mission work.\n\n7.

Amen.\n\nO merciful God, grant that the old Adam in [this child] may be so buried, that the new man may be raised up in [him.] Amen.\n\nGrant that all carnal affections may die in [him,] and that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow in [him]. Amen.\n\nGrant that [he] may have power and strength to have victory, and to triumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh. Amen.\n\nGrant that whosoever is dedicated to thee by our office and Ministry, may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly rewarded through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who dost live and govern all things, world without end. Amen.\nAlmighty, ever living God, whose most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of our sins, did shed out of his most precious side both water and blood, and gave commandment to his Disciples that they should go teach all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Regard, we beseech thee, the supplications of this congregation; and grant that [this child,] now to be baptized, may receive the fulness of thy grace, and be found at last in the number of thy faithful and elect children, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThen shall the people stand up: and the Minister shall say,\u2014Hear the words of the Gospel, written by St. Mark, in the tenth chapter, beginning at the thirteenth verse:\u2014\n\nThey brought young children to Christ, that he should touch them. And his Disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.\n\nThen the Minister shall take the child in his arms, and say to the Parents or Friends of the Child, \"Name the Child,\" and then, naming it after them, he shall Baptize the Child, saying,\n\nN. I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\nThen shall be said, all kneeling,\n\nOur Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\nThy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.\n\nThen the Minister may conclude with extempore prayer.\n\n---\n\nSECTION II.\n\nTHE MINISTRATION OF BAPTISM TO ADULTS.\n\nThe Minister shall use the following, or some other exhortation suitable to this holy office.\n\nDearly beloved, forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin, (and that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and they that are in the flesh cannot please God, but live in sin, committing many actual transgressions;) and our Saviour Christ saith, None can enter into the kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of water and of the Holy Ghost; I beseech you to call upon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that, of his bounteous goodness he will grant to [these persons,] that which by nature[they] cannot have; that[they] may be baptised, not only with water but also with the Holy Ghost, and received into Christ's holy Church, and be made lively [members] of the same.\n\nThen shall the Minister say,\n\nAlmighty and immortal God, the aid of all that need, the helper of all that flee to thee for succour, the life of them that believe, and the resurrection of the dead; We call upon thee for [these persons;] that[they,] coming to thy holy baptism, may\nbe filled with the Holy Ghost. Receive [them], O Lord, as thou hast promised by thy well-beloved Son, saying,\u2014Ask and ye shall receive,\u2014seek and ye shall find,\u2014knock and it shall be opened unto you: So give now unto us that ask; let us that seek find; open the gate unto us that knock; that [these persons] may enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly washing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised by Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nAfter which he shall say,\n\nAlmighty and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble thanks for that thou hast vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee; increase this knowledge and confirm this faith in us evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to [these persons], that [they] may be made [heirs] of everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, now and forever. Amen.\n\nO merciful God, grant that the old Adam in [these persons] may be so buried that the new man may be raised up in [them]. Amen.\n\nGrant that all carnal affections may die in [them], and that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow in [them]. Amen.\n\nGrant that [they] may have power and strength to have victory, and to triumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh. Amen.\n\nGrant that [they,] being here dedicated to thee by our office and Ministry, may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly rewarded through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who dost live and govern all things, world without end. Amen.\nAlmighty, ever living God, whose most dearly beloved Son, Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of our sins, did shed out of his most precious side both water and blood, and gave commandment to his disciples that they should go teach all nations, and baptise them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Regard, we beseech thee, the supplications of this congregation, and grant that [these persons] now to be baptised may receive the fulness of thy grace, and be found, at last, in the number of thy faithful and elect children, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThen shall the people stand up, and the Minister shall say,\u2014Hear the words of the Gospel, written by St. John, in the third chapter, beginning at the first verse:\n\nThere was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof; but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\nThen the Minister shall speak to the Persons to be Baptised on this wise:\n\nWell-beloved, who [have] come hither, desiring to receive holy baptism, [ye] have heard how the congregation have prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to receive you, and bless you, to release you of your sins, to give you the kingdom of heaven and everlasting life. And our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised, in his Holy Word, to grant all those things that we have prayed for; which promise he for his part will most assuredly keep and perform.\n\nWherefore, after this promise made by Christ, you must also faithfully, for your part, promise, in the presence of this whole congregation, that you will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly believe God's Holy Word, and obediently keep his Commandments.\n\nThen shall the Minister demand of each of the Persons to be Baptised, severally:\n\nQues. Dost thou renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow or be led by them?\n\nAns. I renounce them all.\n\nQues. Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth? and in Jesus Christ his only begotten Son our Lord? and that he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary? that He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried? that he arose again the third day? that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, and from thence he shall come again, at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead?\n\nAnd dost thou believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy Catholic Church; the Communion of Saints; the Remission\nof Sins; the Resurrection of the Body, and Everlasting Life after death?\n\nAns. All this I steadfastly believe.\n\nQues. Wilt thou be baptised in this faith?\n\nAns. That is my desire.\n\nQues. Wilt thou then obediently keep God's holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the days of thy life?\n\nAns. I will endeavour so to do, God being my helper.\n\nThen shall the Minister ask the name of the person to be baptised, and repeating the name shall baptise him, saying:\n\nN, I Baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\nThen shall be said the Lord's Prayer, all kneeling.\n\nOur Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.\n\nThe Minister may conclude with extempore prayer.\n\nSection III.\n\nOF THE LORD'S SUPPER.\n\nTHE ORDER FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.\n\nWhile the Collection for the Poor is being taken up, the Minister shall say one or more of these sentences:\n\nLet your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\u2014Matt. v. 16.\nLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\u2014Matt. vi. 19, 20.\n\nWhatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.\u2014Matt. vii. 12.\n\nNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.\u2014Matt. vi. 21.\n\nZaccheus stood forth and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have done any wrong to any man I restore him fourfold.\u2014Luke xix. 8.\n\nHe that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Let every man do according as he is disposed in his heart; not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.\u20142 Cor. ix. 6, 7.\n\nAs we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.\u2014Gal. vi. 10.\n\nGodliness with contentment is great gain; for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.\u20141 Tim. vi. 6, 7.\n\nCharge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves\na good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u20141 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19.\n\nFor God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.\u2014Heb. vi. 10.\n\nBut to do good and to communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\u2014Heb. xiii. 16.\n\nBut whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?\u20141 John iii. 17.\n\nHe that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.\u2014Prov. xix. 17.\n\nBlessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.\u2014Psalm xli. 1.\n\nWhile these sentences are being read, some fit person, appointed for that purpose, shall receive the alms for the poor; and then bring them to the Minister, who shall place them upon the table.\n\nAfter which the Minister shall say:\n\nYe that do truly and earnestly repent of your sins, and are in love and charity with your neighbours, and intend to lead a new life, following the commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in His Holy ways; draw near with faith and take this Holy Sacrament to your comfort; and make your humble confession to Almighty God, meekly kneeling upon your knees.\n\nThen shall this general confession be made by the Minister, in the name of all those that are minded to receive the Holy Communion, both he and all the people kneeling humbly upon their knees, and saying:\n\nAlmighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things, Judge of all men: we acknowledge and bewail\nour manifold sins and wickedness, which we from time to time most grievously have committed, by thought, word, and deed, against thy Divine Majesty, provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us. We do earnestly repent and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings; the remembrance of them is grievous unto us. Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful Father, for thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, forgive us all that is past; and grant that we may ever hereafter serve and please thee in newness of life, to the honour and glory of thy name, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThen shall the Minister say:\n\nO Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of thy great mercy hast promised forgiveness of sins to all them that with hearty repentance and true faith turn unto thee; have mercy upon us; pardon and deliver us from all our sins, confirm and strengthen us in all goodness, and bring us to everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThe Collect.\n\nAlmighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid; cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy Holy Name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThen shall the Minister say:\n\nIt is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all times and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord, Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God.\nTherefore, with angels and archangels, and with all the company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name, evermore praising thee, and saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, heaven and earth are full of thy glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord most high. Amen.\n\nWe do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy table. But thou art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy; Grant us, therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his blood, that our sinful souls and bodies may be made clean by his death, and washed through his most precious blood, and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.\n\nThen the Minister shall offer the Prayer of Consecration, as followeth:\n\nAlmighty God, our heavenly Father, who of thy tender mercy didst give thy only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death upon the cross for our redemption; who made there (by his oblation of himself once offered) a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world: and did institute, and in his holy Gospel command us to continue a perpetual memory of that his precious death, until his coming again: hear us, O merciful Father, we most humbly beseech thee, and grant that we, receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine, according to thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed\nBody and Blood, who in the same night that he was betrayed, took bread; (1) and when (1) Here the Minister may take the plate of bread into his hand. he had given thanks he brake it (2) and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take eat; this (3) is my body which is given for you; Do this in (3) And here may break the bread. remembrance of me. Likewise after supper he took (4) the cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this; for this (5) is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you, and for many, for the remission of sins; this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. Amen.\n\nThen shall the Minister first receive the communion in both kinds himself, and then proceed to deliver the same to other Ministers in like manner (if any be present), and after that to the people also, in order, into their uncovered hands. And when he delivereth the bread, he shall say:\n\nThe Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy soul and body unto everlasting life. Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by faith, with thanksgiving.\n\nAnd the Minister that delivereth the cup shall say:\n\nThe blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee, preserve thy soul and body unto everlasting life. Drink this in remembrance that Christ's blood was shed for thee, and be thankful.\nIf the consecrated Bread or Wine be all spent before all have communicated, the Minister may consecrate more, by repeating the Prayer of Consecration.\n\nWhen all have communicated, the Minister shall return to the Lord's Table, and place upon it what remaineth of the consecrated elements, covering the same with a fair linen cloth.\n\nThen shall the Minister say the Lord's Prayer; the people repeating after him every petition.\n\nOur Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name; Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven; Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nAfter which shall be said as followeth:\n\nO Lord our heavenly Father, we thy humble servants desire thy Fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits and death of thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we and thy whole church may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of his passion. And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy and lively sacrifice unto thee; humbly beseeching thee that all we who are partakers of this holy Communion, may be filled with thy grace and heavenly benediction. And although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any sacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service; not weighing our\nmerits but pardoning our offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord: by whom, and with whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.\n\nThen shall be said:\n\nGlory be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.\n\nO Lord, the only begotten Son Jesus Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon us.\n\nFor thou only art holy, thou only art the Lord; thou only, O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the Glory of God the Father. Amen.\n\nThen the Minister, if he see it expedient, may offer an extempore Prayer; and afterwards shall let the people depart with this blessing:\n\nMay the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost be amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen.\n\nN.B.\u2014If the Minister be straitened for time, he may omit any part of the service, except the prayer of Consecration.\nFORM AND MANNER OF ORDAINING MINISTERS.\n\nSECTION IV.\n\nTHE FORM AND MANNER OF ORDAINING MINISTERS.\n\n[When the day appointed by the President is come, there shall be a Sermon, or exhortation, declaring the Duty and Office of such as come to be admitted Ministers: how necessary that order is in the Church of Christ, and also how the people ought to esteem them in their office.]\n\nAfter which, one of the Ministers shall present unto the President all them that are to be ordained, and say:\n\nI present unto you these persons present to be ordained Ministers.\n\nThen their names being read aloud, the President shall say unto the People:\n\nBrethren, these are they whom we purpose, God willing, this day to ordain Ministers. For, after due examination, we find not to the contrary, but that they are lawfully called to this function and ministry, and that they are persons meet for the same. But if there be any of you who knoweth any impediment or crime in any of them, for the which he ought not to be received in this holy Ministry, let him come forth in the name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is.\n\n[If any crime or impediment be objected, the President shall surcease from ordaining that person until such time as the party accused shall be found clear of the crime.]\n\nThen shall be said the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, as followeth.\n\nThe Collect.\n\nAlmighty God, giver of all good things, who by the Holy Spirit hast appointed Ministers in thy Church; mercifully\nbehold these thy servants now called to the office of Ministers, and replenish them so with the truth of thy doctrine, and adorn them with innocency of life, that, both by word and good example, they may faithfully serve thee in this office, to the glory of thy name, and the edification of thy Church, through the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.\n\nThe Epistle. Eph. iv. 7-13.\n\nUnto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave some Apostles; and some Prophets; and some Evangelists; and some Pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\n\n[After this shall be read for the Gospel, part of the tenth chapter of St. John.]\n\nSt. John x. 1-16.\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him\nthe porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake Jesus unto them, but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door; by me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also must I bring, and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.\n\nAnd that done, the President shall say unto them as hereafter followeth:\n\nYou have heard, brethren, as well in your private examination as in the exhortation which was now made to you, and in the holy lessons taken out of the Gospel, and\nthe writings of the Apostles, of what dignity and of how great importance this office is whereunto you are called. And now again we exhort you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you have in remembrance into how high a dignity, and to how weighty an office ye are called. That is to say, to be messengers, watchmen, and stewards of the Lord, to teach and to premonish, to feed and provide for the Lord's family, to seek for Christ's sheep that are dispersed abroad, and for his children who are in the midst of this evil world, that they may be saved through Christ for ever.\n\nHave always, therefore, in remembrance how great a treasure is committed to your charge. For they are the sheep of Christ, which he bought with his death, and for whom he shed his blood. The church and congregation whom you must serve, is his spouse, and his body. And if it shall happen the same church, or any member thereof, do take any hurt or hindrance by reason of your negligence, ye know the greatness of the fault, and also the horrible punishment that will ensue. Wherefore consider with yourselves the end of the Ministry towards the children of God, towards the spouse and body of Christ; and see that you never cease your labour, your care and diligence, until you have done all that lieth in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all such as are or shall be committed to your charge, unto that agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeness and perfectness of age in Christ, that there be no place left among you either for error in religion or for viciousness in life.\n\nForasmuch, then, as your office is both of so great excellency and of so great difficulty, ye see with how great care and study ye ought to apply yourselves, as well that ye may show\nyourselves dutiful and thankful unto that Lord who hath placed you in so high a dignity, as also to beware that neither you yourselves offend, nor be occasion that others offend. Howbeit ye cannot have a mind and will thereto of yourselves; for that will and ability is given of God alone: Therefore ye ought, and have need to pray earnestly for his Holy Spirit. And seeing that ye cannot compass the doing of so weighty a work, pertaining to the salvation of man, but with doctrine and exhortation taken out of the Holy Scriptures, and with a life agreeable to the same; consider how studious ye ought to be in reading and learning the Scriptures, and in framing the manners both of yourselves and of them that specially pertain unto you, according to the rule of the same Scriptures; and, for this self-same cause, how ye ought to forsake and set aside (as much as you may) all worldly cares and studies.\n\nWe have good hope that you have all weighed and pondered these things long before this time; and that you have clearly determined, by God's grace, to give yourselves wholly to this office whereunto it hath pleased God to call you; so that, as much as lieth in you, you will apply yourselves wholly to this one thing, and draw all your cares and studies this way, and that you will continue to pray to God the Father, by the mediation of our only Saviour, Jesus Christ, for the heavenly assistance of the Holy Ghost, that, by the daily reading and weighing of the Scriptures, ye may wax riper and stronger in your Ministry; and that ye may so endeavor yourselves, from time to time, to sanctify the lives of you and yours, and to fashion them after the rule and doctrine of Christ, that ye may be wholesome and godly examples and patterns for the people to follow.\n\nAnd now that this present congregation of Christ here\nassembled may also understand your minds and wills in these things, and that this your promise may the more move you to do your duties,\u2014ye shall answer plainly to these things which we, in the name of God and his Church, shall demand of you touching the same.\n\nDo you think, in heart, that you are truly called, according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the office of a Minister?\n\nAns. I think so.\n\nThe President. Are you persuaded that the Holy Scriptures contain sufficiently all doctrine required of necessity for eternal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ? and are you determined out of the said Scriptures to instruct the people committed to your charge, and to teach nothing as required of necessity to eternal salvation but that which you shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved by the Scriptures?\n\nAns. I am so persuaded, and have so determined, by God's grace.\n\nThe President. Will you then give your faithful diligence always so to minister the Doctrines, and Sacraments, and Discipline of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded?\n\nAns. I will so do, by the help of the Lord.\n\nThe President. Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's word; and to use both public and private monitions and exhortations, as well to the sick as to the whole within your charge, as need shall require and occasion shall be given?\n\nAns. I will, the Lord being my helper.\n\nThe President. Will you be diligent in prayers and in reading of the Holy Scriptures, and in such studies as help\nto the knowledge of the same, laying aside the study of the world and the flesh.\n\nAns. I will endeavor so to do, the Lord being my helper.\n\nThe President. Will you be diligent to frame and fashion yourselves, and your families, according to the doctrines of Christ; and to make both yourselves and them, as much as in you lieth, wholesome examples and patterns to the flock of Christ?\n\nAns. I shall apply myself thereto, the Lord being my helper.\n\nThe President. Will you maintain and set forward, as much as lieth in you, quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people, and especially among them that are or shall be committed to your charge?\n\nAns. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.\n\nThe President. Will you reverently obey your chief Ministers, unto whom is committed the charge and government over you; following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions, submitting yourself to their godly judgments?\n\nAns. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.\n\nThen shall the President, standing up, say:\n\nAlmighty God, who hath given you this will to do all these things, grant also unto you strength and power to perform the same; that he may accomplish his work which he hath begun in you, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\n[After this the congregation shall be desired, secretly in their prayers, to make their humble supplications to God for all these things, for the which prayers there shall be silence kept for a space.]\nAfter which shall be said by the President, (the persons to be ordained Ministers all kneeling,) Veni, Creator, Spiritus, the President beginning, and the Ministers and others that are present answering by verse, as followeth:\n\nCome, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,\nAnd lighten with celestial fire.\nThou the anointing Spirit art,\nWho dost thy Seven-fold gifts impart.\nThy blessed Unction from above,\nIs comfort, life, and fire of love.\nEnable with perpetual light,\nThe dullness of our blinded sight.\nAnoint and cheer our soiled face\nWith the abundance of thy grace;\nKeep far our foes, give peace at home,\nWhere thou art guide, no ill can come.\nTeach us to know the Father, Son,\nAnd Thee, of both to be but one:\nThat through the ages all along,\nThis may be our endless song;\nPraise to thy eternal merit,\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nThat done, the President shall pray in this wise:\n\nAlmighty God and heavenly Father, who of thine infinite love and goodness towards us, hast given to us thy only and most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ to be our Redeemer and the Author of everlasting life; who, after he had made perfect our redemption by his death, and was ascended into heaven, sent abroad into the world his Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers; by whose labour and\nministry he gathered together a great flock in all parts of the world, to set forth the eternal praise of thy holy name; for these, so great benefits of thy eternal goodness, and for that thou hast vouchsafed to call these thy servants here present to the same office and ministry appointed for the salvation of mankind, we render unto thee most hearty thanks: We praise and worship thee; and we humbly beseech thee, by the same thy blessed Son, to grant unto all, who either here or elsewhere call upon thy name, that we may continue to show ourselves thankful unto thee for these and all other thy benefits, and that we may daily increase and go forward in the knowledge and faith of thee and thy Son, by the Holy Spirit. So that, as well by these thy Ministers, as by them over whom they shall be appointed thy Ministers, thy holy name may be for ever glorified, and thy blessed kingdom enlarged, through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the same Holy Spirit, world without end. Amen.\n\nWhen this prayer is ended, the President, with two or more of the Ministers present, shall lay their hands severally upon the head of every one that receiveth the order of Ministers; the Receivers humbly kneeling upon their knees, and the President saying:\n\nThe Lord pour upon thee the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a Minister in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands. And be thou a faithful Dispenser of the Word of God, and of his Holy Sacraments; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\nThen the President shall deliver to every one of them, kneeling, the Bible into his hands, saying:\n\nTake thou authority to preach the Word of God, and to administer the Holy Sacraments in the congregation.\nThen the President shall say:\n\nMost merciful Father, we beseech thee to send upon these thy servants thy heavenly blessing, that they may be clothed with righteousness, and that thy Word spoken by their mouths may have such success that it may never be spoken in vain. Grant also that we may have grace to hear and receive what they shall deliver out of thy most Holy Word, or agreeably to the same, as the means of our salvation; and that, in all our words and deeds, we may seek thy glory and the increase of thy kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nPrevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help, that, in all our works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally, by thy mercy, obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThe peace of God that passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessings of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be among you, and remain with you always. Amen.\n\nSection V.\n\nTHE FORM OF SOLEMNIZATION OF MATRIMONY.\n\nFirst, the Banns of all that are to be married together must be published in the Congregation three several Sundays, in the time of Divine Service, (unless they be otherwise qualified according to law,) the Minister saying, after the accustomed manner:\n\nI publish the Banns of Marriage between M of \u2014\u2014, and N of \u2014\u2014. If any of you know cause or just impediment\nwhy these two persons should not be joined together in holy Matrimony, ye are to declare it. This is the first [second or third] time of asking.\n\nAt the time appointed for the solemnization of Matrimony, the Persons to be married standing together, the man at the right hand of the woman, the Minister shall say:\n\nDearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the sight of God, and in the presence of these witnesses, to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony, which is an honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church; which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with his presence, and the first miracle that he wrought in Cana of Galilee, and is commended of St. Paul to be honorable among all men; and therefore is not by any to be enterprised or taken in hand unadvisedly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, and in the fear of God.\n\nInto which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined. Therefore, if any one can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.\n\nAnd also speaking unto the Persons that are to be married, he shall say:\n\nI require and charge you both, (as you will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if either of you know any impediment why you may not be lawfully joined together in Matrimony, you do now confess it. For be ye well assured, that so many as are coupled together otherwise than as God's word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their Matrimony lawful.\nIf no impediment be alleged, then shall the Minister say unto the Man:\n\nM, Wilt thou have this Woman to be thy wedded Wife, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?\n\nThe Man shall answer:\n\nI WILL.\n\nThen shall the Minister say unto the Woman:\n\nN, Wilt thou have this Man to be thy wedded Husband, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?\n\nThe Woman shall answer:\n\nI WILL.\n\nThen the Minister shall cause the Man with his right hand to take the Woman by her right hand, and to say after him, as followeth:\n\nI M, take thee N, to be my wedded Wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my faith.\n\nThen shall they loose their hands, and the Woman, with her right hand, taking the Man by his right hand, shall likewise say after the Minister:\n\nI N, take thee M, to be my wedded Husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for\nricher for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my faith.\n\nWhen the parties desire to be married with a ring, the following form may be used;\u2014The Man placing the ring upon the fourth finger of the Woman's left hand, shall say after the Minister:\n\nWith this Ring, a token and pledge of the Vow and Covenant now made between me and thee, I do thee wed, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\n\nThen shall the Minister say\u2014Let us Pray:\n\nO Eternal God, Creator and Preserver of all Mankind, Giver of all Spiritual Grace, the Author of Everlasting Life; send thy blessing upon these thy servants, this Man and this Woman, whom we bless in thy name; that as Isaac and Rebecca lived faithfully together, so these persons may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made, and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together, and live according to thy laws, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThen shall the Minister join their right hands together and say:\n\nThose whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.\n\nForasmuch as $M$ and $N$ have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have pledged their faith either to other, and have declared the same by joining of hands, and by the giving and receiving of a ring, I pronounce that they\nare Husband and Wife together,\u2014In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\nAnd the Minister shall add this blessing:\n\nGod the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you, and so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye may so live together in this life that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen.\n\nThen the Minister shall say:\n\nOur Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.\n\nThen shall the Minister say:\n\nO God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, bless this Man and this Woman, and sow the seed of eternal life in their hearts, that whatsoever in thy holy word they shall profitably learn, they may indeed fulfil the same. Look, O Lord, mercifully on them from heaven, and bless them. And as thou didst send thy blessings upon Abraham and Sarah, to their great comfort; so vouchsafe to send thy blessings upon this Man and this Woman, that they, obeying thy will, and always being in safety under thy protection, may abide in thy love unto their lives' end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nO God, who by thy mighty power hast made all things of\nnothing, who also (after other things set in order) didst appoint that out of man (created after thine own image and similitude) woman should take her beginning, and, knitting them together, didst teach that it should never be lawful to put asunder those whom thou by Matrimony hast made one; O God, who hast consecrated the state of Matrimony to such an excellent mystery that in it is signified and represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and his Church, look mercifully upon this Man and this Woman; that this Man may love his Wife according to thy Word, (as Christ did love his Spouse, the Church, who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it, even as his own flesh;) and also that this Woman may be loving and amiable, faithful and obedient to her husband; and in all quietness, sobriety and peace, be a follower of holy and godly matrons. O Lord, bless them both, and grant them to inherit thy everlasting kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThen shall the Minister say:\n\nAlmighty God, who at the beginning did create our first parents, Adam and Eve, and did sanctify and join them together in marriage, pour upon you the riches of his grace, sanctify and bless you, that ye may please him both in body and soul, and live together in holy love, unto your lives' end. Amen.\n\nSection VI.\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD.\n\n[N.B. The following or some other solemn service shall be used:]\n\nThe Minister meeting the Corpse, and going before it, shall say:\n\nI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;\nand whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die. John xi. 25, 26.\n\nI know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. Job xix. 25, 26, 27.\n\nWe brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. 1 Tim. vi. 7; Job i. 21.\n\nAt the grave, when the Corpse is laid in the earth, the Minister shall say:\n\nMan that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.\n\nIn the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased.\n\nYet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.\n\nThou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers, but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.\n\nThen, while the earth shall be cast upon the body by some standing by, the Minister shall say,\n\nForasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God in his infinite wisdom to remove the departed from among us, we now\ncommit [his] body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, awaiting the resurrection of the dead at the last great day.\n\nThen shall be said:\n\nI heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.\n\nThen shall the Minister say:\n\nLord have mercy upon us,\nChrist have mercy upon us,\nLord have mercy upon us,\n\nOur Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. Amen.\n\nThe Collect.\n\nO merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth and believeth in him shall not die eternally:\u2014We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this life we may rest in him; and, at the general resurrection on the last day, may be found acceptable in thy sight, and receive that blessing which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ our Mediator and Redeemer. Amen.\nThe Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.\n\nSECTION VII.\n\nTHE FORM OF RENEWING THE COVENANT.\n\n[After a short sermon, impressing upon every soul the importance of giving himself to God, and that without delay, each Preacher is recommended, on his first tour round his Circuit in the New Year, beginning the first Sabbath in January, to read the following directions, or some of them, in every congregation, and persuade as many as possible to make solemn Covenant with God, and by Divine grace, to keep the Covenant inviolate unto the day of His coming:]\n\nI. Get these three principles fixed in your heart: That things eternal are much more considerable than things temporal; that things not seen are as certain as the things that are seen; that upon your present choice depends your eternal lot. Choose Christ and his ways, and you are blessed for ever; refuse, and you are undone for ever. And then,\n\nII. Make your choice.\n\nTurn either to the right hand or to the left; lay both parts before you, with every link of each; Christ with his yoke, his cross, and his crown; or, the devil, with his wealth, his pleasure, and curse; and then put yourselves to it thus: \"Soul, thou seest what is before thee: what wilt thou do? Which wilt thou have, either the crown or the curse? If thou choosest the crown, remember that the day thou takest this, thou must be content to submit to the cross and yoke, the service and the sufferings of Christ, which are linked to it. What sayest thou? Hast thou rather take the gains\nand pleasures of sin, and venture on the curse? Or wilt thou yield thyself to Christ, and so make sure of the crown?\"\n\nIf your hearts fly off, and would fain waive the business, leave them not so. If you be unresolved, you are resolved; if you remain undetermined for Christ, you are determined for the devil. Therefore, give not off, but follow your hearts from day to day; let them not rest till the matter be brought to an issue; and see that you make a good choice.\n\nThis is your choosing the good part, God and the blessedness of the world to come, for your portion and happiness; and in this is included your renouncing the world and worldly happiness.\n\nIII. Embark with Christ.\n\nAdventure yourselves with him; cast yourselves upon his righteousness, as that which shall bring you to God; as a poor captive exile that is cast upon a strange land, a land of robbers and murderers, where he is ready to perish, and having no hope, either of abiding there, or of escaping home with life; and meeting at length with a pilot, that offers to transport him safely home, he embarks with him, and ventures himself, and all he hath, in his vessel. Do you likewise: you are exiles from the presence of God, and fallen into the hands of robbers and murderers; your sins are robbers, your pleasures are robbers, your companions are robbers and thieves. If you stay where you are you perish; and escape home of yourself you cannot. Christ offers, if you will venture with him, he will bring you home, he will bring you to God. Will you now say to him, \"Lord Jesus, wilt thou undertake for me? Wilt thou bring me to God, bring me into the Land of Promise?\"\nWith thee will I venture myself; I cast myself upon thee, upon thy blood, and thy righteousness; I lay up all my hopes, and venture my whole interest, soul and body, with thee.\n\nThis is closing with Christ as your Priest. And in this is included your renouncing your own righteousness: you can never, you will never, cast yourselves on him alone, till all your hopes in yourselves have given up the ghost.\n\nThere are two things which must necessarily be supposed, in order to a sinner's coming to Christ:\n\n1. A deep sense of his sin and misery.\n2. An utter despair of himself, and all things else besides Christ.\n\n1. A deep sense of sin and misery.\n\nNo man will regard a Saviour that doth not see himself a sinner; the whole regard not the physician. Therefore, it is said, that the Spirit of God, when he should come to christianize the world, should, in the first place, \"convince the world of sin.\" (John xvi. 8.) He shall convince the world of sin; he shall demonstrate them sinners, bring up their sins before their eyes; bring home their sins upon their consciences, and make them see them, and feel themselves most vile and filthy. Sin hides itself from the sinner's eyes, and all its vileness and deformity. But the Spirit of God plucks off the mantle, and makes sin appear to be sin; makes all the sinner's gods appear to be as so many devils; brings forth the blackness and filthiness of sin into sight, and makes the sinner see himself an unclean and abominable creature; and, withal, he brings forth the guilt of sin, awakens the sinner's conscience, and fills him with fear, terror, and amazement. In this respect he is called the Spirit of bondage, that works fear and trouble in the\nRENEWING THE COVENANT.\n\nheart. The Spirit's awakening a sleepy sinner, is a kind of awakening in hell. \"Lord what am I? What mean these legions round about me, these chains and fetters that are upon me? What means this black roll before mine eyes, of curses, and wrath, and woes? Lord, where am I? Have I been playing and sporting, and making merry, and my soul in such a case as this? But is there no hope of escaping out of this wretched state? I see there is no abiding thus. I am but a dead man, if I continue as I am. What must I do to be saved?\"\n\nWhen he is brought to this, there is some way made for his entertainment with Christ; yet this is not all that is needful, but he further must be brought to,\n\n2. An utter despair of himself, and all things else without Christ.\n\nBeing made sensible of his sin and his danger, a sinner will look for help and deliverance; but he will look everywhere else before he will look unto Christ; nothing will bring a sinner to Christ but absolute necessity. He will try to forsake his sins, and to see if by these means he may escape. He will have recourse to prayers, and sermons, and sacraments, and search if there be not salvation in them. But all these, though they be useful in their places, and indeed necessary, yet, looking no further, the sinner sees there is no salvation in them; his righteousness cannot save him,\u2014this is but rags; his duties cannot save him,\u2014these may be reckoned among his sins; ordinances cannot save him,\u2014these are but empty cisterns; and all tell him, \"You knock at a wrong door; salvation is not in us.\" \"Well, the Lord be merciful unto me,\" saith the sinner, \"What shall I do? Abide as I am I dare not, and how to help myself I know not: my praying will not save me; my\nhearing will not; if I give all my goods to the poor, if I should give my body to be burned, all this would not save my soul. Woe is me! what shall I do, and whither shall I go?\"\n\nAnd now being brought to this distress, to this utter loss, his despair drives him to the only door of hope that is left open. Then Christ will be acceptable, when he sees none but Christ can save him. The Apostle tells us, \"We are kept under the law, shut up unto the faith that should afterwards be revealed.\" (Gal. iii. 23.) All other doors were shut up against us; there was no hope of escaping but by that one door which was left open. \"The faith that was afterwards to be revealed.\" As the besieged in a city, that have every gate blocked up, and but one difficult passage left open, by which there is any possibility of escaping, thither throng for the saving of their lives; they are shut up unto that door, to which (if there had been any other way open) they would never have come.\n\nAnd as Christ will never be accepted, so can the sinner never be received of him, till he lets go all other props, and trusts in Him alone. Christ will have no sharer with him in the work of saving souls. \"If ye seek me, let these go their way,\" as he said in another case; let not only your sins go, but all dependance on your righteousness, all the refuge of lies wherein you have trusted; let all go, if you will have me to be a refuge to you. I came not to call the righteous; if I should, they would not come; or if they come, let them go as they came, let them go to their righteousness in which they trust; and let naked, destitute sinners, distressed sinners, come to me; who am come to this end, to seek and to save them that are lost.\n\nSinners, will you come now? Will you venture here?\nFor this your adventuring on Christ, you have this three-fold warrant:\n\n1. God's Ordination. This is he whom God the Father hath appointed, and sent into the world, to bring back his exiles to himself, to save sinners. This is he whom God the Father hath sealed, hath marked him out for that chosen person in whom is salvation; hath sealed him his commission, for the redeeming and reconciling the world to himself. As God said unto the three friends of Job, when he was angry with them, \"Go to my servant Job, and he shall offer sacrifice for you; he shall pray for you, for him will I accept.\" (Job xlii. 8.) So to sinners: Go, saith the Lord, to my servant Jesus; he shall offer sacrifice for you, he shall make reconciliation for you. \"Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.\" (Isaiah xlii. 1.)\n\n2. God's command, \"This is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.\" (1 John iii. 23.\n\n3. The promise of God: \"Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious: he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.\" (1 Pet. ii. 6.)\n\nNow, having this three-fold warrant\u2014the warrant of God's ordination, command, and promise\u2014you may be bold to adventure on Christ, and to apply yourself to him thus: \"Lord Jesus, here I am, a poor captive exile, a lost creature, an enemy to God, under his wrath and curse. Wilt thou, Lord, undertake for me, reconcile me to God, and save my soul? Do not, Lord, refuse me; for if thou refuse me, to whom then shall I go? Art not thou he, and he alone, whom God the Father hath sealed, the Saviour of sinners?\"\nLord God hath sent me to thee, hath bid me come; he hath commanded me to believe, and cast myself upon thee. Lord Jesus, wilt thou refuse to help a distressed creature, whom the Father hath sent to thee for thy help? If I had come on my own head, or in my own name, thou mightest well have put me back; but since I come at the command of the Father, reject me not! Lord, help me! Lord, save me! Art thou not he, concerning whom the Father hath promised, 'He that believeth on him shall not be confounded?' I come, Lord; I believe, Lord; I throw myself upon thy grace and mercy; I cast myself upon thy blood. Do not refuse me. I have no where else to go. Here I will stay, I will not stir from thy door; on thee will I trust, and rest and venture myself. God hath laid my help on thee, and on thee I lay my hope for pardon, for life, for salvation. If I perish, I perish on thy shoulders; if I sink, I sink on thy vessel; if I die, I die at thy door.\n\nIV. Resign and deliver up yourselves to God in Christ.\n\n\"Yield yourselves to the Lord,\" that is, as his servants; give up the dominion and government of yourselves to Christ. \"Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. \"To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey.\" Yield yourselves so to the Lord, that you may henceforth be the Lord's: \"I am thine,\" says the Psalmist. Those that yield themselves to sin and the world, their heart says, \"Sin, I am thine: world, I am thine;\u2014riches, I am yours; pleasures, I am yours.\" \"I am thine,\" saith the Psalmist; devoted to thy fear, dedicated to thy service, \"I am thine,\nsave me.\" Give yourselves to Christ, sinners; be devoted to his fear.\n\nAnd this giving yourselves to him must be such as supposes that ye be heartily contented,\u2014\n1. That he appoint you your work.\n2. That he appoint you your station.\n\n1. That he appoint you your work: That he put you to whatsoever he pleaseth. Servants, as they must do their master's work, so they must do that work which their master appoints them; they must be for any work their master hath for them to do; they must not pick and choose; \"This I will do, and that I will not do:\" they must not say, \"This is too hard,\" or \"This is too mean, or \"This may be well enough let alone.\" Good servants, when they have chosen their master, will let their master choose their work; and will not dispute his will, but do it.\n\nChrist hath many services to be done; some are more easy and honorable, others more difficult and disagreeable; some are suitable to our inclinations and interests, others are contrary to both. In some we may please Christ, and please ourselves; as, when he requires us to feed and clothe ourselves, to provide things honest for our maintenance. Yea, and there are some spiritual duties that are more pleasing than others; as, to rejoice in the Lord, to be blessing and praising God, to be feeding ourselves with the delights and comforts of religion: these are the sweet works of a Christian. But then there are other works, wherein we cannot please Christ but by denying ourselves; as, giving and lending, bearing and forbearing, reproving men for their sins, withdrawing from their company, witnessing against their wickedness, confessing Christ and his name, when it will cause us shame and reproach; sailing aginst the wind,\nswimming against the tide, steering contrary to the times, parting with our ease, our liberties, and our accommodations for the name of our Lord Jesus.\n\nIt is desirable that the whole of this Tract be prayerfully pondered in private by those who purpose to enter into the Covenant; but, to shorten the service, the Preachers may here begin to read, on occasion of the annual renewal of the Covenant in the Methodist Societies.]\n\nIt is necessary, beloved, to sit down, and consider what it will cost you to be the servants of Christ, and take a thorough survey of the whole business of Christianity, and not to engage thoughtlessly to you know not what.\n\nFirst, see what it is that Christ doth expect, and then yield yourselves to his whole will. Do not think of compounding or making your own terms with Christ: that will never be allowed you.\n\nGo to Christ, and tell him, \"Lord Jesus, if thou wilt receive me into thy house, if thou wilt but own me as thy servant, I will not stand upon terms; impose upon me what conditions thou pleasest, write down thine own articles, command me what thou wilt, put me to any thing thou seest good; let me come under thy roof, let me be thy servant, and spare not to command me: I will be no longer mine own, but give up myself to thy will in all things.\"\n\n2. Let him appoint you your station and condition; whether it be higher or lower, a prosperous or afflicted state. Be content that Christ should choose your work and choose your condition; that he should have the command of you, and the disposal of you: \"Make me what thou wilt, Lord, and set me where thou wilt: let me be a vessel of silver or gold, or a vessel of wood or stone, so I be a vessel of honour: of whatsoever form or metal, whether higher or lower, finer\nor coarser, I am content; if I be not the head, or the eye, or the ear, one of the nobler and more honourable instruments thou wilt employ, let me be the hand, or the foot, one of the most laborious, the lowest, and most contemptible of all the servants of my Lord; let my dwelling be in the dust, my portion in the wilderness, my name and lot amongst the hewers of wood and drawers of water, among the door-keepers of thy house; anywhere, where I may be serviceable. I put myself wholly into thy hands; put me to what thou wilt, rank me with whom thou wilt; put me to doing; put me to suffering; let me be employed for thee, or laid aside for thee; exalted for thee, or trodden under foot for thee; let me be full, let me be empty; let me have all things, let me have nothing; I freely and heartily resign all to thy pleasure and disposal.\"\n\nThis is closing with Christ as your King and Sovereign Lord; and in this is included your renouncing the devil and all his works, the flesh and its lusts; together with your consenting to all the laws and ordinances of Christ and his providential Government.\n\nBeloved, such an agreement with Christ as you have here been exhorted to, is that wherein the essence of Christianity lies. When you have chosen the incorruptible crown; that is, when you have chosen God to be your portion and happiness; when you have adventured, and laid up your whole interest and all your hopes with Christ, casting yourself wholly upon the merits of his death; when you have understandingly and heartily resigned yourselves to him, resolving for ever to be at his command, and at his disposal; then you are Christians indeed, and never till then. Christ will be the Saviour of none but his servants. He is the Author of eternal salvation to those that obey him; Christ will have no servants but by consent; his people are a will-\ning people; Christ will accept of no consent but in full to all he requires; he will be all in all, or he will be nothing.\n\nV. Confirm and complete all this by solemn covenant.\n\nGive yourselves to the Lord as his servants, and bind yourselves to him as his covenant servants.\n\nUpon your entering into covenant with God, the covenant of God stands firm to you: God gives you leave, every one, to put in his own name into the covenant-grant; if it be not found there at last, it will be your own fault; if it be not there, there will be nothing found in the whole covenant belonging unto you; if it be there, all is your's; if you have come into the bond of the covenant, you shall have your share in the blessings of the covenant. \"Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, to hearken to his voice; and the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee.\" (Deut. xxvi. 17, 18.) Observe it: The same day that they avouched the Lord to be their God, the same day the Lord avouched them to be his peculiar people. The same day that they engaged to keep the commandments of God, the same day the Lord engageth to keep his promise with them.\n\nThere is a two-fold covenanting with God. In profession, or in reality; an entering our names, or an engaging our hearts. The former is done in baptism, by all that are baptized, who, by receiving that seal of the Covenant, are visibly, or in profession, entered into it. The latter is also two-fold.\n\n1. Virtual. Which is done by all those that have sincerely made that closure with God in Christ, which we have spoken of. Those that have chosen the Lord, embarked\nwith Christ, resigned up, and given themselves to the Lord, have virtually covenanted with him.\n\n2. Formal. Which is our binding ourselves to the Lord by solemn vow or promise to stand to our choice. And this may be either inward in the soul, or outward, and expressed either by word, lifting up the hands, subscribing with the hand, or the like; and by how much the more express and solemn our covenanting with God is, by so much the more sensibly and strongly is it likely to hold our hearts to him.\n\nNow, that which we would persuade you to, is this solemn and express covenanting with God; and in order to the putting this matter into practice, take these few directions:\n\n1. Seek earnestly his special assistance, and gracious acceptance of you.\n\n2. Consider distinctly all the conditions of the Covenant, as they have been laid before you.\n\n3. Search your hearts, whether you either have already or can now freely make such a closure with God in Christ, as you have been exhorted to. Especially consider what your sins are, and examine whether you can resolve to forego them all. Consider what the laws of Christ are, how holy, strict, and spiritual, and whether you can, upon deliberation, make choice of them all, (even those that most cross your interests and corrupt inclinations), as the rule of your whole life. Be sure you be clear in these matters; see that you do not lie unto God.\n\nSecondly, Compose your spirits into the most serious frame possible, suitable to a transaction of so high importance.\n\nThirdly, Lay hold on the covenant of God, and rely upon His promise of giving grace and strength, whereby you\nmay be enabled to perform your promise. Trust not to your own strength, or to the strength of your own resolutions, but take hold on His strength.\n\nFourthly, Resolve to be faithful. Having engaged your hearts, opened your mouths, and subscribed with your hands to the Lord, resolve in His strength never to go back.\n\n[Here let the Minister request all who are willing to engage in the renewal of the Covenant, to signify it by standing up, after which, in the name of the congregation, he shall open his lips to the Lord, in these words, all devoutly kneeling.]\n\nO most holy and most merciful God! for the passion of thy Son, we beseech thee accept of us poor prodigals now prostrating ourselves at thy door. We have fallen from thee by our iniquity and are by nature heirs of death, and a thousand-fold more children of hell by our sinful practice; but of Thine infinite grace Thou hast promised mercy to us in Christ, if we will but turn to thee with all our hearts; therefore, upon the call of thy Gospel, we are now come in, and, throwing down our weapons, submit ourselves to thy mercy.\n\nAnd because thou requirest, as the condition of our peace with thee, that we should put away our idols, and be at defiance with all thine enemies, which, we acknowledge, we have wickedly sided with against thee, we here, from the bottom of our hearts, renounce them all; firmly covenanting with thee not to allow ourselves in any known sin, but conscientiously to use all the means that we know thou hast prescribed for the death and utter destruction of all our corruptions. And whereas, formerly, we have inordinately let out our affections upon the world, we do here resign our hearts to thee; humbly protesting before thy\nglorious Majesty, that it is our firm resolution, and that we do unfeignedly desire grace from thee, that when thou shalt call us hereunto, we may practice this our resolution, to forsake all that is dear unto us in this world, rather than turn from thee to the ways of sin; and that we will watch against all temptations, whether of prosperity or adversity, lest they should withdraw our hearts from thee, beseeching thee also to help us against the temptations of Satan, to whose wicked suggestions we resolve, by thy grace, never to yield. And because our own righteousness is but filthy rags, we renounce all confidence therein; and acknowledge that we are of ourselves hopeless, helpless, undone creatures, without righteousness or strength.\n\nAnd forasmuch as thou hast, of thy boundless mercy, offered most graciously to us, wretched sinners, to be again our God through Christ, if we would accept of thee; we call heaven and earth to record this day, that we do here solemnly avouch thee for the Lord our God; and with all possible veneration, bowing our souls under the feet of thy most sacred Majesty, we do here give up ourselves to thee, the Lord Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for thy servants; promising and vowing to serve thee, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our lives.\n\nAnd since thou hast appointed the Lord Jesus Christ the only means of coming unto thee, we do here, upon our bended knees, accept of Him, as the only new and living way by which sinners may have access to thee.\n\nO blessed Jesus, we come to thee hungry, wretched, miserable, blind, and naked; guilty, condemned malefactors, unworthy to wash the feet of the servants of our Lord, much more to be joined in covenant to the King of Glory; but since such is thine unparalleled love, we here, with all\nour power, accept thee, and take thee for our head and Lord; for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; for all times and conditions, to love, honour, and obey thee before all others, and this to the death. We embrace thee in all thy offices; we renounce our own worthiness, and do here avow thee for the Lord, our righteousness; we renounce our own wisdom, and do here take thee for our only guide; we renounce our own will, and do take thy will for our law.\n\nAnd since thou hast told us we must suffer if we will reign, we do here covenant with thee, to take our lot as it falls with thee, and, by thy grace assisting, to run all hazards with thee; verily purposing, that neither life nor death shall part between thee and us.\n\nAnd because thou hast been pleased to give us thy holy laws as the rule of our lives, and the way in which we should walk to thy kingdom, we do here willingly put ourselves under thy yoke, and set our shoulders to thy burden; and, subscribing to all thy laws, as holy, just, and good, we solemnly take them as the rule of our words, thoughts, and actions; promising that, though our flesh contradict and rebel, we will endeavour to order and govern our whole lives according to thy direction.\n\n[Here shall follow a season of silent prayer. Then the whole congregation, led by the Minister, shall repeat audibly the following words:]\n\nNow, Almighty God, Searcher of Hearts, thou knowest that I make this covenant with thee this day without any known guile or reservation, beseeching thee, if thou espiest any flaw or falsehood therein, that thou wouldst discover it to me, and help me to do it aright.\n\nAnd now, glory be to thee, O God the Father, whom I shall be bold, from this day forward, to look upon as my\nGod and Father, that ever thou shouldest find out such a way for the recovery of undone sinners. Glory be to thee, O God the Son, who hast loved me, and washed me from my sins in thine own blood, and art now become my Saviour and Redeemer.\n\nGlory be to thee, O God the Holy Ghost, who, by the finger of thine Almighty power, hast turned about my heart from sin to God.\n\nO great Jehovah, the Lord God Omnipotent, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, thou art now become my covenant-friend, and I, through thine infinite grace, have become thy covenant-servant. Amen. And the covenant which I have made on earth, let it be ratified in heaven.\n\n[The Minister may here conclude with singing and extemporaneous prayer.]\n\nThis covenant we advise you to make, not only in heart, but in word; not only in word, but in writing; and that you would, with all possible reverence, spread the writing before the Lord, as if you would present it to him as your act and deed; and when you have done this, set your hand to it; keep it as a memorial of the solemn transactions that have passed between God and you, and that you may have recourse to it in doubts and temptations.\n\nSection VIII.\n\nFORM FOR LAYING THE CORNER-STONE OF A CHURCH.\n\nThe Minister, standing near the place where the stone is to be laid, shall say unto the Congregation:\n\nDearly beloved, We are taught in the word of God, that, although the heaven of heavens cannot contain the Eternal One, much less the walls of temples made with\nhands, yet his delight is ever with the sons of men, and that, wherever two or three are gathered in His name, there is He in the midst of them. In all ages His servants have separated certain places for His worship; Jacob erected a stone in Bethel for God's house; Moses made a tabernacle in the desert; and Solomon builded a temple for the Lord, which He filled with the glory of His presence before all the people. We are now assembled to lay the corner-stone of a new house for the worship of the God of our fathers. Let us not doubt that He will favourably approve our godly purpose, and let us now devoutly unite in singing His praise, and in prayer for His blessing on our undertaking.\n\nLet an appropriate Hymn be sung.\n\nThen shall the Minister say:\n\nLet us pray.\n\nMost Glorious God, heaven is Thy throne and the earth is Thy footstool: what house then can be builded for Thee, or where is the place of Thy rest? Yet, blessed be Thy name, O Lord God, that it hath pleased Thee to have Thy habitation among the sons of men, and to dwell in the midst of the assembly of the saints upon the earth. And now, especially, we render thanks unto Thee, O God, that it hath pleased Thee to put it into the hearts of Thy servants to erect in this place a house for Thy worship. We thank Thee for Thy grace which has inclined them to contribute of their substance for the glory of Thy Name: and we pray Thee, to continue Thy blessing upon their pious undertaking. Amen.\n\nMay many unite with them in their holy work, until this habitation of Thy house shall be completed, and ready\nfor dedication to Thy service, free from all debt or claim of man. Amen.\n\nMay peace and harmony prevail in the counsels of Thy servants. May the work of this building be accomplished without hurt or accident to any person. And when Thou shalt have prospered the work of their hands upon them, and this house shall be prepared for Thy service, grant that all who shall enjoy the benefit of this pious work, may show forth their thankfulness, by making a right use of it, to the glory of Thy blessed Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nGrant that all who shall hereafter worship Thee in the temple here to be builded, may so serve and please Thee in all holy exercises of godliness, that in the end they may come to the holy place, made without hands, whose builder and maker is God. Amen.\n\nHear us, O Lord, for Thou art our God in whom we trust. And when we shall cease to pray unto Thee on earth, may we, with all those who in like manner have erected such places to Thy name, and with all Thy glorified saints, eternally praise Thee for all Thy goodness vouchsafed unto us on earth and laid up for us in heaven. Amen.\n\nAccept these our prayers, we beseech Thee, for the sake of Thy dear Son, who has taught us when we pray to say, \"Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" Amen.\nThen shall the Minister read the following Psalm, or the Minister and people may read it in alternate verses; the parts in italics to be read by the people.\n\nPsalm cxxxii.\n\nLord, remember David, and all his afflictions:\nHow he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;\nSurely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;\nI will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,\nUntil I find out a place for the Lord,\nA habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.\nLo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.\nWe will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.\nArise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.\nLet thy priests be clothed with righteousness;\nAnd let thy saints shout for joy.\nFor thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.\nThe Lord hath sworn in truth unto David: he will not turn from it;\nOf the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.\nIf thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.\nFor the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.\nThis is my rest forever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it.\n\nI will abundantly bless her provision:\nI will satisfy her poor with bread.\nI will clothe her priests with salvation:\nAnd her saints shall shout aloud for joy.\nThere will I make the horn of David to bud:\nI have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.\nHis enemies will I clothe with shame:\nBut upon himself shall his crown flourish.\n\nThe Lesson. 1 Cor. iii. 9-23.\n\nFor we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you! If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this\nworld is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.\n\nThen shall follow the Sermon, or an Address suitable to the occasion, after which the contributions of the people shall be received.\n\nThen shall the Minister, standing by the stone, exhibit to the congregation a vessel to be placed in an excavation of the stone. [It may contain a copy of the Bible, the Hymn Book, the Discipline, Church periodicals of recent date, the names of the Pastor, Trustees, and Building Committee of the Church, with such other documents and articles as may be desired. A list of these may be read.] After which the person thereto appointed shall deposit the vessel in the stone and cover it; and shall lay the stone, assisted by the builder, saying:\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I lay this corner-stone for the foundation of a house to be builded and consecrated to the service of Almighty God, according to the order and usages of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Amen.\n\nThe service may conclude with extempore prayer, the Lord's Prayer, and the Benediction.\nDEDICATION OF A CHURCH.\n\nSECTION IX.\n\nFORM FOR THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH.\n\nThe Congregation being assembled in the Church, the Minister shall say:\n\nDearly beloved, The Scriptures teach us that God is well pleased with those who build Temples to His name. We have heard how He filled the Temple of Solomon with His glory, and how in the Second Temple He manifested Himself still more gloriously. Let us not doubt that He will approve our purpose of dedicating this house for the performance of the several offices of religious worship; and let us now devoutly join in praise to Almighty God that this godly undertaking hath been so far completed; and in prayer for His further blessing upon all who have been engaged therein, and upon all who shall hereafter worship in this place.\n\nLet an appropriate Hymn be sung, and extemporary prayer be offered, the congregation all kneeling during the prayer.\n\nThen shall the Minister, or some one appointed by him, read\n\nThe First Lesson. 2 Chron. vi. 1, 2, 18-21, 40-42; vii. 1-4.\n\nThen said Solomon, The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling forever.\n\nBut will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built! Have respect, therefore, to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which\nthy servant prayeth before thee: that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. Hearken, therefore, unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place, hear them from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.\n\nNow, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. Now, therefore, arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed; remember the mercies of David thy servant.\n\nNow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth forever. Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.\n\nThe Second Lesson. Heb. x. 19-26.\n\nHaving therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to\nsay, his flesh; and having a High Priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.\n\nThen shall a Hymn be sung, after which the Minister shall deliver a Sermon suitable to the occasion, and after the Sermon the contributions of the people shall be received.\n\nThen shall the Minister read the following Psalm, or the Minister and the Congregation shall read it alternately; the parts in italics to be read by the Congregation:\n\nPsalm cxxii.\n\nI was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.\n\nOur feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together.\nWhither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord,\nUnto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.\nFor there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.\nPray for the peace of Jerusalem:\nThey shall prosper that love thee.\nPeace be within thy walls,\nAnd prosperity within thy palaces.\nFor my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say,\nPeace be within thee.\nBecause of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.\n\nThen let the Trustees stand up before the Minister, and one of them,\nor some one in their behalf, say unto him:\n\nWe present unto you this building, to be dedicated as a Church for the worship and service of Almighty God.\n\nThen shall the Minister request the Congregation to stand, while he repeats the following\n\nDECLARATION.\n\nDearly beloved, It is meet and right, as we learn from the Holy Scriptures, that houses erected for the public worship of God should be specially set apart and dedicated to religious uses. For such a dedication we are now assembled. With gratitude, therefore, to Almighty God, who has signally blessed his servants in their holy undertaking to erect this Church, we dedicate it to His service, for the reading of the Holy Scriptures, the preaching of the Word of God, the administration of the Holy Sacraments, and for all other exercises of religious worship and service, according to the Discipline and usages of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. And, as the dedication of the temple is vain without the solemn consecration of the worshippers also, I now call upon you all to dedicate yourselves anew to the service of God. To Him let our souls be dedicated, that they may be renewed after the image of Christ. To Him let our bodies be dedicated, that they may be fit temples for the indwelling\nof the Holy Ghost. To Him let our labours and business be dedicated, that their fruit may tend to the glory of His great name, and to the advancement of His kingdom. And that he may graciously accept this our solemn act, let us pray.\n\nThe Congregation kneeling, the Minister shall offer the following prayer:\n\nO most glorious Lord, we acknowledge that we are not worthy to offer unto thee anything belonging unto us; yet we beseech thee, in thy great goodness, graciously to accept the Dedication of this place to thy service, and to prosper this the work of our hands; receive the prayers and intercessions of all thy servants who shall call upon thee in this house; and give them grace to prepare their hearts to serve thee with reverence and godly fear; affect them with an awful apprehension of thy Divine Majesty, and a deep sense of their own unworthiness; that so approaching thy sanctuary with lowliness and devotion, and coming before thee with pure hearts, bodies undefiled, and minds sanctified, they may always perform a service acceptable to thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nRegard, O Lord, the supplications of thy servants, and grant that whosoever shall be dedicated to thee in this house by Baptism, may be found at last in the number of thy faithful children. Amen.\n\nGrant, O Lord, that whosoever shall receive in this place the blessed Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, may come to that holy ordinance with true repentance, faith and charity; and being filled with thy grace and heavenly benediction, may obtain remission of their sins, and all other benefits of his death. Amen.\n\nGrant, O Lord, that by thy holy Word, read and preached\nin this place, and by the Holy Spirit grafting it inwardly in the heart, the hearers thereof may perceive and know what things they ought to do, and may receive power to perform the same. Amen.\n\nNow, therefore, arise, O Lord, and come unto this place of thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength. Let thine eye be open toward this house day and night; and let thine ears be attent to the prayers of thy children, which they shall offer unto thee in this place: and do thou hear them from heaven, thy dwelling-place, and when thou hearest, forgive. O Lord, we beseech thee, that here and elsewhere thy ministers may be clothed with righteousness and thy saints rejoice in thy salvation. And may we all, with thy people everywhere, grow up into a holy temple in the Lord, and be at last received into the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. And to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, be glory and praise, world without end. Amen.\n\nThe services may conclude with the Doxology and the Benediction,\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE FUNDS AND COMMITTEES OF CONNEXIONAL SOCIETIES.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nTHE BOOK AND PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n1.

(that is to say),\n\nIn or about the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, certain Ministers or Preachers of the Gospel, being members of the New York Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States of America, were ordained and sent by the Reverend Francis Asbury, one of the Bishops of said Church, into various parts of Canada, where they preached the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and united in Classes and Religious Societies, such persons as professed faith in the doctrines taught by the said Ministers or Preachers, and adherence to the Rules and Discipline of the said Methodist Episcopal Church; and such Classes and Religious Societies continued to increase in number, until in process of time Circuits were duly organized in the said Province, and supplied with the word and ordinances of God by Ministers appointed by Bishops of the said Church:\n\nIn or about the year one thousand eight hundred and seventeen, certain Ministers or Preachers of the Gospel were also sent into the said Province, by the Wesleyan Missionary Committee in London, England, being Ministers in connexion with the Conference of \"The people called Methodists,\" in England, as known by a certain Deed Poll or Instrument in writing under the hand and seal of the Reverend John Wesley, (formerly of Lincoln College, Oxford, and\nafterwards of the City Road, London,) Clerk, bearing date on or about the twenty-eighth day of February, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, attested by two credible witnesses, and enrolled in His Majesty's High Court of Chancery, or or about the ninth day of March, in the year last aforesaid;

and the persons under their pastoral care and direction were united with the Societies under the care and direction of the Ministers of the said Methodist Episcopal Church:\n\nIn or about the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, arrangements were made for the assembling of a yearly Conference of the said Ministers or Preachers in Canada, called \"The Canada Conference,\" under direction or oversight of a Bishop or Bishops, of the said Methodist Episcopal Church: In the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, in compliance with a memorial from the said Canada Conference, addressed to the Bishops and Members of the General Conference of the said Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Ministers composing the said Conference, were authorized by the said General Conference to form themselves and their Societies under their pastoral care into an independent Church in Canada: And a Church was accordingly constituted, having the style and title of the \"Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada;\" Thenceforward, the Ministers of the said Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada, continued to meet together in Conference annually, and in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, proposals, were made for a Union between the said Conference in Canada and the English Conference, for the purpose of concentrating their joint efforts for the spread of true religion throughout the Province; And, after mature consideration and negotiation upon the matters involved in the said proposals, Articles of Union were agreed upon by the said English Conference and the Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada, and ratified in York, (now the City of Toronto), in Upper Canada, by an instrument in writing, bearing date the second day of October, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, and signed on behalf of the said Conference in Canada, by Egerton Ryerson, and on behalf of the said English Conference, by George Marsden: in connection\nwith the establishment of the said Union, the appointment to the office of Bishop (no Bishop having been ordained in or for the said Church,) was made annual, according to the provisions of the Discipline of said Church, and as contemplated in the said Articles of Union: And also, a change was made in certain portions of the Discipline of the said Church in Canada, in order to assimilate them more nearly to the economy and usages of the Parent Body, under the direction of the English Conference:\n\nIn consequence of these arrangements and alterations, the style and title of the said Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada, was changed: and the said Church in Canada was designated, \"The Wesleyan Methodist Church in British North America,\" which style and title was again changed in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, to that of \"The Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada: Certain misunderstandings which occurred between the English Conference and the said Conference in Canada, in or about the year one thousand eight hundred and forty, occasioned a temporary suspension of the practical operation of the Union, effected as above recited, until in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-seven, mutual arrangements were made between the said Conference in Canada, and the English Conference, to restore their unanimity of action in carrying on the work of God in the said Province: As the basis of this arrangement, certain Articles of Settlement and Re-Union were agreed upon by the said Conferences;
