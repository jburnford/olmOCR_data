For a great part of this distance, however, the exploration was necessarily limited to a single line of traverse. While, therefore, enabling large additions to be made to knowledge of the physical and climatic features of the region, the exploration is really of the nature of a reconnoissance, and in the remote region to which it refers, it is under present circumstances impossible within the limits of a single season to carry out more detailed surveys.\n\nThe immediate object of the exploration of the past season was to obtain all possible information as to the physical features and economic importance of the country, for the purpose of determining to what extent it offered advantages for the passage of the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. For the examination of the engineering features of the proposed route, several gentlemen connected with the staff of the Canadian Pacific Railway were detailed. To Mr. Sandford Fleming, Engineer in Chief of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Geological Survey is indebted for the facilities accorded to us in connection with his surveying parties. Messrs. H. J. Cambie and H. A. F. MacLeod, with whom I was more immediately associated in the field, I have to thank for ready cooperation and assistance in many cases.\n\nThe expedition occupied in all a period of seven months, extending from the 8th of May to the 9th of December. The journey from Mont-\nreal to Victoria was accomplished by the Union and Central Pacific Railways, and from San Francisco by steamer, in the usual manner. The mouth of the Skeena River was reached by steamer from Victoria on the 6th of June, from which date to the end of December, when we arrived at Winnipeg, Manitoba, our time was continuously occupied in travel and exploration in a region without any recognized means of conveyance.\n\nA preliminary report on the results of the exploration was prepared at Mr. Fleming's request, and has been published by him, together with those of the engineers, in the Canadian Pacific Railway Report for 1880. In the present report many subjects touched on in that just alluded to, are treated in greater detail, more particularly the strictly geological features, which required a greater length of time for their elaboration than could be afforded in the preparation of the preliminary report. In the following pages a general description of the country in the vicinity of the routes followed, with special reference to its economic importance, is supplemented by general remarks and conclusions on the region. To this follows a connected account of the geological structure so far as it is known, the information collected serving to illustrate a general section across the Cordillera region from the west coast, to the undisturbed Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of the plains. Notes on points connected with the possible construction of a railway line are given for those places which were not examined by the gentlemen more particularly engaged in this branch of the survey.\n\nPHYSICAL FEATURES AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE COAST REGION.\n\nThe Coast or Cascade Range of British Columbia is that forming the high western border of the continent, but beyond it lies another half-submerged range, which appears in Vancouver and the Queen Charlotte Islands and is represented in the south by the Olympian Mountains of Washington Territory, and northward by the large islands of the coast archipelago of Alaska. In this outer range there are three remarkable gaps, the most southern occupied by the Strait of Fuca, the central being the wide opening between Vancouver and the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the northern Dixon's Entrance. To the south of these, the lower part of the valley of the Columbia appears to occupy a similar depression, through which, and by Puget Sound, a moderate subsidence of the land would enable the sea to flow, forming of the Olympian Mountain region an additional large island. Whatever the ultimate origin of the gaps holding the Strait of Fuca and Dixon's Entrance, they are features of great structural importance, and\nare continued eastward in both cases by depressions more or less marked in the Coast Range proper. This is evidenced by the fact that the Fraser River, carrying by far the larger part of the drainage of the region lying between the Coast Ranges and Rocky Mountains, after flowing southward for several hundred miles, reaches the sea opposite the end of the Strait of Fuca; while the Skeena, whose tributaries interlock with those of the Fraser, and derive their waters from a portion of the same great interior plateau or valley, falls into the Pacific near the head of Dixon's Entrance. A second large river, the Nasse, draws its waters chiefly from the far north, and its mouth is not many miles northward from that of the Skeena. Though the Salmon or Dean River, the Bella Coola and the Homathec rise to the north-east of the Coast Range and traverse it on the way to the sea, in the region intervening between the Skeena and the Fraser, these are comparatively small streams, and drain an inconsiderable portion of the plateau, deriving the greater part of their waters from the Coast Mountains during the passage through them.\n\nThe persistent north-west and south-east valley which separates the Coast Range from that forming the large islands already referred to, is occupied by the Strait of Georgia, Johnston and Broughton Straits, Queen Charlotte Sound, and the water-stretch separating Queen Charlotte Islands from the mainland, sometimes called Hecate Strait.\n\nThe northern part of the coast of British Columbia is best represented on the admiralty charts 1923 A and 1923 B, with No. 2431 and several special plans of harbors and anchorages. It is as yet, however, very imperfectly surveyed, attention having been devoted to the complete examination of the channels lying in the direct route of steamers passing up and down the coast, while many of the larger inlets and exposed parts of the coast are still drawn from Vancouver's sketches made in the last century. Vancouver being instructed to set at rest the possibility of the existence of openings to a \"North-west Passage\" felt himself obliged to examine to their extremities all the inlets, and explored many places which have since been seldom visited.\n\nThe main structural features giving rise to the present complicated outline of the coast of Northern British Columbia are comparatively simple. The most important lines of structural weakness, or of the outcrop of softer rocks, have been those, running in a north-west and south-east bearing, corresponding with the direction of the mountain ranges and the coast. These have been crossed nearly at right angles by a second series, while traces are also distinctly apparent of a meridional series. These lines, sculptured out by denudation at former periods when the coast stood at a higher level, and possibly also in\npart by glaciers, have become the valleys of the broad high region constituting the Coast Range. The axial elevations of this range are situated at an average distance of sixty to eighty miles from the coast, and from these the height of its peaks and plateaux decreases gradually and with more or less uniformity to the westward, till it at length becomes so inconsiderable that the sea flows into the valleys, forming the remarkable plexus of channels, and archipelago which fringes the coast. In conformity with the general decrease in elevation westward, the outer islands of the archipelago are low in comparison with those lying nearer the mainland.\n\nThese islands and the coast of the mainland are almost everywhere covered with dense coniferous forest, with the exception of the mountain sides and summits which are too steep for vegetation to cling to. As seen from the water, the trees frequently appear somewhat scrubby and small, but on closer examination are found to be of considerable size, though in most cases not equalling those of the low alluvial portion of the Queen Charlotte Islands. The covering of soil is almost everywhere scanty, a fact connected with the absence of extensive glacial deposits, which has been referred to in former publications. This is also found to be the case in the islands, which from their low and uniform outline might be supposed to have some agricultural value. Thus it is that even were the climate more favourable to agriculture, the area of land actually available for this purpose would be very small, and with the exception of the low north-eastern portion of the Queen Charlotte Islands, is scarcely worth taking into consideration. The Indians, while living chiefly on fish, frequently cultivate small garden patches, growing potatoes and other vegetables not requiring much care, or a prolonged warm and dry summer season.\n\nDissected as the coast is with inlets, good harbors are scarce. The inlets and channels are generally deep with bold rocky shores, and are traversed by strong tidal currents. The heads of the fiords penetrating the Coast Range almost always receive rivers, each of which has formed a shoal bank about its mouth, but this usually slopes off rapidly into water too deep for anchorage. The mouth and estuary of the Skeena is shallow and encumbered with bars and banks, and is unsuited as a port for large vessels. A fine harbor like Port Simpson, therefore acquires peculiar importance in view of the possible future requirements of this part of the coast. This harbor has been accurately surveyed, and is represented on a large scale on admiralty chart No. 2426, published in 1872. It is, therefore, unnecessary to enter into a detailed description of it. It may suffice to state that it is over three miles in length, with an average breadth exceeding one mile; that it is well sheltered and easy of access, lying at the eastern end of Dixon's Entrance. There\nis a considerable area of level or gently sloping ground well adapted for the erection of buildings, and the only circumstances lessening its value as a terminal port for a railway appear to be the small area of arable land in its vicinity, and certain climatic conditions subsequently alluded to.\n\nAt Port Simpson the Hudson Bay Company has long had its chief northern post, and although the defensive measures necessary a few years since are now no longer required, the fort still maintains a somewhat formidable aspect. Besides the Company there are here a few other traders, and a number of Indians. A large and handsome mission church is conspicuous from a distance. At Metla-Katla, sixteen miles south of Port Simpson, a station of the Church Missionary Society, under Mr. Duncan, has long been established, and a large colony of Indians have come together about it. At Port Essington on the south side of the estuary of the Skeena, is a third village, chiefly inhabited by Indians, but also by one or two traders. With the exception of salmon canning establishments, these three are the only settlements on the northern part of the coast. The fisheries promise to be the most important industries for some time to come. The fish are of excellent quality, and are generally very abundant both in the Skeena and the Nasse. The salmon are taken in nets in the estuaries of the rivers, and a large number of Indians and Chinamen are employed in connection with the canning business during the season. The sea fisheries of the coast are as yet undeveloped, but the same remarks are applicable to them as to those of the Queen Charlotte Islands, made in the Report of Progress for 1878-79. On some parts of the coast the timber will doubtless be of value before many years. No mineral deposits of such a character as to induce permanent work have yet been discovered.\n\nCLIMATE OF THE COAST REGION.\n\nThe climate of the coast of the northern part of British Columbia, while not subject to great extremes of temperature, is excessively humid, with much rain at all seasons of the year and occasional heavy falls of snow in winter. Neither Esquimalt nor New Westminster, which are the only regular meteorological stations maintained on the coast of the Province, give a just criterion by which to arrive at a knowledge of the climatic conditions of other districts; for both these places\u2014bat especially Esquimalt\u2014are sheltered from the excessive precipitation which occurs where the moisture-bearing winds first strike the high coast line. Observations maintained by myself while engaged in a geological examination of the Queen Charlotte Islands, during the summer of 1878 (published in the Report of Progress of the\nGeological Survey, 1878-9), fairly represent the climate of that region during a few months. Observations kept up during many years at Sitka, two and a-half degrees north of Port Simpson, and further west, doubtless represent a climate considerably worse than that of the northern part of the coast of British Columbia. It may, however, be useful to extract from these the following facts. The latitude of Sitka is 57\u00b0 3', or about one degree north of Glasgow (Scotland). Temperature observations extend over a period of forty-five years with little interruption. \"The mean temperature of spring is 41.2\u00b0; of summer, 54.6\u00b0; of autumn, 44.9\u00b0; of winter, 32.5\u00b0; and for the entire year, 43.3\u00b0 F. The extremes of temperature for 45 years are 87.8\u00b0 and -4.0\u00b0. However, the mercury has fallen below zero of Fahrenheit in only four years out of the 45, and has risen about 80\u00b0 during but seven years of that period. The coldest month is January, the warmest, August; June is slightly warmer than September.\" The mean of the minima for seven years of the above period is 38.6\u00b0, and of the maxima for seven years, 48.9\u00b0, showing a remarkably equable climate. The average annual amount of rain, melted snow and hail from 1847 to 1864 (with the exception of the year 1855) was 82.66 inches, or within a fraction of seven feet; and the average annual number of days on which rain, snow or hail fell, or heavy fogs prevailed, was two hundred and forty-five, or two days out of three, while it does not follow that the other days have a clear sky. Tables by L\u00fctke, from observations in 1828 and 1829, show that on an average each year there were 170 days calm, 132 days moderate winds, and 63 days with strong winds.*\n\nThe average annual precipitation of moisture at the mouth of the Columbia River, eleven degrees of latitude further south, is stated to be five inches greater than at Sitka, and it is therefore probable a priori, that in the vicinity of Port Simpson and about the mouth of the Skeena, on that part of the coast of the mainland lying open to the westerly winds between Queen Charlotte and Vancouver Island, and on the west coasts of these islands, that the precipitation is at least equally great, and amounts to between 80 and 90 inches per annum. This amount of precipitation, though small in comparison with that of a few exceptional places on the earth's surface, is greater than that characterizing even the western coasts of the British Islands, with the exception of a few peculiarly situated mountainous localities, where it is exceeded, and little less than the heaviest rainfall on the Norwegian coast (90 inches).\n\nRecently published observations for Fort Tongass, though covering a period of but little over two years, are very interesting in this con-\n\n* Alaska Coast Pilot, 1869, and U.S. Pacific Coast Pilot, Appendix I, 1879, p. 30.\nconnection, and must represent the climate of the region in the vicinity of Port Simpson and of the Queen Charlotte Islands pretty closely, as Tongass is situated on the north side of Dixon's Entrance, a little over fifty miles from Port Simpson in a direct line. The mean temperature is here 46.5\u00b0, or considerably warmer than Sitka. \"This may be due,\" Mr. W. H. Dall writes \"to the reception in the open throat of Dixon's Entrance of the warm waters of the Alaska Current, fresh from the great North Pacific Gulf Stream.\" Fort Tongass is the locality of the greatest known precipitation in Alaska, the rainfall averaging during the years of observation 118.3 inches, on which Mr. Dall remarks, that observations point to the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the region about Dixon's Entrance as the most rainy part of the north-west coast. At Tongass about two hundred days a year are either rainy or snowy, a proportion agreeing nearly with that observed at Sitka.*\n\nThe excessive rainfall, considered in conjunction with the fact that the sky throughout the year is essentially cloudy, preventing rapid evaporation and keeping the dew point near the actual temperature of the air, accounts for the peculiar character of the vegetation, and the fact that ordinary cereals cannot be grown in the districts exposed to these conditions. At Port Simpson, on the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands, and elsewhere, many of the hills are but partially covered with forest, the remainder of the surface being occupied by sphagnum moss several feet in depth, and saturated with water even on steep slopes. The low north-eastern part of the Queen Charlotte Islands is in great measure sheltered from the rain-bearing winds, and constitutes, in fact, the only extensive area of land which appears to be suitable for agriculture on the northern part of the coast. Mr. Duncan of Metla-Katla, who kept a meteorological register for some time after his arrival in the country, estimated that there were on an average about seven fine days in a month at that place. The behaviour of the paths of storms winds and barometer in both Vancouver and the Queen Charlotte Islands, appear to indicate that the centres of most storms, travelling from west to east, pass to the northward of the coast of British Columbia. This being so, it is probable that the force of the gales is somewhat greater on the northern part of the coast of the province than on the southern.\n\nI have elsewhere stated that fogs do not seem to occur with such frequency in the vicinity of the Queen Charlotte Islands as in the southern part of the Strait of Georgia. It may be interesting to quote, in this connection, the following statement by the great but unfortunate navigator, La P\u00e9rouse, bearing on the northern part of the west coast.\n\n* Pacific Coast Pilot, Appendix I.\nHe writes: \"I first thought these seas more foggy than those which separate Europe and America, but I should have been greatly mistaken to have irrevocably embraced this opinion. The fogs of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Hudson's Bay have an incontestable claim to pre-eminence from their constant density.\"\n\nThe cause of the exceptional mildness of the climate of this region is to be found not alone in the fact of the proximity of the sea, but in the abnormal warmth of the water, due to the Kuro-Siwo or Japanese Current. The average temperature of the surface of the sea, during the summer months, in the vicinity of the Queen Charlotte Islands, as deduced from a number of observations taken by myself in 1878, is $53^\\circ 8'$. Between Victoria and Milbank Sound, by the inner channels, from May 28th to June 9th, the average temperature of the sea surface was $54^\\circ 1'$. In the inner channels between Port Simpson and Milbank Sound, between August 29th and September 12th, $54^\\circ 5'$; and from the last mentioned date to October 18th, about the north end of Vancouver Island, and thence to Victoria by the inner channels, $50^\\circ 7'$. Observations by the United States' Coast Survey, in 1867,\u2020 gave a mean temperature for the surface of the sea between Victoria and Port Simpson and outside the Prince of Wales Archipelago, from Fort Simpson to Sitka, in the latter part of July and early in August, of $52^\\circ 1'$. In the narrower inlets of the coast, the temperature of the sea falls, owing to the quantity of cold water mingled with it by the entering rivers. These observations serve to show the existence, off the coast, of a great body of warm water, and the temperatures closely correspond with those found in similar latitudes, and due to the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic surface drift, on the west coast of Britain. The annual average temperature of the sea surface off the west coast of Britain is stated as $49^\\circ$, while that of the eastern North Atlantic, influenced by the Gulf Stream, varies from $44^\\circ$ to $54^\\circ$.\u2021\n\nIt will be observed that the summer temperature of this body of warm water appears to be somewhat lower than the mean summer temperature of Sitka. Its influence on the climate is not, however, a direct one, but is chiefly exercised in the following way:\u2014The prevailing south-westerly winds, sweeping over the warm surface of the\n\n---\n\n* Quoted by G. Davidson in Alaska Coast Pilot.\n\n\u2020 Alaska Coast Pilot, 1869, p. 20.\n\n\u2021 \"That portion of the Kuro-Siwo having a temperature of $55^\\circ$ F., or more, approaches the coast of North-west America in the vicinity of Vancouver Island. The precipitation is greater, and sudden meteorological disturbances are more common between latitudes $48^\\circ$ and $55^\\circ$ N. than on any other part of the coast, so far as we know. But the water near the coast is less than $55^\\circ$ in temperature, and may average not more than $50^\\circ$.\" Pacific Coast Pilot, Appendix 1, p. 21.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nsea are raised to its temperature, and become saturated with moisture, abstracting from it, as they do so, and rendering latent in conformity with well known physical laws, a still greater quantity of heat. When, on reaching the mountainous coast, this moisture is condensed and discharged, the latent heat becomes again apparent, and greatly raises the temperature of the atmosphere in which the reaction occurs.\n\nAccording to Dove's tables, the mean annual temperature of a place situated in the latitude of Glasgow, derived from the temperature of the whole northern hemisphere, should be 35\u00b0. Owing to the Gulf Stream and south-westerly winds, the actual mean annual temperature of Glasgow is about 50\u00b0, or exceeds the normal by 15\u00b0. The mean temperature of the greater part of the North American continent in the same latitude is five to twelve degrees below Dove's normal temperature, but that of the region on the west coast of America (which is related to the course of the Japanese Current in a manner similar to that of the west coast of Europe and the Gulf Stream) as represented by the above-detailed observations at Sitka, exceeds the general mean by eight degrees. The mean annual temperature of Sitka being, in fact, nearly the same as that of Montreal, ten degrees of latitude further south.\n\nThe coast about Port Simpson and the mouth of the Skeena is very imperfectly sheltered from the rain-bearing winds by the Queen Charlotte Islands, while the islands of the coast archipelago, being for the most part of moderate elevation in this region, abstract little moisture. Where these winds first impinge on the mountainous mainland the heaviest precipitation occurs, in exact correspondence with the height to which the moist air is forced up into the higher regions of the atmosphere, and cooled there by its expansion and loss of heat by radiation. As the mountains attain a considerable elevation at the coast, and the increase in height of the peaks towards the axis of the range is comparatively gradual, the heavy rainfall of the coast is not found to be maintained in travelling eastward by the Skeena River.\n\nTHE SKEENA RIVER.\n\nThe village of Port Essington, or Spuksute of the natives, is situated on the south side of the estuary of the Skeena, on the west side of a point forming the angle between it and a long inlet which runs southward, and is called the Eestall. The ground in the vicinity of the village is swampy, and rough with stumps and logs, the remains of an originally dense forest growth. Behind the little flat on which the village stands is a ridge which rises in one place to a rather remarkable conical mount. The Eestall is referred to by Mr. H. J. Cambie*\n\n* Canadian Pacific Railway Report, 1878, p. 38.\nas the source of ice floes which encumber the Skeena estuary during a great part of the winter.\n\nThe estuary of the Skeena was first explored by Mr. Whidbey of Vancouver's staff in July, 1793. He appears to have gone no further up than the mouth of the Estall, and to have been too easily convinced that the inlet was one of no particular importance. To Vancouver the name Port Essington is due, and was by him originally applied to the whole estuary. It is singular that notwithstanding the diligence and skill of Vancouver in his exploration of the west coast he passed the mouths of the three largest rivers, the Fraser, the Skeena and the Nasse, without specially noting them.\n\nThe estuary of the Skeena or Kshi-en, as the river is called by the Tshimsians, above Port Essington occupies a valley which resembles one of the inlets elsewhere penetrating the Coast Range, but has become filled with d\u00e9bris brought down by the river, so that where from the bold banks one would be led to expect deep water, it is not found. The mountains are steep, and for the most part densely wooded, but monotonous from the regularity of their rounded outlines. Their summits, though probably seldom exceeding 4000 feet, were deeply buried in snow at the date of our visit. In a few cases wide areas of bushes and swampy meadows seem to occupy the higher slopes, but frequent large bare surfaces of solid rock are visible, from which snow-slides and land-slips have removed whatever covering of soil may have originally clung.\n\nThe tide flows up the Skeena for a distance of eighteen or twenty miles above Port Essington. At this point the river valley narrows somewhat, and a mass of bare and rocky mountains appears on the north bank. The slopes of these are exceptionally steep and end at the river bank in bluffs and cliffs of considerable height. Between the head of tide and the mouth of the Lakelse River, a distance of thirty-six miles, the Skeena receives several streams of some importance. The valley has an average width in the bottom of from one and a half to two miles, the mountains bordering it everywhere reaching 3000 to 4000 feet at a short distance from the river. At about half way between the two points mentioned, however, the height of the mountains appears often to surpass 4000 feet, and they probably reach 5000 feet on both sides of the river west of the Lakelse. Near the Lakelse with a decreasing altitude they assume more rounded forms and show less bare rock, being covered with trees nearly up to their summits. The quantity of snow which accumulates on the higher mountains is evidently very great. In some places it has poured down the valleys during the winter, forming great heaps near the river's edge, some of which had not entirely vanished at the date of our visit.\nThe valley of the Kstoos or Ecstews is large, and several high ragged summits are seen up it, several miles distant. One of these the Tshimsians call by a name denoting an Indian box from the square shape of its apex.\n\nThroughout this part of its course the dull brownish water of the Skeena flows steadily onward at an estimated rate of four to six knots an hour, sweeping round the islands and pouring through the accumulated piles of drift logs with a steady rushing sound. No reaches of slack water occur. It is evidently in general shallow, and later in the summer must show many wide gravel bars. Islands are exceedingly numerous and often so divide the stream as to cause it to occupy a great part of the valley. The islands, though presenting a considerable aggregate area of flat ground, are so low as to be subject to overflow, or where they rise above the flood level are densely covered with large cottonwoods or spruces.\n\nThe Lakelse flows out of a lake of some size situated about eight miles to the southward, which is about two hundred feet higher than the Skeena at the mouth of the river. The Lakelse valley is a wide and low depression, quite different in character from those of streams joining the Skeena lower down. According to Mr. Cambie, who ascended to the lake in 1877, the valley runs through to the head of the Kitamat arm of Gardner Inlet, the watershed south of Lakelse Lake being quite low. The wide valley from the head of the Kitamat arm was noted by Vancouver at the time of its discovery in 1793. He writes*:\n\n\"This termination differed in some respects from most of the others; its shores were not very abrupt, but were bounded on each side by a range of lofty mountains, which, however, were not (as had been constantly the case) connected at the head of the arm, but continued seemingly in a direction parallel to each other. The valley between them, which was three or four miles wide, formed nearly a plain, and was covered with tall forest trees mostly of the pine tribe.\"\n\nMr. J. Richardson who examined the Kitamat arm in 1874, in connection with the work of the Geological Survey, reports that it is capable of being made a fair harbor. At the mouth of the Lakelse is a small Indian village, and evidences of a former more extensive one. Salmon run up the Lakelse, according to the Indians, in great numbers.\n\nAbout eight miles above the mouth of the Lakelse the Kitsumgalum River joins the Skeena from the north or north-east. It is a large stream and is ascended by the Indians in canoes for a considerable distance. On Mr. Trutch's map it is called the Kitumax. It occupies a wide valley and appears to run through to the Nasse, forming a con-\n\n* Voyages, vol. IV, p. 78.\ntinuation of that of the Lakelso. A small Indian village is situated at the mouth of the river. The water between the Lakelse and the Kitsumgalum we found more rapid and difficult than any we had previously met with on the lower part of the Skeena, and it is at about two miles above the mouth of the Kitsumgalum that the stern-wheel steamer Mumford reached her furthest point in 1866. The Mumford was engaged in carrying supplies for the Western Union telegraph company, and the point reached by her probably marks the limit of profitable steam navigation of the Skeena. It is indeed difficult to understand how some of the rapid reaches below this place were ascended by the Mumford.\n\nAbout five miles above the mouth of the Kitsumgalum is the Sip-ki-aw fall or rapid. The course of the river is here interrupted by a mass of granite, forming a low rocky projection on the left side, which is submerged when the river is in flood. On the opposite bank the rock rises abruptly as a steep hill 600 to 700 feet high, which is continued further up stream by a range similar in elevation. The width of the river at the rapid is 400 to 500 feet only, and at the time of our visit, the water having declined considerably from its highest stage, a half submerged mass of rock was also visible in mid stream. The fall at this stage of water is about two feet only, but a body of water so great, making this descent at a single bound, forms a pretty wild rapid. Canoes are generally unloaded here and tracked up light. Ours were portaged across the rocky neck on the left bank, the stage of the water rendering that the easiest method. A steamer could only be got up the Sip-ki-aw Rapid by warping.\n\nFrom the head of the tide to Sip-ki-aw Rapid the river is characterized by a great number of islands of all shapes and sizes. Above this point there are few. The islands are generally found to be composed of coarse gravel, with several feet in thickness of fine sandy soil or silt capping it. They seldom rise more than ten or twelve feet above the water level, and are evidently in most instances detached portions of the flat occupying the bottom of the valley through which the river flows. The coarse gravel has been deposited in the bottom of the stream, like the bars which now encumber the river, the finer overlying deposits are the result of the overflow on them of the flood waters when the river had cut down to a somewhat lower level. In ascending the river in a canoe the 'sloughs,' or narrow channels behind the islands, are followed as much as possible to escape the strength of the current, though such 'sloughs' are usually found to lead at the head of the island to a rapid and drift-pile.\n\nAbout four miles above Sip-ki-aw the Zymoetz River from the southeast joins the Skeena. This stream, which is of considerable size, was\nexplored by Mr. Cambie in 1877. It has a deep but narrow valley with steep banks and draws most of its waters from the east and northeast in the direction of the Kitsegnecla, but receives a large branch called the Kitnayakwa from the south-east. The mountains among which it rises are over 6000 feet high, the snow-line being about 5200 feet early in August.\n\nAbout five miles above the Zymootz, or seventy-seven from Port Essington, is Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on. The mountains here crowd closely on the river, especially on the north side, and though the cliffs and precipitous rocks are seldom over one hundred feet in height, they are rugged and the hillsides above them steep and rough. The channel of the river is also interrupted by several islands and rocks. At the lower end of the ca\u00f1on the river forms a considerable expansion. Here and in the eddies in the ca\u00f1on itself are the favorite salmon fishing stations of the Indians. In entering the ca\u00f1on from the lower end, it is possible to ascend a certain distance in canoes by making wild dashes across the stream from the eddy at one side to that on the other. The length of the portage varies according to the stage of the water, and the water having fallen considerably from its highest on the 16th of June, we made two short portages. The first across a narrow neck of rock over which the canoes were carried as well as the cargo; the second, about 1000 feet further up, is by a path about 1000 feet long on the left bank. The canoes are tracked up here empty. Canoes descend the rapids safely without portaging.\n\nNear the lower end of the ca\u00f1on, on the right bank, are perched a few Indian houses, with some rudely executed carved posts, or totem poles of the kind common on the northern coast. Most, in this instance, are cylindrical with figures of birds at the top. At the upper end of the ca\u00f1on on the opposite or left bank, is a second and larger village with eight or ten houses, a few in good order, but most in various stages of dilapidation. The latitude of this place as determined by a meridian altitude of the sun is $54^\\circ 37' 6''$. The mountains to the north of the Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on at a few miles distant from the river, are estimated to reach a height of 6000 feet. On the south bank, west of the Zymoetz, is a range of similar height, which from its appearance may be granitic. These, with the mountains before mentioned, constitute the eastern side of the low valley containing the Kitsumgalum and Lakelse. West of the Zymoetz and south of Kitsalas the summits are probably scarcely less in altitude.\n\nFrom Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on to Kwatsalix\u2014a distance of about twenty-four miles\u2014the general course of the river is nearly north and south. The axial and highest range of the Coast Mountains appears to be crossed by the Skeena in this part of its length. The river has, however,\navailed itself of an important structural valley, and has not cut transversely through the range. This is evidenced by the fact that the mountains at some distance from the river are higher than any in its immediate vicinity. From various points a few miles above Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on fine glimpses of the higher peaks are obtained, but a better view, including the whole snow-clad sierra, some tent-like peaks of which surpass a height of 8000 feet, is gained on looking back on this region from the hills above the Forks. In several places small valleys in the upper parts of the range are filled with blue glacier ice, and one glacier which appears to be of some size is situated a few miles below Kwatsalix on the right bank. The semi-circular valley containing this, surrounded by peaks estimated at 7000 feet in height and abundantly covered with snow, is probably the finest piece of mountain scenery on the river. The glacier occupies the bottom of a narrow V-shaped valley and is probably about a quarter of a mile in width, rising up between the slopes like a broad waggon road. The ice appears from a distance to be completely covered with fallen stones and debris, and though the slope of the valley is considerable the motion of the glacier must be slow, as the stream flowing from it was at the date of our visit nearly without earthy impurity. The end of this glacier is about four miles back from the river, and was estimated to be about 600 feet above it.\n\nThe river in this part of its course has several swift rapids, but at moderately low stages of the water the banks are well suited for poling and tracking, rendering ascent though slow not difficult. The valley continues to be about a mile and a half, and even in places two miles wide between the steep slopes of its bordering mountains. The river winds considerably, but does not make abrupt turns, and there is now in general a flat based on gravel and from ten to thirty feet or even more in height, on each side. These flats are not very heavily wooded as a rule, and though sometimes stony, and generally with a light soil, might in part, be brought under cultivation. The growth of wild peas, vetches and other plants was observed to be very luxuriant in some places where the forest had been burnt.\n\nIn correspondence with the position of the highest part of the Coast Range the line of division between the coast and the interior floras may be said to be at Quatsalix. It is by no means so definite, however, in this wide low valley as in the narrow and steep valleys of most other streams crossing the range. The damp-loving devil's club (Echinopanax horrida) and skunk cabbage (Lysichiton Kamtschatense) here became scarce. The last specimen of the wild crab apple (Pirus rivularis) was noted about ten miles below Kwatsalix. Pinus contorta becomes abundant on the river flats with the aspen (Populus tremuloides).\nwhich grows both on these and the hill slopes. The soap berry, or *Shepherdia Canadensis*, and a few specimens of the Douglas fir were noted, and the evidence of comparatively dry summer weather is found in the greater frequency of patches of burnt forest.\n\n*Kwatsalix Ca\u00f1on* is merely a part of the river less than half a mile in length, where steep rocks and low cliffs come down to the water's edge. The water runs swiftly, though not so much so as to prevent loaded canoes working up by poling and without the use of the tracking line, when it is at a good stage. There are a few Indian houses about the ca\u00f1on, and according to our Tshimsian Indians from Metla-Katla the dialect here spoken differs a little from that of the coast.\n\nThe Kit-wan-ga Indian village is situated on the right bank of the Kit-wan-ga river about twenty-four miles above Kwatsalix. There are few islands in this reach of the river, and the valley continues wide with the exception of one place four or five miles above Kwatsalix, where low rocky hills come out on the water's edge. The river is generally swift, with a few stiff rapids. Terrace flats or benches are even more prominent than before and in some places spread widely. One flat in particular, about ten miles below Kit-wan-ga, having been burnt over and grown up with grass and coppice presented a very attractive appearance. It is about a mile long, with a width of half a mile, but with rather light soil. The hills for some distance back from the river are very low, and are evidently composed of the soft rocks of the sandstone and argillite series. Higher mountains appear at some distance. A prominent group of these to the south-east being called Ish-gun-isht by the Indians. Most of the hillsides on this part of the river have been burnt over, and are largely, in some cases for considerable areas, exclusively covered with aspen second-growth.\n\nThe Kit-wan-ga Indian village consists of about fifteen houses situated on a flat of some extent and at a height of about twenty feet above the river. A trail leads from this place across to the Nasse River, the journey occupying, according to the natives, three long days. The houses are of the style usual on the coast but not nearly so large or well finished as those of the Hadias. There are about ten carved posts, but none of them very striking in design.\n\nAbout seven miles above Kit-wan-ga is the mouth of the Kitseguecla River, and some of the strongest rapids we found on the river are situated in a stretch of about four miles near its confluence. Above this point to the Forks, the river though still swift, is more moderate. From Kit-wan-ga to Kitseguecla the river is narrowed in several places by the low rocky hills of Mesozoic sandstones and argillites. The Kitseguecla is a stream of some size but very rapid and apparently\nunsuited for canoeing. It comes from the south-east, and a pretty low valley runs through from its sources to the Watsonkwa behind the mass of mountains known as the Rochers Deboul\u00e9s. There is a small Indian village near the mouth of the river, consisting of about ten houses, quite modern and of inferior construction. This place was accidentally set fire to and burnt by some miners ascending the Skeena a few years ago, and has since been partly rebuilt, the government compensating the Indians to some extent for their loss.\n\nThe Forks,' or Hazelton, is situated on the left bank of the Skeena, a short distance above the junction of the Watsonkwa. It stands on an extensive flat elevated ten or fifteen feet above the river, and at the base of a higher terrace, which rises very steeply to a height of 170 feet. Two or three traders live here, and there is an Indian village of about half-a-dozen barn-like buildings, each accommodating several families. The Indian village is quite new, and there are no carved posts, though the people speak of erecting some soon. The old village, where carved posts are still standing, is about a quarter of a mile further down stream.\n\nThe low region about the Forks, and wide valleys of the Skeena, Watsonkwa, and Kispayox, seem to be shut in on all sides by high mountain ranges. A triangular area, circumscribed by the valleys of the Skeena, Watsonkwa and Kitseguecla is occupied by the Rochers Doboul\u00e9s Range or Nil-ki-au-da of the Tshimsians. The north-east angle of this compact mountain mass is a magnificent rocky summit, with an altitude which was ascertained to be 5955 feet above the Forks, or about 6680 feet above sea level. Among some of the peaks near it a small glacier is sheltered, and great masses of snow in June still lay on the upper parts of the range. The rocky cliffs about the summit must in some places be of great height, but are dwarfed by distance. Looking back down the Skeena, the axial mountains of the Coast Range occupy a considerable part of the horizon line. The highest points probably attain an altitude of 8000 to 9000 feet. To the west and north-west the continuation of these axial mountains is concealed by a nearer range, which lies between the Skeena and the Kispayox, the summits of which are at a distance of six to ten miles from the Forks, and reach heights estimated at from 5000 to 6000 feet. The axis of this small range appears to run north-north-east and south-south-west. The summits have a peculiar reddish appearance. To the north and north-east, a massive range, from 7000 to 8000 feet in height, and holding a few little glaciers, runs north-north-west and south-south-east. It lies to the east of the part of the Skeena above the Forks, and decreases in altitude toward the north, where the Babine River breaks through it.\n\nThe Skeena district can scarcely be regarded as of much value\nagriculturally. On the lower part of the river,\u2014with the possible exception of a few islands,\u2014there is absolutely no good land. At Skeena district about twenty miles below the Forks, however, the higher terraces at the sides of the river, and a few hundred feet above its level, extend in some places several miles back from it, and show soil of fair quality composed of sandy loam with more or less vegetable matter. It is reported that the Skeena valley continues to present the same appearance further up, and it is certainly wide and low for some distance above the Forks, while a considerable width of land suited for agriculture is also found in the valley of the Kispyox to the north-westward. It is impossible to give an exact estimate of the area of arable land in this region, but it may be roughly stated at about 80,000 acres. There may also be some good land in the wide valley of the Lakelse and Kitsumgalum previously referred to, but unless in the event of some local demand arising, it will probably belong before these regions are fully utilized.\n\nThe Skeena has been somewhat extensively used as a channel of communication between the Omenica mines and the coast for a number of years, but as the notes already given render evident, is by no means well adapted as an artery of trade. The large canoes that the Indians of the coast hollow from the cedar, are generally employed on the Skeena. These have remarkably elegant lines, and are not as might be supposed heavy or cumbrous. Large boats carrying about fifteen tons have been worked up to the Forks, but the native canoes are found better adapted to the work. Freight brought up to the Forks costs about four dollars a hundred pounds. The point to which the steamer \"Mumford\" ascended is sixty-two miles above Port Essington. Above the Forks the river is scarcely deemed navigable even for canoes. The ascent of the river in canoes requires the utmost skill, dexterity, and strength on the part of the crews. Paddling is of little use, and only resorted to in certain quiet reaches, or in crossing the stream. Tough hemlock poles, pointed and hardened in the fire, are generally employed, and with these the canoe is impelled foot by foot against the rushing water, till some place too strong or deep is reached when a dash must be made for the opposite bank, or the shore of some island, and the poling there recommenced. Tracking with a line on the beach is also resorted to, but when the water is too high and has flooded the beach, it often becomes necessary to drag the canoe up along the banks by the branches of trees and half-submerged shrubbery.\n\nVEGETATION AND CLIMATE OF THE SKEENA.\n\nThe point at which the vegetation of the coast is replaced by that characteristic of the northern interior of the province has already been\nnoted, and it will be unnecessary to enter at length into the dates at which various plants were observed to be in bloom. It may suffice to state that the lower part of the Skeena exposed to the climatic influences of the coast, is distinctly later than Victoria, by probably at least ten days. The vegetation in the vicinity of the Forks, is still considerably in advance of that of many of the cultivated and thickly peopled portions of the province of Quebec. From the character of the plants met with, the rainfall at the Forks would appear to be about equal to that at Quesnel, and quite ample for agriculture, though very much less than that at the mouth of the river.\n\nThe summer temperature of the region about the Forks is often high. According to Mr. Hankin, a trader who has resided many years at this place, snow generally first falls in October, but melts again, the winter snow not coming till about the middle of December. The winter is in general steadily cold, though there is almost always a thaw in February. The thermometer has been known to reach forty-eight degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, and to remain for days at a time below -30\u00b0.\n\nThe winter is in fact about the same as that of Stuart Lake, but the spring is said to open much earlier. Grass begins to grow green and some trees to bud out about the first week in April. Some cultivation is carried on. Potatoes are occasionally nipped by frost in the spring, and on two occasions have been affected by summer frosts. They are generally harvested in the end of September, but are ripe before that time, and can be obtained large enough for use about the first of July. Indian corn does not ripen, and wheat, Mr. Hankin believes would be an uncertain crop. The season of 1878 was exceptionally long, and two successive crops of oats ripened before the frost; the second being a 'volunteer crop.' In favorable seasons, squashes, cucumbers and other tender vegetables come to perfection. A few cattle and horses have been wintered here, the former requiring to be fed for five months, the latter have been kept by clearing away the snow to a certain depth in strips to allow them to scrape for grass.\n\nThe climate is in general much like that of Quebec or Montreal, with the exception of the winter, which, according to the statements above given, though rather shorter, is more severe. I am induced to think that Mr. Hankin may be wrong in supposing that wheat would not succeed well about the Forks, but this must remain a matter for future experiment.\n\nThe Skeena usually opens during the last week in April or first week of May. Ice begins to run in the river early in November, but the river does not generally freeze till the end of December. The river being very rapid, the occasion of its freezing is usually the occurrence\nof a thaw. This sets free great quantities of anchor ice, sometimes very suddenly, blocking the river and causing it to freeze over. In 1867 the river closed on the 13th of November, which was exceptionally early. The river is generally highest in July, deriving most of its water from the melting snow on the mountains. It is lowest immediately after the ice goes.\n\nWith regard to the snowfall on the Skeena, Mr. H. J. Cambie during his survey here in 1877, gathered that from Port Essington to near the mouth of the Lakelse (54 miles), it is exceedingly heavy, reaching a depth of ten feet or more. From this place to Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on it reduces, at least occasionally, a depth of six feet; while about Kit-wun-ga\u2014sixteen miles below the Forks\u2014it averages three feet. So far as information can be obtained from the Indians it appears to confirm these estimates. The depth on the benches about the Forks is not over one foot, but owing to local circumstances the snowfall is here considerably less than in any neighbouring locality, the average for this part of the Skeena valley being probably a little under two feet.\n\nMeteorological observations kept by myself while on the Skeena, from June 7th to 23rd, being taken en route from Port Essington to the Forks, are necessarily imperfect, and as we were engaged in travelling during the day it was impossible to ascertain the maximum temperature. The mean minimum temperature read on a good thermometer carefully placed, on nine nights, between Port Essington and Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on, was 43\u00b74\u00b0 F., the actual lowest reading being 39\u00b0. The mean of seven nights from the ca\u00f1on to the Forks, 43\u00b76\u00b0, the actual lowest being 37\u00b75\u00b0. The mean of observations taken about 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., every day, on the first mentioned part of the river is 50\u00b78\u00b0; on the upper part of the river, 52\u00b78\u00b0. The mean of morning readings taken below Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on is 45\u00b0 of evening readings, 56\u00b74\u00b0. These, reduced for the hour and time of the year by Dove's table of corrections, derived from observations at Sitka, indicate actual mean temperature of 49\u00b71\u00b0 and 53\u00b71\u00b0, respectively. The mean doubtless lies between these figures, but their discord shows that we have already a considerably greater range and a climate more continental in character than that of Sitka. Morning observations above the ca\u00f1on, indicate a mean of 46\u00b76\u00b0. Evening observations 58\u00b79\u00b0, which, corrected in the same way, yield 50\u00b758\u00b0 and 55\u00b76\u00b0, as approximations to the true mean temperature.\n\nOf the Watsonkwa River, which joins the Skeena from the southeastward at the Forks, Mr. Cambie reports that the valley throughout its entire length is in part prairie and sustains a magnificent growth of grass, but is subject to frequent summer frosts and unsuited to agriculture.*\n\n*Canadian Pacific Railway Report, 1878, p. 70.\nIndian Population of the Skeena Region.\n\nOn most of the rivers of British Columbia, the Coast Indians, completely different in language and habits from those of the interior, claim the territory to the head of canoe navigation. Following this rule, they stretch much further inland on the Skeena than elsewhere. The Indians of the Forks speak the same language with the Tshimsians of the coast, with but slight dialectal difference, while those of the Ahwilgate and Kyahwilgate villages, a few miles up the Watsonkwa are people of the Tinneh or Carrier stock. Dialects of the Tshimsian are spoken for about eighty miles above the Forks on the line of the river, and up the Babino River to the ca\u00f1on. The people of the Kispoyox village on the river of the same name about eighty miles north of the Forks, also speak the Tshimsian language, but these and those of the upper part of the Skeena approximate in their manner of speech to the Nascar Indians of the Nassc. The Nascars have permanent villages about twenty-five miles above the tide water on the Nassc, and claim the country for about fifty miles still further up. The division between all the branches of the Tshimsians and the Tinneh or Carrier people, appears to be quite distinct.\n\nThe Indian population of this region is estimated as follows:\n\n| Estimated population |\n|----------------------|\n| **Tshimsian**        |\n| On the Skeena:       |\n| Kitsumgalum.......... | 25 |\n| Kitsalas, uncertain, owing to the number of people away at the coast and elsewhere yet calling this place their home, about... | 300 |\n| Kitseguecla.......... | 150 |\n| Skeena Forks......... | 250 |\n| Kuldoir, above the Forks.............. | 150 |\n| Kispoyox.................. | 350 |\n| Kit-ka-gas, three miles up the Babine River from its mouth.......................... | 400 |\n| Kit-wun-kool, between the Skeena and the Nasso... | 250 |\n| **Tinneh**....          |\n| Ahwilgate and Kyahwilgate on the Watsonkwa.... | 200 |\n\nTotal: 2,075\n\nFor these estimates,\u2014which must be considered as very rough approximations only,\u2014and for several of the facts above mentioned I am indebted to Mr. Hankin.\n\nBabine Portage.\n\nThe Skeena River above the Forks being exceedingly rapid, and the Babino River in the ca\u00f1ons quite impassable for canoes, and making\nBesides a long detour to the north, the route for the north end of Babine Lake and Omenica leaves the Skeena at the Forks. The distance from the Forks to Babine Lake in a straight line is about forty-one miles, by the trail probably about fifty. The direction is nearly due east. The trail between these places, following nearly the line of the old Indian route, was cut and improved by the Government of British Columbia a number of years ago to afford more ready access to the Omenica district. It is still used to a considerable extent, more especially by the Indians, who make a regular trade of carrying goods and provisions across at the rate of about $4 a hundred pounds. The load usually carried by a man or woman is about one hundred pounds in weight, but in many cases much more than this is taken. The pack is firmly roped together and then supported on the back by straps round the chest and forehead.\n\nHaving a considerable quantity of provisions and baggage we were obliged to hire a motley crew of Indians to carry these across to Babine Lake, and on leaving the Forks on the 23rd of June we found that our carriers were twenty-three in number, including two women. Several dogs, were also pressed into the service to carry various articles belonging to the Indians themselves. The carriers advanced by stages of a mile or half a mile at a time, according to the nature of the ground, stopping every now and then for a few moments rest.\n\nAfter ascending from the flat at the Forks, the trail passes over a nearly level bench or terrace for some miles. It is lightly wooded with poplar, cottonwood and birch, mingled with evergreen trees, and seems to have a good soil and to be fit for cultivation. Grass, with wild peas and vetches, grow in great luxuriance, and at the date above given the thickets were fragrant with wild roses. Service berries and choke cherries had attained about half their full size on sunny exposures, and wild strawberries were ripe, and abundant in some places. At about four miles from the Forks the trail comes out on the sloping hillside on the right bank of the Watsonkwa, which it continues to follow for nearly seven miles, till the Sus-kwa* just above its junction with the Watsonkwa, is reached. In following the hillsido the valleys of several small streams flowing in courses of greater or less depth are crossed. The valley of the Watsonkwa, between the bases of the mountains at its sides, is wide, but the immediate valley of the river is a steep-sided trough several hundred feet in depth, and the river itself flows onward between rocky banks with the speed and impetuousness of a torrent. The Indians in this part of the country construct bridges across streams too rapid to\n\n*A Carrier name meaning Bear River.\nbe crossed in canoes with safety, when not too wide for the means at disposal. These have been called suspension bridges, and are ingenious in plan. The Watsonkwa is spanned by one of these about five miles above the Forks. The river is here about fifty feet wide, rushing between rocky cliffs of about fifty feet in height. At each side two beams are placed, projecting at an angle of twenty or thirty degrees, their butt-ends being firmly planted in a rude crib-work of logs weighted with stones. The ends of the projecting beams from opposite sides are then joined by a pair of light but strong horizontal pieces which are lashed to them. The footway or floor of the bridge may consist of a single large flatted beam or of several lengths of poles spliced together and laid parallel. The footway is suspended to the superstructure above described by a series of vertical poles with hooked ends, withes being used as lashing, or, as in the instance now described, telegraph wire, being a portion of that left by the Western Union Company at the time of the abandonment of their enterprise.\n\nAbout six miles from the mouth of the Sus-kwa, it is joined by the Skil-o-kis, from the north, a very rapid stream fifty-seven feet wide, and two feet deep. This is crossed by a newly constructed Indian bridge like that previously described. Five miles further on, in a general eastward direction, the main valley of the Sus-kwa turns to the south-south-east, while the trail continues eastward by that of a large tributary. The sources of this stream, known as the Oo-ats-anli, are reached in about fourteen miles, and the summit passed at a distance of seven miles from the north end of Babine Lake.\n\nThe Sus-kwa valley, to the mouth of the Oo-ats-anli, is wide, if the entire distance between the steep mountains at its sides be taken into consideration, but shows terraces at several different levels, the river itself flowing in a deep narrow trough cut in these. The terraces are usually very stony and even when of considerable width are quite unsuited to agriculture. The hillsides generally have been almost denuded of trees by fire, and exhibit a rank growth of grass, wild pea, *Heracleum* and *Epilobium*, in some places already shoulder high, and offering very fine summer pasture for stock. At the junction of the Sus-kwa and Oo-ats-anli a wide flat of attractive appearance is sunk among the mountains, but is probably of no agricultural value. In following the Oo-ats-anli, the trail continues on the whole to ascend though frequent descents into the valleys of tributary streams are made. The benches are rough and irregular, and are cut across by numerous little streams. Fire has passed over nearly the whole country, leaving in some parts of the valley great forests of bleached and bristling trunks, with only here and there a cluster or belt of trees which has not been\ndestroyed. Where the trees are still green the ground is everywhere soft and wet. In its upper portion, and at the summit, the valley is wide and flat-bottomed with swamps and swampy meadows alternating with brush and wood. The summer trail does not cross the summit at the lowest place, but leaving the valley to the south, ascends and passes over an irregular plateau at a height of about 750 feet greater than the pass. This little plateau is quite evidently of the nature of a terrace, and its surface is strewn with water-worn and transported stones and boulders. Its height above the sea is about 4300 feet. The dense forest which has originally filled the valleys here gives place to clumps of stunted trees, with thick rapidly tapering stems, composed of many superposed annual rings of growth. On June 26th the snow had evidently not long gone from the ground and the low-growing willows were just leafing out. Streamlets ran everywhere upon the surface from one little moss-rimmed pool to another. At greater elevations on the surrounding mountains, very few trees are seen, and 4500 feet may be stated as the upward limit of the healthy growth of trees in this region.\n\nThe highest peaks of the range separating the valleys of Watsonkwa and Skeena from that of Babine Lake are passed about half way from the mouth of the Oo-ats-anli to its sources, and lie to the west of the summit of the trail. A great rugged mass of mountains to the south occupies the angle between the Sus-kwa and Oo-ats-anli. This receives the name of Ne-tal-tzul, which was translated to me as the 'watery mountain.' It has a height of about 8500 feet, and one or more small glaciers are observed among the mountains near it. The mountain sheep is found in this part of the range, but not very abundantly. The mountain goat is common to all the ranges of this region.\n\nLooking in the opposite direction from the summit plateau Babine Lake is seen stretching far to the south-eastward like a silver ribbon, its banks generally low with flats or rounded hills of moderate elevation bordering it. The weather at the time of our visit was not favourable for a very distant view, and only a portion of the snowy ranges which might otherwise have been seen to the south-east were visible. The descent to Babine Lake is rather gradual, over a somewhat broken surface chiefly composed of stony superficial deposits, not arranged in terrace form. The country is either densely wooded or bristling with windfall, the most abundant trees being Abies subalpina, Engelm., (Lasiocarpa Hook), Picea Engelmanni, and Pinus contorta. Before reaching the lake the trail crosses a small river called the Tz\u00ebs-a-tza-kwa or Canoe-making river. This in low water was fifty feet wide by one foot deep, and derives its waters from the range from which we have descended.\nLakes and Mountains of Northern British Columbia.\n\nThe group of large lakes of which Babine is one, may be regarded as occupying two parallel valleys, which conform to the general north-westerly and south-easterly bearings which govern the main features of the whole country lying between the Rocky Mountains proper and the coast. Babine Lake, for the greater part of its length, lies nearly parallel to the Watsonkwa valley, but at its southern end bends abruptly eastward, a wide valley running through from its extremity to the head of Stuart Lake. The watershed between the Skeena and Fraser River systems is situated in this valley, Babine Lake discharging northward by the Babine River, which after following the general direction of the valley occupied by the lake for some distance, cuts across the line of the Babine Mountains and reaches the Skeena; Stuart Lake discharging by the Stuart River into the Nechacco and thence to the Fraser. The valley of Stuart Lake opens widely at its south-eastern extremity to the low country of the Nechacco and Chilaccio.\n\nStuart Lake occupies the south-eastern part of the second or north-eastern of the great valleys above referred to; and to the north-west of it in the same line lie Trembleur, Tacla and Bear Lakes. Stuart Lake is about forty miles in extreme length, Tacla forty-six miles and Bear Lake about twelve miles, while the dimensions of Trembleur, Traverse or Cross Lake are not known. Trembleur and Tacla Lakes discharge south-eastward into Stuart Lake, while Bear Lake forms the source of the Skeena. With the generally more mountainous character of the country to the north the height of the water surface in the lakes increases being approximately as follows: Stuart Lake 2200, Tacla Lake 2271, Bear Lake 2604. Thutage or Thutade Lake still further to the north is scarcely known. It is probably the same with a long lake sketched by Mr. Madden, a prospector in that region, and may lie in the continuation of the same persistent valley. It discharges into the south branch of the Finlay, and a fall of 180 feet in height is reported to exist not far below its outlet.\n\nThe Babine Mountains form a well defined range from the northern bend of the Babine River (lat. 54\u00b0 40') to the vicinity of Fraser Lake to the south-east. They appear to culminate in height between the north bend of the Babine and the Babine and Skeena Forks trail, and decrease in elevation in a south-eastward direction, departing gradually at the same time from the shore of Babine Lake and leaving a wide intervening low country.\n\nThe entire region between Babine Lake and River, the north bend of the Skeena, Bear and Tacla Lakes is filled with high and rugged\nmountain ranges. The Atna or Atnah* Mountains lying north of the Babine River rise according to Mr. Horetzky to elevations of 9000 feet, and the summit of the Atna Pass by which they are crossed is 6000 feet. Bordering Tacla Lake on the south-west is a massive range which as it is crossed by the Fire-pan Pass may be designated the Fire-pan Range. Its summits are 7000 to 8000 feet in height. Further north near Bear Lake this range appears to become less homogeneous and more broken, but still continues as a high rugged mountainous country. South of the latitude of the southern end of Tacla Lake the region between the two valleys defined in a preceding paragraph, is not so mountainous, and though still broken the elevations seem seldom to exceed 4000 feet.\n\nTo the east of Stuart Lake lies a range of limestone mountains which can be traced running far to the north-westward from high points in that vicinity. According to the best accounts of the country about Trembleur Lake, the range must there be low or wanting, but further north it resumes as the Omenica Mountains on the east side of Tacla Lake, and forms also the mountains on the east side of Bear Lake. This range is by no means so high and rugged as those previously described, Na-katl, which forms its south-eastern extremity, has a height of 4800 feet, while the Hogem Pass leading across to the Omenica gold region was proved by Mr. Horetzky to have an elevation of only 3438 feet.\n\nStill further to the east and north-east is the Omenica mining region, which is a relatively depressed but still hilly and mountainous district. Hogem on the Omenica River has an elevation of 2570 feet, while the mouth of Germansen Creek is at 2457 feet. The country between the Omenica River from Stuart to McLeod Lake has not been explored, but no high ranges are known to exist.\n\n**Babine and Stuart Lakes.**\n\nBabine Lake has been so called by the French or half-breed servants of the North West or Hudson Bay Companies in allusion to the fact that the Indians living on it had the custom of wearing a wooden labret or lip-piece in the lower lip. This custom though common on the coast is not elsewhere found among the Carrier or Tinneh people of the interior, and has doubtless been a fashion acquired by them from the Tshimsians. The lake is known as Kit-koin by the Tshimsians, by the Carriers as Na-taw-bun-kut or 'long lake.' While lying in the main in a north-west and south-east bearing the actual course of the lake is rather sinuous. Its length is eighty-seven miles, while its width varies\n\n---\n\n*This is the name applied by the Tinneh people of British Columbia to any foreign Indians. The Atna Pass is here so called as being that used by the Coast Indians as an avenue to the interior country.*\nfrom half a mile to five or six miles. The elevation of the lake above the sea is about 2222 feet, or twenty-two feet greater than Stuart Lake.* On the east side of the lake, near its outlet, is situated an Indian village called Wut-at, and a small trading post of the Hudson Bay Company. The Indians take here annually a large quantity of salmon by forming a weir of split sticks across the river. The salmon are dried and stored in a cache raised on posts in the usual way, and kept for home use or to sell to travelling parties of Indians on the way between the coast and the Omenica Mines. The canoes used in the interior lakes are far inferior to those of the coast Indians, a fact arising in part from the absence of the cedar which the coast tribes employ. Cottonwood 'dug outs,' small, narrow, slab-sided and often more or less seriously warped and out of shape on account of exposure to the sun and air, are in general all that can be obtained. On the 20th of June we left the north end of the lake in two such canoes, and being favoured with good weather reached the opposite or southeastern extremity on the morning of July 3rd.\n\nFrom the north end of the lake to Na-tal-kuz\u2014a distance of twenty-five miles\u2014it is narrow, and much more sinuous and irregular in width than the sketches which have heretofore appeared on the maps would lead one to suppose. It has also the appearance, in this part of its length, of being quite shallow. The banks rise often to a height of 100 to 200 feet pretty steeply, and then slope more gently away to the hills which do not anywhere in the vicinity of the lake reach 1000 feet. Considerable areas are quite flat and low, and on southern exposures large tracts have been thoroughly burnt over forming slopes of rich pasturage. In many places the timber is more than half composed of aspen second-growth, and the coniferous are everywhere relieved by a mixture of deciduous trees. In passing down the lake, occasional glimpses of the high and snowy mountains which intervene between it and the Watsonkwa are caught. Several of the peaks attain 8000 feet, but after leaving the north end of the lake a wide stretch of comparatively low land intervenes between the shore and the base of the range. To the north-east is seen from a few points the wall-like and cloud-capped range across which the Fire-pan Pass leads. This surpasses the last-mentioned range in general elevation, and is everywhere heavily snow-covered.\n\nNa-tal-kuz is the name of a second Indian village, situated on the north side of the lake, at the extremity of a point which lies between\n\n---\n\n* It should be stated that a considerable discrepancy exists between the height here stated and that given by Mr. Horetzky. I have been unable to explain this difference, for while I feel sure that the difference between Stuart Lake and Babine here given is nearly correct, Mr. Horetzky's estimation seems to be founded on a number of correct observations. The height assigned by Mr. Horetzky is 1647 above Skeena Forks, or assuming that point to be 725 feet, 2372 feet above the sea.\nit and a long arm running to the north-eastward. The surrounding region, and a prominent and nearly conical hill which stands a few miles back from the village are denoted by the same name. The village is also called Ni-to-atz, but this is a comparatively modern name and refers to a trading post of the Hudson Bay Company. This post is the most important on the lake, that at the north-east end being only occasionally visited. Both are at present in charge of Mr. Sanspere, who proved able and willing to give much valuable information on the surrounding country.\n\nFrom this point the lake runs nearly due south-eastward for about thirty-five miles. Its width is greatly increased, and while its southwest shore shows little irregularity of outline, its north-eastern border forms two deep bays and is fringed by numerous islands. The shores continue on the whole low, though a rampart-like range of hills 800 to 900 feet in height runs along the north-east side, beyond the bottoms of the bays above referred to for eighteen or twenty miles from Na-tal-kuz. To the east of this is a low region through which a trail was at one time opened to Trembleur Lake, as a means of access to Omenica. At a little distance from the shore on both sides hills 700 to 800 feet in height appear as projections on the flat or undulating country of less elevation. There is as before much lightly-wooded and aspen-covered country, and if the climate is suitable, there is evidently here a wide stretch of land favourable in soil and contour for farming. The rainfall appears to become less as the lake is followed to the south-eastward. A few specimens of Artemisia frigida appear with the Douglas fir, and other plants not before observed.\n\nAt its upper end the lake turns to a south-south-east bearing and eventually for about twelve miles runs nearly due east. Its average width for twenty or twenty-five miles, is three and a half to four miles. It is evidently very deep, and the Indians say that this part of the lake does not freeze across in winter. With the appearance of Tertiary volcanic rocks, which here occur tilted at various angles, the country becomes somewhat more rugged, and the land bordering the lake is higher. There are still, however, on the north shore some fine grassy slopes, while the south in more densely wooded.\n\nA remarkably abrupt rocky hill of 600 to 700 feet high stands on the south side of the lake at its extremity. This is called Te-tzal-to. East of it is a wide low valley running to the south-east (S 55\u00b0 E. 10 miles or more) from which a large stream flows. A small lake lies some way up it, according to Indian report, and a trail runs through Portage to the Stella Indian village at the head of Fraser Lake.* A low tract,\n\n*See Report of Progress 1876-77, p. 46.\nbeing the continuation of that in which the lakes lie, also leads through from the extremity of Babine Lake to Stuart Lake. The length of the portage, or actual distance over which goods have to be carried, is about seven and a half miles, and the Hudson Bay Company have constructed a moderately good waggon track between the lakes. The country passed over is undulating and appears to consist of wide terraced flats or benches, through which little rocky and gravelly hills project. The summit is about 400 feet above Babine Lake, the valley some four miles wide between the steeper slopes, with a soil which though in some places good, is generally light. About one-third of the area may be regarded as suitable for agriculture. Most of the wood has been destroyed by fire, but the western scrub pine (Pinus contorta) appears to have been the most abundant tree. The portage trail ends at the mouth of a little sluggish river, less than one hundred feet wide, called the Yi-ko, which rises in a small lake to the north-westward. The latitude of the point, at which the portage road ends at the mouth of the Yi-ko was found to be $55^\\circ 36' 22''$.\n\nStuart Lake or Na-kas-le, from the mouth of the Yi-ko southeastward, is a fine sheet of water thirty-one miles in length, and about five miles in width in most places. Its north-western end is somewhat contracted and surrounded by mountains 1000 to 2000 feet high. It sends off a narrow arm or fiord in a north-westward direction, for a distance of probably ten miles or more, which distance might be added to the length as above stated. A short portage leads across from this arm to Trembleur Lake. The outline of the shore line about the north-western end of the lake is ragged, and there are many small islands, while to the east it runs in wide sweeping curves, and the water is evidently not so deep. Besides the Yi-ko, two streams of some size known as the Tache and Pinchi, flow into the lake. The first of these comes from Trembleur or Cross Lake, which in turn receives the water of Tacla Lake. It is by this route that goods are carried by the Hudson Bay Company from Fort St. James to their post on Bear or Connelly Lake in latitude $56^\\circ 6'$. The Pinchi, also from the north, is smaller, and rises in a lake not many miles from Stuart Lake, and which appears to occupy a parallel valley. The peak Na-katl, 4800 feet in height, and its surrounding rugged limestone mountains, which touch on the north shore of the lake at its eastern extremity, have been described in former reports. The continuation of this range, running north-westward, altogether leaves the lake at the mouth of the Pinchi River. The land here becomes low and level, and is lightly wooded with aspen, mixed with coniferous trees. The south-western shore of the lake is pretty closely bordered by high hills, and as usual more densely wooded; but the\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\naggregate area of cultivable land must be considerable. The Douglas fir is quite abundant round the shores of Stuart Lake, and I was informed on good authority, that it extends northward to near the middle of Tacla Lake.\n\nCLIMATE OF THE LAKES.\n\nThe northern or lower extremity of Babine Lake being more closely hemmed in by snow-clad mountains, is evidently less favourably situated than the remainder of this lake and Stuart Lake, and vegetation was found to be decidedly behind that of the Sus-kwa valley. Mr. Sanspere of the Hudson Bay Company, states that at the post at Na-tal-kuz, on Babine Lake, he can grow potatoes and many kinds of vegetables, and that his predecessor grew barley, which ripened well. An Indian living on the portage between the two lakes cultivates a little patch of land, and though very poorly attended to, he had a fine looking crop of potatoes and a little field of barley\u2014the latter about three feet high and with the ear just appearing\u2014at the date of our visit (July 4th). He also keeps some cattle here, cutting hay for them in swamps about the river mouth. At Fort St. James we found potatoes flourishing, but rather late, having been cut down by a frost in June. Barley was doing well, and has been grown as a regular crop for many years.* In the garden were peas, lettuce, beets, carrots, onions, garlic, turnips, cabbages and cauliflowers, doing well enough, but not carefully cultivated. Wheat has been sown this year as an experiment, and had not suffered from frost at the date of our visit (July 7th).\n\nTemperature observations kept while on Babine and Stuart Lakes, Temperature.\u2014June 27th to July 8th\u2014gave a mean minimum temperature of 40\u00b72\u00b0. The mean of the early morning and evening observations being 51\u00b75\u00b0. The temperature is here subject to greater and more rapid changes than in the Skeena valley, and on the night of June 29th we experienced a frost, the thermometer registering 26\u00b0 near the northern end of Babine Lake, and in the vicinity of the snow-clad mountains already referred to.\n\nIn the valley of Babine and Stuart Lakes the summer season seems to be sufficiently long, and the absolute amount of heat great enough to bring all ordinary crops, including wheat, to maturity, but the question remains to what extent the liability to summer frosts may interfere with the cultivation of some plants, more especially wheat. Though this valley may be regarded as a continuation of the country of the Lower Nechacco, its vicinity to the mountains appears to render it somewhat inferior to that district in climate, and places it in this regard, in my opinion, nearly in the same position with the country\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1876-77, p. 51.\nbordering on Fran\u00e7ois Lake. In previous reports,\u2020 I have described the flat country of the Lower Nechacco basin as constituting the greatest connected region susceptible of cultivation in the province of British Columbia. Its area has been estimated at 1000 square miles. It is based on fine white silty deposits of the later portion of the glacial period, constituting a soil almost uniformly fertile, and is remote from high snow-clad ranges. In the absence of further information, I can merely repeat what was said of this region on a former occasion, viz., that while it is not probable that wheat can be grown over all parts of its area, it can scarcely be doubted that barley may be ripened almost everywhere in it, while wheat would succeed in chosen spots. This region will, doubtless, at some time support a considerable population, but it is to be remarked that the passage of a railway through it would do little at present toward settling it; for in the first instance, the country to the east of the Rocky Mountains, in the Peace River or Saskatchewan valleys, would offer superior inducements to farmers and stock raisors.\n\n**Indian Population of Northern British Columbia.**\n\nThe Tinneh Indians of this northern part of the interior of British Columbia are divided by dialect into two great groups, known as the Porteurs or Carriers, and the Siccanies. The Carriers extend on the Fraser as far down as Soda Creek, near the mouth of the Chilcotin. They inhabit the valley of the Blackwater, and stretch westward to Gatcho Lake and the Coast Range, Fraser, Stuart, and Babine Lakes and the Watsonkwa valley; north of Fort St. James to Middle River, and east to Fort McLeod and the Fraser River, above Fort George to about 120\u00b0 30' of longitude. The Siccanies lie to the north and east of the Carriers, occupying the west part of Tacla Lake and the region about Bear or Connolly Lake. They extend up the North Finlay about seventy-five miles and down the main stream of the Peace River to Hudson's Hope. North of the Siccanies and toward the coast, are the Na-ha-nies, who are said to speak a different dialect, while the Indians still further north, about Cassiar, are said to be again different.\n\nThe Na-taw-tin or people of Babine Lake, number about 300. The Na-kas-le-tin, or people of Stuart Lake, are divided as follows:\u2014Villages at Fort St. James, 75; at Pinchi River, 40; at Tache River, 32. At Grand Rapid, ten miles up the Tache, are the Kus-ch\u0113-o-tin, now numbering 22 souls; at Stony Creek, south of the Nechacco, are the Ta-tshik-o-tin, numbering 24; at Nool-ke Lake, the Nool-ke-o-tin numbering 56; of the Nau-tle-a-tin and Stel-a-tin, of Fraser Lake, I did not learn the number. There are no permanent villages on Fran\u00e7ois Lake,\n\n---\n\n\u2020 Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1876-77, p. 45. Canadian Pacific Railway Report, 1877, p. 252.\nthat part of the country belonging to the Watsonkwa people who visit it periodically.\n\nSTUART LAKE TO MCLEOD'S LAKE.\n\nAt Fort St. James we met the pack trains, which had been sent from Kamloops, and by means of which our supplies for the prosecution of the survey in the Peace River country were to be transported. We left Fort St. James on July 8th, the combined parties aggregating seventy-four pack and twenty-two riding animals, and reached Fort McLeod at the north end of McLeod's Lake on the 14th. This part of the route being the same with that traversed by Mr. Selwyn in 1875, and by Mr. J. Hunter in 1877*; and having already been described by them, need not be referred to here in great detail. The region as a whole is flat, and characterized rather by low ridges and terraces than by hills. Its eastern part drains toward Stuart Lake, but the greatest area is unwatered by the Salmon River and its tributaries, which flowing southward joins the Fraser near Fort George. East of the Salmon River lies the Pacific and Arctic, watershed beyond which the Long Lake River\u2014a small stream\u2014is found flowing toward McLeod's Lake. On leaving Stuart Lake the ground rises gradually till a height of 400 feet is gained at eight or nine miles from the Lake. The surface is generally undulating, has been frequently burnt over, and shows fine grassy meadows, suitable for cultivation. From this place to the crossing of Salmon River, the country consists of undulating uplands, the highest point of which is about 700 feet above Stuart Lake. Carrier Lake, two and a half miles long, is passed to the left, besides several other small ponds. These may occupy original inequalities in the surface of the drift deposits with which the surface is here heavily covered, the material being a sandy clay with stones and boulders like that called 'boulder-clay' elsewhere in British Columbia. At the east end of Carrier Lake, are some remarkable ridges which resemble moraines, but are composed of sand. The Salmon River is here a stream about fifty feet wide by two deep, with a gentle current. The latitude of the point at which the trail first touches it is 54\u00b0 36' 26\". From Salmon River to Swamp River, so called, a sluggish tributary of the former, the distance is ten miles, the country resembling that above described, but being rather more broken and irregular, and quite useless agriculturally. Between Swamp River to the narrows of Lac a la Carp, or Carp Lake\u2014twelve miles\u2014the Pacific-Arctic watershed is crossed, with an elevation of 620 feet above Stuart Lake, or taking the latter at 2200 feet\u20142820 feet above the sea. The watershed region is characterized by the great\n\n* Report of Progress, 1875-76, p. 34. Canadian Pacific Railway Report, 1878, p. 73.\nspread of nearly level or slightly undulating terrace flats. These are generally sandy or gravelly, with occasional level ground occupied by swamps and small lakes. *Pinus contorta* is common, generally growing in a scattered manner, and rather stunted from the poor soil. *Lupinus polyphyllus*, purple with blossom, was very abundant. Carp Lake has an elevation of 2747 feet. The trail crosses it at the narrows, and it is necessary to unpack and swim the animals. It would be easy to make a trail round the northern bay, which would avoid this trouble and the subsequent travelling in the water round the border of the lake.\n\n**Long Lake.**\n\nCarp Lake flows into Long Lake, a pretty little sheet of water with banks rising steeply to about one hundred feet, and a hill 500 or 600 feet high on the south side. Long Lake River, a small stream, is crossed by the trail at the lower end of the lake. Iroquois Creek, a small brook\u2014so called from the murder of an Iroquois here by the Fort St. James Indians many years ago\u2014is then crossed. Its valley is deep and to the south of the trail are large swampy meadows with fine feed.\n\n**Iroquois Lake.**\n\nBeyond Iroquois Creek a series of mounds and ridges are passed over, and the trail then descends gradually, over dry sandy or gravelly slopes and terraces, which are for the most part covered with burnt woods, to the edge of McLeod's Lake. At the border of the lake the Long Lake River is again crossed at its mouth. It is here about fifty feet wide by two deep with a rapid current.\n\nThe ridges several times referred to, are rather remarkable in character, and often strongly resemble moraines. Near the east end of Carp Lake are some peculiar depressions, in some instances nearly circular and over one hundred feet deep, occasionally holding pools. The surrounding country is a mass of ridges which however have no very constant direction, the whole being composed of gravel, or material like that above referred to as boulder clay. In the vicinity of Iroquois Creek these ridges are particularly noticeable and are associated with little terraces which generally seem to occupy lower levels and to have been later in date of formation.\n\n**Moraines.**\n\nThe country between Stuart and McLeod's Lakes is thus somewhat higher than the Nechacco and Chilaco country to the south, and quite different in character, wanting the extensive deposits of white silt which there form a fertile soil. The soil is here generally light, sandy or gravelly, and is at present covered for the most part by burnt woods. A considerable area would doubtless be available for pasture land if the forest were completely removed by fire, and there are numerous swamps and meadows along streams yielding natural hay. The region cannot however be considered as of any agricultural value. It formerly yielded large number of skins, of marten, mink and other forest-inhabiting animals, but since the extensive spread of fires\u2014some of the most\n\n**Region without agricultural value.**\n\nForest fires.\n\n---\n\n**Long Lake.**\n\nMcLeod's Lake is situated near the head of the lake, and is connected with it by a narrow channel. The lake is about five miles long and two wide, and is surrounded by wooded hills.\n\n---\n\n**Moraines.**\n\nThe moraines are formed by the deposition of glacial materials, consisting of sand, gravel, and boulders, which are not easily transported by wind or water. They are usually found in areas where the glacial ice has been eroded away, leaving behind a deposit of these materials. Moraines are often found in valleys and along the borders of lakes, with the largest ones being found in the areas where the ice has been thickest. They are often used as sources of building materials and as a source of water for irrigation.\n\n---\n\n**Region without agricultural value.**\n\nThe region without agricultural value is characterized by a lack of suitable soil for farming. The soil is generally sandy or gravelly, and is not well suited for growing crops. The region is also characterized by a lack of water, making it difficult to grow crops that require a lot of water. The region is also characterized by a lack of trees, making it difficult to provide shade and shelter for livestock.\n\n---\n\n**Forest fires.**\n\nForest fires are a natural occurrence in forested areas, and can be caused by lightning strikes, human activity, or natural causes such as drought. Forest fires can be devastating, causing loss of life, property, and wildlife. They can also cause long-term damage to the forest ecosystem, including the loss of habitat for many species of animals.\nimportant of which occurred about ten years ago\u2014fur-bearing animals, with the exception of the bear, have been scarce. A frost was experienced on Iroquois Creek on the night of July 13th, my thermometer going down to 27\u00b0. No frost occurred however at Fort McLeod nine miles off and between four and five hundred feet lower.\n\nThe Douglas fir finds its eastern limit in this region near McLeod's Vegetation Lake, and is not found on the lower part of the Parsnip. *Abies subalpina* is abundant in cold swampy spots on the route between Stuart and McLeod's Lakes. *Pachystima Myrinites*, common on the Skeena, reappears in abundance in the vicinity of McLeod's Lake. On the dry land near Iroquois Creek the berries of *Shepherdia Canadensis* were beginning to reddish and *Epilobium angustifolium* to flower on July 12th.\n\n**McLeod's Lake and Misinchinca River.**\n\nMcLeod's Lake is according to Mr. Selwyn sixteen or seventeen miles long, with an average breadth of about two miles. Its elevation by comparative readings is nearly that of Stuart Lake, or taking that of Stuart Lake at 2200, it may be stated as 2250. It lies in a north-north-west by south-south-east bearing, and may be regarded as marking at this place the line of junction of the interior plateau of the western part of British Columbia, with the western foot hills of the Rocky Mountain Range. From the higher undulating country to the west, a wide view embracing numerous rounded ridges to the eastward is obtained, and in the distance to the south-eastward mountains were seen bearing some snow in July. The immediate shores of the lake are bordered by low hills and ridges almost everywhere densely wooded.\n\nThe latitude of the Hudson Bay post, situated near the outlet of the lake at its northern extremity, was determined by Mr. Webster, who accompanied Mr. Selwyn in 1875, as 55\u00b0 0' 7\". An observation by myself on the 15th of July last makes the latitude 55\u00b0 0' 2\". In the garden at Fort McLeod we found at the date of our visit some ordinary vegetables growing well. The potatoes had been cut down by frost in June, but had recovered completely. The soil about the fort is, however, poor and little attention is paid to cultivation. D. W. Harmon, who resided in the northern part of British Columbia, or 'New Caledonia,' at some time\u2014trading I believe for the North-West Company\u2014in his 'Voyages and Travels' published at Andover, Mass., 1820, states that snow generally falls about Fort St. James and Fort McLeod about the 15th of November and is all gone about the 15th of May. The snowfall is said to be greater about McLeod's Lake than about Stuart Lake, reaching sometimes a depth of five feet, a fact confirmed\nby those now acquainted with the region. At Fort St. James the snow reaches a depth of about three feet.\n\nThe river issuing from McLeod's Lake, known as the Pack River, is from 150 to 200 feet wide, and had an average depth of about two feet in July last. It does not appear to be subject to heavy floods and carries clear brownish water derived from swamps and springs. It flows northward about fifteen miles to its junction with the Parsnip River, which joins it from the south-east. The tongue of land lying between the two rivers is mountainous opposite the end of McLeod's Lake, rising to a height of from 1500 to 2000 feet above the water. At about seven miles north of Fort McLeod these mountains end, and a plateau or terrace-flat with an average elevation of about 130 feet stretches from the expansion of the Pack River known as Lac la Truite or Tutia Lake across to the Parsnip near the mouth of the Misinchinca. The summit on this line is, according to Mr. J. Hunter, 250 feet above Lac la Truite. This flat country is sandy and gravelly and not well adapted to agriculture. It falls northward toward the junction of the two rivers in a succession of benches of which some of the lower may be more fertile. The terrace-flat comes out on the bank of the Parsnip with its full height, and is found in scarped banks to be formed of gravel chiefly composed of quartzite fragments and covered over with fine yellow sandy soil. Evidence of increasing rainfall is found in the country to the east, as compared with that to the west of McLeod's Lake. The sandy and gravelly flats above referred to are characteristically clothed with the western scrub pine (Pinus contorta) but on the slopes and in valleys this tree is mingled with spruce (Picea Engelmanni and Abies subalpina), aspen and birch; while the devil's club (Echinopanax horrida) again begins to abound.\n\nThe Parsnip River at the mouth of the Misinchinca is, according to comparative barometer readings, 2170 feet above the sea. It has a width of 500 feet, and at the date of our visit (July 19) was full from bank to bank. The current is rapid, averaging probably three or four miles an hour, the waters being brownish and muddy and evidently in great part derived from melting snow. Above this place the Parsnip has not been explored since the date of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's visit, in June, 1793. He ascended the stream to its sources and portaged his canoe across to a small river running toward the Fraser. From his account it would appear that there are very high mountains about its head and probably true glaciers. This seems to be confirmed by the small possible drainage area of the river compared to the volume of water it carries. In the autumn, I was informed, the Parsnip is much reduced in size and meanders between wide gravel bars.\nThe crossing of the Parsnip was accomplished on July 19th, the animals swimming the river without accident, while the aparejos and packs were ferried across in a boat which had been obtained from the Hudson Bay Company at Fort McLeod. The gentlemen connected with the railway survey then began their descent of the Parsnip and Peace Rivers, in the boat just mentioned, while I set out next morning by land for our rendezvous at Dunvegan, which proved to be at a distance of two hundred miles, and was not reached till the 16th of August. Mr. Joseph Hunter had in 1877 made a reconnoissance of the Pine River Pass for railway purposes, a short account of which is published in the Canadian Pacific Railway Report of 1878. Having penetrated eastward to about longitude 120\u00b0 30', the season being far advanced and the country very difficult, he turned back by the way he had come. He had with him a small pack-train lightly loaded and did no more chopping than was absolutely necessary, travelling for many miles in the bed of the river. His trail was of some little service, but having now such a large number of animals, comprising Messrs. Cambie & McLeod's supply trains as well as my own, we were obliged to do much work in chopping, brushing swamps, and bridging streams along all parts of the route.\n\nThe country on the east bank of the Parsnip is all densely wooded or covered with windfall or brul\u00e9. The surface rises gradually, or in a succession of low steps for a distance of six to eight miles, when mountains 1500 to 2000 feet in height above the river appear. Following the south bank of the Misinchinca we passed over sandy and gravelly benches which are generally less than 100 feet above the stream and are covered with western scrub pine of small size. The undergrowth includes a small blue-berry a Houstonia and frequent patches of grey or white moss. Though the extent of flat land about the mouth of the Misinchinca and bordering this part of the Parsnip is considerable, it is scarcely to be regarded as of any agricultural value. The Misinchinca River is tortuous and not very rapid, with swampy flats covered with black spruce and other moisture-loving plants on the inner sides of its bends, while the opposite bank is usually formed by the scarped edge of a gravelly terrace, of which the stones are glossy schists and quartzites.\n\nAt ten or twelve miles up the Misinchinca the terraces above described come to an end, and the mountains which now bound the valley continuously, slope down on each side of the river-flat. The flats have generally a width of about a mile and the river flows through them with a very crooked course. The luxuriant growth of devil's club, ferns, moss and lycopodium indicate a humid climate. Willows and tall dark groves of spruce immediately border the river.\nFollowing Mr. Hunter's example, we crossed the Misinchinca about eighteen miles from its mouth in latitude $55^\\circ 14' 39''$, as the river here touches the hills on the left of the valley, and the slopes being rugged and thickly tree-clad present great difficulty to travel with loaded mules.\n\nEight miles above the crossing, the Atunatche stream joins the Misinchinca, which is here found coming from the south-eastward, while a massive range of limestone mountains, attaining elevations of from 5000 to 6000 feet above the sea, appear to block further passage to the north-eastward. From the crossing to the mouth of the Atunatche the Misinchinca valley continues as a flat-bottomed trough never less than eight-tenths of a mile in width. The river is very crooked and though much obstructed with drift-wood is not very rapid till within about two miles of the Atunatche. It then changes its character, flowing swiftly over coarse gravel and boulders and spreading widely in seasons of flood through 'sloughs' and alternative channels by which the valley bottom is cut up. Most of the land in the bottom of the valley is elevated only a few feet above the river and some of it is evidently liable to overflow. The mountains at the sides of the valley rise boldly to heights of 2500 or 3000 feet above it in some instances, and are densely tree-clad with the exception of the highest points. Large trees of black spruce and cottonwood occur in some places, several of the latter being observed to attain five feet in diameter. The vegetation continues to assume a more alpine character, the undergrowth including *Veratrum album*, *Lonicera involucrata*, devil's club, alder, elder and various ferns.\n\nThe elevation of the mouth of the Atunatche is 2500 feet.\n\n**THE PINE PASS AND PINE RIVER.**\n\nThe valley which is occupied by the lower part of the Misinchinca may be said to come to an end at the mouth of the Atunatche, inoculating with a second which runs in a north-north-west by south-south-east course parallel to the main direction of flexure and elevation in this part of the Rocky Mountains. It marks in a general way the junction of the schistose and slaty beds so far met with, with the massive limestones of the axis of the mountains which appear to underlie them. To the south-south-eastward this valley is occupied by the main stream of the Misinchinca, and was followed up for twenty-six miles by Mr. Hunter, who found it to end finally among high limestone mountains. In the opposite direction this depression becomes the Atunatche valley and further on that of the upper part of the Pine River, which after flowing north-north-westward for eleven miles, turns abruptly to the eastward and finds its way to the Peace River below Fort St. John.\nThe Misinatche River flows in a northerly direction from the Atunatche River, which flows in a north-north-western direction of the Limestone Mountains. It is a small river and slaty in color. The axis of the river flows in the southern direction, downstream of the summit lake. Mr. Hunter, who visited these regions. In the valley and its tributaries after flowing into the river, the east-west direction of the John. In\ntravelling northward across the summit one has the high axial limestone mountains already referred to on the right hand with lower and more rounded mountains to the left. The limestone mountains form a regular wall-like range, the higher summits of which probably reach 6000 feet and still held considerable patches of snow in shady hollows, near the end of July.\n\nFrom the mouth of the Atunatche to the lower end of Azouzetta or Summit Lake, a distance of three and three-quarter miles, the valley probably averages half a mile in width of flat ground or gentle slopes, with the exception of about half a mile near the mouth of the Atunatche where it becomes somewhat contracted, with steeply sloping side-hills. Mr. Hunter states the rise of the valley in this distance to be 270 feet while by my barometer on July 27th it appeared to be about 350, and this I believe to be nearly correct.\n\nAzouzetta Lake is about a mile and a third in length and probably three-quarters of a mile wide in some places. It is evidently shallow and holds one or two little wooded islets. Its south end is bounded by a low grassy flat. The lake drains into the Atunatche, but about three-fourths of a mile beyond its north-western or upper end a stream forming the source of Pine River is found entering the valley from the mountains on its south-west side. This on the 28th of July was estimated to average twenty-five feet in width by six inches deep, with a rapid current. The space between the elbow which this stream makes in turning from its first course into that of the valley, and the head of Azouzetta Lake, is occupied by a series of swamps and beaver ponds with groves of thick and tangled spruce. This forms the actual watershed which is so low and undefined that it is probable water may run in both directions when the country is wet. In the detritus carried into the trough-like valley by the source of Pine River and other little streams, the cause of the actual position of the watershed is probably to be found.\n\nThe latitude of our camp at the summit, opposite the bend of the stream forming the source of Pine River, above referred to, was $55^\\circ 24' 17''$ by observation.\n\nBefore leaving Stuart Lake we had arranged with Mr. Alexander, in charge of the Hudson Bay post there, to keep a record of the state of the barometer, for the purpose of comparison with observations to be taken on our way eastward. The readings kept by Mr. Alexander do not, however, show a very close correspondence with fluctuations observed by us, and were generally taken at intervals of some hours from our observations. By comparison with Mr. Alexander's readings, the height of the summit of Pine Pass is 2795 feet. I have subsequently obtained from Mr. Horetzky a copy of his barometer observa-\ntions on Babine Lake, and by comparison with these, believe the true height of the pass to be 2850 feet, very nearly.\n\nFrom the upper end of Azouzetta or Summit Lake, the valley runs north-westward about eleven miles, then northward for two and a half miles, and next turning nearly due east, continues in that direction for about nine miles. In thus following the Pine River from its source for a distance of over twenty miles, the actual distance gained from Azouzetta Lake and the summit, in a northerly direction, is about seven and a half miles only. The mountains included in this loop may be regarded as a part of the axis of the range, but decline in elevation north-westward from the vicinity of the summit to the bend of the river.\n\nTwo miles from the head of Azouzetta Lake, a sudden drop in the level of the bottom of the valley occurs, being that which Mr. Hunter refers to in his report as \"the precipice.\" This is produced by the outcropping edge of a bed of limestone which here runs across the valley. The abrupt portion, which may be called a cliff, though never forming a sheer precipice, and generally more or less densely covered with trees, moss and bushes, with piles of fallen rock here and there, has a height of 130 feet above the flat bottom of the valley below it. The brook forming the source of Pine River follows the left or southwest side of the valley, descending through a little rocky gorge. The total descent from the summit of the pass to the flat at the base of the precipice, is about 158 feet, and this occurs in a distance of about a mile and a quarter.\n\nFrom the precipice a fine view down the valley is obtained. To the right are limestone peaks probably rising 3000 feet above the stream, while on the left the mountains are much lower and more rounded. The slopes on both sides are gentle towards the bottom of the valley, and the hill sides do not appear to be much broken up by ravines or gullies, and little rock is seen except at a considerable height on the slopes. The bottom of the valley appears narrow, but on travelling down it, it is found to be straight, with either flats or very light slopes continuously bordering the stream. Its average width is probably about a quarter of a mile. The total fall of the stream in a distance of about five and a half miles from the summit, including that part of the valley in which the precipice occurs, is about 207 feet. The valley is densely wooded, and occasional groves show large and fine trees. Aconitum Napellus was observed to be abundant and in full flower.\n\nAt the end of the north-western reach of the valley it has an average width of about half a mile, which it maintains with considerable uniformity for a distance of about eleven miles, or to the end of its eastern reach above referred to, where, opposite Canoe Mountain, it becomes\nThe true\n\nThe valley runs\nhalf\ndirection\nsource\nfrom\nabout\nloop may\nelevation\nend of the\n\nin the\nHunter\nby the\nacross the\nnever\ncovered\nthere,\nbelow it.\n\nor south-\nedge.

The most important factor in slowing down the water is the base of the soil. This is composed of a layer of fine, curving roots. These roots hold the soil together, minimizing erosion by about twenty-five feet. They also non-conductively cool the soil.\n\nIn conclusion, the soil and climate are essential factors in this experiment.\n\nAt the present time, the point of maximum fertility is only slightly less than the point of minimum fertility. At this point, the soil is able to conduct heat and water. However, the southern part of the rocks is not yet fully developed and the northern part is still in the process of development. It will be advantageous to continue the experiment until all parts of the rocks have been developed.\n\nFor example, the direction of the wind affects the evaporation of water.\nsomewhat contracted, though probably in no place less than a quarter of a mile wide in the bottom. The valley is generally flat-bottomed, most of the flats being elevated but a few feet above the river. The slopes at the base of the hills are also as a rule light, and on the right bank no rocky bluffs project to the river. The river pursues a tortuous course, running over beds of flat pebbles of clean, silvery schist, with a current uniformly swift, but without any waterfalls or heavy rapids.\n\nThree tributary brooks were observed to join the main stream from the south-west and west, between the summit and a point about thirteen miles down the valley. At fifteen miles from the summit, a tributary about half the size of the main stream, and estimated to average forty feet wide by six inches deep, enters from a wide valley which runs north-westward, and may be considered as forming the continuation of the main valley previously defined.\n\nBelow Canoe Mountain the river turns to a north-eastward course, and the older rocks characterizing the country from Fort McLeod to this place are replaced by Cretaceous sandstones.\n\nAgriculturally, the country passed over from Fort McLeod to this point is of very little value, for though there are limited areas susceptible of cultivation, they are quite insignificant as compared with the fertile regions to the eastward, and have probably an inferior climate.\n\nThe valley of the Misinchinca appears to be well adapted for railway construction as far as the mouth of the Atunatchi. Assuming the rise from this point to the summit to be 400 feet (which is probably a maximum,) the distance between the two points being about five miles only, it would probably be necessary to gain grade on the hillside forming the north bank of the Misinchinca. The hillside appears to be not unfavorable to this for a distance of about three miles below the Atunatchi, which would give a total distance of eight miles in which to overcome the ascent. The work would probably be moderately heavy throughout. In crossing the summit, a line should follow the south-west side of the valley, as the slopes there are light and not rocky. On the opposite side of the valley, the mountains being higher and for the most part bare, several \"fans\" of d\u00e9bris occur, and there are also evidences of small snow-slides in winter. The descent from the precipice on the opposite side of the summit would also require to be accomplished on the south-west side of the valley, where the slopes are moderately light and regular. The bottom of the valley once gained, no further difficulty would be encountered, with the exception of probable crossings of the stream to avoid curvature.\n\nFor about sixteen miles from Canoe Mountain the valley takes a direct north-eastward course, and at this distance may be said to leave the eastern foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains and to enter the plateau.\ncountry. Near Canoe Mountain several summits rise to heights of 2000 to 3000 feet above the valley, but the mountains gradually decrease in elevation from that point, and at the edge of the foot-hills seldom reach a height of much more than 1000 feet. The rocks are chiefly sandstones, and from a much disturbed condition gradually become less and less sharply folded, till at the point above indicated as the edge of the foot-hills, they are horizontal or very nearly so. The width of the flat bottom of the valley averages half a mile till near the edge of the foot-hills, when it expands to about a mile. Gravelly benches forty to fifty feet high are occasionally seen, and considerable areas of the bottom of the valley are cultivable, though the hills at the sides are almost without soil, and show, even at a distance, the flexures of the sandstone rocks composing them. The climate changes in this part of the course of the river from the extreme humidity characteristic of the mountains, becoming much drier and warmer. In consequence of this, most of the river flats have been burnt over, and some are almost completely cleared by fire. Raspberries were abundant and ripe in such places on the 1st of August. The river appears when in flood to rise about five feet above its summer level in the upper part of this reach. Near the border of the foot-hills the floods rise about eight feet above the summer level, while the river at the time of our visit averaged about one hundred and seventy-five feet wide.\n\nThe valley next runs a few degrees south of east for about seven miles, and then resumes its north-eastward course for sixteen miles. The average width of the valley is fully a mile in this part of its course, and in some places it may reach two miles. The plateau level is about 1000 feet above the valley bottom and generally presents serried ranks of dry whitened trees through which fire has passed once. In the first eight miles of this part of the valley terraces constitute a particularly prominent feature, rising generally about 100 feet above the river, and being composed of gravel, fine sand or silt. A railway line would probably require to cross the river two or three times in this part of its course, as more or less degraded terraces occupy some of the bends which it makes in the valley. Horizontal beds of sandstone outcrop frequently in the hillsides. A large portion of the bottom of the valley has been cleared by fire and is very fertile with a natural growth of pea-vine and grass as high as a horse's back. The northern bank of the valley is generally open and grassy and the dry character of the climate is evidenced by the occurrence of sage (Artemisia frigida) and Eleocharis erythropoda. Choke cherries, and the small wild red cherry were noticed here for the first time, and the service berries were found to be ripe on the 3rd of August.\nOne considerable tributary joins the Pine River in this part of its course. It comes from the south-westward and must drain the country between the main stream of Pine River which we have followed down and the Sukunka or Middle Branch. It has projected a large 'fan' into the valley at its entrance, forcing the river over to the north side.\n\nFrom the point to which the description of Pine River valley has now been carried, the stream turns abruptly, and running south-south-eastward for four miles joins the Sukunka. A wide trough-like valley, forming the continuation of that which Pine River has so far followed, runs on in a north-eastward direction and may be followed across to the Pine River below the Lower Forks. Near Pine River, it is about two miles in width and it becomes wider and more diffuse, the hills at the sides decreasing in height, and the bottom sloping up gradually. At the river it is flooded by benches from 100 to 200 feet high, and from it flows a small tortuous stream.\n\nThe part of the river above described as flowing south-south-eastward to join the Sukunka, occupies a valley which seems to be later in origin than that of the upper part of the stream. It is comparatively narrow, averaging probably about a mile between the bases of the steep slopes. Its bottom is chiefly formed by terraces of silt 100 to 200 feet above the river, and is broken by many and deep transverse gullies. The river is somewhat tortuous, and owing to the fact that the scarped fronts of the terraces come out to the bank, it would probably be necessary to cross it two or three times with a railway line. Its width is from 150 to 200 feet. The length involving rather heavy work on this part of the line is about two and a-half miles.\n\nA very fine view up the valley of the Sukunka or Middle Branch may be obtained from the edge of the plateau above the valley at the fork. The valley of the Sukunka is an important one, quite equal in size to that of the main stream above the constricted portion just described, and generally resembling it. The river pursues a devious course bordered by wide flats and occasional gently sloping 'fans' projecting from the sides of the valley, which are sometimes bare but are generally covered with thickets of young aspen and pine which have grown up after fire. The valley runs in a direction a few degrees west of south for about ten miles, when it appears to turn more to the east. Its average width exceeds a mile, and there is thus probably at least ten square miles of fertile land in sight in this part of its length, with grazing grounds on the slopes and hills above which might be greatly improved and extended by burning off the woods completely.\n\nAt a distance of twenty or thirty miles off to the southward some\nmountains were seen, with small patches of snow still (August 5) clinging to them; but no bare and rugged peaks like those forming the axial range of the Rocky Mountains were in sight. A flat with an area of probably 1000 acres occurs at the fork. It is in part sandy and gravelly, but also wide meadows covered with luxuriant herbage forming fine grazing for animals.\n\nThe plateau above the river valley is here partly open but generally covered with young pine and aspen, or with burnt forest not yet replaced by new growth. Much good summer grazing land exists but the surface is probably not adapted to agriculture. The general character of this part of the country is that of a high broken plateau traversed by wide generally trough-like valleys rising to a hilly or even mountainous region toward the main range. The land in the valleys appears generally to be well suited for cultivation, while the slopes and summit of the plateau will constitute good stock ranges.\n\nThe Middle Branch appears to be about equal in volume to the main stream. The latitude of our camp on the flat above referred to was found to be $55^\\circ 37' 23''$, making the approximate latitude of the actual confluence of the river $55^\\circ 36' 23''$. The Pine River at the Forks is 624 feet above the level of the Peace River at Dunvegan or about 1930 feet above the sea.*\n\nFrom this point the river turns again to a north-eastward course nearly parallel with the direction of its upper portion, and in eighteen miles reaches its confluence with the East Branch. For eleven miles the valley is open, though probably averaging less than a mile in width. Terraces extend several hundred feet up the sides of the valley, but are difficult to identify in many cases owing to the outcrop of horizontal beds of sandstone. Extensive slides have also occurred, producing in some places sharp ridges parallel to the sides of the valley. These are all, however, of old date and now show no signs of motion. The valley is also somewhat cut up by 'sloughs' and the terraces occasionally front directly on the river, but there is still a considerable proportion of fertile land. The river now enters a contracted part of its course which has been called the Canon. It is about three miles in length, and for this distance the sandstones and shales form steep slopes or cliffs rising from the water's edge on both sides, generally to a height of about 100 feet above the river. Above this the heavy drift deposits form slopes for several hundred feet higher, reaching eventually the level of the plateau at about 500 feet above the river or 2350 above the sea. The slopes are as a rule steep but generally not so much so\n\n* The height of this point and those assigned to other places between this and Dunvegan, are checked by barometer readings at the latter place by the Rev. D. M. Gordon, and are probably close approximations to the truth. The height of Dunvegan is estimated at 1305 feet.\nas to prevent their being covered with grass. They are very irregular, being broken by ravines and gullies. It would probably be necessary to cross the river several times in the ca\u00f1on with a railway line, and there would be some heavy rock cutting.\n\nBelow the ca\u00f1on the valley again expands, and in four miles reaches the Lower Forks. It is not, however, so wide as that either of the Sukunka or upper part of the main stream, being contracted by terraces at the sides. The high plateau now no longer exists, but the country is based on a heavy covering of drift deposits which spreads widely at a height of about 500 feet above the river, forming a very fertile soil. From high points the view to the northward is sea-like and unlimited, while southward the broken hilly plateau before described begins to rise irregularly. The plateau has at one time been heavily wooded, but has now in most places been traversed by successive fires, which have not only destroyed the forest but consumed the greater part of the fallen logs, producing prairie country with patches of young aspen in the vicinity of the river valleys. The lower terraces on this part of Pine River, and about the Lower Forks produce a wonderfully luxuriant growth of pea-vine and grass, and plants common on prairie land begin to appear.\n\nThe latitude of the confluence of the rivers at the Lower Forks was found to be $55^\\circ 43' 42''$. The East Branch is the larger stream, its volume being in proportion to that of the branch we have followed down about three to two. The water of the East Branch is more heavily charged with silt and has somewhat the appearance of a stream fed by glacier water. Both rivers are rapid and not deep, though it was with some difficulty and not without risk that we forded the East Branch on August 7th.\n\nAt the Lower Forks of Pine River the mountains and high level plateau country has been left behind, and instead of finding fertile land in small and isolated patches the general surface of the country becomes susceptible of cultivation, the barren tracts being exceptional.\n\nTable Mountain ascended by Mr. Selwyn in 1875,* and in 1877 by Mr. Hunter,\u2020 is situated about half way between the Lower and Middle Forks of Pine River and forms one of the outliers of the higher plateau, of which others occur to the southward east of the Sukunka. Its elevation according to Mr. Selwyn is 3400 feet, according to Mr. Hunter 3500 feet.\n\nThe character of the Pine Pass in regard to railway construction appears to be very favourable, but as Messrs. J. Hunter and H. J. railway route.\n\n---\n\n* Report of Progress 1875-76, p. 54.\n\u2020 Canadian Pacific Railway Report 1878, p. 79.\nCambie have both given special attention to this point,* it is not necessary to enter into detail here. An independent estimate by myself gave, however, the following results:\n\nTotal distance by the river valley, which a railway line would have to follow, from the Parsnip at the mouth of the Misinchinca to the Lower Forks of Pine River, 108\u00bd miles.\n\nDistance on a straight line bearing N. 50\u00b05' E., 81 miles.\n\nOf the distance by the valley 93 miles may be classed as easy work, 2\u00bd miles as moderately heavy work, and 13 miles as heavy work.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Range where crossed by the Pine Pass may be said to be nearly forty miles wide, but this includes a considerable width of foothills on each side, the high and rugged summits forming a comparatively narrow zone, and apparently not rising above 6000 feet in height. In following the chain southward and eastward to the 49th parallel, the passes generally increase in height and the mountains reach a greater altitude and show grander and more rugged outlines. Near the 49th parallel, again, the eastern side of the mountains is abrupt and well marked, while in the region now described the mountains fall gradually to hills, which are reduced eventually, and without any well marked line, to the level of the plateau. A comparison of the geological features of the mountains on the Pine and Peace Rivers with that of those to the south-eastward, is made on a subsequent page. To the north of the Peace River, we as yet know hardly anything of the range.\n\nCountry generally wooded.\n\nFrom Fort McLeod to the Lower Forks the country may be described as a whole, as densely wooded, the only exceptions being the summits of mountains too high or too rugged to bear forest, or such places as have been cleared by fires.\n\nVegetation and climate.\n\nFrom the mouth of the Misinchinca to a point on Pine River about seven miles north-eastward from the highest point of the range, there is evidence in the vegetation and otherwise of a humid climate, and forest fires have been few and have not affected great areas. The valleys are here filled with dense dark groves of spruce in which the trees often obtain a great size, while the hillsides are also clad with coniferous forest, becoming more and more stunted toward the summits. From the point above mentioned eastward, fires have been frequent, and along the south bank and on the flats of the river valley grassy meadows begin to appear. Ten miles above the Middle Fork Artemisia frigida and Eleocharis erythropoda, with the wild red cherry and chokecherry were for the first time observed. Service-berries (Amalanchier) were here found ripe on the 3rd of August. Before reaching the Lower Forks\n\n* Canadian Pacific Railway Reports 1878, p. 72; 1880, p. 52.\nForks, sunny slopes showed such flowers as *Monarda fistulosa*, *Campanula rotundifolia* and *Anemone patens* which are found very generally distributed over the prairies of the North-west. Raspberries were found ripe in the upper part of Pine River, and the berries of the viburnum turning red on the 31st of July.\n\nOwing to the densely wooded character of the country and the number of swamps, streams and other impediments to the passage of the animals, it was not without putting forth every effort that we were able to make an average actual advance of about five and a half miles a day from the Parsnip to the Lower Forks. On Pine River we found it advisable to follow Mr. Hunter's example and travel for the most part in the river bed, crossing and recrossing to keep shallow water and firm bottom. During this part of the journey several of us were constantly employed in advance on horseback searching for fords and marking them with bushes, or cutting trail across wooded points which it was impossible to go round in the river. The country was evidently comparatively dry at the time we passed, and in the spring it would be quite impossible to bring a loaded pack train through by this route without expending a great amount of labour in trail-making.\n\nGame must be very abundant in some parts of the mountains, particularly the moose, bear end beaver. We found many of the bars and mud banks along the rivers from which the water had not long receded quite covered with the tracks of these animals. The Siccanie Indians of the vicinity of Fort McLeod travel eastward up the Misinchinca, but apparently visit it very seldom, as there is no well-marked Indian trail. Near the Summit Lake we found traces of an Indian camp a few years old, and we were informed that a trail of some sort leads to this place from the Parsnip west of the Misinchinca valley. From the east the Beaver Indians hunt westward toward the sources of the Pine River, but owing to the difficulty of travel caused by the burnt forest and windfall, have nearly abandoned the head waters of the streams. We found, however, a small cottonwood canoe cached on the Pine River opposite the summit which I have named Canoe Mountain, and not far from the eastern base of the axial range of the mountains. From the appearance of branches which had been thrown into the canoe it must have been left here in the preceding May, when the river was probably very high. On this part of the river there is evidence of the rise of the water in floods to a height of five feet above its low water level. Half way from the summit to the Middle Forks an extreme rise of eight feet is indicated.\n\nIn regard to climate, the route from Fort McLeod to the Middle Forks of Pine River, seventy-two miles distant, may be treated together.\nas representing the Rocky Mountain zone, including the foot hills of both slopes and the higher plateau attaching to these on the north-eastward. From July 17th to August 5th, the mean of the observed minima on this part of the route is 39\u00b0-7\u00b0. The mean of the early morning and evening readings of the thermometer, 49\u00b0-4\u00b0. This must be much below the actual mean temperature, for the thermometer had seldom risen much above its minimum when observed at 6 a.m. The heat was sometimes great in the middle of the day, but as we were then always travelling, could not be registered. Three frosts were experienced, on the nights of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of August, the thermometer reading 30\u00b0-5\u00b0, 28\u00b0 and 30\u00b0-5\u00b0 on these nights respectively. Strong westerly winds, falling calm at sundown, with a clear sky, were the conditions causing the frosts.\n\nLower Forks of Pine River to Dunvegan.\n\nThe portion of the Peace River basin for which the exploration of 1879 enables pretty accurate general information to be given, may be considered as extending eastward from the Middle Forks of Pine River. West of this point, as already stated, the areas of fertile land are small, being confined to certain river valleys which penetrate the foot hills of the Rocky Mountains, and the high plateau attached to them. With this western limit, the region now to be described may be defined as bounded to the north by the 57th parallel to its intersection eastward with the Peace River. Thence the boundary may be assumed to follow the Peace River southward to the mouth of Heart Brook, near the confluence of the Smoky River. Thence to run southeastward to the extremity of Lesser Slave Lake, to follow the western border of the hilly region lying to the south of the lake to the Athabasca River; thence to follow the Athabasca westward to the foot hills, and skirting the foot hills to run north-westward to the first mentioned point on Pine River.\n\nThe tract included within the limits above given has an area of about 31,550 square miles, and by far the largest part of this area may be classed as fertile. In treating of this region a description of the routes followed will first be given, embracing such details as are likely to be of value. This will then be succeeded by such general deductions as to physical geography and climate of the district as our knowledge will allow. The region as above defined being somewhat homogeneous it is possible to arrive at the general facts in regard to it with some degree of certainty.\n\nIt had been arranged that Mr. MacLeod, in event of his arriving in time at Dunvegan, should carry his exploration for railway purposes\nwestward to the Pine River Forks, and leave there a note stating his whereabouts and telling me what he wished done with his contingent of the pack train. On arriving at the Forks on August 7th no such note could be found, and the flats along the river side though covered with a luxuriant growth of wild pea and vetch, showed no tracks of men or horses, though here and there trodden down in devious paths made by the bears in feeding. We fired a number of shots in the calm of the evening to bring in any Indians who might be in the vicinity, but without success, and so the next morning, after having put up a notice of our visit, we set out for Dunvegan. The neighbourhood of the Forks presents many features of geological interest, but the season was already so far advanced and the time to be occupied on the way eastward so uncertain, that I did not feel warranted in delaying there a day.\n\nWe followed for a few miles the north bank of the East Branch of Coal Brook. Pine River\u2014travelling along open or lightly wooded flats, and then turned northward up the valley of a small tributary called by Mr. Hunter, Coal Brook.* The stream at this date was about thirty feet wide by six inches deep, with a slope of about one in one hundred. In flood it must be from seventy to a hundred feet wide. For about five miles the valley is narrow and gorge like, and very tortuous, with banks of sliding Cretaceous shales and sandstones forming scarped hillsides 200 to 300 feet high where the brook impinges upon them. At the distance from its mouth above indicated, the valley widens to about a quarter of a mile, with flats bordering the stream on the right and left sides alternately. The sides of the valley still continue steep, though decreasing in height. We travelled chiefly in the bed of the brook, or along the low flats bordering it, and camped in the evening at about fourteen miles from the Forks, at an elevation of 2150 feet or 300 feet above the Forks.\n\nFrom this camp to the next\u2014a distance of about thirteen miles\u2014we travelled in the first instance up the bed of the stream, as before. The banks becoming gradually lower, and showing gravelly and bouldery drift deposits with occasionally a few feet of the underlying Cretaceous shales. We then found, not without some difficulty, the point at which Mr. Hunter had left the brook, and by keeping three or four of our Indians constantly ahead looking for signs were able to follow his old marks to the summit between Coal and Buffalo Creeks. Our camp at this point was at an elevation of 3300 feet and the country somewhat hilly, being in fact a broad ridge very much higher than most of the region. The woods are composed of black spruce, scrub pine,\n\n* This must not be confounded with 'Coal Creek', of Mr. Selwyn's report, which is a small gorge on the south of Pine River Canon.\nbirch, aspen, cottonwood and alder, in most places dense, but where fires have passed grass is found growing luxuriantly. The soil is good being a pale silt.\n\nAugust 10th.\u2014Leave camp early and travel till 4 p.m., passing at first for some miles through heavily wooded country, but on coming down to the sources of Buffalo Creek find a more open region, with considerable areas of scattered aspen groves and grassy flats, which continue to become more extensive as we descend the stream. The valley when first seen is small with gently sloping sides, but continues widening, till at our evening camp it is nearly a mile in width. The plateau at the sides at the same time becomes lower, and the rounded hills which rose above the level of the upper terrace or plateau on the upper part of the stream disappear. The soil is everywhere fertile and susceptible of cultivation, and earthy drift or loam twenty to thirty feet deep is exposed in banks near our evening camp, which is situated a few miles above the junction of Buffalo Creek and Mud River. Found some recent horse tracks and signs that the valley has been visited by Indians within a few weeks. Near this point Mr. Hunter,* in 1877, turned back after getting into a tangled and swampy country on the east side of the Mud River. Determined to keep a few miles further north to avoid this known bad country and then set out on a compass course for Dunvegan.\n\nAugust 11th.\u2014Travelled about ten miles eastward, keeping on later than we otherwise would have done on account of the difficulty of finding water. Two miles from morning camp cross Mud River, now averaging 120 feet wide, with a moderate current and muddy banks. It is depressed fifty feet below the level of the wide valley which it follows to the northward. To the north-eastward the country is evidently a nearly level plateau which appears however to fall gradually to the north. To the south are low hills which seem to rise about 300 feet above the plateau. The valley of Mud River is in great part open, well grassed and with very fertile soil. As it appeared to turn too much to the northward and westward, we ascended its east side to the level of the plateau. This has been originally more or less heavily timbered with black spruce, scrub pine, cottonwood and aspen often of fine growth. Fires have, however, swept over considerable districts which are now covered with second-growth aspen or fallen timber. Our camp, which is at about the average level of this part of the plateau, is at an elevation of 2600 feet. The latitude, determined by a meridian altitude of Altair $55^\\circ 46' 54''$.\n\nAugust 12th.\u2014Cut our way with much labour for some miles through heavy windfall among which young aspen groves are struggling up, but get before long into standing woods and eventually into\nopen groves through which we travel along easily, till catching a glimpse of a still more open country to the northward we turn in that direction and emerge on a valley with gently sloping sides, one to two miles wide and chiefly prairie with coppice of willow and alder bushes here and there. This is the first prairie country we have seen and contrasts very pleasantly with the dense forests through which for the most part we have heretofore been groping our way. The grass is in some places as high as the horses' bellies and is already ripe and turning brown at the tops. The hillsides are gay with summer flowers such as Castilleia, Aster, and Solidago. After travelling a few miles through this park-like country we caught sight of a couple of Indians, who immediately plunged into a thicket, evidently much alarmed, and were next seen on the top of a hill about half a mile off running away as fast as they could. The invasion of this quiet region by a party so large and so unfamiliar in style of equipment, is doubtless enough to disturb the equanimity of a timid Beaver Indian, who has perhaps never even seen mules before. Camped on the bank of a small river which flows northward in a valley about 200 feet deep, traced in the bottom of a much wider hollow.\n\nThis stream we found afterwards is known where it reaches the Peace River as the D'Echafaud, the country about it being called the Ponce Coup\u00e9e Prairie. The valleys here are not mere troughs cut in the plateau, but wide depressions with gentle slopes, and at times a trough-like course in the bottom. The plateau itself is usually a widely extended terrace level. The soil in the valleys is very deep and rich, while that of the plateau is similar but not so deep, and rests on a silty deposit, which when it comes to the surface gives the soil a pale aspect. Even the silt, however, is a rich soil as evidenced by the luxuriant growth found upon it. Service berries were abundant but over-ripe in sunny spots at the date above given. Choke cherries beginning to ripen.\n\nTwo of the men who had pursued the runaway Indians to their camp, returned shortly after we had camped, and were followed by a number of men, women and children curious and hungry. These were the first people we had seen besides our own party since leaving the Parsnip River twenty-four days previously. They are Beavers, a tribe of the Tinneh stock, but differing considerably in language from their relatives on the west side of the mountains. An Indian from Stuart Lake whom we had with us was able to understand their language imperfectly, while it was almost unintelligible to a lad from the vicinity of the Skeena Forks. The Carriers near Skeena Forks approximate in their coarse features and broad faces to the Indians of the coast. This resemblance becomes less marked about Stuart and Fraser Lakes, while\nthe Beavers are slight in build, much less broad-faced and coarse-\nfeatured and with pleasant expression. They are evidently lithe and\nactive but comparatively weak, and show a considerable resemblance\nto the woodland Crees in appearance.\n\nThe D'Echafaud at camp was found to be 728 feet above Dunvegan\nor 2030 feet above the sea level.\n\nPlateau east of\nD'Echafaud.\n\nAugust 13th.\u2014On leaving camp travelled northward along the river\nbank to find a trail which we had learned from the Indians would lead us\nto Dunvegan. Having found the trail, we crossed the river and turned\neastward over the plateau, with a general elevation of 2380 feet, for a\ndistance of fourteen miles. Small open meadows and prairies, aspen\ngroves and thickets, willow coppice and tall well-grown woods of\nspruce and aspen alternate. Met with occasional swampy spots and\nsome fallen timber, impeding progress, but almost the whole region is\nsusceptible of cultivation. The trail we had attempted to follow is a\nvery indistinct one and evidently not much used. We were frequently\nquite at a loss to trace it, and eventually missed it altogether in an\nextensive burnt patch. Camped at 5 p.m. at a little brown sluggish\nstream surrounded by wide swampy meadows and blocked with many\nold beaver-dams. Altitude of camp 2310 feet above sea level. Latitude\nby meridian altitude of \u03b8 Aquila 55\u00b0 53' 34\".\n\n\nObtain a guide.\n\nAugust 14th.\u2014Having now made by account sufficient easting to\nreach the longitude of Edmonton, had determined to turn northward\nin search of that place, but two Indian lads who came into camp and\nspent the night with us, insisted, as far as we could understand them,\nthat the place was still further east. Having induced one of them to act\nas guide, set out again in an easterly direction. The guide proved to be\nvery useful, as there were many indistinct Indian trails and hunting\ntracks running in all directions. Camped at 5 p.m. beside a small\nstream in a thick wood, but with good grass on the slopes for the\nanimals. Height of camp above sea level 2280 feet. Latitude by\nmeridian altitude of Altair 55\u00b0 49' 54\".\n\n\nCharacter of\nthe Plateau.\n\nThe country passed over resembles that previously described, the sur-\nface being nearly uniform, and the highest point attained between the\nsources of several small streams having a height of 2670 feet. The region\nis generally thickly wooded when not burnt over, the trees being\nchiefly aspen and scrub pine where dry, spruce where damp. From\nhalf to three-fourths of the region is well adapted for cultivation, with\na rich soil.\n\nMeet Mr.\nMacLeod.\n\nAugust 15th.\u2014Travelled eastward thirteen miles through country\nsimilar to that just described, but chiefly wooded with poplar. About\n1 p.m. unexpectedly met Mr. MacLeod with a few men and horses on\nhis way westward. Camped, and discussed arrangements for remaining explorations.\n\nAugust 16th.\u2014Having now reached a well-beaten trail, made a journey of twenty-one miles and camped on the south bank of Peace River opposite the Hudson Bay post of Dunvegan. Four miles from morning camp crossed the Rat River, a small stream thirty feet by two to three feet when in flood, but flowing northward in a valley 240 feet deep, with scarped banks. The plateau at the bank of the valley has a height of 2250 feet above the sea. Passed through open poplar woods for a few miles after leaving camp till the whole country became open and prairie-like, with poplar and willow coppice in the hollows; the surface gently rolling or undulating and covered with luxuriant grass and wild pea, and gay with Asters, Erigerons and Solidagos. From little hills an extensive view of similar prairie country opens to the south-eastward, while to the southward it is bounded at a distance of about twelve miles by the edge of a low wooded ridge or plateau. No mountains or high hills can be seen on any bearing. About ten miles from the edge of the Peace valley the trail enters a belt of poplar woodland with small open meadows. The woods gradually become thicker as we approach the river, being protected from the sweep of fires by the numerous steep-sided ravines and gullies which ramify from the main depression. Emerging at length upon a beautiful rounded grassy promontory, the great Unjigah or Peace River is discovered flowing in a broad tranquil stream in a valley two to three miles wide and eight hundred feet deep.\n\nThe river and its valley, as far down as the mouth of Smoky River, have already been fully described by Mr. Selwyn in the Report of Progress for 1875-76, and need not here be further specially referred to.\n\nBoth Beaver and Cree Indians are now found on this part of the Peace River, though the country really belongs to the former. The extent of the Beaver territory is as follows:\u2014Northward to the Battle River, eastward to the Smoky and Simonette Rivers, southward to Grand Coup Plat, a tributary of the Smoky, westward to the Portage of the Mountain of Rocks on the Peace River, where they mingle with the Siccanies. On Pine River and other south-western streams, the Beaver country extends to the mountains. The Beavers are now a small and weak people. The Crees are encroaching on them from the east side of Smoky River, while a band of Iroquois hunters and half-breeds has taken possession of a considerable part of the southern country, between Dunvegan and Jasper House.\n\nThe Siccanie Indians call the Peace River the Ts\u0113-tai-e-ka, a name meaning \"the river which runs by the rocks,\" in allusion to its passage\nof the Rocky Mountains. The Cree name is A-mis-kwe-i-moo-si-pi, or the Beaver Indian River. The Cree name for the Smoky River is Ka-ska-pa-t\u0113-si-pi with the same signification as the English name. That of the Little Smoky is Ka-ska-pa-t\u0113-si-pi-s\u012bs.\n\n**Grande Prairie, and Descent of Smoky River.**\n\nHaving ascertained from Mr. MacLeod that it was likely that his expedition to the westward would occupy him till about the end of the month, and that Mr. Cambie, who had set out for Lesser Slave Lake, would not be back till the same time, on arriving at Dunvegan on Saturday, August 16, I immediately organized two small parties. With one of these I set out to the southward on Monday morning, having with me a packer, three British Columbian Indians, and a half-breed as guide, with riding horses for the party and three pack animals. My assistant, Mr. McConnell, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Gordon, left Dunvegan at the same time with instructions to penetrate as far to the northward as possible. He had with him a packer, a Beaver Indian as guide, and a half-breed to act as interpreter to the guide, three pack animals and five riding horses.\n\nSeveral trails run southward from Dunvegan toward Grande Prairie and the head waters of the Smoky River, and the Indians travel through in this direction to Jasper House on the upper Athabasca. Many little hunting trails and dim tracks ramify from the main trails in all directions, in conducting us among which our guide was of great service as long as we confined ourselves to the part of the country with which he was familiar.\n\nAfter passing through the belt of woodland already mentioned as bordering the Peace River valley, the trail to Smoky River emerges on the beautiful rolling prairie country previously described, and passes over it in a south-south-eastward direction for about ten miles. At eight and a half miles from Dunvegan the Ghost or Dead River is crossed, at sixteen miles the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9. These streams both flow eastward, and meeting, eventually reach the Peace about fifteen miles below Dunvegan under the last mentioned name. The Ghost River, where crossed by the trail, is a small stream in an inconsiderable valley depressed about forty feet below the prairie, the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9 in August was about twenty feet wide by six inches deep, or in flood forty feet by two feet. Its valley is 1000 feet wide and about a hundred feet deep.\n\nA short distance beyond the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9, the trail begins gradually to ascend a broad ridge, gaining eventually an elevation of about 200 feet above that of the prairie, and passing at the same time into a wooded country. This higher tract has been referred to as a ridge, but has at\nPlate 4.\n\nG. M. D., Photo. Aug. 31, 1879.\n\nLOOKING UP PEACE RIVER VALLEY FROM HILL BEHIND DUNVEGAN.\nthis place a width of about seventeen miles. It runs north-eastward and south-westward, but in the latter direction soon turns to a nearly east and west course, continuing to bound the Grande Prairie to the north for many miles. Where crossed on this trail, the north-eastern part of this higher plateau is about three-fourths woodland, with many pretty little prairie openings. For about six and a half miles before reaching the northern margin of the Grande Prairie, the woods become dense, consisting of aspen, alder, cottonwood and birch, with an occasional spruce.\n\nThe soil of the prairie to the north of the higher plateau is uniformly fertile black loam, of the higher plateau in some places a little coarser, and with here and there a few boulders appearing, but all rich. At twenty-two miles from Dunvegan Ka-toot Lake, about a mile in length, is reached. It drains south-eastward toward Bad Heart or Ma-atz-i-ti he-si-pi of the Crees, which six miles further on is crossed. This has a valley two hundred feet deep and about half a mile wide, the stream being fifteen feet by four inches, or in floods about forty feet by two feet. It flows eastward to the Smoky River.\n\nThe so-called Grande Prairie is a tract of country about forty miles in extreme length in a north-east and south-west direction, and where widest over twenty miles in width. It has an area of about 230,000 acres, and is included between the southern slopes of the ridge or higher plateau above mentioned, the Smoky, the Wapiti and Beaver Lodge Rivers. It is drained by the Klos-kun stream flowing eastward to the Smoky River, by the Bear River which crosses it from north-west to south-east, and at its western extremity by the Beaver Lodge. Kles-kun and Bear Lakes, about three and six miles in length respectively; besides many smaller sheets of water, occur on the prairie.\n\nThe surface of Grande Prairie is not monotonously undulating like that described to the north, but may rather be characterized as forming a series of gently sloping ridges or swells between the various river and stream courses, which are here not found to cut deep gorge-like valleys. The features of the region seem to have been produced by the long-continued and uniform progress of denudation. Much of the country is park-like with groves of poplar, while extensive tracts are quite open, or with coppice along the stream valleys only. Toward the edges the prairie very often blends almost imperceptibly with the woodland by the gradual increase and coalescence of the patches of poplar and willow. The Amalanchier or service berry is exceedingly abundant, and here bears larger and finer fruit than I have seen elsewhere. On the 20th of August the berries were over ripe except in shaded places, and the Indian berry harvest was over. Both Cree and Beaver Indians often come long distances for the berry gathering at Grande\nPrairie, and after having secured and dried a sufficient quantity of fruit, scatter again in small bands into the more remote parts of the country for the autumn hunt.\n\nFertile soil.\n\nThe soil of Grande Prairie is almost everywhere exceedingly fertile, and is often for miles together of deep rich loam which it would be impossible to surpass in excellence. The low ridges sometimes show rather light soil with an admixture of sand or gravel and a few boulders, but a very small proportion of the surface is unfavourable for cultivation. Buffalo trails still score the sod in all directions, and are deeply hollowed out where a number converge toward the crossing of a river or lake, or some such place. The saucer-shaped 'wallows' of the buffalo and scattered bones are also numerous, though the animal is now no more seen here. The Indians state that the extinction of the buffalo was not entirely due to the introduction of fire-arms and the active hunting carried on for the supply of the Hudson Bay forts, but that all remaining were killed many years ago by an excessively severe winter when the snow was over the buffaloes' backs. It may be mentioned in this place that the Beaver Indians report having seen in the summer of 1879 six woodland buffaloes, of which they killed one, in the vicinity of the Pouce Coupee prairie. Kles-kun Lake is evidently shallow, and surrounded about its lower or eastern end by extensive marshes, producing fine natural hay. The slopes along its northern side are particularly noted as affording good winter pasturage for horses. The marshes are in some places more or less saline, and Salicornea was abundant in a few spots. Ducks, geese, cranes and other similar birds are exceedingly numerous about Kles-kun Lake in the autumn. A low gently swelling ridge separates the valley holding Kles-kun from that holding Bear Lake or Sus-mi-gi of the Beaver Indians. This lake is fringed with grassy swamps and coppice, and is probably deeper than Kles-kun Lake.\n\nWoodland buffalo.\n\nBear River.\n\nThe valley of the Bear River, Sus-za-ka of the Beavers, for some miles west of the lake, is, for country in a state of nature, singularly beautiful. Two and a half miles from the lake, the river flows in a trough-like depression 500 feet wide and thirty to forty feet below the general level of the wide valley. The stream at the time of our visit was thirty feet across by two deep, rapid and rather difficult to ford on account of its steep soft banks. The water is brown and evidently drawn from swamps. Klo-es-sa-ka or Fish Creek, a rapid stream ten feet wide by six inches deep, coming from the westward, joins Bear River a short distance above the lake. South of these streams is the Isle de Montagne or Sis-tin of the Beavers, a wooded flat-topped hill rising about five hundred feet above the river valleys, and probably an outlier of an old higher plateau. The Beaver Lodge River or Uz-i-pa\npasses to the south-west of the Isle de Montagne, flowing south-eastward to the Wapiti. It occupies the bottom of a valley two to three miles wide, with gently sloping banks. It was about thirty feet wide by six inches deep where rapid, and flows in a trough cut eighty feet deep in the bottom of the wide valley. The north-eastern slopes of valley are open prairie, but to the south and west the eye ranges over a great extent of wooded country. This is in fact the edge of the Grande Prairie in this direction.\n\nThe Wapiti River, Elk River or Riviere la Bicho, which may be considered as bounding the Grande Prairie country to the south, joins the Smoky River in latitude $55^\\circ 9' 30''$ longitude $118^\\circ 34'$. In August it was found to be about three hundred feet wide and so rapid and deep as to require caution in fording. Its water differs from that of the smaller streams above described in being charged with fine mud, and is doubtless partly derived from melting snow. Our guide pointed out to us a high snow-covered peak in the Rocky Mountains, situated about fifty miles south-westward from the mouth of the Wapiti, as being near the source of the river. The valley of the Wapiti averages probably a mile in width and is depressed about 400 feet below the plateau bordering it. Along the west bank of that portion of it examined, the country for some miles back is sandy and poor, with ridges and mossy swamps. The northern slopes of the valley itself in its lower part are irregular, with sandy and gravelly ridges covered with scattered trees and scanty herbage.\n\nA traverse was made south of the Wapiti River, between that stream and the Smoky, for the purpose of ascertaining the character of the country. Seen from high points on the Grande Prairie this district forms part of a wide nearly level or gently undulating wooded region, which stretches to the distant foot hills of the Rocky Mountains. On the traverse above mentioned the country was found to be generally lightly wooded with poplar and coniferous trees, though dense belts of spruce, in which the trees are sometimes of a large size, also occur. The surface is slightly undulating, and the soil,\u2014especially near Wapiti River\u2014in places light. At least half the surface, however, would, if cleared, be well adapted for agriculture.\n\nOn reaching the bank of the Smoky River\u2014which we did on the trail followed in latitude $54^\\circ 53' 4''$\u2014we hoped to find a small canoe which we were assured had been left there by a hunting party in the spring, and in which I wished to descend the Smoky River to the Peace to examine any rock sections which might occur. Being unsuccessful in our search, and wishing not to lose the time necessary to make a canoe for ourselves, we waited till noon to ascertain the latitude, as above given, and then travelled back fifteen miles to the\ncrossing of the Wapiti, where we had already found a small cottonwood canoe 'cached'. The Smoky River valley at the point just mentioned is two and a half miles wide and over 300 feet deep. The banks are not precipitous and the bottom is wide, with beaver dams and swampy meadows and fine large cottonwoods in dense groves.\n\nDirecting the packer with our guide and one Indian to return at once to Dunvegan, and after obtaining fresh animals there to go on to the mouth of the Smoky to meet us, I got the little canoe above mentioned launched, and with two British Columbian Indians set out to descend the Wapiti and Smoky Rivers to the Peace. We knew that the Indians hunting in this part of the country not unfrequently ran down the Smoky River in canoes, but were not prepared to find it so rapid as it proved. We arrived at the Peace River safely on the evening of August 28th, after a voyage, following the course of the river, of one hundred and twenty miles, and the packer and animals arriving next morning, we rode back to Dunvegan, arriving at 3 p.m., on August 30th.\n\nFrom Mountain Creek, where we embarked on the Wapiti River, to the mouth of the latter\u2014thirteen miles in a straight line\u2014the banks of the valley continue generally wooded with moderate slopes, and show no extensive slides, though frequent small exposures of rock occur at the water's edge. Flats at about ten feet above the river are somewhat extensive but appear to be liable to be flooded. Seven and a half miles from the mouth of the Wapiti the Bear River joins it from the north-west. About a mile and a half below the mouth of the Wapiti, the Smoky is joined from the east by the Simonette River, a stream forty to fifty feet wide by two feet deep with moderately rapid current. This occupies a deep but narrow valley, and is said to head not far from the upper part of the Smoky at a considerable distance to the southward. It is doubtless the upper part of this stream which was crossed by Mr. E. W. Jarvis in his adventurous winter journey across the Rocky Mountains in 1874*. An easy crossing of the Smoky River for a railway line can be obtained by following the valley of the Bear River and the north bank of the Wapiti, crossing the Smoky River at the confluence and making grade to the plateau level again in the valley of the Simonette.\n\nFrom the mouth of the Simonette to the confluence of the Little Smoky River\u2014forty-two and a half miles in a straight line, or about sixty miles by the course of the river\u2014the valley is from a mile to a mile and a half wide from rim to rim. The banks in many places show the effects of very extensive slides, which have brought the soft\n\n* Canadian Pacific Railway Report 1877, p. 155.\nCretaceous rocks are exposed in the valley of the river, but so far as I could see there were no trees growing on them. The river flows in soft rounded curves.\n\nAll spring waters are pure and cool. The banks of the river are covered with grass and trees. On both sides of the river are wooded hills. The Smoky Mountains are visible from the river.\n\nThe river flows in a regular course, excepting at one point where there is an action of the water which causes some of the trees on the banks, and even the rocks, to be phenomena. This is called a fall or a waterfall.\n\nAfter the fall, the river flows in a regular course again. The river flows through the valley of the Peace. The river flows in a regular course excepting at one point where there is an action of the water which causes some of the trees on the banks, and even the rocks, to be phenomena. This is called a fall or a waterfall.\n\nIt was named the Smoky River by the Indians in 1792, and the name has been retained by the country people ever since.\n\nThe town of Smoky is situated at a distance from the river of about two miles, which makes it easy to get water from the head of the river. The town is surrounded by grassy slopes and wooded hills. Considerable attention is given to the river, and it is evident that it will continue to be used for many years to come.\nCretaceous beds down from the level of the country above to the water's edge in broken and confused masses. These are generally old, but some are evidently still occasionally in motion, and covered with trees thrown at all angles by the disturbance. Scarped banks of these soft rocks from one to two hundred feet high also occur in some places. All southern exposures are in general grassed, while the shady parts of the valley are wooded. The flats bordering the river on alternate sides are from ten to twenty feet above it, being higher near the Little Smoky. The Little Smoky is much less in size than the Wapiti River.\n\nThe point at the junction of the Smoky and Little Smoky is an irregular mass of sombre Cretaceous shales, and here is situated the only one of the 'bocannes' which have given the river its name, at present in Bocannes action. Several other places where a smouldering combustion has at some time occurred, are marked by spots of red baked clay in the banks, but at this place a thin column of smoke is still issuing. This phenomenon is again referred to in treating of the Cretaceous rocks on a following page.\n\nAfter making a few abrupt turns below the mouth of the Little Smoky, Lower Smoky River, the main river flows in a nearly straight line to its confluence with the Peace. The valley continues with much the same character as before, slides and scarped banks alternating with grassy or wooded slopes. The river becomes very wide and shallow in some places, especially for several miles before reaching the Peace, and there are several strong rapids. The Cretaceous sandstones which now prevail in the banks are nodularly hardened, and large blocks of these indurated portions of the rock derived from old slides obstruct the river bed in some places, rendering the rapids more difficult to run. It is possible that a stern-wheel steamer of considerable power could ascend the Smoky River for some distance, perhaps even as far as the mouth of the Wapiti, but this would be at best for a short time each year, and the river can in no proper sense be accounted a navigable one.\n\nIt was on the Peace River about six miles above the mouth of the Old Post Smoky that Sir Alexander Mackenzie built a post in the autumn of 1792, and wintered preparatory to his exploration of the then unknown country to the westward.\n\nThe trail from Smoky River to Dunvegan lies at a considerable distance from the river, and passes almost all the way through a country which may be described as prairie. The plateau is nearly level beyond the heads of the numerous ravines which run toward the Peace, wide grassy stretches alternating with aspen coppice and patches of willow. Considerable patches of burnt aspen of larger growth also occur, and it is evident that fire passes at intervals over all this part of the\ncountry keeping down the young growth of trees. Near Dunvegan, for some miles, the surface becomes undulating and broken from the action of denudation sweeping toward the main river valley. This undulating region is pretty densely wooded with aspen. The soil is everywhere exceedingly fertile and the general aspect of the country very beautiful.\n\n**DESCRIPTION BY MR. McCONNELL OF THE COUNTRY NORTH OF DUNVEGAN.**\n\nThe following notes, which may be introduced here, are by my assistant, Mr. McConnell, and accurately describe the country examined by him northward from Dunvegan to the Battle River, a stream which flowing eastward joins the Peace about a hundred miles below the Smoky River:\n\nNorth of Dunvegan the plateau level is attained at about a mile from the fort, and is about 800 feet above the river. The highest point reached by the barometer during the day being 27-48, while at the river level it read 28-452. For several miles after reaching the plateau, the country passed through was somewhat rolling, and dotted with aspen coppice, but gradually the rolls ceased, and at a distance of about six miles from the river the surface became almost perfectly level. As far as the eye could reach nothing met the view save a level plain with here and there a clump of aspens, the whole being admirably adapted to agriculture. The soil displayed where the trail had been worn somewhat deeply was a heavy clay, covered with rich black mould often over a foot in depth. Neither swamps or muskegs and but two gullies were passed over or seen in any direction. This style of country continued for a distance of about fifteen miles from the river, and then commenced gradually to change for the worse. As we approached Hay Lake the country became more swampy and wooded, while with the aspens were now mixed a considerable number of spruce.\n\nHay Lake is about a mile and a half in length by three-quarters of a mile in width, and is so called from the marshes around it affording a large quantity of wild hay. After leaving Hay Lake the trail we followed bends more to the west and leads on to Lac des Isles, distant from Hay Lake about four miles. This lake is somewhat larger than the last and contains numerous islands. Between the two lakes, the country for the greater part of the distance is chiefly wooded with aspen and spruce, and though the trail passes over firm ground nearly all the way, still on either side of it were seen large tamarac swamps and open marshes. But the country seen here cannot be taken as a safe criterion of its character at any distance from the trail, as the swamps\nand marshes are probably due to the proximity of the lakes, the land between them being very low. About half way between Hay Lake and Lac des Isles, a small stream about twenty-five feet wide by a foot deep, and into which both lakes discharge, was crossed; this is the same stream which falls into Peace River about half a mile above Dunvegan, and up the valley of which the trail now led for a considerable distance.\n\nOn leaving the Lac des Isles the country improved considerably, but yet remained far inferior to that in the vicinity of the river. The valley of the stream which we now followed up is about seventy-five feet deep, and varies greatly in width, now narrowing down to about a quarter of a mile, then spreading out to several miles\u2014and giving off at intervals, on either side, large lateral valleys. Here the country is again rolling, with woodland and open prairie alternating with occasional swamps. The soil, though on the whole good, is sometimes light, the tops of the highest rolls showing sand or gravel. About twelve miles north of Lac des Isles we left Muddy Creek, which here turned abruptly westward, and headed, as we were informed by our Indian guide, at a lake several miles long lying at the foot of the same range of low hills which now stretched across our path from east to west. This range we found on crossing it to be about nine miles in width, the hills varying from 400 to 500 feet in height. It appeared to run in a south-westerly direction, but owing to its densely wooded condition, from no point could we obtain more than a glimpse of the country around. The trees were principally small aspens, but a couple of muskegs were passed over on which spruce was growing. On the southern side of this range and the greater part of the way across it, the land is of little value, but the northern slope, being very gentle, displays quite a large area of good land. Descending this slope, we found at its foot the largest muskeg observed in the whole trip. In this swamp headed a small stream which flowed northwards to White Mud River, the range of hills constituting the watershed between that river and the streams flowing southward to Peace River.\n\nAfter passing with difficulty through this swamp, which is about three miles in width, we found that the country gradually improved. First swamp and aspen bush alternated with one another, then all became aspen bush, and at last an open prairie. About six miles from the foot of the hills we came to a large stream called White Mud River, about fifty feet in width by about a foot and a half in depth. It flows in an easterly direction, and the country we descended into appeared to be its valley. If so, it is from north to south, where the trail crosses it, about fifteen miles in width, but appears to narrow westward, another\nrange of hills running from the south-east seeming almost to close it up. Between these two ranges of hills, and stretching eastward and south-eastward as far as the eye could reach, is a large area of magnificent country, slightly rolling, and dotted here and there with clumps of aspen and willow. This reach of country, according to half-breed report, follows White Mud River to its mouth, and bears the same character throughout. This would make it about fifty miles in length, with probably an average width of twenty miles. It appears to be about the same height as the plateau above Dunvegan, or 2200 feet.\n\nThe banks of White Mud River are about fifteen feet in height, but showed no rock sections whatever, the cutting being chiefly through a stiff grey clay. The bed of the stream was filled principally with Laurentian gneissic boulders, together with a small number of well-worn sandstone rocks. After leaving White Mud prairie, the country again grew worse, the proportion of swampy land being on the increase, and the prairie land also giving way to aspen bush; but getting past the watershed between White Mud River and Battle River it again improved, and from this point on to Battle River, a distance of about twenty-five miles, it maintained the same general character, showing scarcely any prairie, but being covered with a thick growth of aspen and willow, and with a very small proportion of swampy land. Battle River, flowing in a valley about a mile in width and 200 feet in depth, is in low water about seventy-five feet wide and about a foot deep, but during floods it must be a large stream of a couple of hundred feet wide and three or four feet deep. A walk of several miles up and down the stream discovered no stratified rocks in situ, though several bluffs were seen from fifty to seventy-five feet high, but consisting principally of sand. Most of the rocks in the stream appear to have come from a distance, gneissic and granitic boulders forming by far the greater proportion of them. Along with these are some of greyish crystalline fossiliferous limestone, and rounded and angular blocks of sandstone, some of them containing fossils, also a small proportion of blackish shale, porphyry, &c. The river is very winding, and runs in an easterly direction. According to the account of a Cree hunter whom we met there, it receives two other branches from the north, each as large as itself, before falling into Peace River, which by his account was two days' journey from this point, or probably about forty miles.\n\nAs a rough estimate of the amount of good land lying between Peace River and Battle River, a distance of eighty-five miles, I should say that fully three-quarters of it is fit for cultivation, the rest being too wet, and the greater part of the cultivable area, including White Mud prairie, being really first-class land, equal to any which I have seen in any other place in the North-west.\nAt Battle River the fall appears to set in very early. Although it was but the 24th August when we were there, yet the leaves of the aspens were already yellow, and were falling off. This appears to have been due to the cold of the night of the 20th August, when the thermometer registered 12 degree of frost, as before that they were quite green, and on our way back after recrossing the hills we found them again comparatively green. This frost, according to the experience of the Hudson Bay Company's people, was quite exceptional in its severity at so early a season, but besides it two other light frosts were experienced on the trip.\n\nExtracts from Mr. Cambie's Report.\n\nTo complete the information obtained during the exploration of the summer of 1879 for the Peace River country west of Dunvegan, the following notes from Mr. H. J. Cambie's report on the region between Dunvegan and Fort St. John and Hudson's Hope, on the north side of the river, and thence southward to Pine River, may be quoted.* As already stated, the river itself has been fully described in the Geological Survey Report of 1875-76 by Mr. Selwyn:\n\n\"From Dunvegan we travelled northward for a day and a half, say thirty miles, and then westward at an average distance of fifteen miles from the Peace River to Fort St. John. ** For the whole distance, nearly 120 miles, the plateau undulates considerably, ranging from 1900 to 2400 feet above the sea level. And for forty miles, after turning to the west, there was a range of hills a few miles to our right rising from 600 to 1500 feet above the adjacent country. My guide informed me that the streams on the other side of that ridge drained into the Battle and Liard Rivers.\n\n\"Eleven streams, from twelve to forty feet in width were crossed, besides numerous smaller ones, and Pine River North, which is situated about six miles from Fort St. John, and was then 100 feet wide by two feet deep, but at high water must be 300 feet wide, in a valley 700 feet deep and a quarter of a mile wide in the bottom. The slopes on both sides are much broken by old land slides.\n\n\"On the west there is a bluff of decomposed shale, and on the face of the eastern slope many ledges of sandstone in nearly horizontal beds.\n\n\"We saw a few small open muskegs, and had to cross one about one mile in width which delayed us more than four hours.\n\n\"The soil is composed of white silt with a good covering of vegetable mould, but for one stretch of fourteen miles, this has been completely burnt off. We also passed over two gravelly ridges.\n\n* Canadian Pacific Railway Report, 1880, p. 50.\n\"A few large prairies were seen, and many small ones interspersed with poplar and willow copse.\n\n\"Twenty-five per cent. of the distance, lay through woods of small poplar, spruce and black pine; near Pine River North, there was also a belt three miles wide of spruce six to fifteen inches in diameter.\"\n\nThe trail from Fort St. John to Hudson's Hope, most of the way, followed the valley of the river, and was on the plateau only for twelve miles after leaving Fort St. John, for about three miles near Middle River, half-way between the two places, and again for a short distance about six miles east of Hudson's Hope.\n\n\"The soil is rich at each of these places, with prairie and poplar and willow copse, also a few small groves of poplar and spruce four to twelve inches in diameter. On the benches next the river, the soil is in some places light, and between Middle River and Hudson's Hope, there is one stretch, six miles in length, gravelly and almost barren. That description of land also extends the whole way across the Rocky Mountain Portage. * * *\n\n\"Regarding the country north of Peace River, I noticed that from the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, about twenty miles north of Hudson's Hope, a range of hills extends, nearly due east till it meets the Peace River, about twelve miles below its junction with the Smoky River.\n\n\"The tract of country lying south of that range, and between it and the Peace, is generally fertile, but that portion of it west of the longitude of Dunvegan is more undulating and at a slightly higher elevation than the other portions of the plateau in the Peace River district, which I had travelled over, and has an appreciable percentage of poor soil.\"\n\nThe plateau south of Hudson's Hope is said to be 2000 feet in elevation, but a ridge rising 900 feet higher is crossed at five miles, and a descent made to Moberly's Lake, which has an elevation of 2050 feet. The country between Moberly's Lake and the Pine River is described as a mountainous and hilly district, sixteen miles in breadth, rendered almost impassable by fallen timber, the only prairies being on the slopes of steep hills facing the south.\n\n\"In the first five miles from Hudson's Hope we had crossed two small tamarack swamps and some stretches of light, sandy soil, with a small growth of poplar and spruce. We had again met with some level land in the valley of Moberly's River, which for nine miles above the lake averages nearly half a mile in width in the bottom. Some portions of this are gravelly and barren, and others fertile, with a few small prairies producing rich grass. There are also some fine prairies at the lake, on slopes facing the south. Between Moberly's Lake and...\"\nPine River there is now a young growth of spruce, black pine and poplar, but the piles of fallen timber proved the existence not long ago of spruce forests of moderate size, and a few belts of that timber, six inches to twenty-four inches in diameter, having escaped the ravages of the fire, are still standing.\"\n\n**Description of Country between Dunvegan and the Athabasca River.**\n\nAugust 21st and the four following days were spent at Dunvegan, in the preparation of a preliminary map and report on the character of the country, and in arranging about supplies and dividing the pack train, the larger part of the animals returning with Mr. Cambie to British Columbia. The season being now far advanced, and no word received from the party which was to have opened a trail from Dirt Lake, west of Edmonton, to Dunvegan; Mr. MacLeod and I decided to divide between us the work necessary to complete exploratory lines to Dirt Lake and Lac La Biche, as in the event of either the Pine or Peace River pass being chosen as a railway route, it appeared absolutely essential that surveys should be connected in both these directions. We left Dunvegan finally on the 5th of September, Mr. MacLeod and I setting out for the upper part of the Athabasca River, while Mr. McConnell had instructions to go to Lesser Slave Lake, and make his way by the best route he could find to Athabasca Landing, where he was to meet me early in October.\n\nWe were able to procure a guide who engaged to take us as far as Sturgeon Lake, toward our objective point on the Athabasca, and travelling in the first instance to the mouth of the Wapiti River, we there crossed the Smoky, intending to strike eastward to the lake. Our guide, however, informed us that the intervening country was a mass of burnt woods and windfall through which he had had great difficulty in travelling on snow-shoes in winter, and quite impracticable for animals. We were therefore obliged to make a long detour to the north, and arrived at Sturgeon Lake on September 14th. There are here a few rough log-houses inhabited by Cree Indians, who cultivate small garden patches. We found, however, that nearly all the men were away on the autumn hunt, and were told that it would be quite impossible to travel south-eastward to the Athabasca owing to the great areas of heavy windfall and swamp. We managed at length, however, to procure a lad as guide, who agreed to lead us to where one of the parties was, and there we hoped to find a man better acquainted with the country. Without entering further into particulars as to the journey, it may suffice to say that after penetrating a very difficult...\ncountry we reached the bank of the Athabasca in latitude $54^\\circ 7' 34''$, approximate longitude $116^\\circ 48'$, on the 24th September.\n\nBetween the Smoky River and Sturgeon Lake, lies a ridge, or area of higher plateau, which exceeds the general level by two or three hundred feet. The route followed from the mouth of the Simonette lay round the north end of this ridge, as we were forced northward by wet country till we fell into the trail which leads from the lower or Cambie's crossing of the Smoky River to Sturgeon Lake. The country may be described as in general densely wooded, the forest being for the most part second-growth, and composed of aspen, birch, *Pinus contorta*, spruce and cottonwood, generally of medium or small growth. Considerable tracts are covered, however, with heavy original spruce or aspen forest. There are many little prairie openings, especially along the banks of streams, and considerable tracts of burnt country still more or less encumbered with the half-consumed logs, but affording excellent pasture for animals. Swamps, generally produced by beaver-dams, are often met with, and the evidences of old beaver work are very frequent, though comparatively few skins are now obtained in this part of the country. The stream beds are not generally depressed more than ten to forty feet below the level of the plateau. The valley of the Pus-kwas-ka-mon, a considerable brook, is followed eastward till within five miles of Sturgeon Lake, when the watershed is crossed at an elevation of 250 feet above Sturgeon Lake. The soil is generally good and in some places very fertile. It is composed of the white silt previously referred to, with a surface coating of vegetable mould of variable thickness. A few Laurentian boulders and quartzite pebbles were observed on the slopes of the ridge or higher plateau.\n\nSturgeon Lake, or Ke-me-sis Sa-ga-he-gun of the Crees, is probably about eight miles long and lies nearly east and west. It is constricted in the middle and its western end was not seen. Its elevation is about 2000 feet. It is probably shallow and its banks are uniformly low, sloping up gradually to a height of about one hundred feet before attaining the plateau level. There is good pasturage and a fine partly open country on the north-eastern border of the lake, along which we passed to reach the Cree settlement. The Indians here own some horses, which they winter on the grassy banks of a second large lake lying to the south of Sturgeon Lake.\n\nTwenty-one miles south-eastward from Sturgeon Lake, the bank of the Little Smoky River was reached. The intervening country is for the most part wooded, but with little prairies along the borders of the streams. The surface is gently rolling the differences in elevation not exceeding a few hundred feet. A few mossy and peaty swamps were traversed, but the area of these is comparatively inconsiderable. The soil is generally good and in some places very fertile.\n\nFor several days the country was extremely wet, while we were obliged to travel by river trails. In Sturgeon Lake there is a current running in the other direction, and on its northern side there is a small island from which a number of fifty-foot trees are visible. It is evident that this valuable timber will soon be swarmed by lumbermen, who contemplate altering the course of the river, so as to float it into the lakes, and thus in the shortest possible time abridge the distance between Buck Lake and Lac-des-Loups.\n\nIn the vicinity of the lake joined the river a small I-o-seh, which flows wide and sluggish in an easterly direction, and is one of the sources of the Lac-des-Loups.\n\nLac-des-Loups is twenty-five miles long and fifteen broad, barrel-shaped, and surrounded by mossy and peaty swamps. Ten miles further eastward, owing to traps set by the Indians a few years ago, the river flows through standing water, which is fed by the spring waters of the swampy patches on either side. The large river is here diversified by numerous islands, and the intervening water is deep and clear.\nsoil is generally good, though in some places becoming rather hard and clayey and then bearing dense groves of spruce.\n\nFrom the point when the Little Smoky River is first reached, its course is in the main followed for thirty-six miles by an indistinct trail which crosses and re-crosses the stream in a number of places. The river averages from 250 to 300 feet wide with generally a stony bottom. In September it was two to three feet deep, with a moderately swift current. The valley is not deep and trough-shaped like those of many other rivers in this region, but wide and shallow. Where first touched on it is depressed about eighty feet only below the plateau, and is from three-quarters of a mile to a mile in width. Further up the valley is from a quarter of a mile to half a mile in width, and scarcely more than fifty feet below the plateau. In approaching the Athabasca, the country is evidently not only increasing slowly in altitude, but decreasing in value. The soil of the plateau becomes sandy in many places and swamps are more extensive. The valley of the Little Smoky, however, continues very beautiful, prairies with fine natural grass and pea-vine, alternating with open woodland. The Indians say that the Simonette, sources of the Little Smoky and the Baptiste Rivers,\u2014the two former flowing into the Main Smoky the latter into the Athabasca\u2014rise near together in the Rocky Mountains. Where the valley of the Little Smoky turns abruptly to the westward the trail leaves it, turning to I-a-pe-oo or Buck Moose Lake, a few miles off.\n\nIn the portion of its course above described, the Little Smoky is joined by four considerable tributaries. On the right bank, the Lo-s\u00e9-gun and I-a-pe-oo Rivers, the former with a flood channel half as wide as that of the Little Smoky and coming from a lake to the southeastward; the latter, probably also a stream of some size, from the lake of the same name above mentioned. On the left bank the Big Beaver Lodge and the Walk-an-a-gan or Tamarac Rivers.\n\nI-a-pe-oo Lake is about three-quarters of a mile wide and at least two miles long, neither end having been distinctly seen. It is surrounded by barren sandy ridges lightly clad with spruce, with intervening deep mossy swamps. From this point to the bank of the Athabasca\u2014twenty miles\u2014there is no visible trail, and the country is exceedingly difficult to traverse, having been for the most part burnt over only a few years ago, the dead trees now forming either almost impassable windfall or standing in thick masses of bleached and bare trunks. In a few places the second growth has attained some size, and in occasional spots patches of the heavy original forest covering, composed chiefly of large spruce trees, have been preserved. The surface is diversified by ridges which rise in some places nearly 200 feet above the intervening hollows, and still continues gradually rising toward the\nAthabasca. At eight miles from the Athabasca the watershed between this river and the Peace is crossed, with an elevation of 3300 feet. Four miles from the Athabasca we crossed the Marsh Head River, a tributary from the eastward. The stream is about forty feet wide by two to three feet deep, and flows in a deep valley over three miles in width. The soil is generally light, the silt often turning to actual sand, but considerable areas of land of fair quality are still to be found. On the higher parts of the ridges or swells Laurentian boulders are not unfrequently met with.\n\nGeneral Physical and Climatic Features of the Peace River Country.\n\nAs the district of country defined on page 16 n, to the description of which the succeeding pages up to this point have been devoted, is bounded to the south by the Athabasca, it may be well here briefly to review the character of this great tract of the Peace River basin, and discuss what facts we possess as to its climate. As already noted its area is about 31,550 square miles. Its average elevation may be stated as a little over 2000 feet, and this is maintained with considerable uniformity, for though the general surface slopes slightly from the north and south toward the Peace River, the region as a whole may be considered as a plateau, through which the great gorge-like valley of the Peace has been excavated. This valley has in general a depth of 600 to 800 feet below that part of the plateau bordering it, with a width of two or three miles from rim to rim. Its tributary streams, at first nearly on the plateau level, flow in valleys of continually increasing depth as they approach that of the Peace River. Those from the south-eastern portion of the region, rise either in the Rocky Mountains or near the Athabasca, the tributaries received by the latter stream, in this part of its course, from the north and north-west being\u2014with the exception of the Baptiste\u2014quite inconsiderable.\n\nThe ridges and hills by which this region is occasionally diversified, appear in all cases to be composed either of the generally soft rocks of the Cretaceous, or of arenaceous clays containing erratics and representing the boulder clays of the glacial period. These elevations are generally slight, and with exceedingly light and gradual slopes, the scarped banks of the streams constituting much more important irregularities. These ridges, however, often resemble detached portions of a higher plateau, and spread widely enough to occupy in the aggregate a considerable area, of which the soil is not so uniform in character as elsewhere. With these exceptions, the soil of the district may be described as a fine silt, resembling the white silts of the Nechacco basin previously referred to, and not dissimilar from the loess-like material\nconstituting the subsoil of the Red River valley in Manitoba. This silt, at a short distance below the surface, is greyish or brownish in color, but becomes mixed superficially with a proportion of vegetable matter to a varying depth. It has evidently been deposited by a comparatively tranquil body of water not loaded with ice, probably toward the close of the glacial period, and has either never been laid down on the ridges and undulations above referred to, or has been since removed from them by processes of waste. As evidenced by the natural vegetation its fertility is great.\n\nWest of the Smoky River, both to the south and north of Peace River, there are extensive areas of prairie country, either entirely open, and covered with a more or less luxuriant growth of grass, or dotted with patches of coppice and groves of trees.\n\nThe northern banks of the Peace River valley, are also very generally open and grassed, and parts of the valley of the Smoky and other rivers have a similar character. The total area of prairie land west of the Smoky River, may be about 3000 square miles. The remainder of the surface is generally occupied by second-growth forest, occasionally dense, but more often open and composed of aspen, birch and cottonwood, with a greater or less proportion of coniferous trees. Some patches of the original forest remain, however, particularly in the river valleys, and are composed of much larger trees, chiefly coniferous, among which the spruce is most abundant. Handsome groves of old and large cottonwoods are also to be found in some of the valleys. Where the soil becomes locally sandy and poor, and more particularly in some of the more elevated parts of the high ridges above described, a thick growth of scrub pine and spruce, in which the individual trees are small, is found; and in swampy regions the tamarack is not wanting, and grows generally intermixed with the spruce.\n\nEast of the Smoky River, and southward toward the Athabasca, the prairie country is quite insignificant in extent, the region being characterized by second-growth woods of the kind just described, which, on approaching the Athabasca, are replaced by extensive and well nigh impassable tracts of brule and windfall, in which second-growth forest is only beginning to struggle up.\n\nThough the prairies are most immediately available, from an agricultural point of view, the regions now covered with second-growth and forest, where the soil itself is not inferior, will eventually be equally valuable. The largest tract of poor land is that bordering the valley of the Athabasca on the north. This rises to an elevation considerably greater than most of the region to the north and west, and appears during the submergence to which the superficial deposits are due, to have been exposed to stronger currents which have prevented the deposi-\ntion of the fine silt, causing it to be replaced by a coarser silt which passes in places into actual sand, and alternates with ridges of boulder clay. This region is also often swampy, and for a width of twenty to twenty-five miles on the trail from Sturgeon Lake to Athabasca is quite unsuited for agriculture, though still in many places capable of yielding good summer grazing when the forest has been completely removed by fire. To the northward, more particularly to the east of Smoky River, peaty and mossy swamps occupy part of the surface, and these may be regarded as permanently unsuited to agriculture.\n\nThere is also a sandy tract, though of small width, along the lower part of the Wapiti River near its junction with the Smoky. Deducting, as far as possible, all the areas known to be inferior or useless, with about twenty per cent. for the portions of the region under consideration of which less is known, the total area of land, with soil suited to agriculture, may be estimated as at least 23,500 square miles. In the absence of complete maps, such an estimate cannot be otherwise than very rough, but may serve to give some idea of the fact.\n\nWhatever theory be adopted, and may have been advanced, to account for the wide prairies of the western portion of America further to the south, the origin of the prairies of the Peace River is sufficiently obvious. There can be no doubt that they have been produced and are maintained by fires. The country is naturally a wooded one, and where fires have not run for a few years, young trees begin rapidly to spring up. The fires are, of course, ultimately attributable to human agency, and it is probable that before the country was inhabited by the Indians it was everywhere densely forest-clad. That the date of the origin of the chief prairie tracts now found is remote, is clearly evidenced by their present appearance, and more particularly by the fact that they are everywhere scored and rutted with old buffalo tracks, while every suitable locality is pitted with saucer-shaped 'buffalo wallows.' In its primitive state, the surface was probably covered with a dense and heavy growth of coniferous trees, principally the spruce (Picea Engelmanni and P. alba) but with scrub pine (Pinus contorta) in some localities, and interspersed with aspen and cottonwood. These forests having been destroyed by fire, a second growth, chiefly of aspen, but with much birch in some places, and almost everywhere a certain proportion of coniferous trees\u2014chiefly spruce\u2014has taken its place. The aspen being a short-lived tree, while the spruce reaches a great age and size, the natural course of events, if undisturbed, would lead to the re-establishment of the old spruce forests.\n\nThe luxuriance of the natural vegetation in these prairies is truly wonderful, and indicates, not alone the fertility of the soil, but the occurrence of a sufficient rainfall.\nWith regard to the climate of the Peace River country, we are without such accurate information as might be obtained from a careful meteorological record, embracing even a single year, and its character can at present be ascertained merely from notes and observations of a general character and the appearance of the natural vegetation.\n\nIt may be stated at once that the ascertained facts leave no doubt on the subject of the sufficient length and warmth of the season, to ripen wheat, oats and barley, with all the ordinary root crops and vegetables, the only point which may admit of question being to what extent the occurrence of late and early frosts may interfere with growth. This remark is intended to apply to the whole district previously defined, including both the river valleys and the plateau.\n\nThe summer season of 1879 was an unusual one, characterized by excessively heavy rainfall, with cold raw weather in the early summer months. These conditions did not extend to the west of the Rocky Mountains, but appear to have been felt over the entire area of the plains to the Red River valley. As a result of this, the crops generally throughout the North-west were later than usual, and the mean temperature of even the latter part of the summer appears to be rather abnormally low. Notwithstanding this, on my arrival at Dunvegan, on the 16th of August, small patches of wheat and barley in the garden of the fort presented a remarkably fine appearance and were beginning to turn yellow. On my return to the fort on August 31st these were being harvested, their complete ripening having been delayed by overcast and chilly weather which prevailed between these dates. At the first-mentioned date potatoes were quite ripe, with the balls formed on the stalks, and the garden contained also fine cabbages, cauliflowers, beets, carrots, onions, lettuce and turnips. Dwarf beans, cucumbers and squashes were also flourishing, and though these plants are particularly tender, showed no sign of frost. The two last-named having been sown in the open ground did not appear likely to perfect their fruit. A few stalks of Indian corn were also growing, though it is improbable that this cereal would ripen in this district.\n\nWhen this garden was again visited, on the last day of August, the beans, cucumbers and squashes had been cut down by frost, but not completely killed. The potato tops were also slightly nipped.\n\nRev. Mr. Tessier, who has been at Dunvegan as a missionary for some years, has always been able to ripen small, black butter-beans, but in some seasons not without difficulty owing to frosts. He had also tried a few grains of oats which he procured accidentally, and obtained a return of astonishing abundance. About the date just referred to the potato plants at Smoky River post (The Forks) were badly cut down by frost, the tubers being, however, quite ripe, fine and large.\nOn the 15th September, Mr. R. McConnell, found the potatoes in the garden of the fort at the west end of Lesser Slave Lake, and on the level of the plateau, little affected by the frost, with tubers large and ripe. Mr. H. J. Cambie also ascertained that wheat thrives at this place. We found some rude attempt at cultivation also at the 'Cree Settlement,' previously referred to, which is at the average level of the plateau, with an elevation of about 2000 feet. Here, on September 14th, the potato plants were slightly affected by frost, but not more so than observed at Dunvegan two weeks before. The tubers were quite ripe, but the Indians did not intend to dig them for about ten days. Turnips were very fine, and carrots, beets and onions were good, though evidently cultivated with very little care. Two or three very small patches of barley had been almost completely destroyed by mice, but a few stalks remaining were quite ripe and with fine heads. The Indians here were very anxious to have a supply of garden seeds, which I have since been able to forward to them by the kindness of Messrs. Stobart, Eden & Co., of Winnipeg.\n\nAt Fort St. John, ninety-five miles west of Dunvegan, and so much nearer the mountains, on July 26th, 1875, Professor Macoun states that potatoes, oats, barley, and many varieties of vegetables were in a very flourishing state in 'Nigger Dan's' garden. The oats stood nearly five feet high, and the barley had made nearly an equal growth.* The barley and oats were both ripe about the 12th of August. Prof. Macoun was informed by Charlette at Hudson's Hope, thirty miles further west, that in 1874 there was no frost from the 1st of May until the 15th of September. In 1875 sowing commenced the last week in April. There appears to have been a frost on June 28th, but the first autumn frost occurred on the 8th of September, and Mr. Selwyn found the potato tops still green in the middle of the month. Mr. H. J. Cambie saw wheat flourishing here in July last, but on his return in September it had been cut down by frost.\n\nSuch are the notes that can be obtained on the growth of cereals and vegetables in the district in question. From information obtained at Dunvegan, it seems that the snow disappears about the middle of April, westerly winds sweeping it away fast. The river opens at about the same time. Cultivation begins at about the end of April or first of May. The river generally begins to freeze in November. The depth of snow, I was told, averages about two feet, an estimate which agrees with Mr. Horetzky's statement.\u2020 Mr. Horetzky was also told that the plains were often nearly bare up to the month of December, though the winter usually sets in with the month of November. Sir\n\n* Report of Progress, Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-6, p. 154.\n\u2020 Canada on the Pacific, p. 295.\nAlexander Mackenzie remarked the same absence of snow in the early winter months of 1792. It was entirely gone on April 5th, 1793, and gnats and mosquitoes were troublesome on April 20.* Horses almost invariably winter out well without requiring to be fed. Hay should be provided for cattle, to ensure perfect safety, for a period of three or four months, though in some seasons it is necessary to feed the animals for a few weeks only. The Indians of the 'Cree Settlement' on Sturgeon Lake, previously referred to, winter their horses without any difficulty round the borders of a neighbouring lake, the shores of which are partly open. From Hudson's Hope, the horses are sent southward to Moberly's Lake to winter, and according to Mr. Selwyn, do well there. Lesser Slave Lake, with its wonderful natural meadows, has long been known as an excellent place for wintering stock, and is referred to as such by Sir J. Richardson.\n\nSome general idea of the length and character of the seasons at Fort St. John may be gained by an examination of the extracts from the journals from 1866 to 1875, published by Mr. Selwyn.\u2020 The dates of opening and closing of Peace River, being an important clue to the mean temperature of the region, may be quoted as summarized by Prof. Macoun in the same report (p. 156):\n\n| Year | Ice breaking | Ice drifting, first time |\n|------|--------------|-------------------------|\n| 1866 | April 19     | Nov. 7                  |\n| 1867 | \"           | \" 8                    |\n| 1868 | \"           | \" 7                    |\n| 1869 | \"           | \" 8                    |\n| 1870 | \"           | no record              |\n| 1871 | \"           | \" 10                   |\n| 1872 | \"           | \" 8                    |\n| 1873 | \"           | \" 4                    |\n| 1874 | \"           | Oct. 31                |\n| 1875 | \"           |                        |\n\nThe average date of the breaking up of the ice may thus be stated to be April 21st; that on which ice is running in the river for the first time, November 7th. In 1792-3, when wintering at the mouth of Smoky River, Sir Alexander Mackenzie observed the ice to be running for the first time on November 6th, while the river was clear of ice on the 25th April. I have been unable to find any precise records of the dates of closing and opening of the Saskatchewan, but Dr. Hector states these are usually the second week of November and the second week of April, respectively. The Saskatchewan is a more rapid stream than the Peace.\n\n* Voyages, p. 131-132.\n\u2020 Report of Progress, Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, p. 84.\nWith regard to the probable difference between the actual valley of the Peace, and the plateau forming the general surface of the country, Prof. Macoun observes,* speaking of the vicinity of Fort St. John, that notwithstanding the difference in altitude, the berries on the plateau ripened about a week only later than those near the river, while he was informed that there was about the same difference in the time of disappearance of the snow in spring. While at Dunvegan, I ascertained that a similar difference was observed there, but it was added that this obtained chiefly with the wooded parts of the plateau, the snow disappearing on the prairies much about the same time as in the valley. In my diary, under date September 5th, I find the following entry:\u2014 \"Aspens and berry bushes about the Peace River valley now looking quite autumnal. On the plateau, 800 or 900 feet higher, not nearly so much so. Slight tinge of yellow only on some aspen groves.\" This difference, though not altogether constant and depending much on diversity of soil, appears to be actual. In October, 1872, Mr. Horetzky writes: \u2020 \"We observed that, curiously enough, the vegetation upon these uplands did not appear to have suffered so much from the effects of frost, this being probably due to the fact of the air in these upper regions being constantly in motion, while in the deep and capacious valley of the river the winds have often no effect.\"\n\nThe difference between the valley and the plateau being thus very small, I have not treated separately the observations for temperature taken by myself in the different situations. Most of the observations, however, refer to the plateau; and including the whole time spent in the country, from the Middle Forks of Pine River to the bank of the Athabasca, cover a period of nearly two months. The mean minimum temperature for the month of August, deduced from observations extending from the 6th to the 31st of the month, is $39.9^\\circ$. The mean of observations at 6 a.m. during the same period is $42.3^\\circ$. That of the observations at 6 p.m., $59.5^\\circ$. In September the mean minimum temperature was $28.1^\\circ$. The mean of morning observations $34.3^\\circ$, of evening observations $51.5^\\circ$. I have endeavoured to deduce from these observations mean temperatures for the months in question, by correcting them by the tables of hourly variations in temperature given by C. A. Schott in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge (No. 277), but find it impossible to do so, as the daily range is here so much greater than that of any of the places represented by the tables, which refer chiefly to the eastern portion of the continent. It would appear, that while in most places the mean temperature of the day is reached\n\n---\n\n* Op. cit., p. 155.\n\u2020 Canada on the Pacific, p. 41.\nabout 8 p.m., it is found in the Peace River country not far from 6 p.m., by reason of the increased rapidity of loss of heat by radiation due to greater elevation and dryer atmosphere. The maximum temperature was seldom observed, but the daily range is very great, and the maximum probably several times reached 80\u00b0 in August, and often surpassed 70\u00b0 in September.\n\nFrom the 6th to the 31st of August I registered two nights of frost, registered on the 13th and 20th of the month, when the thermometer showed 32\u00b0 and 26\u00b0, respectively. Both of these were observed on the plateau, but one at least of them (that of the 20th) must have occurred also in the valley, from the effects produced at Dunvegan on tender vegetation. These frosts occurred in very fine weather, following a day of strong westerly wind, the result of which is to remove from the surface of the earth the whole of the lower heated layer of the atmosphere. This, succeeded by a calm and cloudless night with transparent sky, causes the thermometer to sink below the freezing-point before morning. When not preceded by strong wind, mere transparency of the atmosphere seems seldom or never to lead to frost in August, in this district, as many beautifully starlight nights without an approach of the mercury to the freezing-point were experienced.\n\nThough in some cases such frosts as these may be general, and extend over a wide district of country, it is more usually found that they are quite local in character. A few floating clouds, or light wreaths of mist, may arrest radiation so far as to prevent frost over the greater part of the country, while some spot accidentally exposed during the whole night under a clear sky, experiences a temperature below 32\u00b0. The contour, and character of vegetation of the country, also have much to do with the occurrence of frosts, and it is very frequently the case that river valleys are more subject to frosts than the upland districts. During the month of September, in a region for the most part wooded, and often above the average altitude, between Dunvegan and the Athabasca, nineteen frosts were registered, the actually lowest temperature being 20\u00b0 on September 18th.\n\nThrough the kindness of Colonel Jarvis, of the North-west Mounted Police, I have been able to secure a copy of records kept by Dr. Herchmer, of Fort Saskatchewan, on the Saskatchewan River, about twenty miles north-east of Edmonton. For comparison with the observed temperatures in the portion of the Peace River country now discussed, they are invaluable; for in the whole district surrounding Fort Saskatchewan and Edmonton we now know, from actual and repeated experiment, that wheat and all other ordinary cereals and vegetables thrive, and yield most abundant crops. The climate, in its great diurnal and annual range, corresponds exactly with that of the Peace\nRiver country. Fort Saskatchewan is situated on the brow of the Saskatchewan valley, about seventy feet above the river, and therefore probably less liable to frosts than either the bottom of the river valley or extensive flat tracts of plain, where there is little circulation of air. This, with the position of the thermometers in regard to the buildings, leads to the belief that if at all in error, as representing the climate of the region generally, the indicated temperatures are slightly too great. The thermometer appears to have been read in all cases to the nearest degree only.\n\nA comparison may be made between the temperatures observed in the Peace River country during August and September, with those at Fort Saskatchewan, as follows:\n\n| Peace River country, mean of minima during August | 39\u00b79\u00b0 |\n| --- | --- |\n| \" | September | 28\u00b71\u00b0 |\n| \" | frosts experienced during August | 3 |\n| \" | \" | 19 |\n| Fort Saskatchewan, mean of minima during August | 39\u00b73\u00b0 |\n| \" | September | 31\u00b71\u00b0 |\n| \" | frosts experienced during August | 0 |\n| \" | \" | 15 |\n| \" | mean of maxima during August | 77\u00b78\u00b0 |\n| \" | \" | 68\u00b71\u00b0 |\n| \" | deduced mean temp. of August | 58\u00b76\u00b0 |\n| \" | \" | 49\u00b76\u00b0 |\n\nMeans.\n\nThe mean of maxima and actual mean temperature for the months cannot be stated for the Peace River country. The actual mean for Fort Saskatchewan is obtained by adding the minima and maxima for each month together, and is probably very nearly correct.\n\nWhile regretting that the data at disposal for the determination of the agricultural value of the Peace River country are not fuller, we may, I believe, arrive with considerable certainty at the general fact that it is great. From such comparison as can be made, it would be premature to allow that the climate of the Peace River is inferior to that of the region about Edmonton on the Saskatchewan. It is true that in both the Saskatchewan and Peace River districts the season is none too long for the cultivation of wheat, but if the crop can be counted on as a sure one\u2014and experience seems to indicate that it may\u2014the occurrence of early and late frosts may be regarded with comparative indifference. The season is at least equally short throughout the whole fertile belt from the Peace River to Manitoba, though early and late frosts are not so common in the low valley of the Red River. The almost simultaneous advance of spring along the whole line of this fertile belt, is indicated by the dates of the flowering of the various plants, which are given in the table on page 75.\n\nGeneral conclusion.\n\nThe Peace River country is characterized by a climate which is intermediate between that of the prairie region and that of the forest belt. The temperature is generally lower than that of the prairie region, but higher than that of the forest belt. The rainfall is generally lower than that of the prairie region, but higher than that of the forest belt. The vegetation is generally intermediate between that of the prairie region and that of the forest belt.\n\nFootnotes:\n* Geographical Survey of Canada.\n\u2020 Report of the Geological Survey of Canada.\n\u2021 Report of the Meteorological Survey of Canada.\nplants, a point referred to by me in some detail elsewhere.* It is further unquestionable that the winter is less severe, and not subject to the same extremes in the Peace River and Upper Saskatchewan regions as in Manitoba.\n\nWe have already found reason to believe that the early and late frosts, and not the absence of a sufficient aggregate amount of heat, constitute the limiting condition of wheat culture in the North-west; but that neither the Saskatchewan nor the Peace River countries lie upon the actual verge of the profitable cultivation of wheat, appears to be proved by the fact that oats succeed on the Saskatchewan, and also\u2014in so far as one or two seasons can be accepted as evidence\u2014on the Peace River; while it is well known that this cereal is less tolerant of summer frost than wheat. This is further proved by the fact that at Fort Vermilion and Athabasca Lake, 180 and 300 miles, respectively, north-east of Dunvegan, Prof. Macoun found wheat and barley ripening well; but in this instance the fact is complicated by the circumstance of the decreasing altitude of the country, which introduces a new condition. As no knowledge has been gained of this country on the Lower Peace in addition to that collected by Prof. Macoun in 1875,\u2020 it is not included in the above discussion, though from it additional great areas might doubtless be added to the fertile tract.\n\nReferring to the journals kept at Fort St. John, Mr. Selwyn, in the report already several times referred to, comes to the conclusion that the climate of the Peace River compares favourably with that of the Saskatchewan or Montreal.\n\nTo give some idea of the value of a tract of generally fertile country such as that now described, let us assume, as above, that the area of actually cultivable land is 2\u00b0 500 square miles, or 15,140,000 acres. Let us suppose, for simplicity of calculation, that the whole area were sown in wheat, the yield, at the rate of twenty bushels to the acre, would be 306,800,000 bushels.\n\nThe portion of the Peace River country embraced in the explorations of 1879, and treated of in this report, however, by no means includes the whole fertile tract, as the statements made regarding the lower part of the Peace by Prof. Macoun\u2021 and others show. Sir J. Richardson places the northern limit of the profitable cultivation of wheat in the Mackenzie valley, at Fort Liard, on the Liard River (lat. 60\u00b05' N.), while from trustworthy information obtained by Prof. Macoun, it appears that even at Fort Simpson, on the Mackenzie in lat. 61\u00b0 51', wheat succeeds\n\n* Geology and Resources of the 49th Parallel, 1875, p. 279.\n\u2020 Report of Progress Geol.

Survey of Canada, 1875-76.\nfour times out of five, and barley always ripens from the 12th to the 20th of August.\n\nIn the report of the Meteorological Department for 1876, a series of observations taken by Mr. J. S. Onions at Fort Simpson is printed. This, though extending merely from May to November, 1875, seems to show that the climate compares very favourably with that of the Upper Peace River. No frosts occurred from the 18th of May to the 10th of September. The mean temperatures of the months of growth are as follows, the figures in the first column being from the source just alluded to, those in the second from the appendix to Sir J. Richardson's \"Journal of a Boat Voyage\":\n\n| Month     | Column I | Column II |\n|-----------|----------|-----------|\n| May       | 44\u00b76     | 48\u00b716     |\n| June      | 58\u00b78     | 63\u00b764     |\n| July      | 63\u00b75     | 60\u00b797     |\n| August    | 63\u00b72     | 53\u00b784     |\n| September | 44\u00b78     | 49\u00b710     |\n\nThe figures differ considerably, but those under column I are probably the more accurate, as the second series depends on observations taken at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., to which a correction of the kind previously mentioned as inapplicable to this western region, has been applied.\n\nIt has often been stated, in a general way, that the cause of the exceptionally favourable climate of the Saskatchewan and Peace River countries, as compared with that of the eastern portion of the American continent, is to be found in the prevalence of warm westerly winds from the Pacific. Sir Alexander Mackenzie speaks of these westerly winds in winter, writing: \"I had already observed at Athabasca, that this wind never failed to bring us clear mild weather, whereas, when it blew from the opposite quarter, it produced snow. Here it is much more perceptible, for if it blows hard south-west for four hours a thaw is the consequence, and if the wind is at north-east it brings sleet and snow. To this cause it may be attributed that there is so little snow in this part of the world. These warm winds come off the Pacific Ocean, which cannot, in a direct line, be very far from us, the distance being so short that, though they pass over mountains covered with snow, there is not time for them to cool.\"\n\nFurther south, these south-westerly currents are known as 'Chinook winds,' and similar consequences are observed to follow their occurrence. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, however, in the summer of 1793, found the distance to the Pacific coast from his wintering place at the mouth of Smoky River, greater than he appears to have imagined at\n\n* Voyages, p. 138.\nthe time he penned the above-quoted remarks, and it is difficult indeed, to understand how currents of air, blowing for at least 350 miles across a country which is for the most part mountainous, should retain enough warmth to temper effectually the climate of the plains to the east. This difficulty would appear to be particularly great in summer, when the mountains are largely snow-clad, and the mean temperature of the Peace and Saskatchewan valleys, is probably considerably in excess of that of the region intervening between them and the sea.\n\nThe complete explanation is to be found in the great quantity of heat rendered latent when moisture is evaporated or air expanded in volume, but which becomes sensible again on condensation of the moisture or compression of the air.\n\nThe pressure in the upper regions of the atmosphere being so much less than in the lower, a body of air rising from the sea-level to the summit of a mountain range, must expand, and this, implying molecular work, results in an absorption of heat and consequent cooling. The amount of this cooling has been estimated at about $1^\\circ$ Centigrade for 100 metres of ascent when the air is dry, but becomes reduced to $\\frac{1}{2}$ degree when the temperature has fallen to the dew-point of the atmosphere, and precipitation of moisture as cloud, rain or snow begins; the heat resulting from this condensation retarding to a certain degree the cooling due to the expansion of the air. When the air descends again on the further side of the mountain range, its condensation leads to an increase of sensible heat equal to $1^\\circ$ C. for each 100 metres.* It is owing to this circumstance that places in the south of Greenland, on the west coast, during the prevalence of south-easterly winds, which flow over the high interior of the country, have been found, in winter, to experience for a time a temperature higher than that of North Italy or the south of France, though the North Atlantic Ocean from which the winds come, can, at this season, be little above the freezing-point. The wind well known in the Alps as the foehn, is another example of the same phenomenon.\n\nThe data are wanting for an accurate investigation of the circumstances of our west coast in this regard, but a general idea of the fact may be gained. We may assume that the air at the sea level is practically saturated with moisture, or already at its dew-point, that in crossing the mountainous region the average height to which the air is carried is about 2000 metres (6560 feet), and that it descends to a level of about 700 metres (2296 feet) in the Peace River country. The loss of sensible heat on elevation would, in this case, amount to $10^\\circ$ C.\n\n* The figures are Dr. Hann's, quoted by Hoffmeyer in the Danish Geographical Society's Journal, and reproduced in Nature, August, 1877.\n(18\u00b0 F.), the gain on descent to the level of 700 metres to 13\u00b0 C. (23.4\u00b0 F.). The amount of heat lost by the air during its passage across the mountainous region, by radiation and contact with the snowy peaks, cannot be determined. It is of course much greater in winter than in summer, and depends also on the speed with which the current of air travels. Taking the mean summer temperature of the coast at about 12\u00b0 C. (54\u00b0 F.) and allowing several degrees for loss by radiation, it becomes easy to understand how the western prairies may be flooded with air nearly as warm as that of the coast, though it has travelled to them over a region comparatively cold.\n\nOwing to the great width of the mountain barrier, the main result is complicated by local details, regions of considerable precipitation occurring at each important mountain range, with subsidiary drier regions in the lee. The last of these regions of precipitation is that of the Rocky Mountain Range properly so-called. In descending from this, a further addition of heat is made to the air, which then flows down as a dry and warm current to the east.\n\nIn addition to the favourable climatic conditions indicated by the thermometer, the length of the day in summer in the higher northern latitudes favours the rapid and vigorous growth of vegetation, and takes the place to a certain extent of heat in this respect. This has been supposed to be the case from the luxuriant vegetation of some northern regions, but Alfonse de Candolle appears to have put the matter beyond doubt by subjecting it to direct experiment. In latitude 56\u00b0 which may be taken as representing the position of much of the Peace River country, sunrise on the 21st of June, occurs at 3h. 12m., sunset at 8h. 50m.; while six degrees further south, in latitude 50\u00b0, which may be assumed to represent Manitoba, sunrise occurs on the same day at 3h. 49m., sunset at 8h. 13m. The duration of sunlight is, in the first case, 17h. 38m.; in the second, 16h. 24m., or one hour and a quarter in excess in the northern locality. This excess of course decreases to zero at the spring and autumn equinoxes, and the difference is reversed in the winter.\n\nIn further illustration of this point, the following extracts from a note in the American Journal of Science, vol. xx., p. 74, may be cited:\n\n\"It is well understood that for a plant to complete its development and mature its seeds, a certain sum of heat is required, varying according to the species. It appears,\u2014as indeed might antecedently be expected,\u2014that we should rather say a certain amount of solar radiation; for light, to a certain extent, may replace temperature. This is shown in the effects of almost uninterrupted summer sunshine upon vegetation in high latitudes. According to Sch\u00fcbler of Christiana and others, barley ripens in eighty-nine days from the sowing in...\"\nFinland, while it requires one hundred days in the south of Sweden, though the latter enjoys a considerably higher temperature. A grain of wheat grown at nearly the sea level in Norway, or in lower latitudes, when propagated at high elevations or in a high latitude, will mature earlier, even although at a lower temperature; and it is said that, within limits compatible with its cultivation the grain increases in size and weight.\"\n\n\"Sch\u00e4beler also makes out that grain, after several generations of cultivation in the highest latitudes or the highest elevations compatible with its cultivation, will when transferred back to its original locality ripen earlier than grain which has not been moved. But it loses this precocity in a few generations, and the seeds gradually diminish to the former size and weight. Plants raised from seeds ripened in a high northern locality are hardier than those grown in the south, and are better able to resist excessive winter cold.\"\n\nA further circumstance giving to the Peace River country and that on the upper part of the Saskatchewan, other things being equal, a value as farming land acre for acre considerably greater than that of most parts of the North-west, is the immunity of this region from the visits of the devastating locust or grasshopper (Caloptenus spretus). I have elsewhere discussed the question of locust invasions, in several papers,* and it has since been taken up by the United States Entomological Commission.\u2020 It must suffice to state here, that while long series of years may pass without the occurrence of serious invasions, these must continue always, or at least for a very long time, to constitute a drawback to the whole territory lying south of a line drawn about sixty miles south of Edmonton, and thence nearly following the border of the wooded country southward and eastward to Manitoba.\n\nThe Athabasca River from Drift-pile Camp to Lesser Slave River.\n\nThe Athabasca River derives its name from the great lake into which it flows, which is called A-p\u00e9-pas-kow by the Crees. The upper part of the river is known as Mus-ta-hi-si-pi or Great River.\n\nOn reaching its north bank on our traverse from Sturgeon Lake, Mr. MacLeod and I had arranged to separate, Mr. MacLeod continuing on overland toward Dirt Lake, while I intended to make a canoe and descend the river. As no traces had yet been found of the party which was supposed to be on the way from Edmonton to meet us, we now set fire to a great pile of drift-logs on one of the bars, and sent one Indian\n\n* Canadian Naturalist, Vol. VIII., pp. 119, 207, 411.\n\u2020 First Annual Report, United States Entomological Commission, 1873.\nup and another down the river to seek for information, but all with no result. It was further unexpectedly found that no cottonwood trees suitable for making a canoe existed in the valley, and as the river was evidently quite unsuited to be descended on a raft, by reason of its swiftness and the number of shoal bars which occur now on one side and now on the other, it became difficult to know in what way the programme could be carried out. It was finally decided to use the canvass cargo-covers and blanket wrappings in the construction of a canoe.\n\nTo this all hands devoted themselves for three days, when we had the satisfaction of seeing a large canoe, properly framed and strengthened, which when painted over with a mixture of bacon fat and spruce gum was nearly water-tight. I had great difficulty in persuading our last Indian guide, Antoine, to accompany me down the river, which he was supposed to know something about having worked Hudson Bay boats on it many years ago. Having at last induced him by offers of good remuneration to accompany us, and having waited a day till he provided himself with a sufficient supply of moccasins for the return journey, we set out on our descent of the river on September 30th. Mr. MacLeod and I had previously divided the provisions still remaining, finding about twenty days supply for each party, which we hoped would be sufficient to carry us to Edmonton. Besides myself the occupants of the canoe were W. McNeil of Victoria, Antoine, a Cree Indian, with whom we could not converse, and his little son, about twelve years old.\n\nThe Athabasca River was formerly much used by the Hudson Bay Company as a route to Jasper House, and thence across the Rocky Mountains to the Boat Encampment on the Columbia, but is now abandoned as a trade route. Dr. Hector followed the upper part of the river from Old Fort Assineboine to Jasper House in January, 1859, and has given a sketch of it on the map accompanying Palliser's Report.\n\nFrom our starting point, Drift-pile Camp, a few miles above the mouth of Marsh Head Creek, to the mouth of McLeod River, the Athabasca valley probably averages two miles in width from rim to rim, and is from 300 to 400 feet in depth, though the banks become somewhat lower and retire further from the stream near its confluence with the McLeod. The river itself is generally wide, shallow and very rapid, spreading among numerous gravelly bars and small islands. Extensive flats occur at heights of six to forty feet above the river, but the soil on these is evidently poor and sandy, though improving considerably in the lower part of that portion of the river now described, where also the scrub pine is found less abundantly, its place being taken by cottonwood groves.

The flow of the river remains unchanged.\n\nSixty feet from the sudden side-ways deviation, the river bank rises sharply, 200 feet high, gradually sloping down over time into a gentle slope.\nsures of soft sandstone, shales and coals occur at intervals, and the sides of the valley though in general gently sloping and tree-clad, are occasionally steep and roughened by outcrops of sandstone. The floods on this part of the river seem seldom to rise higher than eight feet, and never to exceed ten.\n\nIn descending the river we were keeping a sharp lookout for traces of the party from Edmonton, and at length\u2014nearly twenty miles below Drift-pile Camp\u2014we noticed a newly blazed tree, and on landing found a note attached to it. This had been written by Mr. Brown, who stated that he had reached the river at this point on September 23rd, having travelled three days on foot from where they had left their horses in a region impassable from dense masses of fallen timber. Their supplies had also become exhausted, and it was intended to turn back at once for Edmonton. It was therefore fortunate that we had not depended at all on the Edmonton party for supplies or assistance.\n\nThe actual conflux of the McLeod River was not seen, as we passed it without notice among islands. We soon found that our guide had forgotten nearly all he had ever known about the river. East of the McLeod are some low hills which rise to 500 feet near the bank of the Athabasca, but are probably quite limited in extent. From this point to Old Fort Assineboine, a distance of thirty-three miles in a straight line, the river valley is on the whole narrower than before, and the banks lower, seldom seeming to exceed 200 feet in height. The river is characterized by the presence of numerous and large islands, which sometimes occupy nearly the whole width of the valley bottom, the stream spreading out and becoming very shoal. The current is at first rapid as before, but for some distance above Old Fort Assineboine is quite tranquil. The flats and flat land on the islands is in great part composed of fine silt and fairly well adapted for agriculture. About half the area of the flats is above the level of flood-water.\n\nOld Fort Assineboine has been abandoned for many years, and not long ago the ruins of the building were destroyed by fire. Its site is now marked by a few irregular heaps of stones and charred wood. The flat on which it was situated is on the left or north bank of the river and is extensive.\n\nSix miles beyond the site of Old Fort Assineboine, the river turns suddenly to a north-eastward course, in which it continues with little deviation to the mouth of the Lesser Slave River. The plateau forming the general level of the country, appears to have an elevation of about 200 feet above the river for some distance below the old fort, but gradually declines till it is not more than 100. The banks at the same time lose to a great extent their escarpment-like character, and form gentle slopes on each side, or rise from the river in successive low\nsteps. The flats bordering the river are now, too, much narrower. The current of the river is slack, probably not averaging three miles an hour, and though there are occasional little rapids, there seems to be nothing to prevent navigation by a stern-wheel steamer. The banks are chiefly wooded with poplar second-growth. A few tamarac (Larix Americana) trees were observed here and there, and our guide informed us that pretty extensive tamarac swamps lay, in some places, on both sides of the river away from its immediate course.\n\nPembina River. About half way from the old fort to the mouth of Lesser Slave River, the Pembina, or Mi-ni-pi-mi-nan-si-pli, joins from the right. It is about 150 feet only in width at the mouth, but deep, and filled with clear brown water, very different in appearance from the muddy flood of the Athabasca.\n\nLesser Slave River and Lake.\n\nOn arriving at the mouth of Lesser Slave River, on October 6th, I found a note which the Rev. Mr. Gordon had left there nearly a month previously, when on his way in the Hudson Bay boat to Athabasca Landing. I was anxious to hurry on to the Landing, as I was already late for my appointment with Mr. McConnell, and our canvas canoe was very poorly adapted for working up such a stream as the Lesser Slave. Finding however from Mr. Gordon's note that none of the parties from the east had reached this point, it became evident that a running survey of the Lesser Slave, and latitude of the outlet of the lake, would be necessary to fill the gap in the exploration of a route for railway purposes. We therefore applied ourselves to the task of ascending the river, which after four days of arduous labour, in cold stormy weather, we accomplished. The river, from its mouth to the lake, is about forty-one miles in length and very crooked. For eighteen miles from the mouth it forms a succession of rapids, which are shallow and stony. Of these there are about twenty in all. Above this the stream is tranquil, though still exceedingly crooked, and flows at the rate of about 1'7 miles an hour. In width the stream decreases from an average of about 200 feet on its lower part to 100 or even less in its upper. The banks near the mouth are about eighty feet high, and each convex bend of the river here forms a scarped slope, while the opposite side presents a flat, or series of low terraces often lightly wooded, but sometimes open and covered with fine grass. In ascending the stream the banks decrease in elevation, till near the lake they scarcely rise above the water level, and broad swamps with fine grass spread widely in all directions, and would afford vast quantities of excellent natural hay. The soil on the flats along the river is generally good, but these are quite inconsiderable in area. That of the general\nsurface of the country seems, however, to be equally good, though wide swampy areas are reported at a little distance back from the river. The character of the deposits shown in the banks indicates that Lesser Slave Lake has at one time spread much more widely, but that the rim of the basin containing it has been gradually cut through by the Slave Lake River. Ice marks produced in the spring floods were observed at a height of fifteen feet above the low water level on the lower part of the river.\n\nNear Lesser Slave Lake, the river makes a loop several miles in circuit, to avoid which a portage of sixty-three yards may be made, across a neck of low ground.\n\nLesser Slave Lake is called A-yi-ti-i-noo Sa-ga-he-gun by the Crees, and but imperfectly translated by the English name. A-yi-ti-i-noo means a foreign Indian, and though here referring to some story connected with the Chepewayans to the north-east, is also used to designate the Blackfeet and other tribes by the southern Crees. The lake is a great expanse of water about seventy miles in extreme length, by fourteen miles in greatest width. It is evidently shoal throughout, and I was informed that there are only two places where the water is deep along shore. At the east end is a hard flat sandy beach, with sand ridges and low dunes behind it. The lake is bounded by high hilly country, at no great distance both to the north and south. The name of the highest point of the hills or ridge to the north was given to me as Raspberry Mountain. Those to the south are generally flat-topped, and resemble the remnants of a higher plateau, most of which has been removed by denudation. They probably average 500 to 600 feet in height above the lake, and may reach 1000 feet in some places. Additional particulars with regard to the lake will be found in Mr. McConnell's report. I had hoped to obtain photographs and sketches of it, but after waiting in a very uncomfortable camp during the afternoon of October 10th and morning of the 11th, with no abatement in the storm of wind with flurries of snow, which had begun on our arrival, decided to set out on our return. On the 12th we ran all the rapids safely, in a blinding snow storm, and camped early in the afternoon on the Athabasca, as the air was too full of snow to allow me to take bearings from point to point on the river.\n\nAt the date of our visit the whole vicinity of Slave Lake was populous with wild fowl on their way southward\u2014ducks of several species, geese, cranes and swans.\nATHABASCA RIVER FROM LESSER SLAVE RIVER TO ATHABASCA LANDING.\n\nFrom the mouth of the Lesser Slave River to Athabasca Landing, the Athabasca flows first for some miles to the north of east, and then takes a south-south-eastward course to the Landing. The distance by the river, which is here flexuous but not very crooked, is sixty-three miles. A rounded hill or ridge about three hundred feet high stands at the junction of the Lesser Slave and Athabasca Rivers, but the general level of the plateau for some distance below appears not to exceed two hundred feet. It gradually increases, however, till it reaches a height of 350 feet at the Landing. The current of the river probably averages about two miles an hour throughout, and there are several little rapids, where it spreads pretty widely and becomes somewhat shoal. All these might, however, I believe, be surmounted by a stern-wheel steamer at high water. No rock exposures are seen, and only occasional slides, most of which are of old date and show little appearance of recent movement. The flats are generally narrow and pass at a short distance from the water's edge into the slopes of the valley. These are almost everywhere light, seldom exceeding 15\u00b0 and often about 10\u00b0 only. No hills rising above the general level of the plateau were seen in any direction.\n\nIn its aspect as a possible railway route, the following points may be noted of the country between Slave Lake and Athabasca Landing. From Slave Lake, which appears to present every facility for the passage of a railway along either shore, the best line would follow the south side of the Lesser Slave River, not in the immediate valley, but on the edge of the plateau bordering it. At the mouth of the river, the Athabasca might be crossed by a bridge 760 feet long and about forty feet high, with excellent approaches. From this point it would probably be best to follow the right side of the Athabasca valley, notwithstanding its somewhat sinuous course, to the Landing, when the summit of the plateau could be gained without difficulty by the valley of the Tow-ti-now-si-pi, which enters there. The bank of the Athabasca, as indicated by the description previously given, is favourable, and no heavy slides occur in this portion of its length. A line taking the north bank of the river would have to cross the Lesser Slave River near its mouth, with a bridge of 150 to 200 feet long, and might cross to the south side of the Athabasca at the Landing, with a bridge of 912 feet, with good approaches. Owing to the uniform character of the banks of the valley, it would also be possible to gain the level of the plateau without necessitating very heavy work, at several intermediate points.\n\nThe character of the plateau lying immediately south of the Athabasca is probably favourable, and there are few streams of any size.\njoining the river in this part of its course. An extensive view from the highest point of the plateau above the Landing shows a nearly level horizon in every direction, its uniformity being broken only by a few low ridges many miles distant.\n\nA railway line from Lesser Slave Lake to Lac La Biche could be made more direct, by cutting across the V-shaped bend of the Athabasca which has its apex at the Landing. No impediments to such a line in the way of hills or high ground were seen, either from the banks above the mouth of Lesser Slave River or from the point at the Landing just referred to. The Moose River joins the Lesser Slave thirteen and a half miles from its mouth, coming from the eastward, and appears to be a sluggish stream about eighty feet wide. I was informed by Indians that this river can be ascended in small canoes, numerous portages being necessary on account of jams of drift-wood. A portage of about two \"spells,\" (say two miles) leads then over low ground to the Calling River, by which one may descend to the Athabasca, reaching it some miles below the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re La Biche. There is also a trail by which the Indians take horses from the east end of Lesser Slave Lake to the Athabasca, near the point just indicated; and it is said, that from points near the Rivi\u00e8re La Biche the Raspberry Mountain, on the north shore of Lesser Slave Lake, may be seen, the intervening country being all comparatively low. A reference to Mr. McConnell's report on the Athabasca below the Landing, will show that it runs westward for some miles below the entrance of the Rivi\u00e8re La Biche, and affords facilities for the descent of a railway line to the river level which would probably render it unnecessary to follow the Calling River down to its mouth.\n\nATHABASCA LANDING TO EDMONTON.\n\nOn arriving at Athabasca Landing, on October 14th, I found that Mr. McConnell with the pack animals had been waiting there some days. To reach the Landing he had been obliged to go from the east end of Lesser Slave Lake to Old Fort Assineboine, and then to Edmonton. The weather was now cold and wintry, with several inches of soft snow on the ground, and the time appointed for the rendezvous at Edmonton at hand, while the practicability of the Rivi\u00e8re La Biche or Wa-was-ke-soo-si-pi for railway purposes, remained to be determined. We were so fortunate as to find a free-trader at the Landing, with a boat, about to set out on his last trip to Lesser Slave Lake with goods, and from him were able to purchase a small bark canoe, with which we were assured the ascent of the Rivi\u00e8re La Biche might be accomplished. The canvas canoe was left in a shed belonging to the Hudson Bay Company, and on the 15th Mr. McConnell, with a half-breed named\nAdam Caillon, left the Landing to descend the Athabasca, ascend the Rivi\u00e8re La Biche, and make the best of his way to Victoria or Edmonton after reaching the Lac La Biche settlement. No time was to be lost, as the small river might now at any time become partly choked with ice and impassible for the canoe. The weather turning clear and cold on the night of the 15th, enabled me to obtain observations for latitude, and on the morning of the 16th I set out for Edmonton with the pack animals.\n\nFrom Edmonton to the Athabasca Landing the Hudson Bay Company has constructed a rough cart-road to facilitate the transport of their goods toward Lesser Slave Lake and Peace River. Edmonton is nearly due south of the Landing, at a distance of eighty-three miles in a straight line, or about ninety-six miles by odometer.\n\nOn leaving the Landing the trail to Edmonton follows the Tow-ti-now si-pi southward for about thirty-two miles. Eight miles further on the road crosses a shallow creek which unites the Bridge Lakes. The valley of the Tow-ti-now runs nearly direct, and is wide and deep, though the sides are often a little lumpy and irregular. With the exception of limited areas in the valley, the whole country has been burnt over, and is strewn with logs, among which shrubby second-growth is appearing. Fine grass and pea-vine appears everywhere, and the country would be a good grazing one, though the soil is generally sandy, and on the plateau there are numerous boulders, often packed closely together, and generally of Laurentian origin. Fairly good soil is seen in a few spots. The surface of the plateau shows a tendency to arrangement in north and south trending ridges, parallel in a general way to the valley of the stream. The Banksian pine is now found in abundance, replacing the western scrub pine. It is much less symmetrical in habit of growth than the latter, with more numerous and diffuse branches and a thicker and rougher bark.\n\nFrom Bridge Lakes, with an approximate elevation of 2415 feet, the road gradually ascends, and in a few miles crosses the watershed between the streams flowing direct to the Arctic Ocean and those going to Hudson Bay. This does not rise much above the general level, having an altitude of about 2485 feet, and though resembling a range of low hills from a distance, is found on approach to have very light slopes. It is an undulating sandy tract of country which has probably been shaped by currents during a general submergence, and shows a tendency to the arrangement of its features in a north-west and south-east bearing. It is lightly wooded with Banksian pine and poplar. A small brook soon leads to the Vermilion River or Wi-a-min-si-pi of the Crees, which occupies a wide shallow valley and is a sluggish winding stream about thirty-five feet in width. Its approximate elevation is 2105 feet.\nSouth of the Vermilion the trail crosses an indistinct low undulating watershed, and passing Long Lake follows the stream which flows from it to the Sturgeon River. South of the Vermilion the country assumes a distinctly prairie aspect. The surface is covered with short close grasses, and groves of willow and poplar are chiefly confined to the valleys. Many old buffalo trails and wallows appear, and a few scattered buffalo bones were observed, though no traces of this animal were noticed north of the Vermilion. This prairie has probably been produced by fire, but is of much older date than the grassy country to the north, which is still in process of denudation by successive fires. The land between the Vermilion and the Sturgeon is of fairly good quality with a great admixture of vegetable mould.\n\nThe Sturgeon River also occupies a wide shallow valley, but is a much larger stream than the Vermilion, averaging sixty feet wide by one deep. In Cree the Sturgeon is called Mi-koo-ki-pow-si-pi, or Red Willow River. The surface from the Sturgeon to the Saskatchewan may be described as a gently undulating prairie of uniform fertility, with a deep black loamy soil, yet light enough to be warm and easily worked. Belts of aspen with coppice of willows vary the monotony, and occasional swamps with fine natural hay occur. The surface declines gradually toward the Saskatchewan valley. Where crops have been tried, wonderfully favourable returns have been obtained.\n\nEdmonton and its vicinity having been frequently noticed by previous travellers, and its lignite coal deposits described by Mr. Selwyn* and Dr. Hector, it will not be necessary to speak of it here. It may be stated, however, that on this part of the Saskatchewan there lies an extensive region of very great fertility, in which settlement is already advancing, and which possesses all the elements necessary to enable it to become, at some not very distant date, a populous province of the Dominion.\n\nEdmonton constituted the terminal point of our surveys for the season. Mr. MacLeod arrived by land from the Upper Athabasca on the same day that I reached the Fort from the Landing. We were now joined also by Mr. Tupper's party, which had fallen back on Edmonton after their unsuccessful attempt to meet us. After a few days spent in making the necessary arrangements and selecting the strongest of the animals, we set out, on October 25th, on our journey of 900 miles to Winnipeg. The combined parties now numbered fifteen men, thirty-four horses and mules, eight Red River carts and two buck-boards. At Duck Lake, on November 12th, the carts were exchanged for flat-sleds, a heavy fall of snow having taken place, and on the 2nd of December,\n\n*Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1873-74.\nafter a wintry journey of thirty-eight days across the plains, we were glad to find ourselves at Winnipeg and again within hearing of a railway whistle.\n\n**Description of the Country from the Confluence of the Smoky and Peace Rivers, by the North Side of Lesser Slave Lake, to Old Fort Assineboine and Edmonton.**\n\nThe report by Mr. McConnell\u2014whose efficient assistance I must not omit to acknowledge\u2014on the country north of Dunvegan to Battle River, has already been given in connection with that part of the Peace River district. His description of the country round the north side of Lesser Slave Lake and thence to Old Fort Assineboine and Edmonton, also of part of the Athabasca, the Rivi\u00e8re and Lac La Biche, and trail thence to Victoria, are here attached, as completing the information on the eastern portion of the area covered by our explorations. Mr. McConnell's notes cover, in addition to the general features of the country, such observations on its geology as he was able to make.\n\nMr. Cambie having passed over that part of the country lying between Peace River and Lesser Slave Lake, and having described it in his report to Mr. Sandford Fleming, it will only be necessary for me in this place to give a very brief description of its general characteristics. Between those two points a very good road has been constructed by the Hudson Bay Company, and passing along this, and forming an opinion of the country merely from that small portion seen from the trail in a thickly wooded region, one might, without hesitation, set down nearly the entire district as eminently adapted for agricultural purposes, as in the whole distance from Peace River to Lesser Slave Lake there is not over five miles, out of a total of sixty-five, of swamp or muskeg; the remainder of the distance being either covered with a growth of aspens, usually of small size, or open prairie land, and the soil being composed of a fine silt, topped with a covering of black mould of variable thickness. Such a conclusion would, however, be very apt to be erroneous, as the country through which a road passes is very far from being a safe guide as to the character of any large section at any distance from it. The roads are usually marked out by Indians intimately acquainted with the country, and are, as a matter of course, carried through the most favourable part of it. In regard to this particular road, Mr. Young, in charge of the Hudson Bay post at the lake, informed me that they had very great difficulty indeed in laying it out on firm ground, and in avoiding the numerous muskegs, and according to him it follows a ridge the greater part of the way,\nwith very swampy land on either side of it. But be that as it may, there must be a large proportion of that country capable of being used for agricultural purposes, as besides the firm land, much of the swampy part could very easily be drained.\n\nThe approximate elevation of the watershed between Peace River and Lesser Slave Lake is 2430 feet.\n\nFor several miles before reaching the lake, the trailled through a luxuriant growth of wild hay three to four feet high and exceedingly thick. This belt appeared to run round to the south of the lake; on the north, the aspen bush extends right down to the water's edge.\n\nThe first part of Lesser Slave Lake seen, coming from the west, is a large bay about five miles from north to south by three from east to west. This bay receives two rather large streams\u2014Salt Creek, coming from the north, about fifty feet wide by a foot and a half deep, and Heart Creek, coming from the east, and being a little larger. The Hudson Bay Company's post is situated on the eastern side of this bay, facing an island about half a mile in width, which extends right across the bay from east to west, leaving only a narrow channel of about one hundred yards wide between it and the mainland. This island in low water is about two feet only above the surface of the lake, and in high water is completely covered. The bay itself is very shallow, in low water being scarcely over two feet deep anywhere. Proceeding southward, this bay, about four miles from the point where we first reach it, narrows down to about a quarter of a mile in width, and turning directly eastward, continues so for about two miles, when the lake again widens out into another bay about four miles from east to west and three from north to south. It next narrows again until it is only about a mile wide, and then widens out into the main portion of the lake.\n\nLesser Slave Lake is about seventy miles long, and lies almost directly east and west. For about thirty miles from the narrows last mentioned, it maintains an average width of from seven to nine miles, then after narrowing again to about three miles in width, it suddenly widens out into a deep bay fully fifteen miles in width, forming the lower end of the lake.\n\nBesides the large bay, just mentioned, at the lower end of the lake, the coast line of which also contains a number of smaller bays, the northern shore of the lake is indented all along its course with shallow bays, varying from one to seven miles from point to point, and very seldom over a mile deep. All along the western and northern sides of these bays, the beach is thickly covered with a mixture of gneissic, sandstone and limestone boulders, while along the eastern side it is a hard sand bank, the sand being probably piled up...\nby the prevalent west winds. Along the southern side of the lake, the coast seemed to be pretty regular and to be marshy all the way.\n\nThere is only one island in the main lake, and that a very small one, situated at the lower end opposite Lesser Slave River, and distant from it about two and a half miles. Harborage on the lake is also very scarce, there being hardly any place where a boat can obtain shelter, save by running down the entire length of the lake and getting into the river or into the lee of the small island mentioned before. Storms on the lake are also very sudden, the principal ones coming from the west.\n\nLesser Slave Lake receives from the north, besides those already mentioned, four tolerably large streams, from thirty to fifty feet wide, and also a number of smaller ones. Of the two largest of these, one called the Narrows River, falls into the lake opposite the narrows, the other at the large bay at the lower end of the lake. From the south, three or four streams fall into the lake.\n\nLooking from the northern side of the lake, a range of hills appears to run all along its southern shore, but at some distance from it, the land between the hills and the lake being marshy. The furthest of these hills seemed to be from twenty to thirty miles distant, the nearest from ten to fifteen. The principal one is a large flat-topped hill opposite the middle of the lake, but distant from it about twenty-five miles, and probably over one thousand feet high, other hills lying between it and the lake are much lower. Westward they diminish in size till they terminate in a low ridge running round the bay at the upper end of the lake. Along the northern side of the lake, coming from the west, a low ridge about one hundred and fifty feet high follows parallel with it for some distance and then dies away, and the country remains flat till the bay at the lower end of the lake is reached, where a rise in the land of about six hundred feet takes place, forming Raspberry Mountain, which runs round the eastern side of the bay and then stretches eastward. East of the lake, the land is a low marsh, covered with wild hay, along with alder and willow bushes, but separated from the lake by a bank of sand over thirty feet high, probably piled up by ice action.\n\nWhile waiting for a guide at the west end of the lake, I rode out about twenty-five miles in the direction of White-fish Lake, in order to obtain some idea of the character of the country bordering the lake on the north. For the first ten miles after leaving the lake, near the mouth of Salt Creek, and proceeding in a north-easterly direction, by compass, the trail leads partly through open prairie and partly through aspen bush. The country is rolling, the hollows usually swampy, and the soil on the higher ground tolerably good, but from the\ntrail large muskegs, wholly worthless, could be seen on either side. The trail appears to wind along a ridge and so to show more good land than would appear on a line drawn at random.\n\nFor the next ten miles the country is much more wooded, the trees consisting principally of aspens, with some spruce, and the proportion of swampy land being very evidently on the increase, until at about twenty miles it culminates in what is known as the Grand Muskeg, a belt of land ten to twelve miles wide and wholly occupied by swamps. Into this we carefully picked our way about four miles and then returned.\n\nAfter passing through the Grand Muskeg, the country improves somewhat, so I was informed, but still remains swampy till White-fish Lake is reached. This sheet of water is about six miles long by three wide, and lies, according to one account, directly north of the west end of Lesser Slave Lake, but according to another statement north-east from that point. Around this lake there is a small area of good land and a little gardening is done.\n\nTaking this district as a whole, and judging both from what I saw and from what I was told, the country north of Lesser Slave Lake, with the exception of that around the upper end of it, is of very little value, large muskegs and swamps caused principally by beaver-dams and separated from one another by small aspen ridges, occupying nearly the whole of it. Merely to give some idea of its character I may say that the various fur traders took out of that country alone, over twelve thousand beaver skins in 1878.\n\nThe climate at Lesser Slave Lake appears to compare favourably with that in other parts of the North-west. The snow-fall is not heavy, horses experiencing little difficulty in supporting themselves through the winter. Early frosts appear to give but little trouble here. In Mr. Young's garden the potato tops were quite green when I was there on the 15th of September, although previous to this they had been destroyed at Dunvegan, and when I arrived at Edmonton several days later, I found them cut down there also. Around the bay at the upper end of the lake, there are quite a number of small houses built by half-breeds, with little patches of ground fenced in, but not much gardening is done, as the people depend principally for their food on the wild fowl, which pass over the lake in immense flocks in the fall, and on the white fish with which the lake abounds.\n\nFrom Lesser Slave Lake I had the choice of three routes by which to reach Edmonton, viz.: To go by the old Hudson Bay Company's trail south of the lake, which was reported to be in a comparatively good condition owing to the dryness of the season; to leave the animals at Lesser Slave Lake and go down by water; or, as a third alternative,\nMr. Young pointed out that I might possibly be able, by waiting till the arrival of their boats, which they expected hourly, to get a guide to take me along the north side of the lake, then down to Old Fort Assineboine by a trail which had not been used for some years. As this latter plan held out the inducement of traversing new ground, I determined to adopt it; and on the guide coming in, two or three days later and reporting himself willing to accompany us, we set out at once. Leaving the Hudson Bay Company's post about noon on the 17th of September, on the 19th we arrived at the mouth of Lesser Slave River, travelling on the beach\u2014nearly all the way, though sometimes in the bush, and occasionally in the lake itself, the great number of boulders on the beach causing travelling on it to be very slow and toilsome.\n\nThe country around Lesser Slave Lake presents very few interesting geological features. Although slides of from ten to thirty feet high occur at intervals along the lake, at no point do they show any rock sections, consisting principally of hardened greyish clays, probably post-tertiary. In some places they are sandy. Stratified rock was observed at one point only, viz., just before entering the deep bay mentioned as existing at the lower end of the lake, where a few small outcrops occur at the water level. These consist of a very argillaceous limestone, which weathers yellow, and is nearly all concreted into round masses cemented together by peroxide of iron. Several of these masses were broken up for the purpose of seeing if they contained fossils, but the search was unsuccessful. The boulders which so thickly strew the beach along its entire course, consist mainly of gneiss and other Laurentian rocks, with, however, a considerable proportion of a whitish, moderately fine-grained sandstone, well rounded; also some angular masses darker in colour and coarser in texture, and a considerable proportion of a light greyish saccharoidal limestone, which, like the sandstone, appeared to be unfossiliferous. A stream about thirty feet wide, which falls into the lake near its lower end, brings down a considerable amount of a very fair kind of lignite, which from its rounded condition appears to have been brought from some distance.\n\nLeaving Lesser Slave Lake at its outlet, we set out in a southerly direction for Old Fort Assineboine, on the Athabasca. For a short distance from the lake, the ground is marshy, but gradually became firmer as we advanced, opening out into a beautiful prairie several miles in width, covered with a heavy growth of wild hay and pea-vine. About six miles from the lake, a range of hills, stretching eastward and westward, is reached. At the foot of this we crossed a stream about twenty-five feet wide, apparently descending from the hills, and emptying into Lesser Slave Lake. Ascending this range, it was found to be about eight hundred feet high, the ascent being made in about\nthree miles. This range of hills is about fifteen miles in width, the southern descent being extremely easy, and being of course less than the northern by the height of the plateau, which is about three hundred and fifty feet above the level of the lake. The summit is a complete network of aspen ridges, running in every direction, and separated by wide muskegs. Eight of these were crossed, the largest being over two miles in width. It was with the greatest difficulty that we succeeded in getting the mules across some of these swamps, even after their loads had been removed and packed across, either on the horses or by ourselves. This part of the country is of the most worthless description, the very small amount of good land being separated by such wide stretches of bad, as to become valueless.\n\nAt the highest point of this range that we reached, the barometer read 27-45, while at the level of the lake it read 28-2, thus indicating a difference of 735 feet.\n\nDescending from this point about four hundred feet, we reached and crossed a large spruce swamp, and then passed over another ridge about two hundred feet high, finding at the foot of it a large rapid stream about one hundred feet in width, called by the Indians Tow-i-now-si-pi. After crossing this stream the country still continued for several miles much broken up by swamps and muskegs, until a low ridge running east and west was reached, which marked the beginning of quite an extensive area of good land, through the centre of which flows a large stream about seventy-five feet wide, called A-kew-i-new-si-pi. This is joined, about a mile below the point where we crossed it, by a second stream about fifty feet wide, called W\u00e9-men-si-pi-s\u00eds, the united streams continuing to bear the name of the larger one. These streams run each in a beautiful valley about a mile in width, the country for several miles on either side being exceedingly fertile. Near the stream the country is almost entirely open, being merely dotted here and there with clumps of willow, but away from it it becomes densely wooded with a growth of small aspens.\n\nThrough this aspen bush we travelled for about seven miles, a glimpse from a slight elevation revealing the same general character of country extending indefinitely eastward.\n\nSeveral barometer readings taken here averaged 23-00, indicating a height of 1880 feet.\n\nAbout ten miles from the A-kew-i-new-si-pi the country again changed for the worse, and now became a mere succession of wide muskegs. These seemed to increase in the direction of the Athabasca River, but to diminish somewhat to the west. This style of country continues till the valley of the Clearwater is reached, where we joined the Hudson Bay Company's trail which comes down south of the lake.\nThis we then followed to Old Fort Assineboine and thence to Edmonton.\n\nThe Clearwater is a stream fifty feet wide by a foot deep flowing in a very fine valley about two miles wide.\n\nFrom the Clearwater to the Athabasca, a distance of about fourteen miles, the country consists entirely of sandy ridges and knolls covered with scrub pine, interspersed with numerous swamps, and without any value whatever. Indeed, from the outlet of Lesser Slave Lake to Old Fort Assineboine on the Athabasca, a distance of about sixty miles, the amount of land passed over fit for agricultural purposes is very inconsiderable, consisting probably of less than one-third of the total area. Between Clearwater and the Athabasca, three small streams were crossed, each from thirty to forty feet wide, and flowing into the Athabasca.\n\nThe Athabasca, where we crossed it, has a valley about four hundred feet deep and about two miles wide, and is itself about two hundred and fifty yards across.\n\nFor several miles after crossing it, the country, though a great improvement on that north of the river, is yet far from good, the soil being a light coloured gravelly silt, with a very thin covering of mould, and broken up by numerous swamps and marshes. About seven miles from the river, however, it improves considerably and becomes fit for settlement, and continues good all the rest of the way in to Edmonton. About twenty-five miles from the Athabasca, Paddle River was crossed, a stream about 100 feet wide by two feet deep, with a bed filled with Laurentian boulders. This stream is a tributary of the Pembina. Between Paddle River and the Athabasca the greater part of the country is very heavily timbered, principally with spruce, aspen and cottonwood, all very large, some of the spruce being over three feet in diameter. The proximity of this timber to the splendid prairie lands around Edmonton must render it in time very valuable. After crossing Paddle River, a ride of eight miles over a beautiful prairie country brings us to the Pembina, a stream about 100 yards wide in low water, with an average depth of about two feet. Its flood banks are about 150 yards apart, and ten to fifteen feet in height, and consist principally of clay. The river bed, where we crossed it, is composed of a fine sand. After crossing the Pembina the country is somewhat hilly, but gradually becomes less so till Lac la Nonne is reached, where it is only slightly rolling. The country around this lake is very fertile, though but little farming is done as yet. After leaving Lac la Nonne, the trail for several miles again passes through a thick bush, but the trees are very small and valueless, except for fencing or firewood. Passing through this, we soon cross the watershed between the Athabasca and\n\nthe Red River, and the trail runs along the edge of the prairie, the line of the river being visible for many miles. We came to a point where the trail turned off to the west, and the river was being followed by a road which had been made by the Indians with poles and brushwood, and which was now worn down to a small path.\n\nDescription of the Athabasca Valley.\n\nWe came to a point where the river was very narrow, and the expanse of prairie on either side was very extensive. There was little timber, and the soil was sandy and gravelly. The most important feature of the valley was the presence of a well-developed forest of spruce and aspen, which extended for many miles far and wide. The soil was not very fertile, consisting mainly of sandy loam, with occasional patches of peat. The trees were of various kinds, including spruce, aspen, birch, and willow. The river was at this point very narrow, with a rocky bottom, and the banks lying close together. The prairie on either side was extensive, and the river was surrounded by a dense growth of shrubs and vegetation, just as it appeared when first seen.\n\nLeaving the Athabasca, we came to a point where the river bank was very steep, and the river was very narrow. We came to La Barre, a small settlement, and remained there for several days, seven of our party being sick. We came to the conclusion that we judged it best to turn back.\n\nNow, as we have already mentioned, the river flows in a northerly direction, and we came to a point where it turns sharply to the south-west. We came to a point where the river falls into a deep ravine, and we turned back, following the trail down the ravine. We came to a point where the trail turned further to the south-west, and we continued on this course until we came to a point where the trail turned back to the north-east, crossing the river once more.\n\nFrom this point onwards, the trail ran along the edge of the northern prairie, and we came to a point where the trail turned to the south-west. We came to a point where the trail turned to the north-west, and we continued on this course until we came to a point where the trail turned back to the north-east, crossing the river once more.\n\nWatershed and edge of prairie.\nthe Saskatchewan, and almost simultaneously reach the southern limit of the true forest and emerge on the open prairie. From this point on to Edmonton, the country is of the most fertile description, being a beautiful, slightly undulating prairie, almost destitute of trees, with numerous small lakelets in the depressions, and watered by several small streams of good water.\n\n**Description of the Athabasca from the 'Landing' to Rivi\u00e8re la Biche, and of the country thence to Victoria on the Saskatchewan.**\n\nWhile waiting at Athabasca Landing I made several attempts to explore the country to the east and west of that place, but with very little success. Owing to the character of the country it was utterly impossible to take animals through it, but on foot, I succeeded in penetrating it for a distance of several miles on either side of the trail. As far as I went I found the land to be almost entirely worthless. Where not occupied by muskegs, the soil consists of a light coloured mixture of sand and clay, covered with a thin layer of black mould of an inferior kind; and according to the account of a half-breed trader whom I met at the Landing, this description might apply to the whole country lying between the trail and Rivi\u00e8re and Lac la Biche, excepting only the land in the immediate vicinity of the lake itself. In this opinion, judging from the parts of it which I examined, I fully concur.\n\nLeaving the Landing about mid-day on the 15th of October, in a birch bark canoe, with a single half-breed, I came to the mouth of Rivi\u00e8re La Biche about ten o'clock the next morning, having travelled about seven and a half hours. Assuming our rate at five miles an hour, I judged that we had come about thirty-seven miles.\n\nNot seeing any appearance of Calling River, which was reported to fall into the Athabasca nearly opposite, I decided to go still further down the river to look for it, but after paddling down about six miles further, we returned, not having seen the river, but having ascertained that it was too far removed from Rivi\u00e8re La Biche to be of service in crossing the Athabasca with a railway line at this point.\n\nFrom the Landing to Rivi\u00e8re La Biche, the river runs in a general north-easterly direction. It is at first somewhat tortuous, with riffles at intervals, but about ten miles from the Landing it widens out considerably, has a gentler current, and shows straight reaches of several miles in length. Approaching Rivi\u00e8re La Biche it again becomes narrow, and bends to the north-west, and still further on nearly west, but where I turned back it was again apparently trending round to the north. The valley presents a nearly uniform character throughout, ranging in width from one to two miles, while the river winding from one side of it to the other, causes the flat which forms the bottom, and which varies\nin width from one-eighth to one-half a mile, to alternate from one side of the stream to the other. About ten miles above Rivi\u00e8re La Biche, the slopes of the valley, which before were moderately steep, become much gentler, but further down they again become more abrupt, and narrow in the valley so much that at Rivi\u00e8re La Biche it is not, from one edge of the plateau to the other, over three quarters of a mile.\n\nNo rock sections were seen between the Landing and Rivi\u00e8re La Biche, although old slides occur at intervals, and no stream of any size falls into the Athabasca between these two points. A rather singular fact is the decrease in the height of the plateau, this being at the Landing about three hundred and fifty feet above the river, while at Rivi\u00e8re La Biche it is only two hundred.\n\nAlthough we had set out with the intention of ascending Rivi\u00e8re La Biche in the canoe, this was found to be utterly impossible owing to the shallowness of the water, and the strength of the current, poling, paddling or tracking being out of the question in such a stream. The only way in which we made any progress at all was by the half-breed wading in the water and pulling the canoe up after him by the bow, but after nearly a day of this kind of work, finding ourselves less than half a mile from the Athabasca, with the stream apparently getting worse instead of better as we ascended, with three holes broken in the bottom of our canoe, and all our gum expended in the vain attempt to patch them, I decided on abandoning what remained of the canoe, and sent the man on to the Hudson Bay Company's post for a cart.\n\nThere is a tolerably good cart road from the mouth of Rivi\u00e8re La Biche to the lake, cut out by a Catholic religious institution at Lac La Biche, for the purpose of getting supplies down to the Athabasca, and thence on to some of their distant missions. Rivi\u00e8re La Biche is the outlet of Lac La Biche, and is about one hundred feet wide at its mouth, but very shallow, not averaging over six to eight inches in depth. It is exceedingly rapid, and its bed is filled with boulders, principally Laurentian, but also with a small proportion of sandstone and limestone. It is very crooked, and although the distance from the lake in a straight line cannot be over fourteen miles, the river must be fully three times that length, making two great bends to the south and one to the north, besides a multitude of smaller ones from one side of its valley to the other. While the valley of Rivi\u00e8re La Biche is from one quarter to one half a mile wide near its mouth, and two hundred feet deep, after ascending it about fifteen miles it is not over fifty feet deep, showing that the river falls in that distance about 150 feet. From this point on to the lake, it is larger, straighter and has much gentler current. The cart road follows the river all the way notwithstanding its tortuous course, it being impossible to carry it straight across the\ncountry owing to the numerous muskegs. Leaving the Athabasca, the road passes for about five miles through an aspen bush, where a slight elevation occurring, I endeavored from its summit to obtain a view of Raspberry Mountain, which was reported to be visible from this point, but was unable to distinguish it. Looking towards Athabasca Landing, the country appeared to be almost level, and to present a mere succession of low aspen ridges and muskegs. On descending this elevation a large swamp was found at the foot of it. A narrow strip of good land follows the river, and explains why the road hugs it so closely, but looking away from the river, the country appears to be a mere worthless mass of muskegs, the good land intervening being of too small extent to be of any value. On approaching the lake, which we do through an aspen bush, the land improves very much, and in the last five or six miles is of excellent quality.\n\nLac La Biche lies nearly magnetic east and west, and is about fifteen miles in length and four to five in breadth. Near its centre, the western coast line, running in a north-easterly direction for about three miles, narrows it down to less than two miles, then turning south-easterly, again increases the width to over five miles. The shores of the lake, wherever I saw them, appeared to be sandy, and to shelve down gradually, although on the opposite side several bluffs from thirty to fifty feet high were seen, which appeared to be of sand. Three streams, each about twenty feet wide, fall into Lac La Biche from the south-west.\n\nThere is a Roman Catholic mission at Lac La Biche, and its effect is found in the number of small wooden houses, and patches of land fenced in, which are seen nearly all round the lake. Although these patches are usually small in themselves, yet in the aggregate they amount to a considerable area. From the stubble I judged that the crops must have been very good, although I could obtain no statistics on this point, owing to the inhabitants being all away engaged in the fisheries.\n\nThe land around Lac La Biche, although not equal to that in the vicinity of Edmonton, is yet very good. It appears to rise from the lake to a height of about one hundred feet in two or three miles, is rather rough, and, looking up the slope, seems to be dotted here and there with muskegs. The tops of some of the higher rolls were also observed to be gravelly. Still, by far the greater part of the land lying around the lake is fairly good, and will no doubt some day be largely settled.\n\nFrom Lac La Biche a good cart road leads to Victoria. This first runs in a south-easterly direction to White-fish Lake, distant from Lac La Biche about thirty miles, and passes through open country.\nnearly all the way, with the exception of a few miles of aspen bush passed through shortly after leaving the lake. In this section of country, though muskegs occasionally occur, they are not frequent, and will not interfere much with its cultivation, though its hilly nature will lessen its value somewhat for agricultural purposes. A peculiar feature of this country is the number of small lakes which are scattered through it, each being depressed below the plateau level from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet.\n\nAbout twenty miles from the lake, Little Beaver River is crossed, a stream about seventy-five feet wide, with a valley about one hundred feet deep. The bed of the stream is full of boulders. About four miles further on we reach Big Beaver River. Judging from the proximity of these two streams, and the direction in which they are flowing, they must unite within three or four miles from the point where the trail crosses them. Big Beaver River is a stream about one hundred feet wide, and very rapid, its bed, like that of Little Beaver River, being filled with boulders. Its valley is about two hundred feet deep and nearly a mile in width. The plateau south of the river is for some distance thickly studded with boulders, rendering it on this account worthless for agricultural purposes. From this point to White-fish Lake, the country is very rough and filled with small lakes. White-fish Lake is about five miles in width by six in length, and is so called from the abundance of white-fish which it, in common with most of the other large lakes in this region contains. The fishing season at White-fish Lake, however, appears to be later than at Lac La Biche, as when I was at the latter place the fishing was at its best, while when I arrived here, two days after, it had not yet commenced. This probably depends on the different temperatures of the two lakes.\n\nThere are forty or fifty families of Indians and half-breeds living about White-fish Lake, most of them doing a little farming. The land, though rough and uneven, is very good, and no difficulty is found in raising cereals and root-crops of various kinds. One field of wheat which I was shown, belonging to Mr. Stainer, the Wesleyan missionary stationed there, averaged twenty-eight bushels to the acre, of excellent grain, although this was the fourteenth consecutive year in which it had been sown with the same crop.\n\nGood Fish Lake is about three miles from White-fish Lake, but considerably smaller, being about three miles in width by four in length. It is surrounded by a considerable area of excellent land. After leaving it and climbing a ridge about one hundred and fifty feet high, the road passes for several miles through an exceedingly rough country, filled with small lakes, and containing a considerable amount of timber. About ten miles from Good Fish Lake, the water-\nshed between Beaver River and the Saskatchewan is crossed, at an elevation of 2150 feet. From this point the road changes its course, running now in a south-westerly direction. The undulations gradually decrease, until about seven miles from the watershed they cease altogether, and the country appears almost perfectly level. During the remainder of the distance to White Mud River, about fifteen miles, the country has the same character, being flat and nearly all open. The soil is somewhat light, with occasional sandy ridges, supporting a growth of black pine. From White Mud River to Victoria, a distance of about eight miles, the road passes nearly all the way through a sandy tract heavily timbered with black pine.\n\nVictoria is situated on a large flat about seventy-five feet above the level of the Saskatchewan, and consists of the Hudson Bay Company's post, overlooking the river, and thirty or forty wooden houses, with small farms attached, which run back to the foot of the slope. The flat is about one-third of a mile wide. Excellent crops were reported by the settlers, who are principally English-speaking half-breeds, but I was unable to obtain any reliable statistics.\n\nON THE GEOLOGY OF THE REGION BETWEEN THE 54TH AND 56TH PARALLELS, FROM THE PACIFIC COAST TO EDMONTON.\n\nThe geological observations made between the Pacific coast at the mouth of the Skeena, and Edmonton, by way of the Peace River country, may be considered as resolving themselves into the description of a general section. This section is about seven hundred miles in length, and, in the northern part of British Columbia, crosses the whole width of the Cordillera region of the West Coast, embracing on the west the Coast or Cascade Mountains, and on the east the Rocky Mountains proper.\n\nRocks of the Coast and Skeena River.\n\nIt is much to be desired that a systematic examination of the crumpled and highly metamorphosed rocks which compose the Coast Ranges and most of the adjacent islands, should be made, with the purpose of ascertaining the composition of the series, and the possibility, or otherwise, of separating it into subdivisions differing in age. This problem, however, not possessing any apparent immediate economic interest, has been postponed to the definition of the areas of the coal-bearing Cretaceous rocks. The remarks made with regard to these\nolder rocks in previous reports,* therefore still hold, and we must be content to class them for the present under the general name of the Cascade Crystalline series. While the rocks are probably almost exclusively Palaeozoic and for the most part of about the Carboniferous period, areas, as yet undefined, of rocks both older and newer, may occur in this disturbed coast belt. In the Report of 1878-79, the older rocks of the Queen Charlotte Islands are described as containing Triassic fossils in their upper portion, but probably passing below into Carboniferous. The series, as a whole, is built up of volcanic products, limestones and argillites, and is not so metamorphic in aspect as that of the Coast Ranges of the mainland. It is highly probable that the felspathic, dioritic and gneissic rocks, with marbles, of the mainland and its fringing archipelago, may represent the lower portion of the Queen Charlotte Island series in a highly crystalline state. At Port Simpson, Work Channel and Metla Katla, a series of schistose rocks appears which may represent the distinctly Triassic argillites of the Queen Charlotte Islands in a metamorphosed condition, but this at present is little more than conjecture. These schists are dark in colour, and may be classed generally as micaeous, though distinct mica crystals are comparatively seldom developed in them. They usually show lustrous satiny surfaces, which are sometimes undulated, and occasionally roughened by the development between the layers of numerous small garnet crystals. In some layers the dark colour of the schists is evidently due to graphitic material, and calcareous matter is also often present in considerable proportion. Small quartz veins frequently traverse the rocks, particularly in the vicinity of Fort Simpson, where they generally follow the bedding or lamination planes. These rocks appear to compose the greater part of the Tshimpsonian Peninsula, dipping at Fort Simpson and Metla Katla, north-eastward, at angles not generally very high, while at the head of Work Inlet, they are found inclined very steeply in the opposite direction. They would thus appear to occupy a synclinal among the more massive crystalline rocks. Though the lithological resemblance to the gold-bearing rocks of Cariboo is close, I cannot learn that gold in paying quantity, has been found in connection with the rocks on this part of the coast. The schists from which the well-known large garnet crystals are obtained on the Stickeen River, are doubtless of the same age with these, and similar schists are known to be largely developed on other parts of the coast to the south-east.\n\nThe eastern side of Work Inlet, with the mountains bordering it, appears to be composed of massive granitic or gneissic rocks, the inlot\n\n---\n\n*Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1877-78, p. 169 b.\nfollowing the line of junction of these with the schistose series. The little rocky promontory at Port Essington, on the south side of the Skeena estuary, is composed of grey hornblende granite, traversed by numerous dykes similar in composition but coarser in texture. From this point, for about sixty miles up the Skeena, rocks referable to the Cascade Crystalline series continue to prevail, and though good exposures are seldom met with along the river banks, the rocks are displayed in the bare upper slopes of the mountains. Massive granitic rocks are no doubt largely developed, and form under the influence of the weather, smooth rounded surfaces, which becoming covered with lichen, present from a distance a dull purplish colour. The dips, observed in a few places, were not generally at high angles, and usually in a north-eastward direction. The rocks are gneisses and granites, often hornblende, with micaeous schists. Fifty miles above Port Essington the last-named rock is shown extensively on small brooks joining the river from the mountains on the left bank.\n\nThe supposed general attitude of the rocks on the lower part of the Skeena is shown on the section appended to the map which accompanies this report. The most remarkable point is, perhaps, the absence, in so far as ascertained, of compressed and overturned folds like those of the southern part of the province, represented in the sections published in the Report of Progress for 1877-78.\n\nA short distance below the mouth of the Kitsumgalum River, occurs a purplish felspathic rock, which was noted as a porphyrite, but of this, the specimen, with others collected on the Skeena, has not come to hand. Three miles further on, a rock similar in composition, but greenish-grey in colour, again occurs. Both these rocks are in places brecciated, and so massive that the attitudes could not be ascertained. They evidently resemble the rocks named the porphyrite series in previous reports, which are extensively developed on the Iltasyouco and Dean or Salmon Rivers. Rocks of this character, from the colour and appearance of the outcrops, evidently compose the lower hills,\u2014at least along this part of the River,\u2014and it is probable that the low and wide valley of the Kitsumgalum, continued southward by the Lakelse Lake valley to the Kitamat Arm, marks the junction of these Mesozoic rocks with the older series.\n\nThe next exposure seen in ascending the river is at Sip-ki-aw Rapid, and is of grey granite of rather coarse texture. It is traversed by jointage planes, which are nearly vertical, and would probably allow the rock to be quarried with some facility in blocks of fair size. They run, on a bearing, S. 22\u00b0 E. A short distance above the mouth of the Zymoetz River, on the right bank, granitic rocks were again seen, and it is probable that the range running southward be-\nbetween the Zymoetz and the Sip-ki-aw is also granitic and that rocks of this kind here form an important mass.\n\nOn the east bank of the Zymoetz, some miles from the Skeena, Mr. H. J. Cambie reports the existence of a massive bed of limestone, dipping about north magnetic, at an angle of 30\u00b0. Mr. Cambie also informs me that the stones in the Zymoetz are generally porphyritic, proving the extension of the porphyrite formation in that direction.\n\nAbout Kitsalas Ca\u00f1on, the rocks seen in the mountain sides appear to belong entirely to the so-called porphyrite series. In the ca\u00f1on they are found to be very compact in texture, but much fractured by jointage planes, and otherwise disturbed. They are hard, greenish felspathic materials, occasionally more or less porphyritic in texture, with little epidotic kernels and veins. No bedding could be made out, but they are occasionally traversed by small granitic dykes. About one mile above the ca\u00f1on, on the right bank, rocks probably of this series, are seen in massive beds in the top of a mountain, dipping about north magnetic at an angle of thirty degrees. For about five miles above the ca\u00f1on, the rocks, examined in a few places, appear to be chiefly hard greyish argillites and sandstones or quartzites. These are then followed by a second mass of granite of some importance, which has all the appearance of being intrusive and is much jointed.\n\nThe material of the bars and banks of the river, and that in the beds of small streams joining it, probably gives a better general representation of the lithological character of the rocks of this part of its course, than the few exposures which occur along the banks. At this point, the gravel consists chiefly of felspathic rocks, purplish, greyish, greenish, or bluish. These are sometimes brecciated, and the breccias occasionally pass into water-formed conglomerates, with well-rounded fragments, the finer materials graduating into ordinary quartzites, sandstones and argillites by intermediate varieties. Fossils were found in some abundance in a bluish felspathic rock, resembling that described in a former report* as carrying fossils on the Iltasyouco. They include Belemnites, a Trigonia, with other molluscs and a branching coral.\n\nFrom this point to the Forks, about forty miles following the course of the river, hard sandstones and argillites, often well-bedded, are the prevailing rocks. At Kwatsalix Ca\u00f1on, these rocks occur in thin regular beds, resembling those of the Nechacco group of the Report of 1876-77. For some miles above Kwatsalix a range of hills follows the right bank of the river, forming in some places a rampart-like escarpment, which is composed of beds of the kind just men-\n\n---\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1876-77.\ntioned, dipping away from the water. Near Kitsegueela, the rocks change somewhat in character. The sandstones are not highly indurated as before, but rather soft, and associated with carbonaceous shales, which occur at different stages in the formation, and are sometimes ten or more feet in thickness. At a little distance these quite resemble coal seams, and on closer examination are in fact found to include films and small lumps of a material which, though very impure and ashy, may be called true coal. Ironstone in nodules and impure coal sheets occurs in abundance in some parts of the formation, and obscure plant impressions were observed in the sandstones. The rocks have been irregularly deposited in many instances, the carbonaceous shales in particular showing a tendency to lenticular forms. The whole series of rocks has since been violently flexed, crushed and disturbed, so much so that even if coal seams of good quality occurred, they would scarcely under any circumstances be workable in this particular spot. About two miles above Kitsegueela, a well marked anticlinal axis crosses the river, a bed of conglomerate participating in the flexure. At a short distance further up the last rock between Kitsegueela and the Forks is seen.\n\nThe width of that portion of the belt of Mesozoic rocks crossed between their first appearance on the Skeena and the Forks, is about fifty-seven miles. They lie in a series of folds, of which the axes hold general north-westerly and south-easterly bearings. The angles of dip are often high, and the degree of disturbance implied considerable, the flexures being doubtless very much more numerous and complicated than the diagramatic section would indicate. It will have been observed that while porphyrite, and other felspathic and often brecciated rocks prevail toward the western margin of the region, comparatively soft sandstone, argillites and carbonaceous argillites, characterize the eastern, the intervening region showing rocks more or less intermediate in lithological character and degree of induration. To what extent this change may show a true difference in the character of the formation from west to east, and in how far it may be accounted for on the supposition that older beds, generally characterized by the abundance of volcanic materials, are represented to the west, it is impossible, with the limited knowledge yet obtained of these rocks, definitely to state. It is supposed, however, that the latter circumstance actually occurs, though the first mentioned may also have added to the appearance of difference now found.\n\nRocks of Babine Portage.\n\nIn proceeding eastward from the Forks to the northern end of Babine Lake, across the intervening mountain region, similar rocks\ncontinue to prevail. Sandstones are most abundantly represented, but contain in some places carbonaceous shales, and towards the summit of the pass become associated with rocks of volcanic origin like those before described. These occasionally seem to form fully one half the thickness of the beds represented. In one place five miles up the Sus-kwa River, a few impressions of leaves were found. Some of these appear to be coniferous. There is one narrow angiospermous leaf and several grass-like blades. Not far from the summit, numerous fragments of silicified wood were obtained, with a few specimens of a mollusc, which, according to Mr. Whiteaves who has examined the specimens, is a *Thracia* of the section *Corimya*. The species is probably undescribed, but it is identical with one from the coal-bearing rocks of the Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\n**Impure coal.**\n\nThe strike of the rocks throughout this region, is generally nearly true north and south, but subject to great local irregularity. In the bed of the Tzes-a-tza-kwa River, near the point at which the tail from the Forks reaches Babine Lake, fragments resembling coal were found, but contain too much earthy matter to be useful as a fuel. From the appearance of the mountains visible from different points in this region, it seems probable that Mesozoic rocks of the kind described, are very widely spread in this part of the province, a belief confirmed by a number of small specimens collected by Mr. Horetzky to the north, during the expedition of 1879. The hills behind the Hudson Bay post at the north end of Babine Lake, on its west side, are composed of moderately indurated sandstones with fine-grained conglomerates striking N. 43\u00b0 E., with a north-westerly dip at high angles. The rocks of the Mesozoic series may extend considerably further in this direction, but were not traced.\n\nThe total width of the belt of Cretaceous rocks crossed on this line, which cuts the 55th parallel at a small angle, is little short of one hundred miles.\n\n**General Remarks on the Cretaceous Rock.**\n\nPrecisely what horizon these rocks represent, it is at present impossible to determine, or as yet to enter into any details as to their arrangement or thickness. From their relation to the Porphyrite series, and the occurrence of the *Thracia* above referred to, it appears, however, that they must represent, at least in part, the coal-bearing series of the Queen Charlotte Islands, while they may even extend upward to include rocks of the horizon of those of Comox and Nanaimo.\n\nThe existence of rocks of this age is not necessarily, in itself, to be regarded as establishing a probability of the occurrence of coal seams of economic value; but the general dissemination over the\n\n---\n\n*For...\ndistrict of carbonaceous shales containing impure coal, points to the occurrence of conditions such as those required for the deposition of true coals, and indicates the possibility, if not the probability, of the occurrence of coal beds of a workable character in some part of the region.\n\nMr. Horetzky collected specimens of the coaly materials found in these rocks on the Skeena, at two localities above the Forks. These were examined by Mr. C. Hoffmann in the laboratory of the Survey, and their analyses published in the preliminary report on this region, which forms Appendix No. 7 of the Canadian Pacific Railway Report of 1879. They have since appeared in Mr. Hoffmann's portion of the Report of the Geological Survey for 1878-79, pp. 12 II. and 12 II., and need not therefore be repeated in this place. The specimens collected by Mr. Horetzky precisely resemble those found at Kitseguecla, below the Forks, but these from the last mentioned place have not been quantitatively examined. They are carbonaceous shales or very impure bituminous coals, containing 1\u00b705 and 1\u00b752 respectively of hygroscopic water and 40\u00b790 and 45\u00b724 of ash. They afford no colour to a boiling solution of caustic potash, and cannot be called lignites.\n\nIn addition to these, I received from Mr. Hankin, when at the Forks of the Skeena, a small specimen of true coal, apparently of excellent quality. This material came from a point on the Watsonkwa River, about eighteen miles from the Forks, and is reported by the Indians to occur in quantity. I was unable to visit the locality, but it lies nearly on the strike of the carbonaceous beds seen near the mouth of the Kitseguecla, on the Skeena, and may therefore occur in a horizon nearly the same. Arrangements were made to procure a larger specimen, but this has not yet arrived.\n\nMr. Hoffmann has examined a fragment of this coal, with the following result:\n\n| Component       | Percentage |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Volatile matter | 40\u00b752      |\n| Fixed carbon    | 57\u00b751      |\n| Ash             | 1\u00b797       |\n\nA determination of the water gave 0\u00b785 per cent., as however, owing to lack of material, no control was made, the amount of this constituent is included in the figure representing volatile matter. Rapid heating gave a firm coke. The ash, which was somewhat bulky, had a light reddish-brown colour and agglutinated slightly at a bright red heat. This is an excellent fuel and closely resembles a coal of the true coal measures.*\n\n*For details as to physical character of this specimen, see the report above referred to.\nIn the present isolated position of the northern interior of British Columbia, the possible existence of workable deposits of coal, is a matter of indifference; but in the event of the opening of any route through it, it would be exceedingly desirable to have all parts of the extensive Mesozoic area subjected to a geological examination as close as possible.\n\nRocks of Babine and Stuart Lakes.\n\nA rapid traverse in canoe and boat of these lakes, did not allow much information as to the rocks surrounding them to be obtained, but it is probable that no very important gap in the section results, as the line nearly follows that of the general strike of the beds. The Cretaceous rocks like those previously described, continue, apparently, for some distance down Babine Lake, but exposures are few. At twenty-five miles from the upper end of the lake, on the west side, a basaltic amygdaloid, evidently of Tertiary volcanic age occurs, and on the opposite side of the lake, near the knee or bend, basaltic rocks form a rather fine display of inclined columns about eighty feet high. At eleven or twelve miles from the upper end of the lake, on the north side, rocks which are doubtless Paleozoic in age, and probably represent a portion of Cache Creek group* appear. They consist of white limestone or marble in thin beds, with greenish schists, hornblendic or occasionally micaeous, and quartzite. These rocks probably also occupy a considerable stretch of the south shore. Eastward they are succeeded by granite, which is in turn followed by basaltic and other Tertiary volcanic rocks, which appear to form a synclinal running north-westward across the extremity of the lake, and compose the conspicuous mountain at its south-eastern angle.\n\nThe trail between Babine and Stuart Lakes, probably leads for some miles over Tertiary volcanic rocks, which are then succeeded by granite, generally grey and hornblendic. The rocks at the Stuart Lake end of the portage are all of this character. The small island at the Yi-ko River is of similar material, with a lamination nearly vertical and running N. 30\u00b0W. The mode of occurrence of the granitic and Tertiary volcanic rocks here, resembles that described in a previous report as existing at the east end of Fraser Lake.\n\nIn travelling down Stuart Lake, the granites are soon replaced by schistose rocks, which are when first seen greyish in colour, and probably for the most part argillite or quartzite. At a small island on which we landed, about half way down the lake, the rock was found to be a grey glossy schist, probably referable to the Cache Creek group.\n\n*See Reports of Progress 1871-72 p. 61, 1877-78 pp. 169 B. 173 B.\nof former reports. The massive limestones of the north-east side of the lake were first clearly seen in the range of hills north of the Pinche River. These limestones have been described by Mr. Selwyn and myself in previous reports, and by the discovery of Fusulinae in them during the exploration of 1876, have been shown to be of Carboniferous age. They are the northward continuation of the typical Cache Creek limestones of the provisional classification of the report for 1871-72.\n\nStuart Lake to McLeod's Lake.\n\nFor the region on the line of trail from Fort St. James, on Stuart Lake, to Fort McLeod, little information exists, for, as elsewhere noted, the drift covering is deep. The nearly parallel section on the Lower Nechacco, about fifty miles further south, is described in the Report of Progress for 1876-77. The Paleozoic rocks of the Cache Creek series are there found to be succeeded to the eastward by a broad belt of Mesozoic and probably Cretaceous rocks, which were designated as the Nechacco series. These are covered to the eastward by accumulations of Tertiary age. The strike of the Cache Creek and Nechacco rocks would carry them across the line of section now described, and the existence of rocks belonging to both these series appears to be proved by the abundant occurrence of fragments referable to both groups in the drift. It is probable that no very extensive spread of Tertiary rocks stretches so far north from the Nechacco, but Tertiary stones are also found in the drift, and about a mile and half east of Carrier Lake, an amygdaloidal basalt with small white crystals of chabazite was seen in place, proving that patches at least of the volcanic portion of the Tertiary occur. A small exposure of hard rusty shales and sandstones of indeterminate character, is seen where the trail first reaches the Salmon River from the west. North-east of Carp Lake, is an isolated exposure of gneissic and granitic rocks, noticed by Mr. Selwyn in 1875.* These rocks are quite peculiar in appearance, being composed of quartz, orthoclase felspar and mica, with garnets, forming in some cases a coarsely crystalline aggregate. As will subsequently appear, they must be older than the rocks of the Misinchinca and Rocky Mountains, and therefore also older than the Cache Creek rocks of Stuart Lake. I believe them to be, in fact, the oldest rocks met with on this line of traverse, and possibly even of Laurentian age. The region here characterized by these rocks is probably not very extensive, judging by their comparatively small representation in the drift of the locality. The occurrence of these oldest rocks forming comparatively low ground\n\n*Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, p 81.\nat the present watershed between the Pacific and Arctic streams, which flowing westward and eastward cut through the probably altogether newer ranges of the Coast and Rocky Mountains, is very interesting.\n\nOn Long Lake River and the lower part of Troquois Creek, somewhat extensive exposures show greenish and grey felspathic schists, occasionally almost nacreous, and associated with grey much hardened but fine-grained limestone and black slaty argillite, which occasionally becomes a micaceous schist. The general strike is N.77\u00b0 E., with a southerly dip at an angle of about 60\u00b0. These rocks, doubtless form a portion of the Palaeozoic series extending eastward from McLeod's Lake.\n\nRocks of McLeod's Lake, Misinchinca River and the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAbout McLeod's Lake, the rocks are limestones and limestone-schists, with felspathic beds, and appear to be sharply folded. From a few exposures noted by Mr. Selwyn, these rocks seem to continue in a north-westward direction on the Parsnip for sixty miles, and it is supposed that they are again represented in the massive and shaly limestones of the main range of the Rocky Mountains, thirty-five miles to the northeast. They appear, in the region between Fort McLeod and the mountains, to form in the main a broad synclinal fold, in which lie the schistose rocks of the Misinchinca River, with a minimum width of fourteen miles. These schists, while showing almost throughout south-westerly dips, are probably arranged in a number of sharply overturned folds, and have no such thickness as would appear on a cursory view. The schists extend northward in this trough for an indeterminate distance, crossing the Peace River at the mouth of the Finlay.\n\nThe section on the Misinchinca, referred to above in general terms, exhibits numerous varieties of schistose rocks, which may be classed together as mica-schists, though differing much in appearance. One of the most abundant is a pale silvery mica-schist, finely laminated and soft. This passes into bluish and grey mica-schists, while felspathic schists and argillites with little micaceous matter are also represented, and in some places hold staurolite. Quartzites are also present, being occasionally, (as in the case of beds which are supposed to immediately overlie the limestones on Atunatche Creek), fine-grained and saccharoidal, but in other places micaceous, and passing into fine grained schistose conglomerates. These are very peculiar in appearance, being composed of rounded or sub-angular fragments of quartz and orthoclase felspar, precisely resembling the varieties of these minerals found in the granitic and gneissic rocks near Carp Lake, the quartz even possessing the same slightly opalescent character. These are imbedded in a silvery micaceous matrix, and the whole has evidently in\nBRITISH COLUMBIA AND NORTH-WEST TERRITORY.\n\nsome cases been much compressed. It may be that much of the micaeous character of the Misinchinca schists, is due to the inclusion of ready-formed mica from the same source as the quartz and felspar fragments. It is quite evident, that the Carp Lake rocks were fully metamorphosed and undergoing waste, at the time of the deposit of the Misinchinca schists, and as these are clearly the same with those holding gold in the Cariboo region, and probably also with the Anderson River and Boston Bar rocks of the lower Fraser, and schistose zones elsewhere found in the province, an important step in establishing the relative age of some of the older rocks is secured.\n\nIn some homogeneous beds on the Misinchinca, a superinduced slaty cleavage renders the true dip uncertain. The resemblance of the rocks to those of Cariboo, and the probable identity in age, might lead to the belief that important gold deposits may occur in this wide schistose belt. It is to be remarked, however, that quartz veins are seldom met with, and that the rocks contrast in this respect markedly with those of Cariboo, and though minute scales of gold were obtained in trial washings on the bars in the stream, and the region appears to be worth prospecting, there is no strong ground for a belief in its richly auriferous character.\n\nThe north-west and south-east valley occupied by Azouzetta, or Summit Lake, the Atunatche, and the south-east or main branch of the Valley, Misinchinca, marks the junction of the schistose rocks with the underlying limestones, which here form the main range of the Rocky Mountains. The higher slopes of these mountains are to a great extent bare, and the dip of the limestone beds can be observed at a great distance. It varies from about 50\u00b0 to nearly 90\u00b0 to the south-westward. Behind our camp, at the summit, the general strike was found to be S. 50\u00b0 E. The thickness of the limestone must be at least 1000 or 2000 feet, and may be much greater. It is generally a bluish-grey crypto-crystalline rock, not highly altered, and lying in rather thin beds, which sometimes become even shaly. Shaly argillites like those of the Misinchinca, but not so much altered, are also seen. Cherty concretions and layers occur in the limestones, resembling the typical cherty quartzites of parts of the Cache Creek group, and some beds of the limestone appear to have been broken up and reconstructed while in process of deposition, forming brecciated layers with evenly bedded ones above and below them. A similar circumstance is noted by Mr. Selwyn with regard to the limestones of McLeod's Lake Mountain, and was also observed in the Stuart Lake limestones. A few very obscure fossils were found in the limestones at the summit of the pass, but not sufficiently perfect for determination. The best preserved is a portion of the dorsal valve of a smooth brachiopod, possibly a small Athyris with a strong mesial fold and sinus.\nThe Omenica gold district, lying to the west of the lower part of the Parsnip River, from what can be ascertained of the character of its rocks, must be situated on a trough of schistose sediments similar to that of the Misinchinae, but separated from it by the limestones of the Parsnip and their north-western continuation. As this district has never been visited or reported on by any member of the Geological Survey, though it appears to possess much prospective importance, it may be useful to incorporate what is known of it with the present report.\n\nThe known auriferous localities here lie about fifty miles north of a line passing westward from Pine Pass by Forts McLeod and St. James. There are three routes by which Omenica may be reached.\u2014First, from the coast by the Skeena River, Babine Portage and Firepan Pass. This route is travelled by canoe and on foot. Second, by a trail from Fort St. James, practicable for pack animals; and third, by canoe or boat from the eastward by the Peace and Finlay Rivers. Without entering into details, a glance at the map will show how completely isolated this district is, and account for the scarcity and high price of provisions, which has prevented the working of any but good paying claims and hindered the thorough examination of the country.\n\nThe main points which seem to bear on the possible future of the district are as follows:\u2014(1.) The existence of rich deposit of gold, and the possibility that with greater facility of access the known area covered by these would be increased, and that it would become possible to work those of a lower grade. (2.) The occurrence of pellets of native silver or amalgam in association with the gold. It may not be found possible to trace this material to veins of workable dimensions, but its presence seems in some degree to show the general argentiferous character of the district. (3.) The chief promise of future importance as a mining centre seems to lie, however, in the fact that highly argentiferous galena occurs in some abundance, and, it is reported, in well-defined and wide veins. These it is impossible at present to utilize, owing to the cost of labour and carriage, but the subjoined particulars may serve to give some idea of the character of the deposits.\n\nAccording to Mr. Woodcock, of Victoria, some of the most important veins are in the vicinity of a stream called Boulder Creek.\n\nThat known as the \"Arctic Circle\" is said to be about twenty feet wide, and to show about four feet of highly metalliferous ore. It is exposed by the brook in a face about thirty feet high. The claim adjoining this is called the \"Black Warrior,\" and shows a vein eight feet wide of nearly pure galena. Other specimens have been obtained from places within a radius of eight miles from this locality.\nNear Lost Creek a vein known as the \"Champion Ledge\" is found, and runs nearly parallel with the stream. Particulars as to its size are wanting. Another vein on this creek is reported to be twenty feet wide.\n\nMr. Woodcock has favoured me with copies of the following analyses of two specimens of the ores from this district, by Messrs. Johnston, Matthy & Co., London, England.\n\n**Arctic Circle Vein.**\n\n| Component   | Percentage |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Lead        | 26.80      |\n| Iron        | 2.50       |\n| Silver      | 0.13       |\n| Sulphur     | 6.35       |\n| Silica      | 61.60      |\n| Alumina     | 1.40       |\n| Combined water | 0.95    |\n| Oxygen and loss | 0.27    |\n\nSilver equal to 44.2 oz. per ton of 20 cwt.\n\nA second analysis of the Arctic Circle ore, is by G. W. Hopkins, San Francisco, and gives the following result:\n\n- Silver, per ton, 40.81 oz., or $52.76.\n- Gold, trace.\n\nPig lead would contain about 50 oz. to the ton.\n\n**Black Warrior Vein.**\n\n| Component   | Percentage |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Lead        | 20.25      |\n| Iron        | 2.15       |\n| Silver      | 0.09       |\n| Sulphur     | 4.80       |\n| Silica      | 69.80      |\n| Alumina     | 1.50       |\n| Combined water | 1.00    |\n| Oxygen and loss | 1.41    |\n\nSilver equal to 29.8 oz. per ton of 20 cwt.\n\nA second assay of the \"Black Warrior,\" by Messrs. Richn, Hemme & Co., San Francisco, showed the sample to contain 98 oz. or $126.70 of silver to the ton, equal to $187.10 per ton of pig lead.\n\nTwo assays of specimens of ore from a deposit known as the \"Mammoth Ledge,\" gave the following results. Assay by Thomas Price, San Francisco:\n\n- Gold, per ton, 1/10 oz. ........... $ 2.06\n- Silver, do 32 1/10 oz. ............. 41.89\n\n$43.95\n\nClean galena would assay $131.85.\nAssay by Messrs. Riehn, Hemme & Co., San Francisco:\n\n|                |       |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Gold, per ton  | $6.28 |\n| Silver, do     | $91.13|\n\nPig lead would contain 207 oz. to the ton.\n\nA specimen of quartz with galena, from a stream near Mansen Creek in the same district, was examined by Mr. Hoffmann some years ago* and found to contain 8-971 oz. of silver to the ton, with traces of gold, but, as Mr. Hoffmann remarks, the silver is confined to the galena, of which a small quantity only occurs in the vein-stone, and which must consequently be highly argentiferous. An analysis in the laboratory of the Survey, of a sample of galena from the Arctic Circle vein, separated as far as possible from the gangue, gave 128 oz. of silver to the ton. A specimen of ore from the Champion Ledge, including galena and gangue, showed 20 oz. of silver to the ton and a trace of gold.\n\nIt would thus appear that a considerable percentage of silver occurs in all the galenas examined from this district, and that if the veins are sufficiently large and constant in character, the region must be of importance when sufficient means of access to it are provided.\n\nAll these ores might, by ordinary process of dressing and washing, be raised nearly to the grade which they show when the precious metals are calculated to the proportion of galena contained.\n\nDuring the summer of 1879, there were, as I have been informed, about sixty white men engaged in Omenica, with twenty Chinamen, and sixty to seventy Indians, the latter receiving wages as labourers at $3 a day. I am inclined to believe, however, that these figures may be rather above the mark than below it.\n\nRocks of Upper Pine River.\n\nIn travelling down the Pine River from its source, the attitude of the limestone beds is found to become less uniform, and they appear to be nearly flat in some of the mountains. The pebbles in the stream are almost entirely of glossy schists like those of the Misinchinca region, though these rocks were not observed in place in this part of the valley. Near the northernmost point of the bend which Pine River now makes, on the left bank of the stream, some fossils were found, in beds of shaly limestone with south-eastward dip at an angle of 80\u00b0. The fossils have been examined Mr. J. F. Whiteaves, who recognizes\n\n---\n\n* Reports of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, p. 430; 1876-77, p. 116.\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1878-79, p. 24, II.\namong them *Atrypa reticularis*, Linn. and another species of brachiopod too imperfect for determination. Also three or four species of corals, mostly fragmentary, one of them apparently a *Zaphrentis* or *Cyathophyllum*. A mile and a quarter further down, a stream enters from the north, constituting the Upper Fork of the river. To the west of this stream is a block of mountains, high and rough, the beds of which appear to have general south-westerly dips, and are for the most part limestones. Along the north-eastern escarpment of this range, however, extensive beds of saccharoidal quartzite must appear, probably coming from below the limestone, as the brook just mentioned is paved with quartzite and limestone pebbles almost to the exclusion of the silvery schistose fragments, which to this point characterize the bed of the main stream of Pine River.\n\nA few miles further on, near the eastern base of Canoe Mountain, in rock slides which descend from it to the border of the river, were found, the east of a small *Rensseleria*, which, according to Mr. Whiteaves, is rather like *R. levis* of Meek from the Devonian rocks of the MacKenzie River, with some unrecognizable fragments of other brachiopods.\n\nToward the eastern border of the limestone ranges, the beds become 'Alpine Trias,' much disturbed, and hard black calcareous shales holding numerous specimens of *Monotis subcircularis*, like those described by Mr. Selwyn on the Peace River forty miles to the north-westward, appear. The precise relation of these rocks to the limestones was not ascertained, and I regret that the time at my disposal did not allow a more complete examination of the rocks in the vicinity of Canoo Mountain. It remains uncertain whether the limestones form an anticlinal overturned to the eastward, or meet these newer beds at a line of fault. No indications of the latter structure were, however, noticed. It may not improbably be that the *Monotis* beds are the little altered representatives of the schists of the Misinchinca River. Immediately after the appearance of the *Monotis* beds, at the point where the Pine River assumes a north-easterly course, the older rocks are concealed by the outcrop of the Cretaceous sandstones and conglomerates.\n\n**Cretaceous Rocks of Pine River**\n\nAt whatever period the elevation of the Rocky Mountain range to the south and east of this point may have occurred, it is clear that portions of the limestones and associated rocks above described, must have projected as islands, or formed a more or less continuous shore-line at the time of the deposition of the Cretaceous beds here lying to the east of them. Those, in the vicinity of the mountains appear to be composed almost exclusively of sandstones and conglomerates, and with\nlittle exception maintain this character on the Pine River as far as the Middle Forks, a distance in a direction at right angles to the main axis of folding, of thirty-four miles from the older rocks. The sandstones are generally brownish in colour, contain little calcareous matter, and are often quite coarse in grain. They are usually regularly bedded, and broad surfaces are frequently ripple-marked. In the coarser grits and conglomerates, the constituent fragments are found to be almost entirely of cherty material like that occurring in the more resistant of the limestone beds about the summit of the pass. In the immediate vicinity of the mountains, these rocks are thrown into a series of sharp folds, which have a general direction of north-west by south-east, and in which the beds occasionally even show overturned dips. At about sixteen miles from the edge of the older limestones, the flexures of these rocks, which have been diminishing in amount, cease, and the beds become practically horizontal; and though at the Middle Forks slight undulations were again noted, these are probably not more than may be accounted for by some original inequality in deposition. From sections exposed in the nearly bare hillsides of Pine River, the thickness of the series must be at least 2000 feet, and may be much more.\n\nThe flexures of the sandstone series, as they occur in the hills forming the north side of the Pine River valley, are shown in the section on Plate 7.\n\nWhile there is no means of arriving at the precise age of most parts of the sandstone series of the Upper Pine River, I see no reason to doubt that it forms the coarse littoral portion of the Cretaceous rocks which spread so widely to the eastward. It seems probable, as more fully detailed elsewhere, that fine shaly materials become increasingly abundant in receding from the mountains, and that the rocks eventually resolve themselves into the subdivisions described below. Further, while the rocks of the Upper Pine River may be described as sandstones and conglomerates, shaly beds are not altogether absent. At a point nine miles from the western edge of the formation, two beds of carbonaceous shale, four and three feet thick respectively, were observed to occur near the water level. They include coaly fragments, and obscure impressions of sedge-like plants were found in sandstones in the same vicinity. At another place, nineteen miles from the western edge of the limestones, about fifty feet in thickness of blackish shaly beds appears in a lateral ravine. With the shales are beds of nodular ironstone, and thin ferruginous sandstone layers. These beds underlie the mass of the sandstones forming the hills, and probably represent the summit of the 'Lower Shales' of the classification subsequently given, for in the sandstones several hundred feet above\nthe world. It is a land of eternal spring, where nature seems to have been deprived of its winter season; where the foliage follows the flowers.\n\nor\n\nand\n\nclearly visible from the summit of Mount Beacon, which stands at an elevation of 184 feet above sea level. This mountain was named in honor of General Robert E. Lee, who died in 1870. The name was officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n\nIn 1902, the city of New York decided to build a water reservoir near the Beacon Rock, which was located at the foot of Beacon Hill. The reservoir was completed in 1906.\n\nThe reservoir is now part of the Beacon Reservoir Park, which is managed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nIn conclusion, Beacon Rock is a natural wonder that has been appreciated for centuries. It is a symbol of the power of nature and a reminder of the importance of preserving our natural resources.\n\nFurthermore, Beacon Rock is a place where people can connect with nature and experience the beauty of the outdoors. Whether you are hiking, fishing, or simply enjoying the view, Beacon Rock offers a unique and unforgettable experience.\nthem, Mr. McConnell found a few fossils which appear to be identical with those characterizing the 'Lower Sandstones' of the Lower Forks of Pine River. On these specimens Mr. J. F. Whiteaves furnishes the following note:\n\n1. *Cyrena*\u2014Cast of a *Cyrena*, with outline very like that of *C. (Vel-Cretaceous oritina) Durkeei* of Meek, from the \"Bear River Series\" of Wyoming and Utah.\n\n2. *Corbula*\u2014Cast of the left valve of a large *Corbula*, apparently closely allied to the smooth variety of *C. pyriformis*, Meek, from the Bear River Series of Sulphur Creek, near Bear River, Utah, but broader posteriorly and with the beaks pointing distinctly forwards. The same species was collected by Mr. Selwyn at Pine River Forks, in 1875. In the same year Mr. Selwyn collected at Dunvegan, and on the Peace River, 36 miles from Dunvegan, specimens of a *Narra*-like *Corbula*, which can scarcely be distinguished from the ribbed variety of *C. pyriformis*, but in these shells the posterior end is elongated and narrowly attenuated and the beaks point decidedly backwards.\n\n3. *Pteria*\u2014Cast of the left valve of a small *Pteria*. Much too imperfect for identification, but apparently rather like *P Nebrascana* of Evans and Shumard.\n\n4. *Ostrea*\u2014Detached valves of a small species.\n\nAt a point somewhat further up the river, impressions of a large *Inoceramus* were observed, but it was found impossible to procure specimens.\n\nThese rocks of Upper Pine River appear to me to represent those described by Mr. Selwyn on the corresponding portion of the Peace River above the Ca\u00f1on of the Mountain of Rocks. From a study of Mr. Selwyn's section on the Peace River, in conjunction with the additional information now obtained, and more particularly in the light of the fine sections on the Smoky River, I believe that the rocks underlying the portion of the Peace River country embraced in the present report may be subdivided as follows, in descending order:\n\n1. Upper sandstones and shales with lignite coals. (apiti River Sandstones.)\n2. Upper dark shales. (Smoky River Shales.)\n3. Lower sandstones and shales with lignite and true coals. (Dunvegan Sandstones.)\n4. Lower dark shales. (Fort St. John Shales.)\n\nFor the region lying to the east of the point now attained in the course of the description, it will be more convenient to treat of the places characterized by each subdivision together.\nLower Shales.\u2014This subdivision, according to Mr. Selwyn's notes, appears to occupy the Upper Peace valley for a length of nearly fifty miles, extending from a point about six miles below Hudson's Hope to a short distance below the mouth of Pine River North. The rocks are described* as \"dark earthy shales, in parts characterized by numerous bands and septarian nodules of clay ironstone, many of which enclose large ammonites, and they are also associated with sandy calcareous layers holding other Cretaceous fossils, among which a species of *Inoceramus* is tolerably abundant, while in the dark argillaceous shales scales of fishes are frequently observed.\" In a section about a mile below Fort St. John, these rocks have a thickness exceeding 600 feet. The area occupied by the lower shales is not wide, however, as the overlying sandstones are found in the higher ground at no great distance back from the river valley. At the point above mentioned, in descending the Peace River, they are overlain by the sandstones of the next succeeding subdivision, and do not again appear till at about five miles below the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9, or twenty-five miles above the confluence of the Peace and Smoky Rivers. They extend for about the same distance up the Smoky River, till the light southerly dip of the beds brings the overlying subdivision down to the water level. On Peace River, below the mouth of the Smoky, these beds are followed by sandstones which at some distance down the stream form rampart-like cliffs. These have not, however, been geologically examined, and it is not known whether they are a return of the Lower Sandstones, or a yet older series underlying the Lower Shales.\n\nThe small exposure of shales probably representing this subdivision on the Upper Pine River, has already been alluded to.\n\nThe fossils obtained by Mr. Selwyn from those rocks near Fort St. John, include numerous crushed specimens of a large *Ammonite*, resembling, according to Mr. Whiteaves, *Prionocyclus Woolgari*, but a new species. The *Inoceramus* may not improbably be *I. problematicus*, and a *Pteria* specifically the same with one from the locality on Upper Pine River described on p. 115 b.\n\nThe Lower Sandstones and Shales, constituting the next subdivision, appear to be much more widely spread. It is probable that a considerable part of the sandstones of the Upper Pine River may belong to this subdivision. It is well characterized, however, about the ca\u00f1on and at the Lower Forks of Pine River, and seems from the information at present available, to occupy the valley of Peace River for a distance of about one hundred miles, between the mouth of Pine River North, and the point below the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9 indicated in\n\n---\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, p. 72.\na preceding paragraph. It also crosses the Smoky River with a width in the bottom of the valley of nine miles, and may further, I believe, be regarded as probably including the sandstones of the Ca\u00f1on of the Mountain of Rocks above Hudson's Hope.\n\nIn the Pine River Ca\u00f1on, the rocks of this subdivision are flaggy sandstones, often brownish-grey in color and false-bedded or ripple-marked, greenish-grey fine-grained sandstones and black soft argillaceous sandstones and shales holding plant impressions, also occur. In the valley of a small stream which cuts the bank on the south side of the ca\u00f1on, not far above the river level, Mr. Selwyn, in 1875, found, in alternating strata of sandstones and shales, four thin seams of coal, which in descending order are\u2014six inches, eight inches, two feet, and eight inches thick. A number of fossils were also found in the associated beds, consisting of leaf-impressions and shells. \"The former occur chiefly in beds below the coal seams, and the latter in the intervening sandy shales, and in the ferruginous and calcareous concretionary nodules which accompany the latter.\" These coal seams and the associated beds are at least 1700 feet below the sandstones of the summit of Table Mountain, and as the beds are nearly horizontal, this difference in elevation must closely correspond with the actual thickness of the rocks. For a portion of the ascent of Table Mountain, however, the rocks are not seen, though about 200 feet thick of sandstone caps the hill. It is therefore uncertain whether the subdivision classed as the Upper Shales may occur in the concealed interval and the sandstones at the summit represent the Upper Sandstone series, or whether,\u2014as is perhaps more probable,\u2014the entire thickness of the rocks from the edge of Pine River to the summit of Table Mountain, should be classed as belonging to the Lower Sandstones, which in this case must here have a very great thickness. In the sandstones of the summit of the mountain numerous specimens of *Inoceramus altus*, a species previously noted in beds supposed to represent the Pierre group in Wyoming, were found by Mr. Selwyn. The fuel occurring in the above-described section scarcely differs from true bituminous coal, containing, according to an analysis by Mr. Hoffmann but 2:45 per cent. of water, and yielding a hard coke.\n\nThe fossil plants and molluscs, obtained from the beds in the vicinity of the Lower Forks of Pine River, are reviewed on a succeeding page.\n\nOn the lower part of Coal Brook, which flows into the East Branch of Pine River, extensive exposures of the Lower Sandstones occur. Coal was discovered here by Mr. J. Hunter in 1877, and is mentioned by him in the Canadian Pacific Railway Report of 1878 (p. 79). Mr. Hunter favoured me with specimens collected by him at the time, and I have since personally examined the locality. The coal occurs in several\nbeds and appears to be of good quality, but so far as observed all are very thin, the thickest measuring about six inches. The coal resembles that above mentioned, but contains 7-83 of water and less ash, and does not yield a coherent coke. Coal also occurs on the east branch of Pine River above the mouth of Coal Creek, and there is much ground to hope for the discovery of coal seams of workable thickness in this region.\n\nThe rocks associated with the coals are sandstones and sandy shales, generally grey, but becoming blackish where most argillaceous. The series is usually very regularly bedded, though many of the sandstones show current structure, and there are occasional marked local departures from horizontality. The beds also include ironstone, which in some places is quite abundant, forming nodular sheets. Ironstone also occurs in this manner in some of the rocks of the same subdivision seen about the Forks of Pine River.\n\nOn Peace River, the rocks of this subdivision are supposed, as above noted, to form the banks for a long distance. They are described as consisting of similar alternating sandstones and shales, the former often worn out by the weather into fantastic shapes, the latter generally markedly arenaceous in character. In the bare hill behind Dunvegan, a thickness of about 400 feet of these beds is shown, consisting of brown and grey sandstones and sandy shales, which hold numerous fossils. The beds appear to be horizontal or nearly so throughout.\n\nOn the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9, near its mouth, about fourteen miles from Dunvegan, Mr. McConnell examined a reported coal seam, which proved to be a lignite coal of inferior quality, and about twelve inches only in thickness. Coal or lignite is also reported to occur on Rat River ten or fifteen miles from Dunvegan, but the locality was not visited. Thin irregular seams of poor lignite were noticed in banks a few miles below Dunvegan on the same side of the river.\n\nOn Smoky River the Lower Shales appear to blend at their summit with the subdivision now under consideration, which is shaly at the base, but in the main represented by sandstones, generally yellowish and soft, but often nodularly hardened. The nodules or concretions are frequently masses exceeding six feet in diameter, which as they weather from the bed fall into the river, and considerably impede its course. The highest bed of the Lower Sandstones is found at a sharp bend of the river, with a rapid, three miles north of the Little Smoky. It is a massive soft grey sandstone, with abundant fragments of plants, often root-like, and in one place distinctly representing the base and roots of a tree, and evidencing a terrestrial surface. Overlying this is a thin carbonaceous film, which at a short distance further up the river becomes a seam of lignite coal two and a half inches in thickness.\nThis, according to an analysis by Mr. Hoffmann, contains 11.52 per cent. of water. It is interesting to find the coal-bearing character of this part of the formation maintained, though by a seam so inconsiderable, so far to the eastward.\n\nThe beds seen in the Ca\u00f1on of the Mountain of Rocks, are sandstones, conglomerates and shales with coal seams. The thickest seam observed by Mr. Selwyn in this place was but six inches,* but in July, 1879, Mr. Cambie noticed one about two feet in thickness. The following analysis of a specimen of coal from this locality, collected by Mr. Selwyn, is published by Dr. Harrington:\u2020\n\n|                | Slow coking | Fast coking |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Water          | 2.10        | 2.10        |\n| Volatile combustible matter | 21.54      | 25.09      |\n| Fixed carbon   | 71.63       | 68.08       |\n| Ash            | 4.73        | 4.73        |\n\nRatio of volatile to fixed combustible by slow coking 1\u20133.32, by fast coking 1\u20132.71. By rapid heating the coal yielded a fine coke, and it may be regarded in all respects as a fuel of excellent quality, only requiring to be found in sufficient quantity to claim importance.\n\nThe resemblance between this and the coal from Pine River Ca\u00f1on is close, and both are better in quality than those from any other part of the region east of the mountains embraced in this report.\n\nFrom the rocks which I have called the Lower Sandstones, in the vicinity of the Lower Forks of Pine River, a number of molluscan fossils have been obtained. Some were collected by Mr. Selwyn in the beds associated with the coals on Coal Gully near the ca\u00f1on. Others by myself in large loose blocks in the lower part of the East Branch. Among those collected by Mr. Selwyn the following forms occur, according to Mr. Whiteaves:\n\nA fragment of an *Inoceramus*, valves of *Pteria*, *Cyrena*, *Ostrea* and a broken cast of a *Unio*. Of these the second and third are specifically identical with those represented on the Upper Pine River, described on p. 115 n. In addition to these a *Corbula*, the same with that from the place just referred to, and a smooth *Goniobasis* were found by us. In 1875, Mr. Selwyn procured the following fossils at Dunvegan, behind the Fort:\u2014*Ostrea* sp., *Inoceramus*, *Corbula* like *C. pyriformis* Meek, *Brachydontes multilinigera*, Meek, *Corbula*, small species, *Cyrena*, *Goniobasis*, and a small bolemnite. A specimen of *Scaphites ventricosus* was\n\n---\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, p. 63.\n\u2020 Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1876-77, table facing p. 470.\nalso found loose in Muddy Creek near Dunvegan, and at a point thirty-six miles above Dunvegan, on the Pine River, an assemblage of forms like those of Dunvegan is again found, but with the addition of a shell like a *Mactra* or *Tellina*. No molluscan fossils or determinable remains of plants were found in the Lower Sandstones on the Smoky River.\n\nThe fossils before alluded to, obtained in loose stones in the Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9, or Burnt River, by Mr. McConnell, though very like some Laramie forms, may be of the same age as those above described. They include, according to Mr. Whiteaves, the following forms: *Unio* nov. sp?, *Corbula pyriformis*? Meek, *Corbula Engelmanni*? Meek, a *Vivipara*, like *V. Conradi*, M. & H., a *Lioplax* (or *Cassiopeia*) like *L. subtortuosa*, M. & H., sp., a species of *Goniobasis*, very like the smooth-shelled variety of *G. Simpsoni* Meek.\n\nThe plant remains from the lower shales are from the Pine River Ca\u00f1on, the Forks of Pine River, and lower part of Coal Brook, places included in a district not over eight miles in diameter, and may be treated together, though the separate localities are indicated in connection with the species mentioned. The following preliminary note on these plants has been kindly furnished by Principal J. W. Dawson:\n\n**Note on Cretaceous Fossil Plants from the Peace River Country.**\n\nThe plants referred to below are of much interest, as representing in a northern locality a flora akin to that of the Dakota Group of the United States geologists, which may be regarded as Lower Cretaceous or at least as belonging to the lower part of the Middle Cretaceous, and is the oldest in which broad-leaved Exogens of similar types to those now existing predominate. It will, however, be seen, from the table (p. 128) that these plants occur in beds believed to be somewhat higher in the series, or nearly on the horizon of the Niobrara group. They will thus supply an interesting link in the history of the American Cretaceons.\n\nThe present note is intended merely as a preliminary to a more full description.\n\n1. *Cycadites.*\u2014The collection contains several leaves of this genus, all belonging to one species, and of the type of the modern *Cycas revoluta*, though of small size, the largest having been less than a foot in length. This species is closely allied to leaves of this genus found in the Cretaceous of Europe, but is probably new; and will be described under the name of *C. Unjiga*, from the Indian name of the Peace River. The specimens of this species are chiefly from Pine River Forks. One fragment occurs in the collection from Table Mountain, apparently\nFrom the reddish sandstones near the top, which contain *Inoceramus altus*, and a well preserved leaf was obtained by Mr. Selwyn from a loose slab on that part of the Peace River occupied by the Lower Sandstones twenty-five miles above Dunvegan.\n\n2. *Carpolithes.*\u2014One specimen represents a remarkable fruit which is either a nut of three centimeters in diameter, surrounded with a dense mass of radiating laminar fibres, five centimetres long, or is a rounded rhachis bearing very long fruit scales. The central mass is carbonaceous, and shining, with spiral pits marking the attachment of these surrounding organs. These are apparently flat, three millimetres wide, with a central smooth band, and scolloped or toothed edges. I can only conjecture that it may be a peculiar globular mass of fructification, possibly of some cycadaceous plant, but of course not probably belonging to that which bore the leaves above mentioned. From the Forks of Pine River.\n\n3. *Magnolia.*\u2014Of this genus there are two well-marked kinds of leaves. One of them is closely allied to *M. tenuifolia* of Lesquereux, but more acute at the point. The other is a larger leaf, seventeen centimetres in length and six broad, and remarkable for narrowing in a uniform manner from the middle to the base and apex. Both species are from Coal Brook.\n\n4. *Carya.*\u2014Leaflets of apparently a very large hickory leaf, with the nervation of this genus, but with entire edges. These specimens are from Coal Brook.\n\n5. *Protophyllum.*\u2014Of this genus, quite characteristic of the Dakota Cretaceous, but of somewhat uncertain affinities, there are two species, one of them allied to *P. rugosum* of Lesquereux, the other quite distinct, but resembling an unnamed species from the Dakota group of Ellsworth, Colorado, now in the collection of the McGill University. The specimens of both these species are from Coal Brook, where they are to be found scattered over large slabs in a fine state of preservation, but difficult to break out without proper tools.\n\n6. *Menispermites?*\u2014A very broad leaf, ten centimetres wide and seven long, cordate at base and with waved margins and seven nerves. Coal Brook.\n\n7. *Salix.*\u2014A long narrow-leaved species, like *S. flexuosa*, Newberry, or *S. protostylia*, Lesq.

From the Forks of Pine River.\n\nThe above accord with the stratigraphical position assigned to the beds, namely below the horizon of the Fort Pierre Cretaceous. It is a distinct flora from that of the Cretaceous coal-measures of Vancouver Island, or that of the Laramie or Lignite Tertiary of the plains. It is older than either, and very nearly akin to that of the Dakota group, as illustrated in Lesquereux's Memoir in the Reports of the United States Geological Survey of the Territories, and Newberry's \"Illustrations\" in the same reports.\n\nThe presence of remains of a *Cycadites* is a noteworthy feature, especially when we consider the northern latitude of the locality, and serves as a link of connection with the Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic floras. These Cycadaeaceae remains are, however, quite distinct from those from the Lower Cretaceous of the Queen Charlotte Islands, collected by Mr. Richardson and described by me in the Report of the Geological Survey of Canada for 1873.\n\nThe Lower Sandstones evidence estuarine, fresh-water and terrestrial conditions throughout, and the molluscs show a mingling of distinctively Cretaceous forms, with fresh-water types, the closest analogy of which is with those of the Laramie Group. Though some doubt may obtain as to the stratigraphical position of the fossils found loose in Rivi\u00e8re Brul\u00e9, which may possibly represent an outlier of Laramie, this need not be allowed to influence our conclusions with regard to the others. The molluscs and plants of Pine River Ca\u00f1on lie together beneath at least 1700 feet of strata, the uppermost beds of which hold *Inoceramus altus*; and judging from the general persistency in type of land and fresh-water molluscs it will be by no means surprising if, when more points of comparison are available, the earlier Cretaceous and Laramie faunas are proved to resemble each other very closely.\n\nThe Upper Shales, constituting the next overlying subdivision, were well seen only on Coal Brook and on the Smoky River. On the first-named stream, five miles east of the Lower Forks of Pine River, the Lower Sandstones are succeeded by dark grey or bluish-black thin bedded shales, of which at least 200 feet in thickness is exposed in ascending the brook to the point at which the valley becomes shallow and drift deposits conceal the underlying rocks. At their base the Upper Shales blend to some extent with the underlying sandstone forma-\ntion, and near the line of junction were found a few marine shells, among which is a small Ostrea.\n\nThe Upper Shales cross the Smoky River with a width of about thirty-six miles. The rocks are here greyish and bluish to nearly black shales, and hold abundance of ironstone, and in some places large ferro-calcareous septarian nodules. In one locality a layer of nearly pure ironstone three to four feet thick was noticed, which further down the river became a ferruginous sandstone, but maintained its place and thickness with great regularity for miles, and enabled the fact of the low southward dip of the rocks to be ascertained, by rising in the bank faster than the bed of the river could be supposed to slope down.\n\nA specimen of ironstone from this part of the Smoky River has been found by Mr. Hoffmann to contain 30.98 per cent. of metallic iron, with 15.94 of insoluble matter.\n\nNear the base of the subdivision occurs a considerable thickness of very dark shales, probably highly carbonaceous. In these the slow and smothered combustion which has given the Smoky River its name, has taken place in a number of localities, and was in progress in 1879 in a scarped bank forming the angle at the junction of the main stream with the Little Smoky. The very lowest beds of the subdivision become paler in tint near the junction with the Lower Sandstones.\n\nThe combustion of the shales on Smoky River was observed in August, 1879, in but one locality, that just alluded to. A small quantity of smoke was here seen issuing from crevices at a considerable height above the river, while reddened masses of shales indicated portions of the beds which had already been burnt out. These so-called 'Bocannes' are described by Mr. Selwyn in the report already several times referred to,* but those seen by him were nearer the mouth of Smoky River, and in the Lower Shales of my classification. At the time of my visit to Smoky River no combustion was observed in the Lower Shales, though marks of its former occurrence were seen. An examination of specimens of the shale by Mr. Hoffmann shows the presence of a large quantity of very finely divided pyrites, with carbonaceous matter. These together are quite sufficient to account for the slow combustion observed, and the pyrites may under certain circumstances spontaneously initiate the phenomenon by the heat evolved during its decomposition.\n\nFrom the upper portion of the Upper Shales on the Smoky River, a short distance north of the crossing place of the trail from Dunvegan Lake, in latitude 55\u00b0 28', a number of fossils were obtained,\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, pp. 58, 73.\namong which Mr. Whiteaves recognises the following forms, proving the horizon to be that of the Pierre Group of the Missouri region, with the addition of a few forms of the Fox Hill, or next overlying group, and establishing a close connection between those remote localities:\n\n*Hemister Humphreysianus*, Meek & Hayden.\n*Ostrota*.\n*Pteria linguiformis*, Evans & Shumard.\n*Pteria Nebrascana*, Evans & Shumard.\n*Inoceramus mytilopsis*, Conrad.

Species unrecognizable.\n\nThe Upper Sandstones and Shales are well shown at the mouth of Mountain Creek, which enters the Wapiti or Elk River thirteen miles from its mouth, and on the lower part of the Wapiti River. About the mouth of Mountain Creek are numerous exposures of horizontal beds consisting of sandstones, generally soft and flaggy, shaly sandstones, shales and clays. The sandstones are often nodular, and hold bands and sheets of ironstone, together with coaly fragments and obscure fossil plants. They are yellowish, or greyish, or bluish-grey in tint, while the shales and clays have often a brownish earthy appearance. This earthy character of parts of the formation, at times renders it difficult to distinguish it locally from the overlying drift deposits; but it would appear that at least one bed of soft rusty conglomerate is included in it. The pebbles in this are composed chiefly of Rocky Mountain quartzites, while those now found in the bed of the river show a considerable proportion of Laurentian origin. Owing to its horizontal or nearly horizontal attitude the total thickness of beds exposed, belonging to this subdivision, is not great, probably not more than 200 to 300 feet.\n\nIn Mountain Creek, large fragments of lignite coal in angular blocks which have evidently not travelled far, strew the bars. Very thin seams of coal were observed in the banks, but the loose pieces must be derived from thicker beds, which may outcrop below the water of the brook or be concealed by slides in the banks. Similar fragments of lignite coal...\nare found along the Wapiti River above the mouth of Mountain Creek, showing that coal beds must also occur on the upper course of the Wapiti.\n\nThe lowest beds of this subdivision occur on Smoky River, at the water level, about ten and a half miles below its junction with the Wapiti, but it is seen in the higher parts of the banks for about eleven and a half miles further down, or to the crossing of the trail from Dunvegan to Sturgeon Lake. Near the base, a seam of good lignite coal five inches in thickness was observed, associated with the following strata, in descending order to the water level:\n\n| Strata                                      | Feet | Inches |\n|---------------------------------------------|------|--------|\n| Shaly clay                                  |      |        |\n| Sandstones with ironstone nodules           |      |        |\n| Shales                                      |      |        |\n| Sandstone                                   |      |        |\n| Coal                                        |      |        |\n| Carbonaceous shale forming an underclay     |      |        |\n\nThickness of Subdivisions on the Smoky River.\n\nThe average southerly dip of the beds exposed in the Smoky River section appears to be at the rate of five to eight feet in the mile. Taking this in conjunction with the probable slope of the river bed, the following approximate minimum thickness for the several subdivisions as here developed, is obtained:\n\n| Subdivision                                | Thickness |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 1. Upper Sandstones and Shales, top not seen | 200       |\n| 2. Upper Shales                             | 350       |\n| 3. Lower Sandstones and Shales              | 100       |\n| 2. Lower Shales, base not seen              | 250       |\n\nNo fossils were obtained in the Upper Sandstones and Shales, nor, in the Smoky River section, in the Lower Sandstones and Shales, or Lower Shales. The lithological similarity of subdivisions 1 to 3, and 2 to 4 is so close, that it is only in an undisturbed section like that of Smoky River that their separate existence and relations could be ascertained. In the case of isolated exposures, it becomes very difficult to pronounce to which subdivision they should be assigned.\nRocks Exposed on Little Smoky River and the Athabasca.\n\nOn the upper part of the Little Smoky River, where followed by us when travelling south-eastward from Sturgeon Lake, there are numerous exposures of soft earthy sandy shales, greyish or brownish, with greyish soft or nodularly hardened sandstones, the beds being horizontal where not disturbed by slides. Drift lignite was abundant in the stream, but was not obtained in the banks. The rocks are supposed to represent the south-eastern continuation of the Upper Sandstones and Shales.\n\nOn leaving the Little Smoky, the country is entirely drift-covered to the Athabasca, but on this river exposures are frequent from the point where we reached it in longitude 116\u00b0 48', for one hundred and ten miles, or to a point about fifteen miles below the site of Old Fort Assineboine. The river is rapid, and has a considerable rate of descent throughout this part of its length, but the rocks appear to slope eastward at nearly the same angle, so that no repetition of the fine section of Smoky River is here found. The beds exposed here belong also, it is supposed, to the Upper Sandstones. They consist of sandstones and shales, the former sometimes false-bedded and often nodular, and producing in some places scarped slopes and cliffs in the banks of the valley; the latter generally brownish and earthy, though in some beds greenish-grey and rather hard. Lignite coal is frequently seen in the banks for about sixty-two miles above Fort Assineboine and several miles below that place. The exposure including lignite coal seen furthest up the river, showed, near the water's edge, the following section, in descending order:\n\n| Feet. Inches |\n|--------------|\n| Sandstones and Shales | \u2014 |\n| Shaly Lignite Coal | 3 0 |\n| Soft Sandstone and Shale | 4 0 |\n| Good Lignite Coal | 1 8 |\n\nAbout eight miles further down, in latitude 54\u00b0 11' 40\" by observation, longitude 115\u00b0 56', on the map accompanying this report, the most important deposit of lignite coal observed on the Athabasca was seen. Two beds here again occur, and are probably the same with those above mentioned. They are shown near the water's edge in a slide detached from the main bank. The upper seam here has a thickness of ten feet, without including in this measurement about six thin shaly partings, which make up in all about ten inches of shale. Below this seam is about twenty feet of soft earthy sandstone and shale, followed by a second seam of clean hard lignite coal three feet in thick-\nness. The upper seam contains, according to Mr. Hoffmann, 11.47%, the lower 10.58% per cent. of water. This percentage of water, though more than in the Pine River Forks and Mountain of Rocks coals, is far below that of the Souris region.\n\nFurther down the river, lignite coal is again seen in two thin seams, which occupy the same horizon, and the persistently coal-bearing character of the formation is thus evidenced, though the only workable seams noticed are those above mentioned. The seam occurring a few miles below Old Fort Assineboine is but four inches in thickness. The announcement of the existence of coal seams on the Athabasca was first made by Dr. Hector, who travelled up this river in the winter of 1859.\n\nNo exposures of the rocks underlying the drift deposits were found lower down the Athabasca than about fifteen miles below Old Fort Assineboine, though disturbed shales with some ironstone were noted in a few places in slides, below the mouth of the Lesser Slave Lake River, and may indicate that rocks similar to those above described continue to occur in some of the high banks of the valley. A small exposure of sandstone was found in one locality on the north bank of Lesser Slave Lake by Mr. McConnell, and fragments of lignite occur in the bed of a large stream coming from the north near the east end of the lake. Impure lignite and sandstone also appear on the Swan River and at Deer Mountain south of Slave Lake, according to Mr. Horetzky; but with these trifling exceptions no indication of the character of the beds underlying this eastern part of the region was obtained on the routes travelled to Lac La Biche and Edmonton.\n\nNote to Comparative Table of Cretaceous Rocks.\u2014In Column IV, the position of the rocks of the localities mentioned in the lowest subdivisions is uncertain. In Column V, the correspondence of the Upper Shales to the Pierre Group may be regarded as quite definitely fixed. The Productive Coal-measures in Column VII and the Chico in Column VIII, are also known to represent the Pierre horizon, while the precise equivalency of the beds overlying the Productive measures remains uncertain. In the Queen Charlotte Islands, series C. is highly fossiliferous, and its position, as indicated, may be assumed as correct, while the time covered by the overlying and underlying beds is uncertain.\n## COMPARATIVE TABLE OF CRETACEOUS ROCKS.\n\n| I.

The mass of the range appears to be composed of limestone, in which the only fossils found are with little doubt classed as Devonian. It remains uncertain whether in this part of the range any limestones of Carboniferous age comparable with the Fusulina limestones of Stuart Lake occur, but it is exceedingly probable that this is the case. To the west these limestones are supposed to be overlain by the Misinchinae schists, to the east by the Triassic Monotis beds, and it is at least possible that these overlying beds of the two sides of the range may eventually be found to be more or less strictly representative.\n\nThe thickness of the limestones must be great, but remains indeterminate. They appear to be underlain by massive quartzites, which must be exposed on the north branch of Pine River, and are described as forming the lower part of Mount Selwyn on the Peace.*\n\nDevonian and Carboniferous limestones with quartzites, are extensively displayed in the Rocky Mountain Ranges between the Peace River and the 49th parallel, and it is probable that subsequent investigation will develop the essential identity of the lower part of the section throughout this region. An important difference is found, however, in the absence of the overlying Triassic red beds with dolomitic sandstones and impressions of salt crystals, which evidence the existence on the 49th parallel and southward, of areas shut off from the ocean. To the north the beds representing these in stratigraphical position are the Monotis shales from which it would appear that at that time the open sea flowed over the Peace River country.\n\nIn the Peace River country as a whole, little altered Mesozoic rocks chiefly or entirely of Cretaceous age, occupy a width of about 330 miles, stretching from the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains eastward to a point near the Falls. The Palaeozoic rocks appear to be concealed throughout this distance, but Devonian limestones and gypsum beds emerge on the Peace River below the point just indicated, forming a portion of the belt of Devonian, and possibly in places Silurian rocks, which runs from the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers north-westward to the west end of Great Slave Lake. From the head waters of the Peace River the Rocky Mountains would appear to run nearly due north, impinging on the Mackenzie at its bend, below the mouth of the Liard. At this point the Mesozoic basin, which has been gradually narrowing northward by the convergence of its Palaeozoic\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1875-76, p. 80.\nborders, is either interrupted, or at least very much constricted. Trustworthy information concerning this northern region is however almost confined to Sir J. Richardson's necessarily brief account of it.\n\nFragments of limestone holding Devonian fossils are more or less abundantly scattered over the whole Mesozoic region. In some of these found by myself on the Wapiti River, Mr. Whitcaves finds the following forms:\n\n- *Atrypa reticularis*, Linn.\n- *Loxozema*. Casts of a small species.\n- *Euomphalus*. One cast of a small species.\n- *Orthoceras*. Fragments.\n\nIn loose stones found by Mr. McConnell on the Battle River, north of Dunvegan, the following species are represented:\n\n- *Acervularia profunda*, Hall. According to Rominger (Foss. Cor., Mich., p. 106) this is a synonym of *Cyathophyllum Davidsoni*, Milne Edwards.\n- *Atrypa reticularis*, Linn. Abundant and well preserved.\n- *Orthis* \u2014?

One example.\n- *Naticopsis* \u2014? Several casts of a species very different to the preceding.\n- *Bellerophon*. Species indeterminable.\n- *Orthoceras* \u2014? Fragments.\n- *Calymene*. Cast of the glabella of a small species.\n\nIn the annexed comparative table the equivalency of the principal western American representatives of the Cretaceous is displayed with as great accuracy as present information allows, the region north of the 49th parallel, in British Columbia, and the North-west Territories, of a portion of which the present report treats, being exhibited in the greatest detail. It will be observed that the Lower or Fort St. John Shales of the Peace River region are supposed to be equivalent to the Benton Group of Meek and Hayden's section, in a general way, while the Lower or Dunvegan Sandstones are assumed to be the representatives of the Niobrara, and the Upper Shales are without doubt referable to the Pierre Group. As the overlying Fox Hill beds, in the Rocky Mountain and Missouri regions, are conformable not only with the Pierre below but with the Laramie and Fort Union above, and as no fossils have been found in the Upper Sandstones of the Peace River country, it is impossible at present to tell whether this subdivision represents the Fox Hill Group alone or this and the Laramie.\n\nIn making these comparisons it must, however, be borne in mind that Meek and Hayden's section, though well marked in Nebraska, is\nnot found to be strictly applicable further west, in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains, and that owing to the difficulty of tracing the subdivisions in that region, Messrs. King and Hayden have agreed to name the Pierre, Niobrara and Benton Groups together, the Colorado Series. A similar change to the westward occurs north of the 49th parallel. This has already been referred to in my report on the Geology and Resources of the 49th parallel, and is found in the Peace River region even more markedly. The vicinity of the land of the Rocky Mountains, which here even at this early time existed, has given rise to the formation of thick sandstones and conglomerates, while land surfaces have occurred during the deposition of both the Lower and Upper Sandstones.\n\nThe occurrence of an estuarine and fresh-water fauna in a horizon of the Cretaceous nearly equivalent to the Niobrara, is a circumstance of great importance, and it is particularly interesting to find that the fresh-water forms resemble so closely those of the Laramie group, and have such a decided Tertiary aspect. The occurrence is analogous to that known at Coalville, in Utah, where it would appear that at a period of the Cretaceous only a little later than that of the Dunvegan Sandstones, a stream must have brought numerous fresh-water forms into the edge of the Cretaceous sea. Instead of a merely local development of such conditions, however, we have in the Peace River country a widely extended subdivision of the Cretaceous of persistent freshwater and estuarine character, which when properly studied, will add largely to our knowledge of the Cretaceous fauna. The occurrence of plants in the same beds also helps to bridge over the interval previously existing between the Dakota and Vancouver Island (Chico) and Laramie floras.\n\nOf the locality already referred to in Utah, where fresh-water and marine shells are found together in association with valuable beds of coal, Prof. Meek writes*: \"The group of fossils found in the dark indurated clay G is, in several respects, a very interesting one, not only because every species is new to science, and all of them entirely different from any yet found at any other locality, or even in any other beds of this locality (with possibly one or two exceptions), but on account of their modern affinities. Here we have from beds certainly overlaid by more than 1000 feet of strata containing Cretaceous types of fossils, a little group of forms, presenting such modern affinities that, if placed before any paleontologist unacquainted with the facts, they would be at once referred to the Tertiary.\"\n\nIn regard to the circumstances of deposit of the several subdivisions\n\n* U. S. Geol. Survey of Territories, 1872, p. 445.\nof the Cretaceous of the interior region of the continent, a somewhat detailed note may be found in the report of the 49th parallel already referred to (chap. vii.). With the light since thrown on the subject by the examination of the Peace River region, the following summary may be presented.\n\nIt would appear that the Cretaceous opened with a period of considerable land surface, shallow waters, and current-driven sandbanks, and that these circumstances not only extended from the Nebraska region westward to the Wasatch Mountains, but probably also northward to the Saskatchewan region, and possibly to the Peace River country, though no beds so low as the Dakota series have yet been recognized here. Similar conditions affected the Mississippi region, described by Prof. Hilgard, and probably at the same time the Cretaceous coast-deposits of New Jersey.\n\nThis seems to have have been followed in the interior continental region, by a general subsidence, during which the Benton shales were formed, the great quantity of fine material required being, probably, brought into the region owing to the opening by the depression of wide avenues to the north through which currents flowed southward, these shales are now known to occur northward to the Saskatchewan and Peace River districts. During a succeeding period of tranquility, in which but a small amount of detrital matter was introduced, the chalk-like Niobrara limestones of the Nebraska region were formed. These have now been found in several places along the eastern exposures of the Cretaceous north of the 49th parallel. In the Rocky Mountain region the Niobrara was a period of elevation, and calcareous beds are not so important; and it would now appear, if the correlation adopted in the table be correct and the Dunvegan Sandstones represent the Niobrara Group, that in the region of the Peace River the elevation gave rise to widely extended tracts of low land. Here probably we find the land barrier which shut out the northern currents with the sediment which they may be supposed to have carried.\n\nIn the Pierre shales, exceedingly fine in texture and of great thickness, we have evidence of a second considerable subsidence, which by again allowing the region to be traversed by marine currents, and perhaps also by bringing neighbouring decayed land surfaces under the action of the sea, supplied the necessary material. During this period, according to Meek and Hayden, a part of the clays and greensands of New Jersey were formed on the Atlantic coast; and in the Mississippi region, according to Hilgard, the Rotten-limestone Group was deposited. The fact that calcareous beds were being formed in the southern portion of the interior continental trough, while deposits so purely argillaceous were produced in the northern, seems to verify the supposition\nof the entrance of the sediment-bearing waters from the north. On the west coast, the subsidence appears to have allowed the Chico beds to spread to the foot of the Sierra, while land surfaces in Vancouver Island were brought down to the sea-level, and vegetable accumulations formed and covered by marine strata, giving rise to the valuable coal deposits of that region. Here the subsidence must have continued for a long period, while several thousand feet of strata were laid down.\n\nIn the interior continental region, either elevation followed the Pierre period, or the increase of sediments proceeded faster than the slow subsidence, for the succeeding Fox Hill period is again characterized by sands and similar shallow-water accumulations; and between the Rocky Mountains and the Wahsatch, near the western margin of the sea, land surfaces, evidenced by the occurrence of coals, existed. That the decreased depth over the interior continental region was due mainly to the filling up of the northern portion of the basin, rather than to elevation, seems to be indicated by the fact that limestones and marlites still continued to be deposited in the Mississippi region.\n\nDuring the deposition of the Upper Cretaceous, Transition or Eocene beds of the Laramie and Fort Union series, depression must have been steadily in progress, for while land surfaces are evidenced at many horizons, the thickness of the formation is very great. The accumulation of material, however, outstripped the slow sinking, for during this period marine conditions came to an end, the salt water being first excluded from the eastern, afterwards from the western part of the area.\n\n**Coal-Bearing Character of the Peace River Rocks.**\n\nIn both the horizons characterized by sandstones in the Peace River district, coal occurs, and while as above stated the upper may in part represent the Laramie, the lower is certainly well down in the Cretaceous formation. This in itself is a point of considerable importance, showing that the carboniferous character of the rocks is not confined to a single series of beds, but recurs at two stages. It also probably confirms the view advanced by Dr. Hector and supported by Mr. Selwyn, for the Saskatchewan country, as to the existence of a coal-bearing horizon in the Cretaceous of that region, in addition to that of the Tertiary or Laramie age.\n\nIt would thus appear, that while in the region lying between the Athabasca and the Peace Rivers, no coal seams sufficiently thick to be of great economic value have yet been discovered, that coal and lignite of good quality occur in two distinct series of beds. Wherever natural sections of these occur in the valleys of rivers and streams, coal\nin greater or less quantity is found, and the persistently carboniferous character of the beds thus abundantly proven. There can be little doubt that beds of a workable character exist in different parts of this district and will be found by further search.\n\nThe promising coal-bearing belt of rocks, supposed to belong to the Lower Sandstones and Shales, which runs south-eastward from the Ca\u00f1on of the Mountain of Rocks to Table Mountain and the Lower Forks of Pine River, probably extends still further in the same direction, crossing the head-waters of the Wapiti and Smoky Rivers above the points reached in my exploration, and forming the south-western side of a synclinal in which the Upper Sandstones and Shales lie. In this the coals reported by the Indians to exist on the upper parts of these rivers may occur.\n\nOn the extension of these formations to the south-eastward, a bed of coal, reported to be eight feet in thickness, occurs near the projected railway crossing of the North Pembina River, while between Fort Edmonton and the mouth of the Brazeau River, on the Saskatchewan, a seam of coal from fifteen to twenty feet in thickness was discovered by Mr. Selwyn in 1873;* and other thick seams are reported on the upper part of the Brazeau.\n\nAn analysis of the fuel from the North Pembina River made in 1874, by Prof. Haanel, gives the following composition:\n\n| Component          | Percentage |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Water              | 11.88      |\n| Volatile combustible matter | 28.66     |\n| Fixed carbon       | 57.25      |\n| Ash                | 2.21       |\n| **Total**          | **100.00** |\n\nThe coal collected by Mr. Selwyn at the place above referred to on the Saskatchewan yielded to Dr. Harrington the following result on analysis by slow coking:\n\n| Component          | Percentage |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Water              | 10.09      |\n| Volatile combustible matter | 28.69     |\n| Fixed carbon       | 54.96      |\n| Ash                | 5.45       |\n| **Total**          | **100.00** |\n\nWhile neither of these can be classed as true bituminous coals, they are fuels of great value, and compare closely with those brown coals used extensively on the line of the Union Pacific Railway in the Rocky Mountain region.\n\n* Report of Progress, Geol. Survey of Canada, 1873-74, p. 49.\nIn many localities on the Peace River, and between that stream and the Athabasca, clay ironstone in nodules and nodular shoots is abundant; but generally not in such quantity as to justify a belief in its economic importance. On the lower part of Smoky River, however, as already mentioned, great quantities of ironstone of excellent quality might be collected from the bars and beaches.\n\n**Glaciation and Superficial Deposits.**\n\nIn the report of 1878-79 it was stated that during the period of glaciation the glacier ice of the mainland probably extended to the outer islands of the Coast archipelago, and the evidence of the passage of ice over the Gnarled Islands lying in Dixon's Entrance, north of Dundas Island was noted. (p. 97 n.) The valley of the Skeena must have been one of the larger troughs by which the ice descended from the continental land, and in following the valley up, we find accordingly the traces of the seaward progress of the glacier.\n\nOn the rocks of the little promontory at Port Essington, heavy and well marked glacier grooving was observed below high-tide mark, the exposed portion of the surface being roughened by weathering. For more than forty miles up the river from this point, the rocks were very frequently noticed to be striated and grooved, while the slopes of the larger projecting masses are sometimes such as to show the effect of ice action on the mountain sides at 3000 feet above the water. Smooth glaciated surfaces are seen, however, only when the slopes have been comparatively lately bared by slides.\n\nThe signification of terraces on the sea coast is sufficiently clear, as indicating a former depression of the land, but on going inland, in a mountainous country, their meaning is by no means so easily understood. In a valley like the Skeena, glaciers may at various times have pressed so far across it as to dam back the waters and bring about the formation of terraces without any necessary alteration of the level of the land, or mere river terraces may be mistaken for traces of change in elevation. The singular absence of extensive detrital deposits along the coast, has already several times been referred to in previous publications, and those of the Queen Charlotte Islands and vicinity of Port Simpson are described in the report for 1878-79. About eighteen miles above Port Essington, on the Skeena, a somewhat extensive terrace-flat with an elevation of about 200 feet was noted, but with this exception, and that of the gravel and silty deposits of the low flats through which the river winds, no detrital deposits of importance were observed till the mouth of the Kitsumgalum River was reached. A hard gravelly deposit rising about twenty feet above the\nriver here occurs, and floors a portion of the wide valley which at this place crosses that of the Skeena. Above Sip-ki-wa rapid, terraces of gravel twenty to thirty feet in height were again observed to border the river. Between Kitsalas and Kwatsalix Caions similar deposits are seen, and terraces to a height of 170 feet above the river were found in one place. On continuing to ascend the river the amount of detrital matter and breadth of terraces increase. At Kit-wan-gah, terraces with a probable height of 200 to 500 feet were observed, while on a mountain side below that place a terrace was noted at least 1500 feet above the stream. Near the mouth of the Kitseguela some material resembling typical boulder clay occurs.\n\nIn crossing from the Forks of Skeena to Babine Lake, the rocks were observed to be glaciated in one place near the head waters of the tributaries of the Sus-kwa, the direction being westward, or down the valley. The summit passed over by the trail is formed by a wide terrace-flat, sloping gently southward. Its surface is strewn with rounded and sub-angular blocks of varied origin. Its height is about 4300 feet, and its character implies the somewhat prolonged action of the water at this level. Smaller terraces clinging to the slopes of the valleys were observed at several places immediately west of this summit, and one of these was estimated to have an elevation of about 4900 feet.\n\nAbout the shores of Babine and Stuart Lakes, superficial deposits are largely developed. Behind the Hudson Bay post at the north end of Babine Lake, two terraces were observed, the lower 160 a second 200 feet above the lake. The first of these is very well marked in many places further up the lake. On the slope of the Na-tal-kuz Mountain, terraces estimated at 800 to 1000 feet above the lake occur. Similar terrace-flats spread widely on the north-east side of Stuart Lake, and the old water-lines are even clearly shown in the cutting back of the limestone rocks near Fort St. James in a step-like manner at various elevations. The country over which the portage between the lakes is made, is for the most part a terrace-flat, with an elevation of about 400 feet above Babine Lake.\n\nThe white silt deposit of the Nechacco region, described in the report 1876-77, is not found in the valley holding Stuart and Babine Lakes, except at Fort St. James, at the southern extremity of the former. Strong currents or other causes may have prevented its deposition, but it is quite clear from the terraced character of the sides of Fran\u00e7ois, Fraser, and the two lakes just mentioned, that these formed at one time arms and bays of an extended and gradually subsiding sheet of water, in which, in the Nechacco region, the white silts were being laid down.\nOn the hills behind the Hudson Bay post at the north end of Babine Lake, the rocks show striation in a bearing of S. 24\u00b0 E., which is that of the valley. The direction of movement has probably been from north to south. On the vertical face of the low cliffs of a small island more than half way up the lake, glaciation was observed. This was evidently the result of glacier ice passing southward between the island and the main shore, and pressing upward as the degree of constriction of the passage became greater. The little island at the mouth of the Yi-ko River at the head of Stuart Lake is also glaciated, and apparently indicates a direction of movement from S. 10\u00b0 E.\n\nThe country between Stuart and McLeod Lakes has already been described as a deeply drift-covered region, rising at the Pacific-Arctic watershed to a height of 2820 feet, and lying to the north of and at a greater elevation than the white silt plain of the Lower Nechacco. The surface is generally undulating, or stretches out in wide terrace-flats, the whole indicating a general submergence as the condition for its formation. Near Carp Lake, and elsewhere, are some remarkable pot-holes, in a few cases nearly one hundred feet deep and with very steep sides. These are probably due to the simultaneous action of water and the retreating edge of a glacier, which has left pretty evident tokens of its extension into this region in the broken ridgy country found on both sides of Iroquois Creek. There can be little doubt that these ridges represent moraines, and the contemporaneous action of water is here again indicated by the presence of terraces among them. The glacier producing these moraines must have pushed thus far westward from the valleys of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe material of the drift of this region is very varied in origin, including besides rocks probably referable to the Cache Creek Series, some of Mesozoic and Tertiary origin, and also a considerable proportion of 'Quartzite drift.' On approaching McLeod Lake, the latter preponderates and is eventually found almost to the exclusion of other material. This 'Quartzite drift' was found in a former season largely developed near Fort George, and is now definitely ascertained to have come from the Rocky Mountain ranges.\n\nOn the Misinchinca River, with the exception of comparatively low terraces bordering the stream, drift deposits appear to be scantily represented, though in the valley of its tributary, the Atunatche, by which the summit of the Pine Pass is reached, the slopes are in some places heavily covered with earthy material. Rolled stones are also found several hundred feet up the mountain side above the actual summit of the Pass, and on the south-west side there appears to be a terrace at a height of 300 to 500 feet. Glaciation was observed in two or three places on the Misinchinca. The rocks are distinctly glacier marked.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA AND NORTH-WEST TERRITORY.\n\nwhere the trail crosses the river, the direction being parallel to that of the valley. At the foot of the precipice on the north side of the summit, the rocks show glaciation in a bearing of N. 60\u00b0 W.\n\nIn the upper part of the valley of Pine River, no rock striation was observed, though this would probably be found by more careful search. The soft character of the rocks is not favourable to the preservation of such marks. Drift deposits appear, however, to be almost entirely absent, and though the sides of the valley in many places simulate terraced forms, this is found to depend on the outcrop of the nearly horizontal sandstone beds. The upper part of the river is paved with glistening fragments of shistose and generally micaeous rocks derived from the mountains. The large tributary entering at the Upper Forks brings with it little but quartzite, which from its superior hardness and resistance continues to prevail on the lower reaches of the main river, the sandstone rocks disappearing.\n\nAbout twenty-eight miles above the Middle Forks, terraces of rolled gravel and fine silty sand begin to appear, one of the best marked being about 170 feet above the river. The plateau in which the river valley is excavated has a height of about 1000 feet above the river, or 3000 feet above the sea. It is not here thickly covered with drift material, but there are many water-rounded stones, a large proportion of these being hard quartzite pebbles like the more resistant materials of the axial range of the Rocky Mountains. These are mingled with a preponderating number of fragments of the softer sandstones of the country, and imbedded in a whitish or cream coloured silty clay, not unlike the material representing the boulder clay over wide districts west of the Rocky Mountains. No Laurentian or other fragments of eastern origin were observed in this region. The character of the plateau changes about the Lower Forks, and instead of showing a comparatively thin covering of drift deposits, the surface of the country is composed to a great depth of such material, the plateau having an average elevation of about 2400 feet. On Coal Creek, sections show in some places 150 feet of drift deposits resting on the Cretaceous beds, the lower part is generally gravelly, and holds boulders, while the upper is a fine silty deposit. The route followed passes over the northern spurs of the higher plateau country which is attached to the foothills to the south and west, crossing a summit of 3300 feet between Coal and Buffalo Creeks. No change in the character of the drift deposits was noted, but on reaching the D'Echafaud River, Laurentian pebbles and boulders were for the first time seen in considerable abundance. The elevation of the D'Echafaud River at this point is 2030 feet, but as the boulders now in the river bed have evidently been derived from the material of the plateau through which it is cut, the level at which\nthe Laurentian drift may be said to begin in this region must be about 2300 to 2500 feet.\n\nEast of this point, the general character of the country in regard to its superficial deposits is so uniform that it is scarcely necessary to particularize localities in describing it. The surface is thickly covered with drift deposits, so much so that exposures of the underlying rocks are, as a rule, only found in the larger river valleys. The lower layers of the drift probably represent the boulder clay of the plains to the south and east, and northern part of British Columbia to the west. They are sandy clays with stones and boulders in greater or less abundance, and their upper surface is somewhat irregular, rising in some places in ridges or broad gentle elevations which stand out above the newer silty deposits. The latter have already been spoken of in connection with the soil of the district, and cover by far the greater area of its surface. The silt is generally pale grey or fawn colour, and very fine, in some places changing to a clay, and elsewhere becoming a fine sand. A stretch of sandy country of this kind borders the lower part of the Wapiti River, and in ascending gradually toward the Athabasca, and southern rim of the Peace River basin, the silt becomes coarser and eventually sandy. During the submergence to which the deposit of the silt is due; these places must have been swept by stronger currents, preventing the finer material from falling to the bottom. The average elevation of the plateau is somewhat greater than 2000 feet, but the degree of submergence required to account for the distribution of boulders over its higher parts near the Athabasca River is at least 3300 feet. The occurrence of Laurentian boulders at this height near the Athabasca, renders it difficult to understand their apparent absence, or at least rarity, in the region about the Middle and Lower Forks of the Pine River.\n\nIn regard to the material of the drift, the stones and boulders scattered over this great district are in part those of the Rocky Mountains, in part derived from the Laurentian axis to the north and east. The fragments from the first-mentioned source are generally of hard quartzites, the limestone and other softer rocks found abundantly in the immediate vicinity of the mountains decreasing rapidly as we recede from them, and eventually all but completely disappearing. This circumstance is also observed in the vicinity of the 49th parallel.* The Laurentian material is chiefly gneiss and granite of the usual well marked types, and as above stated is still abundant at an elevation of about 3300 near the north bank of the Athabasca, at the watershed between that river and the Peace. Laurentian boulders were noted as\n\n* Geology and Resources of the 49th parallel, p. 246.\nabundant in the lower part of the Smoky River, and some particularly large ones on the Athabasca between the mouth of Lesser Slave River and the Landing.\n\nBetween the Landing and Edmonton, Laurentian boulders are in some places exceedingly numerous, but quartzite from the Rocky Mountains is still present. The sandy hills forming the watershed between the Athabasca and Saskatchewan, with an elevation of about 2500 feet, in their forms and material show evidence of strong current action.\n\nThe circumstances causing the glaciation of British Columbia and the sequence of the various phenomena have been discussed in previous reports, and in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society.* It will consequently be unnecessary to recapitulate the details of evidence collected in various regions, but it may be stated that the main question seemed to resolve itself into two possible cases. A general north-to-south movement of ice is indicated by striation in a number of places extending over a length of about 450 miles in the interior plateau region. The same region is covered with drift deposits requiring by their character and mode of arrangement the action of water from elevations exceeding 5000 feet downward. To account for these facts, the flow of strong Arctic currents bearing heavy ice during a period of great submergence may be supposed, or it may be necessary to believe, that the whole region has been buried under a massive confluent glacier, the drift deposits being laid down as it retreated either during a period of submergence, or in water held back by glacier-dams in the valleys of the various mountain ranges.\n\nIt was supposed that the gaps of Peace and Pine Rivers in the Rocky Mountain ranges, might have sufficed for the entrance from the north-east of such currents and masses of ice as would be required by the first theory. But the examination of the region with this supposition in view, has convinced me that notwithstanding the general decrease in elevation and width of the Rocky Mountains, the valleys of the Peace and Pine are too narrow and indirect, and the surrounding mountains too high, to allow the inflow of sufficient currents with the degree of subsidence which would be indicated by most of the localities of glaciation and by the superficial deposits. Neither is there any evidence of the passage of drift material in this region across the mountains either from east to west or in the opposite direction. It therefore remains as the most probable hypothesis that a great glacier mass has filled the region between the Coast Ranges and Gold and Rocky Mountains, which may be designated as the interior plateau, moving, though perhaps very slowly, southward and south-eastward from the\n\n* Report of Progress Geol. Survey of Canada, 1877-78, p. 150 B, 1878-79, p. 98 B. Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc., 1878, p. 117.\nregion of great precipitation and high mountains of the northern part of the province, and discharging by the Okanagan depression and through the valleys of the Coast Range.\n\nIt still appears to me most probable, however, that this stage of the glacial period was closed by a general submergence, during which the deposit spoken of as boulder clay was laid down, and as the land again rose many of the terraces and benches were formed. Conditions may be invented to account for the temporary existence of a great lake over the Interior Plateau of British Columbia, but this will not explain the great submergence which appears to be required by the drift-deposits of the east side of the Rocky Mountains, which were probably produced at the same time and by the same agencies. The last stage of the glacial period in the northern low country of British Columbia appears to have given rise to the silts of the Lower Nechacco basin, while to the north-east, on the opposite side of the Rocky Mountains, similar deposits were laid down over the Peace River country. The general elevation of the white silt plains of the Nechacco is somewhat less than 2600 feet, of the Peace River country between 2000 and 2500 feet.\n\nThe general question of the origin of the drift-deposits of the great plains, and more particularly of the western portion, having been fully discussed in the Geology and Resources of the 49th Parallel, and in a paper communicated to the Geological Society of London,* it will be unnecessary to enter at length into it here. The most prominent feature of the glacial deposits of the plains is the Missiouri Coteau, which it was supposed ran northward from the region in the vicinity of the 49th parallel where it was more particularly studied, nearly following the margin of the third prairie steppe. This supposition has since been in great measure confirmed, and on the journey from Edmonton to Winnipeg in the Autumn of 1879, I was able to examine cursorily the character of the third prairie steppe where it touches the north Saskatchewan near the Elbow, and to observe the great accumulation of heavy boulders of eastern and northern origin in that vicinity. Further north, with the general lowering of the surface of the country, the well defined zone of drift deposits known as the Coteau appears to be lost, the material being scattered broadcast over a wide surface, and approaching in considerable mass the high lands near the base of the Rocky Mountains. It will have been observed, however, that over the entire area examined, the material from the Rocky Mountains has also been strewn eastward, implying a sea in which ice bearing debris both from the Laurentian Axis and Rocky Mountains floated freely.

The temperature is stated in degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe force of the wind is estimated according to Beaufort's scale. The proportion of sky covered by clouds is estimated on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being a cloudless, blue sky, 10 an overcast sky. The character of the clouds is denoted by the usual letters or combinations of letters referring to Howard's classification.\n\nThe state of the weather is denoted by the following letters:\u2014b, blue sky; c, detached clouds; d, drizzling rain; f, fog; h, hail; l, lightning; m, misty; o, overcast; p, passing showers; q, squally; r, rain; s, snow; t, thunder; w, wet, meaning dew. A letter repeated denotes intensity, as rr much rain, and a figure attached duration in hours, as 7d, seven hours drizzling rain.\n\n| PLACE                        | Date   | Hour     | Barometer | Temperature of Air | Maximum | Minimum | Direction of Wind | Force of Wind | Kind of Cloud | Weather at Time | Weather during Next Interval | Remarks |\n|------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------------|---------|---------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|---------|\n| Port Essington               | June 7 | 10 00 a.m.| 30.27     |                    |         |         |                  |               | C.K. & S.    |                 | o, cc Westerly wind                |         |\n| Skeena River                 |        | 3 30 p.m.| 30.22     |                    | 53.0    |         | Wes'tly          | 2             | C.K.         |                 | o, cc Westerly wind                |         |\n| \"                            |        | 6 00 p.m.| 30.065    |                    | 59.0    |         | S.S.W.           | 3             | K.           |                 | b, c; clouding                      |         |\n| \"                            |        | 9 00 a.m.| 30.045    |                    | 48.5    | 63.0    | N.E.             | 3             | S. & K.S.    |                 | o, nearly calm                     |         |\n| Skeena River (38 miles up)   |        | 10 00 a.m.| 30.065    |                    | 48.5    |         | Wes'tly           | 1             | S. & K.S.    |                 | Mist on hills                      |         |\n| Skeena River (48 miles up)   |        | 11 00 a.m.| 30.225    |                    | 47.5    |         | E'Strly          | 1             | C.K.         |                 | b, c, westerly wind                 |         |\n| Skeena River (58 miles up)   |        | 12 00 a.m.| 30.175    |                    | 56.5    |         | S.W.             | 3             | K.S.         |                 | o, p, calm                        |         |\n| Lakelse River                |        | 12 00 a.m.| 30.17      |                    | 61.0    |         | W.S.W.           | 3             | K. & K.S.    |                 | b, c, p, westerly wind              |         |\n| \"                            |        | 13 00 a.m.| 30.215    |                    | 40.0    |         | S.W.S.W.          | 3             | K. & K.S.    |                 | b, c, nearly calm                   |         |\n| Mumford Landing              |        | 13 00 p.m.| 30.75     |                    | 52.5    |         | E.S.E.           | 3             | K. & K.S.    |                 | b, c, S.E. wind                    |         |\n| 24 miles below Kitselas Canon|        | 14 00 p.m.| 30.110    |                    | 44.0    |         | E'Strly          | 1             | S. & C.S.    |                 | b, c, p, strong west wind           |         |\n| (20' above river)            |        | 15 00 p.m.| 30.045    |                    | 52.5    |         | W.S.W.           | 4             | K. & C.K.    |                 | 5.30 a.m., clouds down on hills     |         |\n\n*Note:* The barometer readings are those of a small aneroid, and therefore to be depended upon only as indicating relative changes of pressure.

DAWSON, D.S., A.R.S.M., F.G.S.\n\nThe following notes and map are presented as a contribution towards our knowledge of the range of some of the trees of British Columbia, based on notes and observations made by myself while engaged in the work of the Geological Survey from 1875 to 1879. I am indebted to Mr. H. J. Cambie of the Canadian Pacific Railway for notes on the extension of certain trees from the coast up the valleys of the Homathco and Dean or Salmon Rivers. In a few cases I have availed myself of facts published in Prof. Macoun's reports, and I am also indebted to Prof. Macoun for valuable notes on the first edition of this article. I have also to thank Dr. Engelmann for information furnished in regard to the specific relations of specimens collected in various parts of the province.\n\nSince the publication of the first edition of these notes in the Canadian Naturalist, Prof. C. S. Sargent, Dr. Engelmann and Prof. Parry, have together visited a portion of the southern part of British Columbia, for the purpose of extending their observations on the distribution of forest trees. I am indebted to Prof. Sargent for several additional facts now incorporated in these pages. The lines on the map have also been slightly modified in some respects since the publication of the first edition.\n\nBritish Columbia forming a portion of the Cordillera region of the west coast of America, with diversified and bold physical features, the lines indicating the geographical range of the various species of plants do not assume in it the broad rounded forms found in less mountainous districts. The peculiarities in distribution, while adding interest to the study, renders an intimate knowledge of the topography of the country an essential prerequisite to its prosecution. As large tracts of the province are as yet geographically unknown owing to their remoteness and singular impenetrability, we are far from possessing complete information on the distribution of many of even the more important species.\n\nIt is not intended to give a description of the orography of the province, though as above indicated this is closely connected with the extension of the various species of plants. The following general\n\n* These notes were first printed in the Canadian Naturalist, Vol. IX., No. 9, but have since been corrected in some particulars and added to.\nstatement made by me in a note on agriculture and stock raising and extent of cultivable land in the province,* may, with little alteration, be repeated here, as outlining the conditions to be found within its area:\u2014The flora of British Columbia as a whole may be broadly divided into four groups, indicating as many varieties of climate, which may be named as follows: the West Coast, the Western Interior, the Canadian, and the Arctic. The first, with an equable climate and heavy rainfall, is characterized by a correspondent luxuriance of vegetation, and especially of forest growth. This region is that west of the Coast Range, and is well marked by the peculiarity of its plants. In a few spots only\u2014and these depending on the dryness of several of the summer months owing to local circumstances\u2014does a scanty representation of the drought-loving flora of the Californian coast occur. The second is that of the southern part of the interior plateau of the province, and presents as its most striking feature a tendency to resemble in its flora the interior basin of Utah and Nevada to the south and the drier plains east of the Rocky Mountains. It may be said to extend northward to about the 51st parallel, while isolated patches of a somewhat similar flora occur on warm hill-sides and the northern banks of rivers to beyond the Blackwater. In the northern part of the interior of the province, just such an assemblage of plants is found as may be seen in many parts of eastern Canada, though mingled with unfamiliar stragglers. This flora appears to run completely across the continent north of the great plains, and characterizes a region with moderately heavy rainfall, summers not excessively warm, and cold winters. The arctic or alpine flora is that of the higher summits of the Coast, Selkirk, Rocky and other mountain ranges, where snow lies late in the summer. Here plants lurk which deploy on the low grounds only on the shores of Hudson Bay, the Icy Sea and Behring's Strait.\n\nIn the following notes the Conifer\u00e6 are placed first, as having the greatest importance both from an economic point of view, and from the vast extent of country which they cover almost to the exclusion of other trees.\n\nPseudotsuga Douglasii, Lindl., Douglas spruce, Douglas fir, sometimes commercially named 'Oregon pine.'\u2014This is the most important timber tree of British Columbia, and the only one of which the wood has yet become an article of export on a large scale. It is found in all parts of Vancouver Island with the exception of the exposed western coast, but does not occur in the Queen Charlotte Islands or coast archipelago to the north of Vancouver. On the mainland, near the 49th parallel, it extends from the sea to the Rocky Mountains, growing at a\n\n* Canadian Pacific Railway Report, 1877. Appendix S.\nheight of 6000 feet in a stunted form, and occurring on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains on the 49th parallel, and also according to Prof. Macoun, about the mouth of Kananaskis and up the valley of Bow River. In the dry southern portion of the interior of British Columbia it is confined to the higher uplands between the various river valleys. Northward it comes down to the general level of the country. It does not extend into the mountainous and comparatively humid region of Cariboo, and is probably absent from the higher portions of the Selkirk and Gold Ranges generally. Its northern line is singularly irregular. It is found about Fort George, and northeastward as far as McLeod's Lake, but does not occur on the Parsnip. It extends about half-way up Tacla Lake, and on Babine Lake to the bend or knee. A few specimens occur on the Skeena River. It is common about Fraser and Fran\u00e7ois Lakes. It is found from the Fraser to the coast mountains on the line of the Chilecotin and its tributaries, and occurs on the Nazeo and up the Blackwater to the mouth of the Iscultaesli, but is absent from an extensive tract of country bounded by the last-named localities to the south and east, and extending northward to Fran\u00e7ois Lake. It occurs abundantly on the coast of the mainland as far north as the north end of Vancouver Island, but beyond that point is found only on the shores of the inlets at some distance from the sea. It is found on the upper part of Dean Inlet and on the Salmon River which runs into it, but about forty-five miles from the salt water becomes small and stunted, and as above stated, is not seen in that part of the interior lying to the eastward.\n\nThe extent of its range to the north-eastward, in the Rocky Mountain Lumber Range, though broadly indicated on the map, is still uncertain.\n\nThe best grown specimens are found near the coast in proximity to the waters of the many bays and inlets which indent it. Here the tree frequently surpasses eight feet in diameter, at a considerable height above the ground, and reaches a height of from 200 to over 300 feet, forming prodigious and dark forests. The wood varies considerably in appearance and strength according to its locality of growth and other circumstances. It is admirably adapted for all ordinary purposes of construction, and of late has obtained favourable notice in ship-building, remaining sound in water for a long time. For spars and masts it is unsurpassed both as to strength, straightness and length. Masts for export are usually hewn to octagonal shape from 20 to 32 inches in diameter and 60 to 120 feet in length. On special orders they have been shipped as large as 12 inches in diameter by 120 feet long. Yards are generally hewn out from 12 to 24 inches in diameter and 50 to 120 feet long.\n\nMasts and spars are generally sent to Great Britain; other forms\nof lumber to South America, Australia, India, China and the Sandwich Islands.\n\n**Tsuga Mertensiana**, Lindl. Western hemlock.\u2014The hemlock occurs everywhere in the vicinity of the coast, and extends up the Fraser and other rivers to the limit of the region of abundant rainfall. It reappears in the Selkirk and Gold Ranges, where sufficient moisture for its growth is again found. The tree attains a large size on the coast, reaching a height of 200 feet, and yields a good wood, but has not yet been much used. The bark is employed successfully in tanning. *Tsuga Mertensiana* closely resembles the eastern hemlock (*T. Canadensis*) but attains a larger size than that tree ever does.\n\nIn the Queen Charlotte Islands it is particularly abundant and large. On the Salmon River, running into Dean Inlet, it is not found in abundance beyond eighteen miles from the sea, at an elevation of 600 feet. It occurs again, however, sparingly on the lower part of the Iltasyouco River, a tributary to the last within the Coast Range. On the Homathco River, flowing into Bute Inlet, it ceases at fifty-three miles from the sea at an elevation of 2320 feet. On the Uz-tli-hoos* it extends to a point six or ten miles east of the Fraser, on the Coquihalla to the summit between that river and the Coldwater. It is mentioned by Sir A. Mackenzie (Voyages, p. 223) as occurring at the headwaters of the Parsnip (about lat. 54\u00b0 30'). This is the most northern locality yet known.\n\n**Tsuga Pattoniana**, Engelm. (*Abies Williamsonii.*)\u2014This tree has been found by Mr. Sargent on Silver Mountain between 4000 and 6000 feet elevation, and it is suggested may extend much further north, as it is essentially alpine in habit, and in the Sierra and Cascade Mountains almost always associated with *Pinus Albicaulis*.\n\n**Thuja gigantea**, Nutt.\u2014Western arbor vitae, Giant cedar, Red cedar.\u2014This tree in its distribution nearly follows that of the hemlock, abounding along the coast and lower parts of the rivers of the Coast Range, being unknown in the dry central plateau, but reappearing abundantly on the slopes of the Selkirk and Gold Ranges. On the Salmon River the cedar ceases at forty-five miles from the head of Dean Inlet at an elevation of 2400 feet, though like the hemlock it is again found sparingly and in a stunted form in the lower part of the Iltasyouco valley. On the Homathco it ceases at a distance of sixty-three miles from the coast at an elevation of 2720 feet. On the Uz-tli-hoos it ends with the hemlock at about six miles east of Boston Bar; on the Coquihalla, just south of the summit between that river and the Coldwater. Cedars are also found sparingly on the Sknist River or east branch of the Skagit, and a few were observed on the banks of the Similkameen,\n\n---\n\n* North-east branch of the Anderson, followed by the trail from Boston Bar to Nicola.\nabout thirteen miles below Vermilion Forks. It extends westward from the flanks of the Gold Range in the Coldstream valley sparingly to within eight miles of the head of Okanagan Lake. It abounds round the shores of the north-eastern part of Shuswap Lake, and in the North Thompson valley to about twenty miles below the mouth of the Clearwater. It is said that there is also a grove of these trees on the Fraser below Fort George. It also grows in the Quesnel River valley. Sir A. Mackenzie (1793) mentions the occurrence of this tree with the hemlock at the head waters of the Parsnip. So far as at present known this is its northern limit.\n\nOn the coast it not unfrequently surpasses fifteen feet in diameter with a height of 100 to 150 feet, but such large trees are invariably hollow. The wood is good, pale yellowish or reddish, and very durable, but it is not yet extensively used except for the manufacture of shingles. From this tree the Indians split out the planks which they use in the construction of their lodges along the coast, and in the north make the carved posts which ornament their villages. They also hollow their large and elegant canoes in it, and use the fibre of the inner bark for rope-making and other purposes.\n\nPicea Engelmanni, Parry. Engelmann's spruce.\u2014This tree frequently surpasses three feet in diameter, and runs up tall, straight, and to a great height. It appears to characterise the interior plateau and eastern part of the province, with the exception of the dry southern portion of the former, and forms dense forests in the mountains. Varieties occur, which, according to Dr. Engelmann, who has examined my specimens, are almost indistinguishable from Picea alba, and to the north-eastward these varieties preponderate. Specimens collected on the Peace River plateau (lat. 55\u00b0 46' 54\", long. 120\u00b0 20', altitude 2600 feet) are still referable to P. Engelmanni, but trees on the Athabasca (lat. 54\u00b0 7' 34\", long. 118\u00b0 48\") belong to P. alba. The northern and north-eastern range of Engelmann's spruce is therefore indeterminate.\n\nIt borders nearly all the streams and swamps in the northern portion of British Columbia between about 2500 and 3500 feet in elevation. It is probably this tree which forms dense groves in the upper alpine valleys of the Rocky Mountains in the vicinity of the 49th parallel. The wood has not yet been extensively employed, but it is excellent, and in some cases very durable.\n\nPicea Menziesii, Lindl. (=P. Sitchensis Carri\u00e8re according to Mr. Menzie's spruce C. S. Sargent.) Menzie's spruce.\u2014This tree seems to be confined chiefly to the immediate vicinity of the coast, where it attains a very large size, and is to some extent used for lumber. It was, however, observed on the summit between the Coldwater and Coquihalla Rivers (3280 feet); also on the Nicolume a few miles beyond the summit between\nthat stream and the Sumallow, and on the west side of the Spios valley near the trail crossing. It was noted (doubtfully) on the summit between the Forks of Skeena and Babine Lake, and may probably occur in the humid region of the Gold and Selkirk Ranges. The wood is white and free.\n\n**Abies grandis.** *Abies grandis*, Lindl.\u2014Confining to the vicinity of the coast, where its range appears to be even more strictly limited than that of the cedar or hemlock. The wood is said to be white and soft, but too brittle for most purposes, and moreover liable to decay rapidly. Grows to a large size.\n\nThis tree, Mr. C. S. Sargeant remarks, may eventually be found extending further into the interior of British Columbia than we now suppose, in view of the fact that it is to be found on the Columbia as far as the Upper Cascades, and in the mountains just south of the Columbia is found at an elevation of nearly 4000 feet.\n\n**Balsam spruce.** *Abies subalpina*, Engelm. (=*A. lasiocarpa* Hook.) Balsam spruce.\u2014Appears to take the place of *Abies grandis* in the region east of the Coast Ranges. It is not found in the southern dry portion of the interior plateau, but occurs abundantly in the Gold and Selkirk Ranges in the Rocky Mountain region east of McLeod's Lake. Elsewhere it occurs in scattered groves, in the northern portion of the interior plateau, generally in localities nearly reaching or surpassing 4000 feet, but even in low valleys in the eastern portion of the Coast Ranges. It crosses the Rocky Mountains in the Peace River district and occurs in cold damp situations in the country between Lesser Slave Lake and the Athabasca River. The tree often exceeds two feet in diameter, but the wood is said to be almost worthless.\n\n**Abies amabilis.** *Abies amabilis*, Douglas, (=*A. grandis* var. *densiflora*, Engelmann.) This tree is added to the list of species of British Columbia on the authority of Mr. C. S. Sargent, who communicates the fact of its discovery on the high mountain directly behind Yale, known as Silver Mountain. Prof. Sargent subsequently found this tree in Douglas' original locality south of the Columbia. He suggests that it may in some cases have been confounded with *A. subalpina*.\n\n**Pinus ponderosa**, Doug. Yellow pine, Red pine, Pitch pine.\u2014A remarkably handsome tree, which grows only in the central dry region of British Columbia, occurring between the Coast Ranges and Selkirk and Gold Ranges northward from the 49th parallel to latitude 51\u00b0 30' and probably also to about latitude 51\u00b0 in the valley of the upper portion of the Columbia. Found also I believe sparingly on the east side of the Rocky Mountains near Waterton Lake on the 49th parallel, and on the Bow River above Morleyville. On the Similkameen this tree is seen furthest east three miles above Nine-mile Creek.\nthe Coldwater it reaches to eighteen or twenty miles from the Nicola; down the Fraser to thirty miles above Yale, and northward on the main waggon road to \"the Chasm\" beyond Clinton. It extends for about forty miles up the North Thompson, is found on the northern slopes of the South-western Arm of Great Shuswap Lake, and also sparingly on the southern part of the Salmon Arm. West of Okanagan Lake towards Cherry Creek nearly to the Camel's Hump Mountain.\n\nIt is pretty extensively used in the region which it characterizes, yielding sawn lumber of good appearance, but rather brittle and not very durable when exposed to the weather. It grows in open groves in the valleys, where it often occurs almost to the exclusion of other trees; and stretches up the slopes of the mountains and plateaux to a height of over 3000 feet, where it is replaced by the Douglas fir and *Pinus contorta*. Its diameter in British Columbia does not seem to exceed four feet, though further south it is said to reach a diameter of twelve to fifteen feet.\n\n*Pinus contorta*, Doug. Western Scrub pine, also called the Bull or Black pine.\u2014Occurs throughout British Columbia from the sea coast to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, and from the 49th parallel northward. It is the characteristic tree over the northern part of the interior plateau, and densely covers great areas. In the southern part of the province it is found on those parts of the plateau and hills which rise above about 3500 feet, where the rainfall becomes too great for the healthy growth of *P. ponderosa*. It grows also abundantly on sandy benches and river flats at less elevations. On the coast it occurs rather sparingly on sandy dunes and the most exposed rocky points, becoming gnarled and stunted. In the Queen Charlotte Islands it is scarcely seen except on the western coast, and does not occur near the water level for a considerable distance up the Skeena. In the interior it often forms dense groves, the trees being 60 to even 100 feet in height, but seldom exceeding a diameter of two feet. It does not extend upward to the timber limit in the higher mountains. The tree characteristic of the interior is var. *latifolia* of Engelmann, and differs considerably in appearance and character of wood from that of the coast to which the name *contorta* may appropriately be applied. Dall states the northern limit of this tree in Alaska to be on the Youkon at Fort Selkirk, latitude 63\u00b0. In the Peace River region it crosses the Rocky Mountain Range, and occurs more or less abundantly over a great area, generally on the higher parts of the plateau with poor soil. It is replaced by the Banksian pine at the watershed between the Athabasca and Saskatchewan, south of Athabasca Landing. Further up the Athabasca the line between these pines passes near Fort Assiniboine, according to Prof. Macoun. Prof. Macoun also states that the *Pinus contorta* occurs\nat the Cypress Hills, and for twenty miles east of Fort Walsh. I have little doubt that it is the same tree which clothes the upper part of the Buttes on the 49th parallel, in longitude 111\u00b0.\n\nThe wood is seldom used as lumber on account of its small size, but is white and fairly durable. The cambium layer, containing much sugar, is eaten by the Indians in the spring, and in some instances large quantities of it are collected and dried for winter use.\n\n*Pinus albicaulis*, Engelm. White pine, White-barked pine.\u2014Wood not employed as lumber; the trees being in general small and in inaccessible situations. Observed in the Coast or Cascade Ranges as far north as the Iltyouco River (lat. 53\u00b0). Occurs in the mountains south of the upper part of the Dean or Salmon River, in the vicinity of Lillooet and at Yale, and on the summit of Iron Mountain at the mouth of the Coldwater. Noted by Mr. Sargent on Silver Mountain, near Yale, at 5000 feet elevation. The seeds are collected and used as food by the Indians.\n\n*Pinus monticola*, Dougl. White pine.\u2014This tree is abundant in certain districts of the interior of Vancouver Island, and is also found in all parts of the southern portion of the Coast Range where there is an abundant rainfall. It is found on the Hope-Similkameen trail, some miles beyond the summit on the Sumallow, about the summit between the Coquihalla and Coldwater on the Hope-Nicola trail; and to the west bank of the Spioos at the trail crossing. On the Homathco River it disappears at fifty-one miles from the sea at an elevation of 2235 feet. It re-appears in the region of heavy rainfall of the Gold Range, being abundant about Cherry Creek and on the shores of Great Shuswap and Adam's Lakes. It has not been observed in the Queen Charlotte Islands, though it may exist there. It appears to flourish best in the higher mountain regions. The tree attains sixty to eighty feet in height with a diameter of two to three feet, but is generally most abundant in situations inaccessible to the lumberer. The wood is coming into use for some purposes. It is not considered equal to that of the eastern white pine (*P. strobus*) which it resembles. The Indians collect and eat the seeds of this tree.\n\n*Chamaecyparis Nuthaensis*, Lamb. Yellow cypress.\u2014Commonly known as the Yellow cedar. This tree is pretty closely confined to the vicinity of the coast and adjacent islands. It is found about Burrard Inlet, on the slopes of the mountains, several hundred feet above the sea level. On Silver Mountain, near Yale, Mr. Sargent describes a few large trees as occurring at 4000 feet elevation, and many smaller ones extending up to 5500 feet. Further north it descends to the coast. It occurs in the interior of Vancouver Island, and is abundant in some parts on the Queen Charlotte Islands, particularly on the west coast. It often exceeds six feet in diameter. This wood is as\nyet comparatively unknown in commerce, but is strong, free and of fine grain, with a pale golden yellow tint and a slight peculiar resinous smell. It is very durable and has been used to a limited extent in boat-building and for various ornamental purposes.\n\n*Larix occidentalis*, L. Western larch.\u2014Is found in the Rocky Mountains and in the valleys of Selkirk and Gold Ranges, its limit there being co-extensive with that of abundant rainfall. Stretches westward nearly to the head of Okanagan Lake. The summit between Osoyoos Lake and Kettle River was called Larch Tree Hill by the Boundary Commission expedition, this being the first place at which the tree was found abundantly in travelling eastward. Not found on the coast. The timber is said to be strong and durable but coarse.\n\nA species of larch, which from imperfect specimens submitted to him Dr. Engelmann supposed to be *L. Americana*, occurs abundantly in swampy spots on the Peace River plateau and on the Athabasca.\n\n*Larix Lyallii*.\u2014Specimens of this tree which, according to Mr. Sargent, is evidently a distinct species, were collected by Lyall in the \"Galton Range,\" which lies immediately west of the Rocky Mountains near the 49th parallel. Very little is known about this larch.\n\n*Taxus brevifolia*, Nutt. Yew.\u2014Occurs on Vancouver Island, and on the shores of the mainland adjacent, attaining sometimes a diameter of two feet. It is found as large as eighteen inches in diameter on the Fraser as far up as Chapman's Bar, near the Suspension Bridge. It also occurs on the Coquihalla for twenty miles above Hope, and is found on the Lower Skeena. Not found, or very sparingly, in the Queen Charlotte Islands. A very tough hard wood of beautiful rose color, employed for various ornamental purposes. Formerly used by the Indians in making bows, spear-handles, fish-hooks, &c.\n\n*Juniperus virginiana*, L. Juniper, Red cedar, Savin.\u2014Has been observed assuming an arboreal form along the shores of Kamloops, Fran\u00e7ois and other lakes, and elsewhere, with a diameter of about one foot. Also observed at Esquimalt and Departure Bay, Vancouver Island. Commonly know as pencil cedar.\n\n*Acer macrophyllum*, Pursh. Maple.\u2014Found on Vancouver and adjacent Islands, and on the mainland in the immediate vicinity of the coast northward sparingly to latitude 55\u00b0, and in the Queen Charlotte Islands. Never found inland. Occasionally attains a diameter of four feet. A valuable hard wood, sometimes well adapted for cabinet-making, and also used as fuel.\n\n*Acer circinatum*, Pursh. Vine maple.\u2014Like the last strictly confined to the vicinity of the coast, but does not appear to go far north. A small tree, seldom over a foot in diameter, but yielding a very tough and strong white wood, which is used, in the absence of ash, for the manufacture of shelves, &c.\nPirus rivularis, Doug. Crab-apple.\u2014Occurs along the coast of Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands, and the whole coast of the mainland of British Columbia. On the Skeena abundant to the mouth of Lakelse and a few trees seen at ninety miles from the sea. A small tree or shrub. Wood very hard, but liable to check, susceptible of a good polish, and especially valuable in those parts of mill machinery intended to withstand great wear. Fruit prized by the Indians as food.\n\nPirus sambucifolia, Cham. and Schlect. Mountain ash.\u2014Sparingly in various parts of the interior of the Province. A small tree or bush.\n\nAmalanchier alnifolia, Watson. Service-berry, 'la poire.'\u2014Occurs on Vancouver Island and very rarely and in a stunted form in the Queen Charlotte Islands. Abundant in some parts of the interior plateau and beyond the Rocky Mountains to the north-eastward in the Peace River country. Generally a shrub. Under favourable circumstances a small tree. The wood is very hard and is used for various purposes by the Indians. The berries are dried and stored away in large quantities for winter use.\n\nQuercus Garryana, Doug. Oak.\u2014Flourishes in the south-eastern portion of Vancouver Island, though Mr. A. C. Anderson mentions the existence of a few trees a mile and a half above Yale, on the Frazer River, and these Mr. Cambie informs me are still to be seen. Reaches a diameter of three feet and a height of about seventy feet. Used for flooring and other purposes in building, and also in the manufacture of barrels and kegs. A hard wood but not very tough. It spreads along the inner coast of Vancouver Island northward to Nanaimo, and occurs also on Quatsino Sound still further north, though there scarce. I have not observed it myself in the last-named locality, but occurrence is vouched for on good authority.\n\nAlnus rubra, Bongard. Alder.\u2014Attains the dimensions of a small tree on Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands and the coast of the mainland. On the Lower Fraser sometimes two feet in diameter. The wood is easily worked, being well adapted for turning and susceptible of a good polish. It is largely employed in Portland, Oregon, for the manufacture of furniture. Also used for the manufacture of charcoal.\n\nBetula occidentalis, Hook. Western birch.\u2014A small tree generally belonging to the dry interior flora. Found pretty widely distributed in British Columbia, and according to Prof. Macoun on both branches of the Saskatchewan, but the precise limits of range not known.\n\nBetula papyracea, Ait. Paper birch, Canoe birch.\u2014This tree appears to find its southern limit on the Lower Fraser and occurs in a number of localities in British Columbia, and abundantly in the Peace River district.\nPopulus tremuloides, Michx. Aspen poplar.\u2014Abounds over the whole interior of the province, growing everywhere in the north and characterizing some of the most fertile lands. In the southern dry portions of the interior found usually along the borders of streams, and on the higher plateaux. First noticed in abundance on the Skeena at about 110 miles from the sea. It forms the usual second growth after fires in the Peace River country. Attains frequently a diameter of two feet.\n\nPopulus trichocarpa, T. & G. Cottonwood.\u2014There is some difficulty in separating this tree, a western form, from P. monilifera and P. balsamifera in the northern and north-eastern part of British Columbia. The eastern species P. monilifera, according to Mr. Sargent, certainly extends across the continent into Alaska. Prof. Macoun informs me that he believes P. trichocarpa does not occur on the Fraser above Yale, while he found P. balsamifera on the Parsnip and Peace Rivers, and in the river bottoms of the South Saskatchewan and its tributaries P. monilifera. These poplars are commonly included under the name of 'Cottonwood,' and are found in the valleys of streams and on the banks of rivers generally throughout the province and in the Peace River district, attaining sometimes a diameter of four to five feet. Used by the Indians of the interior for the manufacture of canoes. P. trihocarpa is now largely employed at some places on Puget Sound in the manufacture of staves for sugar barrels which are used at San Francisco for the Sandwich Island crop.\n\nArbutus Menziesii, Pursh. Arbutus, Madrona.\u2014Occurs on Vancouver and the neighbouring islands, but never far from the sea. It is sparingly represented as far north as Seymour Narrows. A very handsome evergreen yielding a white close-grained heavy wood, resembling box. Attains a diameter of from eighteen inches to two feet, and a height of fifty feet.\n\nCornus Nuttallii, Aud. Dogwood.\u2014On Vancouver Island and the coast of the mainland adjacent, attaining the dimensions of a small tree. Wood close-grained and hard.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/cihm_03655.pdf",
