Smith Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBeantford, Ont.\nChamplain, Oct. 21st\n\nFrank Miller Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Dept.,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTwo months ago I secured a contract from the Six Nations Council for $110.00 to move my school to some spring corner. The specifications did not say anything about time to do it. I figured on doing it in good weather with one traction engine. Right after I got the contract, Tess Garrison Inspector of roads, told me I must do it at once, thus changing the specifications. I started it but before going far the weather got bad and one engine could not take it further. I was going to leave it for good weather but second ships told me to go on by a man and they would see that I got extras. I tried another engine at $59 an hour and on account of the weather and roads and second engine my account ran up to my $172.00. Now I cannot get more than $110.00. There is a block somewhere. In good weather as I figured I would have come out all right with one engine. The Inspector changed the specifications after I got the job by compelling me to go ahead in bad weather when no time was specified; my bill of $172.00 is the closest possible figuring and all I ask is extras ($172.00 - $110.00) = $62.00 owing to change of specifications, the time compelling me on account of bad roads and weather to hire an second engine. I hope you will fill this up for me.\n\nYours Truly,\nGeorge B. Curry\nOttawa, April 8, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in reference to your contract for the removing of the No. 5 school to Sour Springs.

Curley. In the first place Mr. Curley is wrong in stating that no time was specified for doing the work. The specifications which are now before me state that the work was to be completed within thirty days from the 15th of January being the date when the tender was awarded to Curley by the Council. Mr. Jamieson did not interfere in any way as the work progressed and did not change the specifications at any time.

Deputy and Secretary,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:-\n\n\"Lack of quarters for teacher at No.3 school\"\n\nThe question of lack of suitable accommodation for teachers at No.3 school has always been a difficulty on this Reserve. There is only one house within reasonable distance of the school where male teachers have hitherto boarded, the house of Mrs. George Smith and where Miss Sylvia Jamieson is now living.\n\nMrs. Smith has been accustomed to get a higher rate from the male teachers and appears to resent the presence of a lady teacher upon whom she has raised her price and is making things generally uncomfortable so that Miss Jamieson wishes to leave, no alternative place to go.\n\nI had intended to ask the School Board to recommend that quarters for the teachers be erected at No.3 school this year but omitted to do so in time for the appropriation.\nAs the only alternative Miss Jamieson has made arrangements to hire a room and do her own cooking at the house of Mrs. Bunice Hill and asks whether the Department will give her some small financial assistance towards purchasing a cot, table cooking utensils etc.\n\nIn view of the good work that Miss Jamieson is doing in this school, which it will be remembered as a very difficult school to handle, I would ask that the Department sanction a grant to her of $30.00 or $40.00 to purchase the required articles and have the accounts sent to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, May 6th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to living accommodation for the teacher at the No. 3 school on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that the teacher has made arrangements to rent a room and do her own cooking, and requests that the Department allow her a grant not exceeding the sum of $40 to purchase a cot, table, cooking utensils, etc. The Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase of the articles required, not exceeding the amount mentioned above. After the purchase has been made, an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is to be understood that all these furnishings are the property of the Department. If there is a change in teacher or other arrangements made at any time, these supplies should either be stored or distributed to the other teachers' living quarters where required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.M. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF SIX NATIONS SCHOOL BOARD,\nDATED MAY 20TH, 1930.\n\nMoved by A. G. Smith, seconded by John Lickers, that, in view of the overcrowded state of No. 3 School, there being more than 55 pupils and others from No. 3 district attending No. 1 school and also in view of the difficulty in obtaining accommodation for the teacher, that this Board ask the Department to consider the remodelling of No. 3 school by adding another classroom and accommodation for the teachers.\n\nCarried.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF LT. COL. C. E. MORGAN, INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT, BRANTFORD, ONT., DATED JUNE 14TH, 1930, ENCLOSING MINUTES OF SIX NATIONS SCHOOL BOARD OF MAY 20TH, 1930.\n\nThe school at No. 3 is overcrowded and the Board decided that the school should be remodelled so as to provide two classrooms and also a residence for the teachers.\nOttawa, June 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing Minutes of the Six Nations School Board. I note that No. 3 School is crowded and that it is recommended that a second classroom be provided and also a residence for two teachers. The Department would like a full report from you in this connection, indicating the urgency of this addition, before an item is placed in the Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E.

Jamieson\nI would draw the attention of the Department to my application last year for enlargement of this school (No. 9) and also No. 3. I made no provision for this enlargement in the estimates I submitted to the Department, as I had no means of knowing whether the Department contemplated building operations in 1932.\nI beg to report that at my recent inspection of the Six Nations Schools and classrooms I found the following matters requiring immediate attention:\n\nSchool No. 3 - Teacher, Miss Sylvia Jamieson.\n\nThis school is greatly overcrowded, the attendance being 62.\n\nThe pump is broken and useless and should be replaced.\n\nThe outhouses need repair.\nOttawa, November 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your No. 108-1527/31 of the 14th instant reporting on the condition of the pump at the No. 3 School on the Six Nations Reserve. In reply I have to say that, when we receive your report concerning the cost involved, as requested in official letter of today's date, our file 32-1-5, consideration will be given to authorizing having a new pump supplied.\n\nYou may arrange for the carrying out of the minor repairs absolutely necessary at the present time to the outhouses, but no unnecessary expense should be incurred. The usual certified voucher, in duplicate, should be forwarded, covering the expense in having these repairs made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt.-Col. G. E.

They are however, willing to make a contract providing the additional ($300.00) three hundred dollars is allowed them.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent Mr. Gordon J.

The Council found that adding $350. to the amount of Russell & Graves' tender would make it higher than the tender of Thomas J. Thomas who asked $2754. so the Council decided to award the contract to Thomas J. Thomas for $2754. I do not think Mr. Thomas has had enough experience to put up a building of this sort and he will no doubt have to sublet nearly all the work.

This decision was come to because the Council has been put to a good deal of trouble by reason of tenderers withdrawing their tenders after acceptance. I beg to recommend that this decision be approved, although there will be considerable difficulty in collecting the deposit and I think it should only be enforced in tenders amounting to $100 or over.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt-\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\nOttawa-\nOttawa, July 8, 1909.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRe School-house at Elliott's Corners.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Superintendent Smith, I visited Chsweken on Friday, June 26th. After a short call at the Chsweken school we proceeded to the Thomas school, in which section it is proposed to erect the new school-house. I had with me a blue print of the reserve, showing the theoretical boundaries of the section and on this I had the teacher, Mr. Miller, show me as near as possible the locations from which there are children attending the school (blue print herewith).\n\nAn examination of this plan will, I think, show the Department that an expensive building of the kind proposed is not required in this section and what is needed is a readjustment of the sections on the reserve. Again, it was proposed to change the site to a part of the reserve on which there are no locates, in order to provide accommodation for a very few children in Onondaga Tp., whose parents have refused to send them across the river. The absurdity of erecting a $3000 building on such conditions is apparent. If a school is to be built, it should be central and a much more modest structure will suffice.\nThere was a meeting of the Six Nation School Board at Brantford on Monday, the 28th ult., at which I was by request present. This and the Onondaga matter were the principal subjects of discussion. The Supt., who is Chairman of the Board, and who was aware of my personal opinion with reference to the Elliott's Corner school, made a suggestion that the question of building be left over for the present. After some discussion this was unanimously agreed to and the motion also carried with its provision to have the whole matter of school accommodation on the reserve looked into carefully by a committee and reported upon.\n\nThe bulk of settlement is on the southern portion of the reserve and I understand that there are two sections there, Nos. 5 and 7, in either of which an expensive school building would be more appropriate and is much more needed. The present Thomas' school building is certainly in a bad condition, but if a new building were erected, say in No. 5, the old building there might possibly be moved to the Thomas' school section and placed in a central location.\n\nThe whole question of readjustment of sections and sites on the reserve is worthy of special consideration, which I am sure it will receive at the hands of the Board and Council. In this connection the matter of centralization of schools may come up. Some are of opinion that larger schools, centrally located, are preferable to smaller ones accommodating correspondingly small districts. This was incidentally touched upon at the Board meeting. We have the experience of the\nMacdonald Consolidated school at Guelph, the only one in Ontario, to guide us. I was unable to see the Chairman of the Board of that school when in Guelph, as he was absent, but so far as I was able to learn, the scheme has not been an unqualified success. Should the Department at any time wish information with regard to this school, I am sure that the Public School Inspector, Major Craig, M.P., would be glad to furnish any details.\n\nAt the present time many from outside the district attend the Ohsweken school. Mr. Clarke, the senior teacher, is very successful in his work and in the case of the Thomas' school any pupils wishing to take up work in the higher classes go to Ohsweken, if possible.\n\nSo far as I see, therefore, there is nothing for the Department to do but await further action by the Board and Council, and I hope the Department will see its way to approve the action taken by the Board at its last meeting, when the minutes of the same are received.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

That the season for hauling heavy materials for these schools houses is past and that No. 3 School Section have a School House which serves the purpose up to the present time and is good enough to serve the purpose which is required for some time yet and so it was decided to abandon the Idea of building a new School House for No. 3 at present.\n\n2.

Chief J. S. Johnson reported the matter to me and I advised him to have a stove placed in the room. In the meantime I notified Messrs. Turnbull, Howard & Co., who supplied the furnace for the school and they sent a man to examine the same. He found that some casting was broken and had to be replaced. The Chiefs are under the impression from the experience of the past two years that the furnace will not heat the Junior Department, particularly when the weather is from the Southwest and therefore they decided to retain the stove so the same can be there for use if required.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The contract for building the water closet was awarded to me for $89.50 for the two, at the new No. 5 School.\n\nDaniel E. Hills tendered for the fences at one dollar per rod for both the picket and the wire fence. The school site measures 16 x 18 rods. The front 16 rods is to be a picket fence, and he agreed to build slats for $16.00. It must take 36 pickets to the\n\nIndian Affairs.

The\nhauling and the work for one\ndollar a rod, how the Council\ncan accept such a tender.

Hill\nSir,\n\nNo. 67\n\nThe Six Nations Council on the 25th of Dec. opened tenders for the building of closets at schools Nos. 5 & 11 and the tender of J.B. Hill at $59.00 for the two schools was accepted. I beg to recommend your approval of this decision.\n\nTenders were also opened for the building of fences around these same school grounds and the council accepted the tender of Daniel E. Hill at $1.00 per rod for both wire and picket fences. The specifications call for a picket fence in front 16 rods in length, and for wire fence around the remaining three sides 46 rods in length. The Inspector informs me that it will be impossible for Daniel E. Hill to build the fences for $1.00 per rod. I enclose a letter received from J.B. Hill protesting against the Council's award and confirming what the Inspector says that it impossible to build a fence as required for the amount.\n\nThe Secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\n\nOttawa.\nJ. B. Hill's tender is the second lowest and will amount to $146.90 according to the present measurements. I therefore beg to recommend that J.B. Hill's tender be accepted and the council's decision be not approved. I beg to enclose specifications for both the closets and fences. Plans are not enclosed because the Inspector tells me that they are already on file being the same as those used at schools Nos. 4 & 1.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.\nOttawa, March 12, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the last instant in reference to W.

The specifications for fencing require that both school yards should be fenced, but the tender for fencing is apparently for one yard only, 15 x 16 rods. Is School No. 11 the same dimensions as School No. 5, or does the tender of J. B. Hill include doing these at the same cost?\n\nThis information should be sent in at the earliest possible date, and on receipt this matter will be given immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hill for the erection of fences at Schools Nos. 5 and 11, the Department cannot approve this, as it is impossible to do the work according to plan and specifications prepared by Mr. Jamieson, for that price.\n\nThe Department approves of the acceptance of the next lowest tender; that of J.B.

Thomas showed me a letter sent to him from the Department on the 9th of February last under above file No. in which he was requested to file his claim with me for extras on his contract for building No. 5 School. The new school building was erected on a lot about half a mile away from the old build and when Thomas tendered on the construction of this building, he understood the building was to be on the old site and he figured on using the water from the well on that lot and using a part of the old school building for his tools and machinery but subsequently the council decided to purchase a new school lot further away and by reason of this change Thomas claims he has lost $70.00 basing his claim on the following items. Extra man and team drawing water ten days $3.50 per day and extra teaming.\n\nThe Secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\nOttawa.\nin drawing 40 loads of gravel the extra half mile and rent of tool house in the vicinity of the work making a total of $70.00 altogether.\n\nMr. Robert Martin's contract for building No. 11 School is exactly the same, $2250.00, whereas Thomas' contract was only $1943 which is a considerable difference. I believe Mr. Thomas took the contract for too little considering the circumstances and I beg to recommend that he be allowed this extra $70.00, although the council refused to grant it. Sometime ago Robert Martin applied for extras on one of his contracts because he had to use a gravel pit farther away than the one he figured and the council gave him the increase.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.\nCERTIFICATE.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nCertificate No. 2\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that Thomas Thomas has supplied material and performed labour on contract for work entitling to a payment of $1943.00\n\nCertificate No. 1. $1000.00 Contract, $1943.00\n\n\" \" 2. $843.00 Extras,\n\n\" \" 3. \" \" \" \" \"\n\n\" \" 4. \" \" \" \" \"\n\n\" \" 5. \" \" \" \" \"\n\n\" \" 6. \" \" Total, $1943.00\n\nLabour and material in building at first certificate $1000.00\n\n\" additional at 2nd $843.00\n\n\" 3rd \" \" \"\n\n\" 4th \" \" \"\n\n\" 5th \" \" \"\n\nto complete contract $1943.00\n\n(Signature) Inspector.\n\nReceived payment\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are hardly useable. The pits are full, and the majority of the boards required to be replaced. I estimate $50.00. There is no pump, the old one having been broken for some time.\n\nThe hinges on the front door need repair.\n\nThe teacher complains that she has not seen her Trustee, Mr. Ed. P. Garlow, since June. This Trustee does not attend to his duties satisfactorily, although he is a Councillor.\nOttawa, November 24, 1931.\n\nReferring to your report of the 14th instant on the No. 5 School on the Six Nations Reserve, it is noted that the outhouses are in a bad state of repair. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the pits cleaned out and any boards required replaced. It is considered that this work could be carried out at much less expense than mentioned by you, viz., $50. Only the minor repairs necessary to the outhouses at the present time should be carried out. You may also arrange to have the hinges on the front door replaced. After the above work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the installing of a new pump, this matter will have to stand over until particulars are received from you as to the cost involved.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher complains the trustee does not visit the school. You might take this matter up with the trustee, Mr. M. F. Saxlow, with a view to having him attend to his duties more satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt.

The result of the Conference was the arrangement as passed by the Council.\n\nAnother course was open to...\nThese people; and that was to curley and obtain a division of judgment against him and that up at the council and ask that payment for the same be made as suggested above; but this was abandoned as it would take too much time and produce more trouble and incur much additional expense, especially as curley does not deny the debt, acknowledging the same in his letter to the Secretary of the Board applying for a renewal of the contract for the present year.\n\nFor the sake of peace and harmony among the people and retaining the confidence of the Pagans in the matter of Education which we seem to have gained and are steadily gaining I earnestly hope that the Department will see its way to sanction the arrangement made and at once authorize the payment of the money.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nVery truly Yours\n\nJ.

Applying this section to schools Nos. 6 and 10, it is easily seen, that, owing to the lack of accommodation at both these schools, it is impossible to enforce the above regulation and as a result a large number of the children are being deprived of an opportunity of obtaining an education.\n\nIn consideration of the importance of this matter, the Department desires you to again bring this matter to the attention of the Council, at their next meeting, and the Department trusts that\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm.

I know of no reason why the building should not be placed on the same lot as the present school. One-half acre has been held for many years for school purposes here and in 1916 an additional acre was purchased from the Indian holder.\n\nThere is no question concerning the advisability of a new school, as serious consideration was given to replacing the present building in 1917. The Deputy has approved of the work being done on a day labour basis, under your supervision.\n\nI have examined the files and I believe that accommodation for 36 children should be provided in the classroom and for one teacher, of course, in the residence.\n\nAs Band Funds are being used and as the School Board has taking an active interest in education on the reserve, I believe it advisable to secure the cooperation of the local Trustee, as well as the Indian Superintendent, when you examine the site, make arrangements for the labour, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 487-5, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA Ottawa, April 26, 1925.\n\nHE NO 6 SCHOOL ON SIX NATIONS RESERVE.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to report that on April 20th I visited the Six Nations Indian Reserve and made arrangements for the building of the new combined day school and teachers' residence at No 6 school. The work will be carried out entirely by Indian labour with Mr. Albert Hill, an Indian, acting as foreman.\n\nI obtained prices for all materials required in both Brantford and Caledonia, and placed the order for the rough lumber with the Albridge Co of Caledonia, and for the window frames and other mill work with Schulitz Bros and Co., of Brantford. These firms have quoted the lowest prices.\n\nThere is at the present at No 6 school an old classroom building, which is being used, and there is a considerable amount of good material in this building which can be reused. In order, however, not to interfere with the classroom work we will not use the material from this building in the erection of the new No 6 school, but will demolish the building after the school closes and remove what suitable material there is, and use same in the building of the addition to the No 11 school.\n\nIn locating the new No 6 school on the school lot I consulted the school trustee for this district and he was perfectly satisfied with my choice and with the arrangements being made for the erection of the proposed building.\n\nArchitect.\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. C. Scott\nDeputy Chief General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nThe Six Nations School Board recommended to the Six Nations Council to build a new school & residence combined for school section No. 6. Also an addition to school & residence at school section No. 11.\n\nThe Council took the matter up and confirmed same. It has always been the custom for Public Works Building etc. to call for tenders and award contracts. The work has already been started by day labor at school No. 6. I would strongly object to such day labor on this work as the cost would be much more than it would be by tender or contract. The Council fully expects that tenders be called for for the building of these schools above mentioned following the usual custom of your Department confirming the same. Trusting that you may take up the matter for your consideration.\n\nI am his obedient servant,\n\nFred L. Johnson\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6224, file 487-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMay 9th\n\nDuncan J. Scott Esq., F.R.S.C., Lith. D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Doctor Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter with regard to the payment of interest money. I forwarded the request of the Council as they asked me to do so but at the same time told them that I did not think you would see your way to grant it owing to the present condition of Six Nations funds.\n\nAt the Council meeting yesterday there was considerable scrumony regarding the commencement of work upon No. 6 school by the Department. A section of the Council headed by Fred Johnson and John Lickers made an attack upon the Department.\n\nIt was stated that although when the delegation visited Ottawa they were told that none of their money would be expended without their knowledge, the erection of No. 6 school had been put in hand without the plans and estimated cost having been submitted to them first.\nI was requested to write to you asking that work upon this school should be suspended, that Mr. Orr should meet the Council and discuss the advisability of calling for tenders.\n\nI explained to the Council that this work had been commenced by the Department with no idea of slighting them or ignoring their right to a say in the expenditure of their money but that obviously the provision by the Department of an architect free of cost, the employment of Indian labour under a foreman and the consequent saving of contractor's profits were all of benefit to the Six Nations. However I promised to draw the matter to your attention and to convey the wishes of the Council to you.\n\nI would say in this connection that I regard with disfavour the increasing tendency on the part of certain of the Councillors notably Mr. Fred. L. Johnson to bring minutes before the Council which may ultimately tend to their own profit to the detriment of the Six Nations funds as I have little doubt that behind this there is a sub-strata of jealousy that tenders were not called for whereby some persons on the Reserve might profit.\n\nAt the same meeting the question of painting the schools by tender was brought up and a discussion\nsomething upon the same lines as the above followed regarding painting by day labour under supervision of Mr. Orr.\n\nAs far as I am aware the foreman placed in charge of the work by Mr. Orr, Albert Hill, is doing the work well, rapidly and economically. The school is at this stage:- The foundations are about completed excepting where the door frames and window frames are to be placed. The joists have all been laid, the first floor has been laid, the rafters and other material have all been cut and the drains leading from the basement to the roadway have been dug. Most of the material ordered by Mr. Orr is on the ground.\n\nMr. Fred Johnson stated that a higher rate of wages were being paid to the carpenters than rules elsewhere, which entirely untrue, the carpenters are receiving forty cents an hour whilst white carpenters are receiving about seventy-five or eighty cents an hour.\n\nI told the Council that I have no power or desire to stop the work and that it will continue until word is received from you but it will perhaps\nbe well if Mr. Orr could come down soon and convince these people that their interests are being guarded wisely and well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGM/B.\nIndian Affairs.

Morgan,\nIndian Office,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had a talk with Mr. Loft regarding the cook stove at No. 6.\n\nFor us this stove has three disadvantages\u2014First, every stick must be saved in two and split in two more sticks to go in the fire box. Second, it cannot be made hot enough for roasting or ironing and third, fire will not remain in more than twenty minutes unless...\nclosely checked.\n\nI wish to call your attention to a stove sold by the J. Eaton Co. and made by the Guelph Stove Co., Guelph, Ont. This stove is slightly larger than ours in every dimension and has a warming closet, large oven and large redwood. It is listed in the mid-winter catalogue as No. 15-900 and the price is $27.50. I mention this, as I understand the new stove at No. 11 cost $40 and we believe this one would be satisfactory.\n\nWe are quite willing to accept what the board will supply, but we do urge that\na more serviceable stove be supplied.\n\nHoping that this will receive prompt attention from the board, I am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEwart T. Peters\nJanuary 29th\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI notified the Department that the stoves supplied to the new schools Nos 6 and 11 were unsuitable for the wood lengths cut by the contractors, and also that the fire boxes do not hold enough to keep the fire going during the absence of the teachers in the class rooms. As I was afraid the we should lose the two lady teachers at No 11, if a delay occurred in changing the stove I did so, as previously reported.\n\nI now enclose a letter from Mr Peters who complains of the same troubles. The difference charged by the Happy Thought people to change the stove for a suitable one and clean up the old one to return to stock was $22.30, vouchers for which I am forwarding by this mail. I would recommend that authority be granted to make a similar change at No 6 school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent-Six Nations.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 487-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 2, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th enclosed with reference to the stores required to the No. 6 schools I beg to say that you may arrange to keep a larger store subscribed for the small use in this school.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. Wilson,\nActing Deputy Chief Superintendent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. G. H. Wright,\nSuperintendent of the Indians,\nBrookfield, Ont.\nJanuary 15th, 1926\n\nR. G. Orr Esq.,\nDepartmental Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Orr:\n\nThat's great news. If you will let me know how much gravel you need I will arrange with Frank Montour to haul it from his pit right away now that there is plenty of snow and the going is good and I will get as good a price as I can from him.\n\nI will also get prices and buy the necessary cement telling the merchant to hold it until we require delivery.\n\nI find we made a mistake in the sizes of the stoves we bought for No. 8 and 11 schools as the fire boxes in the kitchen stoves are far too small and will not take the standard wood supplied to the schools by the contractors. The circular Happy Thought stoves we bought for the living rooms are also unsuitable to burn wood. We have a re-arrangement in No. 11.\nschool. It was found that two men batching it was not a success and we have now got two excellent lady teachers, Mrs. Beiffer, a married woman with eight years experience and Miss McLaughlin, a very nice, qualified local teacher. These girls say that they cannot keep the kitchen range going and that the lengths of wood is such that they cannot use it at all in the circular living room stove. There was no time to be lost.\n\nI took the following action:- I got in the parlor stove and exchanged it for an iron box stove at no extra cost. I exchanged the kitchen stove with the Happy Thought people for one which would take 24\" wood. The cost of this range is $40.00 just double what you paid for the other but it will be a saving in the end as the only possible way to run the other would have been to have had a cord or two of wood sawn specially for it, the fire would not have lasted long and would always have been going out when the teachers were in their class rooms.\n\nI made arrangements with the Happy Thought people, who were very decent about it, that we were to receive credit for the $20.00 paid for the other stove less the amount it costs them to reblacken and clean the fire box and the return stove, in order\nto put it back in stock.\n\nI think this procedure will also have to be adopted with regard to No. 6. There has also been some expense in bringing these stoves in which I will voucher to the Department and ask you to be good enough to O.K.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGM/B.\n| Name            | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Payday | Amount |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|\n| J.J.

The water is not fit for the children to drink on account of the rats, mice and squirrels which fall into it and pollute the water. There is no other source of water supply in the vicinity and the children either have to drink this water or go without.\n\nAny action toward the repair of this well would greatly please both the parents and teacher.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nE.

(RG 10, Volume 6224, file 487-5, part 1)\nOttawa, December 10, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your No. 108-1577/35 of the 6th instant, enclosing copy of letter received from the teacher of the No. 6 School, with reference to the condition of the wall. You may have this wall repaired at once, keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nWith regard to the second and third paragraphs of your letter, a careful search has been made of the Department's records and no trace can be found of your letter of October 26th. Apparently it has never reached this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. J. Randle, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 487-5, part 1)\nOctober 28th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you of certain conditions prevailing at School No. 6, Six Nations Reserve and drawn to my attention by the teacher, Miss M. Monture, during my inspection of schools, last Friday.\n\n(A) The only drinking water obtainable is soft water obtained by drainage of the eaves troughs of the school building into a well. Under the best conditions this kind of water is particularly poor and not suitable for children as drinking water, but under prevailing conditions at the school, this supply is a danger. The water is not filtered in any way and all impurities collected in the eaves troughs are carried into the well which has not been cleaned for many years. In addition the well covering is only of wooden boards and mice are continually getting into the well between these boards and the ground level and drowning. As a result the water is fouled and absolutely unfit for human consumption. For sometime the school has been obtaining water from a nearby farm but this supply has now given out owing to the lack of any stead rains, so the school is without any usable water supply. I understand there is a drilled well at this school not in use as the water is sulphurous and the children cannot drink it.\n\nIn view of these circumstances, I would recommend that the soft water well and system be thoroughly cleaned and a cement top to replace the board one and if possible some system of filtering the water installed.\n(B) The chimney of this building either needs repair or its height increased, being only a few inches above the roof level. With winds in certain directions, the classroom is filled with smoke and if it is too cold to open the windows the children have to leave the room and instruction ceases.\n\n(C) The line fence surrounding the school property is a total wreck and on the day of my inspection, cattle from the neighboring farm were roaming at pleasure around the school buildings and leaving the grounds in a condition unpleasant for the children to play on.\n\n(D) Miss Monture informs me that she and her mother no longer reside at the school as her father was home again and the family are living on their own farm. Whilst in residence, Miss Monture carried out the duties of Janitor but under the changed conditions requests that a Janitor be appointed and recommends Mr. George Buck who resides close to the school and has previously acted temporarily in that capacity.\n\nMay I please be instructed as to what the wishes of the Department are in regard to these conditions?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle (sgd)\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nSupt. Six Nations.\nDecember 12th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 32-6-5 of December 10th with instructions to repair the well at No. 5 School.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which failed to reach the Department IOB-1339/35 of the 28th of October, and also three others of the same date pertaining to school matters, as it is possible they also were not received by the Department as matters to which they relate are still in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

After a careful search of our records we can find no trace of these letters having reached here.\n\nIn official letter of the 10th instant, you were authorized to have the well at the No. 6 School repaired, keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nIt is noted that the fence surrounding the school property should be repaired. This matter can stand over until next Spring, at which time you should give the Department an estimate of the cost of a new fence.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of increasing the height of the chimney on the No. 6 School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

This application was granted and the Department wrote to me that an expenditure of $40 would be sanctioned for this service.\n\nIn the meantime Miss Jamieson was successful in securing a furnished room and did not avail herself of the Departmental grant in consequence. She has now been transferred to No. 7 School where it is difficult for a teacher to obtain furnished rooms and finds herself confronted by the same difficulty as formerly.\n\nShe now asks whether the Department will still consider this former grant of $40.00. There are one or two schools where it is a matter of extreme difficulty for teachers, especially lady teachers, to find accommodation and this is one of them.

I will, therefore, ask permission to definitely close this school at the end of this term, and, should the Department find it inconvenient to rebuild, I think that I can hire a small church in the vicinity which will answer the purpose.

In this connection, it is noted that you consider this building to be unsafe for occupation and that you could, no doubt, arrange for the rental of a small church in the vicinity that would answer the purpose until such time as a new school building can be erected. We will have no funds this year to provide for the erection of a new building.\n\nYou may make arrangements for the rental of the church building referred to by you and have it fitted up for classroom purposes, moving the equipment such as desks, etc., from the present old No. 9 building to the church. The rental to be paid for the church and the cost of having it fitted up for school purposes should be kept as low as possible. You should have the new classroom in the church ready when the school returns after the summer holidays. When the furnishings have been removed, you should see that the old building is properly fastened up in order to prevent damage. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the most satisfactory arrangements you can to continue the work for the next school year and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nPlease advise the Department later as to whether you have been able to obtain the church and the steps taken in having same fitted up for classroom purposes, also state the rental charged and the approximate cost of transferring the furnishings and fitting up the building as a classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.R.

I then said that I could rent the Adventists Church which stands on the opposite side of the road for a small sum.\n\nOn the 25th, ult., I received a reply from the Department (32-9-5) authorizing the rental of this Church and instructing me to take the necessary steps to install the school furniture. I now regret to report that Mrs. Lydia Johnson, who has control of this Church, refuses to lease it for any price or under any consideration to be used for school purposes, and as there is no other building available in the district I find myself at a loss as to how to carry on the scholastic work.\n\nThere is no doubt whatever that No. 9 School is not safe and that a great risk to the lives of the children would result should it continue to be used. This school is situated in an outlying district of the Reserve and is therefore too far away from the other schools to render it possible for the pupils to be distributed elsewhere. I am afraid if this section is not to be allowed to go without school benefit that either a new school must be built or No. 9 repaired, which owing to its condition I imagine would hardly be worth the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

(RG 10, Volume 6224, file 490-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIn company with Superintendent Morgan, I visited a number of the day schools on the Six Nations Reserve on the afternoon of May 14th.\n\nThe sum of $2,000 was provided in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1933-34 for the erection of a new building at the No. 9 School. However, repairs were made to this building last fall and it is now in a condition to last for several years and it is, therefore, unnecessary to erect a new building at the present time.\n\nCol. Morgan suggested that the funds provided in this year's appropriation be used for the purpose of adding second classrooms to two or three of the present schools.\n\nI reviewed the average attendance figures at all the day schools on the Six Nations Reserve with Col. Morgan and, after carefully studying these, I do not think that the attendance is sufficiently large to justify the erection of second classrooms at the present time. Under these circumstances, Col. Morgan stated that he would write the Department and withdraw his suggestion that second classrooms be built at certain schools.\n\nI met Mr. Joyce, the Public School Inspector who visits the Six Nations Schools and he agreed with me that it was undesirable to consider erecting additional classrooms at the present time. Incidentally, Mr. Joyce stated that the salaries we are allowing the teachers of the Six Nations Schools are larger than those paid in the neighbouring white communities.\n\nMinor repairs are required at a number of the schools on the Six Nations Reserve and I would suggest that from $1,500 to $2,000 be allowed Col. Morgan to effect the necessary repairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 490-5, part 1)\nMay 19th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\nSix Nations Schools.\n\nI have had the advantage of a discussion regarding the Six Nations Schools with Mr. Phelam who is at present visiting Brantford and with whom I inspected several schools yesterday.\n\nI learned when at the Department that $8,000 has been included in the Estimates to rebuild No. 9 School. I discussed this with Mr. Orr and as we were able last year to repair No. 9 school so it will continue to be safe and serviceable for some years to come I think in view of the shortage of funds it may perhaps be better to defer the re-building until a later date. There have been complaints from some of the teachers that the schools are overcrowded and I suggested to Mr. Orr that perhaps it would be well to take a portion of this money to build two further class rooms, one at No. 9 School and another at No. 3 to relieve this congestion. However upon discussing this with Mr. Phelam it appears that he is of opinion that these schools are not unduly overcrowded as schools in other reserves have as many and, in some cases, more pupils than ours. He pointed out that the erection of class rooms with the $8,000 would entail further expense in the hire of teachers and school furniture and books which at the present time is undesirable and in consequence I think this suggestion of mine should not be followed up.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 490-5, part 1)\nHowever, as this money is available, some of it might be utilized to paint and repair all the schools some of which require painting and general repairs quite badly.\n\nI would therefore ask the Department to be good enough, if he can be spared, to allow Mr. Orr to visit Brantford in order that he and I may go thoroughly into this question of painting and repairs. If the Department will be good enough to notify me when he may be expected I will make arrangements to meet and look after him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Morgan.\nOEM/NA.\nSupt. Six Nations.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the amount provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year in connection with the Six Nations Indian Day Schools. It is noted that, owing to the repairs carried out last year to the No. 3 School, the building will not be serviceable for some years. The Department will therefore delay the building of a new school until a later date. When Mr. Phelan was on the Reserve, he enquired into the matter of overcrowding at the schools, and it is not considered necessary to build further classrooms, as it does not appear that the schools are unduly overcrowded.\n\nIn considering the matter of general repairs and painting to the school buildings, the Department will be prepared to authorize an expenditure of from $500 to $1,000 during the present fiscal year in carrying out ordinary repairs and for painting. It will be necessary, however, for you to furnish a detailed estimate, stating the work which you recommend be performed at each school, separately. Please give full particulars as to the cost of all materials and labour required. The total expenditure for all the schools should be kept within the amount stated above. The Department is anxious to effect every saving possible in the Appropriation this year, and only the painting and repairs which you believe absolutely necessary should be considered.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to have full information, as requested, at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department will remember that last year No. 9 School on the Six Nations Reserve was reported as being unsafe and authority was granted to have the studdings replaced where rotten and an amount of $8,000 was included in the Appropriation to rebuild this school during 1933.\n\nThe repairs having taken place I reported that the school was now in a good enough condition to last with safety for several years and that in consequence the amount included in the Appropriation would not be required for this purpose.\n\nIt has now been reported to me by the Trustee that the studding is dry-rotting in other places and it seems that dry-rot having gained ascendancy there is no alternative but to pull this school down and re-erect it. At a meeting of the School Board held recently Mr. Albert Hill who is a carpenter and builder as well as a Trustee was authorized to investigate the condition and as this will require pulling up floor boards and stripping the walls to some extent he was also authorized to employ a helper. I will report fully upon receipt of his report but am writing this in order that the Department may be prepared to go ahead with the work if necessary during the holidays.\n\nSeveral of the schools need painting both inside and out and Mr. Orr will remember that we discussed the question of using some of this $8,000 for this purpose when I was in Ottawa, but in the event...\nof No. 9 requiring to be recoult I presume that the painting will have to be held over until next year?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, June 28, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your LOH-990/33 of the 26th instant, with reference to the Six Nations No. 9 Indian Day School.\n\nIt will not be possible to consider erecting a new school this year to replace the present No. 9 School. As you were informed in official letter of the 31st ultimo, the Department hopes to be able to authorize an expenditure of from $1,500 to $2,000 during the present fiscal year in carrying out repairs and painting at the schools on the Six Nations Reserve. Even this amount is not yet definitely assured, but, in the meantime, you should forward the information requested in the latter part of paragraph 2 of official letter of the 31st ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 490-5, part 1)\nThe 27th meeting of the Six Nations School Board was held in the Council House, June 23rd.\n\nIt was proposed by Noah Vanevery, seconded by Harry Loft that in view of the unsafe condition of No. 9 school that Mr. A. E. Hill be asked to examine the school and is authorized to remove the flooring and panelling as may be necessary to ascertain the condition of the studding and he is to report to the Chairman. The Chairman was also asked to write to his department for authority for A. E. Hill to examine said school.\n\nCarried.\n\nWith reference to No. 9 school building Col. Joyce condemns this school from a standpoint of light and general formation. It was also reported that the studdings are loose.\n\nJune 30th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn the minutes of June 23rd, I beg to draw the attention of the Department to the resolution in regard to No. 9 school. To-day I received your letter of the 28th inst., (3E-9-5) with reference to No. 9 school at the School Board meeting Mr. A. E. Hill who is a carpenter was asked to examine the school and was authorized to remove the flooring and panelling to ascertain the condition of the studding and he is to report to me. In the event of Mr. Hill's report that the school is unsafe I would ask what steps I should take before the opening of the school in September in order to make this school safe for the children. There will be a small expense in connection with the work by Mr. Hill and I would therefore ask that you authorize the payment to Mr. Hill.\n\nO. E. Morgan.\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, July 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the condition of the No. 9 School.\n\nIt is noted that you have authorized a carpenter to remove the flooring and panelling in order to ascertain the condition of the studding. When his report is received, you should advise the Department, and consideration will then be given to what amount can be allowed for repairs. As you were informed in official letter of the 26th ultimo, it will not be possible to consider erecting a new school this year to replace the present No. 9 building. Our funds will permit only a very small expenditure on this school this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6224, file 490-5, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nNo. 9 School - Six Nations Reserve\n\nFurther my letter IOB-981/33 of June 26th, in which I reported the assurance of the Trustees of the school that the studding of No. 9 School was unsafe. As I informed the Department I asked Mr. A. H. Hill who is a carpenter and builder on the Reserve to make a thorough examination of No. 9 School and I am pleased to be able to report that the statement of the Trustees was very greatly exaggerated. Mr. Hill reports that the studdings are sound and that in such few places as they need it repairs can be made for a practically nominal sum. He reports however that the shingling is in a very bad state and it may be for this reason that water has been finding entrance and causing some of the trouble.\n\nMr. Hill has offered to re-shingle this school for $140., to which I would add $30. for the repairs to studding and wainscoting and replacement of floors. I would therefore ask for authority to expend $170. on this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. G. H. Morgan,\nSupt., Six Nations.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Orr, of this Department, will be in Ottawa in the course of the next few days and he will give you the necessary instructions regarding the purchase of material and the employment of the labour required in performing the work.\n\nThe repairs at each of the schools should be completed before they re-open on September first. After the work has been completed, so far as satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material, and labour returns, in triplicate, for the labour employed.

This was not reported to me, the teacher contenting herself with sending across to Mr. Lickers house, which is on the opposite side of the road to the school for such water as the children require for drinking purposes.\n\nThis has gone on for some time and I had no knowledge of the fact until Mr. Lickers brought in this account and complained that this is only a small amount of the damages that have actually been done by these children who have broken the windmill as well as the pump.\n\nThe pump has a boring of approximately 90 ft. and I understand from inquiries that I have made that the fault lies in the fact that the well bores passed through the sweet water strata when drilling and drilled on until this brackish water was struck. It, therefore, seems that the only remedy will be to sink another well or else to continue to get the water from Mr. Lickers, who good-naturedly says that he has no objection if the children do no further damage.\nI will, however, go into the matter with a well expert and ascertain the approximate cost of a new boring or whether it will be possible to raise the pipe in order to strike only the sweet water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

Randle, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nDecember 23rd, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 32-9-5 of the 14th instant with regard to No. 9 School and would advise the Department that there is little which could be done to this school except the complete rebuilding of the walls which are crumbling outwards.\n\nAs a temporary measure on the inside, where the gap between the floors and the walls is, it would be advisable at the cost of a few dollars for some stripping to protect the teacher from the constant draft she now endures, so would the Department please authorize this at once so it can be done during the holidays.\n\nAs previously reported the means of ventilation in this school is both poor and scarce, and it would be helpful if the Department would authorize me to put in wooden ventilators on the two windows which do not have them as they give satisfactory ventilation without draft.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nRPR/CB.\n\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, December 27, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 108-1614/35 of the 23rd instant, with reference to the condition of the Six Nations No. 9 School.\n\nYou may arrange for the stripping which you consider necessary. You may also have wooden ventilators placed on two windows.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. F.

J. Thomas, * 3344.\nJ. W. Hill, * 3335.\nRobt. McDonald, Hagroville, 3000.\n\nThe undersigned would recommend, pursuant to the provisions of section 2 of section 36 of the Public Works Act, that the tender of Robt. McDonald, the lowest, be accepted for the work above mentioned for the amount of his tender, namely, $3000.00, and that under section 69 of the Indian Act the same be charged to the capital at the credit of the Six Nations Indians, which amounts to $3000.00.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 491-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nIn calling for tenders for No.10 School, Six Nations Reserve, notices on the usual forms were posted up in the Council-hall, Post Office and other public places on the reserve, as is their usual custom there, and at least twenty days' notice was given. No tender was called for in the public press.\n\nThe plans and specifications for the school were prepared by Mr. Augustus Jamieson (Indian) their building inspector; and plans, specifications and tenders submitted to the Department, with their Council's recommendation, for approval, the work being awarded to the lowest satisfactory tenderer. The tender of Robert McDonald for this work, is a fair and reasonable one, and is $500.00 below the Department's estimate for the building.\n\nArchitect.\nThe accompanying recommendation is for the acceptance of tender for the construction of a new school-house to replace old No.10 on the Six Nations reserve, the cost to be charged to band capital.\n\nFour tenders were received, three of which were from Indians and the lowest was from a white man.\n\nAs a rule the Six Nations themselves are the only tenderers but in this case, with a view to expedition, whites were permitted to tender; and the lowest tender, for $3000.00, is that of a white man, Robt. McDonald. The Indians would desire that the lowest Indian tender be accepted were it not that the lowest Indian tenderer, J. W. Hill, for $2735.00, has not given satisfaction in some other works done by him, and it is thought that it will have a good effect if this tender is awarded to the white man, Robt. McDonald, whose tender is lower than Hill's.\nThese Indians have a Clerk of Works of their own and in general conduct their own business, so that it is not possible in the case of the Six Nations to comply strictly with the instructions of the President of the Privy Council as communicated to this Department on the 14th March last to the effect that the President \"desires to have inserted in every report to Council from this Department recommending the award of any contract, the names of all newspapers (with date and number of insertions) in which notices calling for tenders were published, and to have such report accompanied by a copy of the detailed estimates pertaining to that particular work signed by the Engineer, Architect or other technical officer of the Department.\" A Memorandum is, however, attached hereto from the Architect of the Department who is dealing with the construction of the school building showing how the matter stands.\n\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, July 20th, 1915.\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, reporting that, it having been found necessary to build a new school-house for Section No. 10 of the Six Nations Indian Reserve, in the Counties of Brant and Haldimand, in the Province of Ontario, tenders were called for, and the following were received:\n\nRobert Martin, Ohsweken, $3,348.00.\nT. J. Thomas, \" 3,544.00.\nJ. W.

Garlow that the attention of the Department be drawn to the conditions of the well at No. 10 School.

Carried.\nI would draw the attention of the Department to the resolution regarding Pump at No. 10 School, and would ask authority to consult an expert as to whether it is necessary to sink a new well altogether. I spoke to Mr. Ferrier about this when he passed through Brantford, and he expressed an opinion, as Six Nations children had thrown stones down the pipe, that the cost of the new well, if necessary, should be borne by the Band.\nOttawa, June 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing minutes of the Six Nations School Board held on the 16th instant.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that there will be three vacancies for teachers for the coming school year and that consideration will be given to the appointment of teachers at an early meeting of the Board.\n\nThe reasons stated by Mr. Longboat for his absence from the previous meeting of the Board have been noted, and approval of the resolution to allow Mr. Longboat to count an attendance is granted.\n\nRegarding the resolution referring to the condition of the pump at the No. 10 School, I have to say that you will be informed in a separate communication regarding the action to be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is considered that either the person who was carrying out the repairs, or the parents of the children who were responsible for putting the stones in the well, should pay the cost involved. There may also have been carelessness on the part of the teacher. It should be ascertained who the children were that caused the damage.\n\nAfter a well expert has given an opinion whether the present well can be placed in good condition, or the necessity of boring a new well, you should furnish full particulars as to the cost, and also your opinion regarding assessing the cost involved against the parents of the children who caused the damage, or the person who was undertaking the repairs, on account of carelessness in not protecting the well when the pump was taken out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

It\nis impossible at this date to allocate the responsibility for\nthe damage owing to the fact that the teacher has\nleft, and the trustee is unable to obtain any information\nas to what children threw stones down the well. The\ntrustee \"Albert Hill\" consulted Mr. Near a well sinker\non the reserve, and a gas and oil expert, who stated\nthat he would not put a drill down this old hole now\nthat stones were there, owing to the danger of breaking,\nand as it is impossible now to allocate the responsibil-\nity, I acted on the suggestion of the Department that\nas the damage had been occasioned by Indian children\nthat the cost of repair should be borne by the Six\nNations, in which, I think, the Council agreed.

The following statement of the amounts paid the contractor shows clearly the over payment which he received, viz:\n\n| Date       | Amount |\n|------------|--------|\n| Nov. 10th, 1914 | $600.00 |\n| Feb. 28th   | $500.00 |\n| April 9th, 1915 | $1800.00 |\n| Oct. 26th   | $100.00 |\n\n$3700.00\n\nIt is desired that you will immediately call upon Mr. Martin to refund to the Department the $500.00 which he received in excess of the contract price ($3200.00).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 492-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nA contract was entered into by your Department with Robert Martin for building school No. II, Six Nations Indians, amount of contract being $2250. I find the following payments have been made on this contract from Trust Account No.\n\n| Year       | Ch.   | Amount |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| 1914-15    | 4036  | $800.00|\n|            | 4355  | 500.00 |\n|            |       |        |\n\nBoth these amounts were paid from Interest;\n\n| Year       | Ch.   | Amount |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| 1915-16    | 657   | $850.00|\n|            | 5814  | 100.00 |\n\nTotal ....... $2750.00\n\nFrom this it would appear that an overpayment of $500 has been made to Martin on this contract, and I find no trace of this overpayment having been adjusted so far.\n\nKindly obtain a refund from Martin at as early a date as possible.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nAugust 21st, 1916.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have before me your letter of the 16th August with reference to an overpayment of $500.00 to Robert Martin. I find that the overpayment was made owing to the fact that the inspector of the works issued two certificates for $500.00, and when he made his final estimate did not include the Department failed to notice the error.\n\nI am pleased to say, however, that Robert Martin has a current contract for the erection of a cement culvert and the overpayment will be deducted from the first certificate for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Fraser, Esq., I.S.O.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nExtract\nOriginal on file...15945-6.\n\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR STANDING ON NO.11 Six Nations School.\n\nGood bookcase in teacher's room.

This knowledge has been the premise for the development and perfection, throughout a period of more than ten years, of a finished and high grade product in the form of the \"Brantford Sectional Buildings\" distributed in increasing quantities to satisfy an ever growing demand, due to a nationally broad recognition of their superior merits.\n\nAdaptability\n\nNEW USES are continually being demonstrated to which the Brantford Sectional Buildings are found to be readily adaptable. Those most prominent in demand follow:\n\nCottage Homes and Bungalows for city suburbs, rural districts, summer resorts, industrial housing in factory areas, on farms, in mining districts and newly settled communities.\n\nAutomobile Garage buildings to house one or more cars, for use at private homes, factories, churches, school properties, exhibition grounds, public resorts, etc.\n\nStore buildings, Restaurants, Barber Shops, Bowling Alleys, Refreshment Booths and Offices. In these are they particularly adapted for use in newly opened districts.\n\nBranch Bank buildings for outlying points.\n\nChurches, Mission Houses, Church Service Work, Salvation Army, Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., auxiliary huts and Hostess Houses.\n\nSchool buildings for City overflow districts, Suburbs, Rural Sections, Fresh Air Cottages, Emergency Hospitals and Isolation Wards, Mess Rooms and Bunk Houses.\n\nBoat Houses for Launches, Row Boats, Canoes, Etc.\n\nDistinctive Features of Construction\n\nTHE OUTSTANDING FEATURE of the construction is the Sectional unit. For foundations cedar posts are most frequently used, this feature is governed by nature of ground.\n\nThe walls, floor, partitions, roof, gables, etc., are in standard sections, compact and ready for fitting and bolting together. All door, window and wall sections are interchangeable, permitting of numerous layouts to suit various locations.\n\nThe doors are already hung and glazed, and the windows already supplied with glass sashes and blinds. One does not handle a window, but a section, which has a window completely fitted with glazed sash and hardware.\n\nAll sections may be readily dismantled, transported and re-erected if occasion requires.

Your account in duplicate should be forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

MORGAN, INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT, BRANTFORD, ONT., DATED DECEMBER 26/24.\n\nOriginal on File 7525-4.\n\nNo. 11 School.\n\nThe outbuildings are in need of repairs and a few minor repairs to the doors and woodshed are required.\nOttawa, January 7th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWe noted from the report of your inspection of the Six Nations' Indian Day Schools of the 26th ultimo that the outbuildings at the No. II school are in need of repairs. Please take this matter up with the new council and with the school board and arrange to have any repairs required carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Orr,\n\nThe Department has approved of the Six Nations Band Council's resolution to build a second classroom and a residence for two teachers at the No. II School. The authority of His Excellency in Council to use Band Funds is being secured (File 7825-4). I know of no reason why the building or buildings should not be placed on the same lot as the present classroom. One and one-half acres have been held here for many years for school purposes.\n\nThe second classroom is badly needed, as there is an enrolment of 73 children. In 1922, consideration was given to the purchase of a portable classroom. The Deputy has approved of the work being done on a day labour basis, under your supervision. I have examined the files and I find that accommodation for 30 children should be provided in the second classroom and accommodation for two teachers in the residence. There are 44 seats in the old classroom, which should be used in future as a junior room, and the new building with accommodation for the 30 as a senior room.\n\nAs Band Funds are being used and as the School Board is taking an active interest in education on the reserve, I believe it advisable to secure the cooperation of the local Trustees, as well as the Indian Superintendent, when you examine the site, make arrangements for the labour, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6224, file 492-5, part 1)\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COL. C. E. MORGAN,\nINDIAN SUPERINTENDENT, BRANTFORD, DATED\nAPRIL 23, 1925.\n\nIn the case of No. 11 the overflow was so great\nthat it has been found necessary to hire the building\nand start a subsidiary school, which I have called\nNo. 11 A, at which on the 26th of April when I inspected\nit there were 24 children in the course of their studies\nand there will be some more in the next few days.\n\nThe school board has approved of the engagement of\nMiss Mildred Froman to conduct this school, subsequently\nthe addition which is to be made to No. 11 for kinder-\ngarten classes at a salary of $500 a year.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to report that on April 20th I visited the site of the proposed addition to the No 11 school on the Six Nations reserve. I obtained the information necessary for the preparation of a plan to provide an additional classroom and teachers' residence. The work on this building will be undertaken when the new No 6 school is complete, as we wish to use as much of the old material from the No 6 school in the building of the addition to the No 11, as possible.\n\nARCHITECT.\n| Date | ARTICLES | Folio | Debt | Credit | Balance |\n|------|----------|-------|------|--------|---------|\n| Aug 5 | To 44 pcs.

Investigation showed that the boards were carelessly and indifferently nailed and it was necessary to pull off the outside boards to ascertain the trouble and re-nail the inner boards.\n\nAs there was some discussion and dispute at the last Council meeting regarding approval of this account I decided to send it direct to the Department with this explanation.\nThe trustee, Mr. Atkins reported the bulge in the wall to me and having asked the Engineer and Road Superintendent to see it and they having corroborated the Trustee's report I authorized him to go ahead with the work before it got worse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

The council after careful consideration and discussion among the chiefs decided to accept and adopt the proposition of the Six Nations School Board, that is to remove the Six Nations School to the Village of Ohsweken, and to take effect at the reopening of schools after the summer vacation of 1896.

Thomson, and some of the Chiefs in Council only temporarily closed we your humble petitioners do now request that said School be reopened in the same building in which it was conducted hitherto, until a new building, if necessary, may be erected within this School Section.\n\nThat the former teacher Mr. John Miller be transferred from the Ohsweken Public School, to this School Section.\n\nThat the Six Nations Council may kindly see this error in judgment and the great injustice which it has occasioned to us your humble petitioners as hereinbefore set forth and that this evil may be speedily rectified by the reopening of said Thomas School.\nAnd ever your humble petition\nas in duty bound will ever pray,\netc., etc.\n\nName,\n\nJohn Blanch\nLucy Blanch\nCharles C.

The Chiefs decided to re-open the School under their own jurisdiction. This School is 1\u00bd miles West of Chawaken village. When the graded school was built at Chawaken it was agreed that Thomas' School should be closed and all should attend at Chawaken. By your decision the Chiefs were given control of the Chawaken School which was to take the place of Thomas' School.\n\nSince the new school has been erected the Trustees of this School have done everything in their power to increase the attendance at the Chawaken School, with the result the attendance has been very large. By the rules of the Schools of the Reserve, a scholar must attend the School nearest his home, any changes from one section to another by one family moving from one section to another the children are transferred and records are kept of the attendance of each School, but the Trustees of the Chawaken School do not consider where scholars come from and induce them to come from other sections to that school.\n\nThe Six Nations School Board has no control over this.\n\nI never considered and in fact do not now consider it to the interest of education to have two distinct school Boards. If Thomas' School is again opened I consider it an unnecessary expenditure and will not be to the best interest of education. I believe a School should be erected 1\u00bd mile North where Thomas' School was formerly held, this will accommodate a large section which at present has no school and is in the midst where the Petitioners of the attach reside.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 493-1, part 1)\nI would recommend that you will not approve of the Chiefs' decision, but for the present to be contented with the management of the Ohweken School, the other Schools will continue under the management of the School Board and would ask the Chiefs to erect a School at what is called \"Elliot's Corners\" and place the management of the same over to the School Board to control. I am satisfied this can be a successfully carried out and will be to the best interest of education of the Reserve.\"\n\nE.D. Cameron, Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs.\nIndian Affairs Department,\nApril 8th, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nA family signed petition was presented to the Chiefs in Council at their annual meeting held on the 2nd of February last, asking that Thomas's school be reopened. The Chiefs granted the petition which I forwarded to you with my report of the same Council meeting on the 3rd of February last. I recommended that a new school be erected at what is known as Elliott's corner which is situated north of the old Thomas's school. It would be in a centre of a section where at present the school is badly located.\n\nI received the attached letter from Mr. Charles Thomas, who resides \u00bd of a mile from Elliott's corner. At the present time his children are three miles from the nearest school, which is their proper school to attend. I again beg to recommend that you approve of my recommendation of the 10th of February last.\n\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSup't.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, March 18, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of communication from the Indians regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Eastern school on the Tyendinaga Reserve, which goes to show that they are dissatisfied with the appointment of Miss Thompson. You will be good enough to send a full report as to how the school is progressing under her charge, giving the number of pupils in attendance, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. R. Stainton, M.A.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 10, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nAs directed by you I went to Belleville on the 3rd instant and met Mr. Clark, the Public School Inspector, on Saturday morning and went into the question of the Indian schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve, which are in his inspectorate, and particularly with regard to the dispute between the Indians and Mr. Stainton, the Agent, regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Eastern Brick School, which is a joint white and Indian School.\n\nMr. Stainton appointed a Miss Hildred Thompson and the Indians put an Indian named T. Irving Brant, who took charge after the Christmas holidays and has been teaching ever since. Mr. Stainton wrote to the Department that Miss Thompson was the holder of a limited Third-class certificate and that Brant had no qualifications! On the strength of his representations the Department decided that the school should be handed over to Miss Thompson and that Brant should be dismissed. The Chiefs retained Brant and my instructions were to find out how the case stood.\n\nMr.\nMr. Clark, the Inspector, told me that Miss Thompson holds no certificate and, while Brant is not properly qualified, he had four years' training in the high school and only failed in one subject (Literature) in his examination for a Second-class diploma and that of the two teachers there was no question as to Brant's being the better. Miss Thompson had previously taught an Indian school and her services were dispensed with.\n\nOn going to the reserve on Tuesday I met the Indian Council, all of the five Chiefs being present. I did not find it necessary to have a lengthy discussion on the merits of the two teachers, as Mr. Clark had furnished me with a letter from Mr. Stainton to him, which was written on the 12th of March, in which he asks Mr. Clark to grant a permit to Miss Hildred Thompson, although he had stated in his letter to the Department of the 10th of January that she was the holder of a limited Third-class certificate. I showed this letter to Mr. Stainton as well as one from the Deputy Minister of Education addressed to Mr. Clark in which Mr. Colquhoun stated that no temporary certificate in favour of Miss Thompson for the current term had been issued by his Department. These two letters show that Mr. Stainton misrepresented the qualifications of Miss Thompson to\nto the Department and if it had been aware of the true facts of the case Brant would have been appointed. I called at the school on two occasions. The first time Brant had 32 pupils present and on the Wednesday there were 39, which is evidence that he is popular among the Indians. I consider that Brant should be allowed to stay on till the end of the term and that Mr. Stainton should be so advised.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should forward Mr. Brent's school return for last quarter, together with a requisition for his salary.\n\nWhen your letter of the 10th of January, last, was written you were well aware that Miss Thompson did not then hold even a temporary certificate for the current school term, as is evidenced by your having applied to the Public School Inspector on the 13th of March for a permit for her to teach in this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos.

Miss Thompson, however, never entered on her duties as teacher of this school and, as a result of inquiries made at the request of the Indian Council, it was found that Miss Thompson was not the possessor of qualifications you stated she had and the appointment of Irvin Brent as teacher was confirmed.

I have taught the \"Eastern Brick\" school on Tyendinaga reserve for three years, and it seems to me that if my teaching and discipline were so much at fault, the fault would have been apparent long before this. I have given satisfaction in every inspection in which I have taught and the late Mr. Nesbitt, D.P.S.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nfor Lennox and Addington,\nin whose inspectorate I first\nstarted to teach, told me that\nhe would be glad to have me\nback in his inspectorate and\nwould recommend me at any\ntime for a school vacancy.\nI wish to state as a matter\nof ordinary justice to myself\nthat the report you have re-\nceived is most certainly not\na fair one. I am not at loss\nto understand Mr. Clark's\nmotive, unless it is that he\nwishes to pave the way for\nthe appointment of a teacher\nof his own choosing.\nI was interviewed and asked\nto take this school in the first\nplace, and I have given\nconscientious thought to the\nneeds of the children in every\nway.\nI succeeded an Indian\nteacher, and when I took the\nschool, the Sr. II class, boys of sixteen and seventeen years old, could not do a solitary question in fractions, and did not even know simple fractions, which they should have learned in the Senior II class. I had only one term to prepare the class for examinations, and they all passed but one pupil who did not attend regularly. Moreover by specially suitable work, I have done a great deal to overcome the native shyness of the Indian pupils. Furthermore Mr. Clark told me last year when he inspected this school, that it was the best school on the reservation. At this year's inspection the pupils spoke up more freely than ever before, and answered almost every question correctly. I was really proud of them.\nIn view of the above facts, you can understand how surprised I was to learn the tenor of Mr. Clapp's report. How he could possibly reconcile his report with what he has said to me personally, I do not know. But I can truthfully say the report is certainly unwarranted.\n\nAs to discipline, the Indian child requires a far different sort than the average white child, and I have endeavored to rule them kindly and justly. The Indian agent and I want order well at sudden and unexpected times and have always found the school in order and discipline good.\n\nI was the first teacher to introduce plain sewing etc., for the girls' clothers and the exhibit at the last two school fairs has been excellent. This year my pupils won...\n1st and 2nd prizes in plain sewing; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes in fancy work; 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th prizes in writing; and 1st prize in drawing over all the other schools on the reserve and was the only school that exhibited map drawing. All judging was done by the principal and teachers of the Debert public school. I may say that if the present law was properly enforced the work of some pupils would be better than it now is.\n\nI enjoy the confidence and respect not only of the pupils but of their parents as well, and last year the senior classes said they would not come back to school into re-opening in January unless I came back to teach them.\nI have endeavoured to make my pupils honest, punctual, and reverent, and have given them more time and effort regarding their work than many of my predecessors, and I certainly feel hurt at the injustice of Mr. Clarke's report.\n\nOf course I do not blame the department for the letter to me, as it had only the information the report contained. I have thought under several inspectors, and this is the first adverse report I ever received, so you may draw your own conclusions regarding it.\n\nTrusting this will set matters straight and thanking you for your favor,\n\nWith best wishes, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department would like to have a report from you on the recommendations of the Inspector.\n\nThe school is in need of a clock and a thermometer, which you may purchase. The price of the former should not exceed $3.00.\n\nThe Inspector says that the teacher of this school has considerable difficulty in getting the children properly supplied with books, and he thinks it would be advantageous to have the Department supply them. If the Tyendinaga Council thought it preferable, the supplies for all the schools could be ordered by the Department from the Government Stationery Office at the lowest figures and forwarded by mail.

Therefore the book stores let their stock run down thereby losing a lot of money with a stock down, the balance was carried over. However the new books are out and the stores stocked with them at reduced prices there will therefore be no difficulty in obtaining the needed books.\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that this school was repaired some years ago as was also the other schools and are now in good shape and I beg to say that the schools on this reserve will compare very favorably with any rural school in the Dominion, as far as appearance and maintenance are concerned.

Original on 153808/6.\n\nNew floor is needed! Closets are not at all satisfactory, particularly the boys' closet, which is filthy, the door off the hinges and the walls disfigured with very improper remarks. I reported on this at my last visit and matters are not improved in any way.\n\nIf the caretaker's duties are not clearly defined they should be. Is it intended that the children do the sweeping and cleaning? Fires are not always satisfactory mornings. This building is not wind-proof.\nOttawa, December 18, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Inspector Clarke's report on the Eastern Tyendinaga School. He states that a new floor is needed and that the closets are not all satisfactory, especially the boys', which is said to be in a filthy condition; the doors are off the hinges and the walls disfigured. Mr. Clarke also refers again to the defining of the duties of the caretaker. He asks whether it is intended that the children should do the sweeping and cleaning. As it is at present the fires are not always satisfactory in the morning.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to see that the closets are cleaned and repaired during the Christmas holidays. You will also obtain an estimate of the cost of flooring the building and I would ask you to report again to the duties of the caretaker. The Department does not approve of having this work done by the pupils and it may be necessary to make other arrangements. Kindly give this matter prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

R. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nThe Trustees of the Eastern Sioux School have advised that there should be a brick floor laid in the school-room as also recommended that the foundation be mortared up and the door be repaired. They also think it would be a good idea to surround the main room with metal siding inside which would add to the warmth of the building. The Chiefs having approved this proposal, the floor could be laid for about four days. The outside work could be done at any time before cold weather and could possibly be done more cheaply after the Masons were through with their summer contracts. The cost of repairs would be about One Thousand Dollars if the promised labor was done at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. M.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. W.J. Malley,\nBemerton, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the Inspector Charles report on the Cataraqui Indian School, it is obvious that he points fault with the desks. I am aware that desks are needed and you Mr. Beaton called my attention to this matter while I was inspecting these schools last summer. I find by looking into this matter that there are some 15 desks needed in this school, and a few needed in two other schools. I had estimated about 15 desks.\n\nIn Belleville they are building a new school and intend to put in individual desks. They have some old desks. They inform me that they have 40 second-hand desks for sale at $2.00 per desk with chairs, tops and in good condition scarcely a mark on them all supplied with ink wells. I would advise that 15 or 20 be purchased at their price which, with what we already have would put these schools in good shape as to seating, as seats which we now have certainly be tightened up under pressure are not and be made very poor. If it is decided to purchase these desks from Belleville it must be done once at the price they are on sale at will result in these being sold quickly. I hardly advise quickly what we have with us in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 7, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. Agent Stainton, who was asked to state how many new desks are required for the schools in his agency, reports that about fifteen or twenty will be needed and suggests that they could be secured at about $1.00 per seat from the Belleville School Board. A new schoolhouse is being erected there, which will be refurnished, and the old seats are quite suitable for the schools on the Indian Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Stainton's suggestion be carried out, as out of the number of desks to be discarded twenty first-class desks can no doubt be secured and as the price is so much below the ordinary cost quite a saving would be effected. These desks would be paid for out of the band funds.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant I beg to say that the department approves of your suggestion to purchase the number of desks required to complete the seating accommodation in the schools in your agency, 15 or 20, from the Public School trustees in Belleville at the rate quoted in your letter, $1.00 per seat, and you are hereby authorized to obtain them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDovercourt, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe need ten school desks for the Birds School (235) on the Reserve when Mr. Benson was here he saw the condition of the desks most all are broken. I went to Belleville and saw the school board there and I was shown some second-hand desks just as good as new ones which they have would sell them to us for one dollar each. I asked Superintendent Mr. Smith to fit them and he told me that the Board ask for instructions from the Dept. in connection with both the matter how soon can the desks be got.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSamson Green\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 26, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that this matter was brought to the attention of the Department by Agent Stainton, who has been authorized to purchase the desks in Belleville.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Irvine Brant,\nTeacher\nOttawa, January 11, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of November 11th, last, in which you were authorized to purchase some desks from the Belleville Public School Board I have to ask you to be good enough to state why some of these desks have not been supplied to the Eastern School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 6, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Inspector Clark in reference to conditions at the Eastern Tyendinaga School. He refers again to the abominable conditions in the water closets, to the need of seating and blackboard accommodation and to the lack of proper arrangements for caretaking.\n\nYou should see that these closets are attended to at once.\n\nYou will also advise the Department as to the lengths of the blackboards required and state the number of rows of seats and the number of seats in each row needed to accommodate the children and an order will be placed for them by the Department.\n\nThe Inspector states that the building has not been scrubbed since the new floor was put in. It is noted that in your statement of the duties of the caretakers of this and the other schools on the reserve the scrubbing of the floors is not included. This must be done at least quarterly and the Department will expect you to make the necessary arrangements accordingly. You should have this school scrubbed at once, and the other three if necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJos. Stanton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from Inspector R.J. Clarke's report on the Eastern Indian School located on Mohawk reserve. Dated Feb. 27\n\nBuilding is not wind-proof. In a driving storm the teacher tells me that the snow drifts in around the windows.\n\nSeats are poor affairs and should be replaced.\n\nClosets are disgraceful. How can any teacher be expected to teach morality when the abominable decoration in these closets are allowed to remain before the children. I have reported on this so often that I am almost of the opinion that to report is useless.\n\nWater-tank is still needed as bad as ever. A pail with a cover is almost as unsanitary as an open pail.\n\nBlackboards in front of room are very poor.\n\nThere are some broken windows.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nThe desks in the Eastern Tyendinaga School were condemned sometime ago by the Public School Inspector and the late Agent was authorized to have them replaced, but he neglected to do so. They are in a wretched condition and should be discarded at once. Eighteen double desks of assorted sizes are required and I should like to know from whom they should be ordered. This school is in Mr. Northrup's constituency. This matter should be attended to at once, as the school will be re-opened this week and cannot be carried on properly without new desks.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, September 3, 1913.\nOttawa, September 4, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Benson of this Department, who visited the Eastern Tyendinaga School in company with you last week, reports that 18 double desks are required at this school as the ones at present there are unsuitable. You are hereby authorized to purchase eighteen double separate desks of the following sizes from a local furniture dealer and have them placed in the school and securely screwed to the floor:\n\n- 6 No. 5\n- 6 No. 4\n- 4 No. 3\n- 2 No. 2\n- 2 rear seats No. 2\n- 1 rear seat No. 4\n\nThese should be placed in three rows, seven in each of the outside rows and four in the center row. The old desks should be discarded and removed from the school. You will be good enough to attend to this matter at once.\n\nThe Department trusts that the repairs to this and the other schools which were authorized by Mr. Benson have been attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Mr. John Scott got the keys of the schools, locked me out, & did not like to go ahead with the work under the circumstances. I consulted the Indian agent here, he said he would take the matter up with the department at Ottawa, & I best to wait until further orders as I have had nothing definite from him.

The coal shed is to be erected in the yard away from the school. Would it not be better to build a lean to all the way across the front of the school, the same as I am doing at the Western school, take the coal down off the east end and the remainder could make a porch over the door at the entrance and would help to keep out the cold wind over buildings etc. would save going out in the snow for the coal. The additional cost for same would be about fifty dollars all complete with paint. I enclose a sketch for same. Please let me know if this meets with\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Clement, Esq.,\nContractor and Builder,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nMemo to Schools Branch.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of Sept. 26th, I beg to report as follows.\n\nThe work done at the Western, Central and Eastern schools having been completed by Mr. Clement, I inspected same with the following result.\n\nAll the work done was found to be in accordance with the agreement with the exception of the roof on the Western School which was not satisfactory to me. I saw Mr. Clement with regard to this matter and he agreed to complete the work in accordance with my request. Some two or three boards on the inside were also badly sprung. I asked Mr. Clement to have these drawn into place.\n\nAt the Central school Mr. Clement performed the work agreed upon and also put new clapboards on the front and fitted one new sash and frame for one window. These two repairs were not included in the agreement but Mr. Clement stated that the repairs were so urgent that he took it upon himself to do the work. So far as the work is concerned I might say that it is well done.\n\nAs the stove pipes at this school were in such a rotten state that it was impossible to start a fire without danger of burning the school, I asked Mr. Clement to take out ten lengths of pipe and one elbow and set up the pipes properly.\n\nAt both the Western and Central schools I considered that the coal bins should have a lock. I accordingly asked Mr. Clement to put a staple, hasp and padlock on these two bins.\nAt the Mission school it was found necessary to place a new sill under the door. The rotten state of the sill was not visible at the time that the repairs were arranged so that this is an extra. This work had already been done at the time I visited the school.\n\nAt the Eastern school the repairs were still under way. As the plaster is to be repaired in a great many places and is now in a very dirty state, and as the woodwork is to be painted white, I thought that the repaired plaster should be kalsomined. To leave the ceiling with so many repairs, some quite large, and paint the woodwork white, would make a very poor appearance. I took it upon myself to authorize Mr. Clement to kalsomine the ceiling.\n\nI might say that the work done by Mr. Clement was very satisfactory and that he appeared to be anxious to have all the work done in such a manner as would satisfy the Department in every way.\n\nThe Rathbun Co., in Deseronto and Mr. Kerr in Shannonville were advised to start delivery of coal as ordered some time ago. A load of kindling wood for the Eastern and Mission schools was also ordered from the Rathbun Co.. There is sufficient at the two Western schools for the present time, there being a great deal of old shingles etc left from the repairs.\n\nAttached, herewith, you will find a list of material ordered at Shannonville for the four schools in accordance with memorandum handed to me by Mr. Benson.\n\nWith\nWith reference to my instructions to the new Agent, Mr. Campbell, as regards schools, I might say that I instructed him as follows.\n\nEach of the four schools are to be visited once monthly. After each visit he is to forward a report to the Department on the forms supplied for that purpose. He was told that such visits were not expected to take the form of an actual inspection, such as is made by the regular school inspectors, but that the visit would be more for the purpose of seeing that the teachers were supplied with necessary material, that buildings and equipment were in proper condition and that the schools were being properly attended and receiving the support of the Indians. It was pointed out that there had been certain friction heretofore which had interfered to some extent with the working of the schools. In this connection he was told that so long as the teachers were retained by the Department, he would be expected to see that they received his support, but that this need not interfere with him reporting to the Department any dereliction of duty on the part of a teacher.\n\nAs there was no caretaker for the Central School, he was instructed to have one appointed without delay.\n\nIn view of the lack of support on the part of the late Agent, in school matters, I also told the teachers at the two Western Schools that in case of neglect on the part of the Agent, they would do the Department a favor by reporting the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.S.

Original 153808-7\n\nI visited this school on the above date and there were 30 scholars. If the children keep coming as they have this spring there will not be room for them as we only have seating for 36. Something will have to be done at this school soon.\n\nG. M. Campbell,\nAgent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott -\n\nBefore commencing plans for school buildings on the Tyendinaga Reserve, it will be necessary to procure definite information respecting the sites that basement for heating and satisfactory drainage may be assured.\n\nThere is also doubt whether the eastern school is a balsam frame, veneered, or solid brick construction, and this must be determined before making plans for alterations.\n\nThe information could be procured and sketches made in one day or at the most two.\n\nThe plans should be at once prepared, if work is to be undertaken this year. Should you approve of this, I will make the inspection on Tuesday next.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, July 23, 1918.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAs instructed, I made an inspection of the four schools on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, on Tuesday, 16th instant, for the purpose of defining the exact condition of the several schools there, and more particularly the eastern one, that sufficient data would be available for use in the alteration of existing buildings or the building of new schools.\n\nThe eastern one is of solid brick construction, about forty years old and on the verge of collapse. No use can be made of any portion of the building as now standing, as there is no proper foundation under the walls, and these with the superstructure have bulged and cracked to such an extent as to render the walls useless and unsafe.\n2.\n\nThe bricks in this building may be re-used when building is torn down after the completion of the new building as will be necessary, but the cost of tearing down and cleaning of the bricks will be at least equal to the value of the product.\n\nA new and larger school is necessary at this point and its erection should be undertaken at once, the old school being retained for use until the new one is finished and ready for occupation.\n\nOwing to labour conditions at this time, which would unnecessarily increase the cost of a brick building, I would recommend that a frame one be erected, and that this work be proceeded with as soon as possible. The school to provide accommodation for fifty-three pupils, the number now enrolled.\n\nThe other three schools are of frame, all of similar design and all being in poor condition and will require rebuilding as soon as this can be undertaken, as the walls are all badly spreading, the building old, cold, poorly constructed, and without adequate accommodation.\nThe Mission school is in the best condition of the three wooden buildings and shows evidence of much better care than that of any of the others. The interior of this school is also neatly painted, both walls and woodwork, and should prove a stimulating incentive to the other schools.\n\nBefore building on the north school-site, it would be well to take a census of the residents of this section and determine if a different site would not be advisable. This matter will be more fully referred to in a separate report of the north school.\n\nI also made an inspection of the Council-hall, as certain repairs are absolutely necessary there, also to the Missionary residence where the driving-shed requires a new roof-covering, the old covering leaking very badly.\n\nThese matters will be more fully covered in a separate report on their respective files.\n\nArchitect.\nINDIAN TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTo Mrs. N.

The combining of the several sections for a graded school does not appear feasible at this time. It has therefore been decided to erect a new school to accommodate the children in that vicinity. A blueprint copy of the plans is being sent you under separate cover for your information. With respect to this I may say that the Department will be pleased to have any suggestions which you may offer with a view of improvement.\n\nAs it is intended to prepare for the erection of the buildings within a very short time, an early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. J. Clark, Esq., B. A.,\nInspector of Schools,\nBelleville, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favour of 12th instant # 153808-5 received today, and apparently it crossed one that I wrote to you yesterday.\n\nI have pleasure in indicating a few minor points, that in my opinion, will improve your plan for the new school to replace the Eastern Mohawk School, Tyendinaga Reservation.\n\n(1) Apparently it is intended to take the cold air from the school-room to the furnace, heat it and send it back to the room. This will be quite satisfactory in the morning before the room is warmed up and before the children assemble for study, but during the time that the school is in session, the air should be brought in from out-of-doors, warmed, and sent to the room. Otherwise the children will be breathing air more than once. I need not point out that passing air through the air chamber of a furnace will not purify it. But it is not necessary to argue this point, for it is self-evident.\n\n(2) I judge that this plan contemplates a platform for the teacher. This is not generally approved of at the present time. The teacher should not be elevated above her class. Lower your blackboards to, say 30 inches from the floor, and omit the platform would be my advice. The width of blackboard is not indicated, but I assume that you will put in four foot slates.\n\n(3) The lighting will be improved by omitting that wall between...\nbetween Belleville, Ont., 191\n\nthe windows, and replacing it with steel uprights, I just forget the name given to them by builders. The idea is to have as little obstruction to the light as possible where the windows are situated, so as to avoid shadows.\n\n(4) Would it not be possible to dispense with one of those entrances? Suppose you let the children enter from doors placed in the front, approximately where the plan shows windows to cap-rooms; place windows where the present plan shows entrances for the pupils; and do away with the central entrance altogether, replacing that door with a window. That would give a more satisfactory room for the teacher, which in the present plan will be largely a vestibule. The teacher can enter by one of the doors provided for the pupils, without any difficulty. This of course is merely a suggestion.\n\n(5) Be careful that this basement does not go too deeply into the ground; at least two-thirds of the basement wall should be above the ground line.\n\n(6) This plan of course does not suggest the tinting of the walls, but in arranging this, I hope you will be careful to choose proper tints. Some interiors of schools are positively painful to look at, let alone having to endure them continually.\n\n(7) There is nothing suggested in the way of closets. The average school W.C. is an abomination. While you are about it, I trust that this very important matter will receive attention. Unless you adopt some form of chemical closet, such as the Kaustine Closet, I suppose that indoor closets are out of the question, but if they must be out-of-doors, let them be the best possible. I know of no greater menace to the children at the\nthe children at the rural school, than the average W.C. It is possible to have a fairly satisfactory out-door closet, so far as the moral effect is concerned, by making it next to impossible to make the obscene decorations. The danger to health from exposure in cold weather however cannot be avoided.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nH.J.C.\n\nBlueprint of Plan goes forward under separate cover.\n\nH.J.C.\nBelleville, Ont., Feb. 13, 1919.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI received today, Blue-Print of Plan #419 presumably for a school to replace the present Eastern School on the Tyendinaga Reservation. I do not know just what your purpose was in sending the plan to me, but if you desire them, I would be glad to make a few suggestions that in my judgment would improve the plan submitted.\n\nIf it is your intention to build this one-teachered school, I assume that you do not at this time intend to attempt any consolidation of your schools. As intimated on my report to you of recent date, there are difficulties to overcome in any considerable consolidation, and probably for some years to come, the system of four schools will better serve your purposes. I hope however that you will consider my suggestion as to getting your teachers trained to teach Agriculture, and Household Science also, if possible. These subjects would be beneficial even if some of the so-called regular subjects have to be curtailed to make room for them.\n\nKindly direct me as to your wishes in reference to the above mentioned plan.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is portable, however, and can be dispensed with if not used.\n\nWith respect to the teaching of household science which you advise, the department cannot provide accommodation which would be necessary for the purpose on the ground floor, but might fix up a room in the basement as a kitchen, where this might be taught if considered advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I am making this contribution in consideration of the heavy demands upon the funds of the band for necessary improvements to roads and buildings. I will further expect the Council to take an active interest in seeing that shade trees are planted and other necessary steps taken to beautify the grounds in connection with the school, after building operations have ceased.

Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto,\nOnt.\nHOW much higher will coal prices go?\n\nThat's a mighty serious question for some, but it needn't worry owners of the Spencer Steam or Hot Water Heater.\n\nThe \"Spencer\" burns the small, cheap sizes of hard coal, such as No. 1 Buckwheat and Pea.\n\nNo. 1 Buckwheat is known as a \"steam size,\" costing $2 to $3 less per ton than domestic sizes. It is a by-product of the larger sizes.\n\nNot being adaptable for domestic use except in a heater especially designed to burn it (as the \"Spencer\" is), it is dependent on manufacturing and other industries for its sale.\n\nHere it must meet the competition of soft coal. If the price of Buckwheat were advanced even a few cents a ton, instantly manufacturers would turn to soft coal.\n\nThus, operators would have on hand thousands of tons of Buckwheat coal which they would be unable to sell.\n\nIn fact, No. 1 Buckwheat was not advanced following the recent strike.\nHere it must meet the competition of soft coal. If the price of Buckwheat were advanced even a few cents a ton, instantly manufacturers would turn to soft coal.\n\nThus, operators would have on hand thousands of tons of Buckwheat coal which they would be unable to sell.\n\nIn fact, No. 1 Buckwheat was not advanced following the recent strike.\n\nBecause it successfully burns this small inexpensive fuel, the \"Spencer\" practically insures its owner against rising coal prices.\n\nNot only this, but the \"Spencer,\" by burning these small sizes, reduces coal bills ONE-THIRD to ONE-HALF on the present scale of prices.\n\nIt is likely to show a proportionately greater percentage of saving in the future.\n\nA heater is a \"long-term\" investment. Do you want one that will double its cost by burning the expensive sizes of coal? Or a \"Spencer,\" that will pay for itself in reduced coal bills in a few seasons?\n\nConsider before investing what kind of coal a heater burns.\n\nSPENCER HEATER CO.\nSCRANTON, PA.\nTHE water-jacketed self-feed magazine of the \"Spencer\" requires coaling but once in 24 hours in ordinary winter weather\u2014twice in severe.\n\nThe coal feeds automatically upon sloping grates, which insure even depth of fire and perfect combustion.\n\nThe \"Spencer\" self-feed feature assures constant, even heat for from 8 to 12 hours without attention. It eliminates the necessity of a night fireman in flats, greenhouses, etc., and also enables residence owners to relieve the \"women folks\" of all care of the heater. In case of serious illness in the home this feature is invaluable.\n\nBRANCHES:\n\nNEW YORK CITY, 501 Fifth Ave., Cor. 42nd St.\nCHICAGO, - - - 187 N.

Scott\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Heating School, Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, Ont.\n\nWe desire to call your attention at this time to the fact that the SPENCER SELF-FEEDING BOILERS for heating purposes are giving results and a service to the public never before accomplished by any other type of heating boiler constructed up to this age.\n\nThe magazine of the SPENCER BOILERS, with one filling, holds a 24 hour supply of coal. The arched grates of the boiler permit thin fires and the fuel feeds out of the magazine in exact proportion as the coal is consumed. Half of the Twin type boiler can be operated separately in mild weather.\n\nBecause of the magazine and arched grate features of the SPENCER the Boiler burns without waste the small inexpensive size of anthracite coal known as #1 Buckwheat, which grade of coal can be purchased anywhere in Eastern Canada at a price of $3.00 per ton less than the regular grades. The SPENCER will also burn the other grades of hard coal and small sizes of soft coal, which are of a non-coking nature.\n\nAs a proof of the efficiency of the Boilers burning this cheap grade of fuel, the ashes when removed from the base are invariably in a powdered condition, and the smoke-pipe leaving the boiler is invariably cooler than the heating mains leaving the boiler when in operation.\n\nThe SPENCER BOILERS are now MADE IN CANADA in all of the various types and sizes suitable for any type of building equipped with hot water heating and the SPENCER is also manufactured in some twenty-seven sizes as a DOUBLE WATER TUBE STEAM HEATER suitable for any size building.\n\nWe can favor you with references concerning the operation of hundreds of SPENCER Boilers in various parts of Canada and thousands in the United States, proving the fact that you cannot afford to continue operation or install an ordinary type of boiler in your building, even as a gift, when compelled to supply fuel and attention for a term of ten years, as compared with the saving and results obtainable by the use of a SPENCER Boiler, which we have proven requires attention not more than once every twelve hours in the coldest weather. SPENCER Boilers are known to run twenty-four hours without attention while keeping the building at a comfortable temperature. The hundreds of references from Winnipeg installations are positive proof of the success of the SPENCER HEATER.\n\nWe will be pleased to furnish you with further information and descriptive catalogue, at your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSPENCER HEATER COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED.\n\nSales Dept.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Campbell.\n\nNot having the means to take a lump sum contract or a unit price contract, but I would be pleased Sir to take charge of the erection of said School House as per plans and specifications on a cost plus compensation from my contract at the rate of 5 per cent of the cost of completed School House.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nJohn Walker,\nStrawmills\n\nMay 26, 1919.\n\nBox 186:\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Chief John Walker in regard to the new school that is to be built. Mr. Walker has not the money to take the contract; he would do all the work and finish the school according to the plans on a percentage basis.\n\nMr. Walker is a good carpenter and has done quite a bit of work around the county among the Whites and they all give him a good name as a carpenter and builder.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Campbell\nAgent\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nMAY 31 1919\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, June 5th, 1919.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared for a school building on the eastern section, Tyendinaga Reserve, necessitated by the extremely dangerous condition of the old building which is now unfit for use. Tenders were asked for by advertisements in Contract Record and four local papers circulating in that vicinity. Owing to the uncertain labour conditions existing at that time no tenders have been received.\n\nAs it is necessary to have this building completed for the re-opening of the school in September next, quotations of material removed from the demolished air service buildings on the reserve and suitable for this building has been received at a price considerably lower than the present market quotations; also an offer from Chief John Walker of this band for the erection of the building on the cost plus compensation basis at 8% of the cost of the building.\n\nThe Indian Agent reports that Walker is a competent builder and has successfully executed many contracts in that vicinity.\n\nAs it is necessary that the work should be undertaken as soon as possible, I would recommend that Chief Walker's offer for the work be accepted, using such materials as are available from the old school building, and that all other materials be purchased by the Department, this apparently being the most economical method of erecting the building.\n\nArchitect.\nJune 5th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department accepts the offer of Chief John Walker to erect the Eastern School, Tyendinaga Reserve, on the percentage basis of 5% of the total cost of labour and material as stated in his letter.\n\nThe Department will purchase the materials and have them delivered on the site as economically as possible, so that there will be no delay caused by reason of lack of these supplies. You are also authorized to arrange with Messrs. S. Anglin & Co., of Deseronto, for the immediate delivery of the material tendered on by them at the price of $271.20 at the school site. With reference to this, I have to request that you will immediately notify them of this acceptance so that there will be no delay on their part in the delivery.\n\nFurther instructions in reference to this will be sent you within a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. H. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 6th inst in regard to the new school contract which you have given John Walker the contract on a percentage basis and also the O'Anglin Co. for material which they quoted you prices and I would refer you to that circular asking for prices for material delivered at Deseronto, and the school is two miles from the station and the O'Anglin Co. quoted prices free at Camp Mohawk which is one and a half miles from the school. The Messrs. Anglin were in the office today and said that they would deliver the material in their contract at the school for $25.00 which I think is reasonable and they would like to know by Monday morning June 9th as they are anxious to get the material to the ground. Will you please give this letter your immediate attention and let me know by the time asked for.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nAttorney\n\nRush\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department will therefore pay $20.00 additional for delivery at the school site, this being in your estimation a reasonable price for the cartage of these materials.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to carefully check over the materials on receipt at the school, also to see that these are properly piled up and secured from the weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Anglia Co. at $50 per sq. ft., and when they delivered it I could not except it as it was a very poor quality and I went to Napier's lumber yard and bought it for $8 per sq. ft. for its quality and flooring S. Anglia wanted $10 per sq. ft. Light of Napier's board $2.50 per sq. ft. and $160 per sq. ft. for the floor and W.D. Mclure wanted $100 for the flooring and I bought from him and I might say that all the material that we got from him was of first class stock.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Affairs\nOttawa\n\nYour obedient servant\nG.M. Campbell\nAgent\nOttawa, 13th November, 1919.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to draw attention to the fact that upon two different occasions you submitted an account of $85.00 from Mr. J.F. McFarlane for nails supplied for building the new Eastern school, and consequently upon this occasion a duplicate payment was made. The account was first submitted under cover of a letter of the 6th August, 1919 and was paid by cheque No. 3527. The account was again received under cover of a letter of the 23rd September, 1919 and was paid by official cheque No. 4808. The Department desires to have you call at once upon Mr. McFarlane to refund $85.00 the amount overpaid which money you should forward here.\n\nIf the school building is completed, report to that effect should be made. I may also say that if any accounts remain unpaid in connection with the building, they should be submitted to the Department without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.M.

On July 5th, Mr. Walker got 200 lbs. of nails @ 5\u00a2 per hundred amounting $10.\n\nAnd this account was sent to the Depot on Aug. 8th.\n\nAnd on July 21st, Mr. Walker got 200 lbs. of nails @ 5\u00a2 per hundred amounting $10.\n\nAnd on Aug. 9th, Mr. Walker got 200 lbs. of nails @ 5\u00a2 per hundred amounting $10.\n\nAnd this account was sent to the Depot on Aug. 9th.\n\nIn all, 600 lbs. of nails from Mr. McFarland amounting $40.\n\nIn all, but the first time I am at Shawinigan I will examine Mr. McFarland's account and report.\n\nThe School House has been completed and I have asked Mr. Walker to submit all the accounts he has, and I will look them up and send them in in a few days.

The air for the heating system is taken from the class-room instead of having a separate intake in the basement as is usually done.\n\n2nd. Down pipes should be connected to the eavestrough in order that the water may be drained to a certain distance from the building, instead of the present arrangement which allows the water to remain around the foundation of the building.\n\n3rd. Window shades should be hung on the windows of the class-room.\n\n4th. The arrangement of the seats is not properly made.\n\nTo remedy the above mentioned defects would require a very small expenditure. If funds are available, I would recommend that Mr. Campbell, the Indian Agent, be requested to have these attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nNovember 19, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed through Inspector Clarke's report on the Eastern School, Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, that the following changes and additions should be carried out at this school.\n\n1st. The pupils' seats should be arranged so that those of the same dimensions be placed in the same row.\n\n2nd. Window shades should be hung on each of the windows of the class-room.\n\n3rd. Down pipes made of galvanized iron 4\" in diameter should be connected to the eavestrough and to vitrified clay pipes in order that the water from the roof may be drained away from the building to a distance of at least 10' where most suitable.\n\n4th. A separate intake pipe should be installed in the basement in order to supply the hot air furnace with fresh air. The intake of this pipe should be placed in one of the cellar windows and made to open and close as may be desired in order to regulate the admission of air from the outside.\n\nIt is desired that you will have the above mentioned work performed as soon as possible under your supervision, and inform the Department when same is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan 19th in reference to Mr. Clarke's request regarding the seats, we have no small size seats at all the new seats are of the larger size. The seats in question are poorer and not as good as the seats were in the old school, and if we place the seats as Mr. Clarke wants them, the child will have turn his feet out in the aisle before he can rise, and I would urge for Mr. Ogden to inspect them before being moved.\n\n(1) Window shades will be put on during Christmas holidays.\n\n(2) Regarding the water from the roof, two of the main outlets are carried five feet from the foundation and the one in question is the water from the front porch where very little water comes down but there can be taken a way by putting a pipe in the ground and let it go in the tile at the bottom of the foundation which can be done when the first goes out.\n\n(3) With reference to the outside pipe & the furnace, I beg to say that I have taken this question up with the Agent of the Surveyor, and he tells me that they do not use the cold air pipe from out side of the building any more, and that the proper way is to air the school room by opening the doors in the morning and letting over.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nThe fresh cold in. And the agent says that they have not used the cold air pipe from our side in years. Now we have the opinion of Mr. Blake and also of the Survey Agent. But I think we should have the opinion of some man from the Dept.\n\nI ought say we have one of the finest looking schools in the Country from Toronto to Montreal if not the finest.\n\nBut there should be some change in the inside. We should have a bath in the North East corner of the Basement and have it attached to a drain which could be done very easily. We could also have a cistern under the stairs that would hold 50 lbs. of water at a very little cost as we have the walls already and only need a floor and a few other changes.\n\nI would like if Mr. Agar would come up and inspect the building before any changes are made and have him suggest any changes that are needed and we will have them done.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nG.M.

This leaves the sum of $3157.44 to be paid from band funds on the construction of this building, by day labour.\n\nThe undersigned would accordingly recommend that, under Section 89 of the Indian Act, authority be given for the above mentioned expenditure of $3157.44 being made from the capital at the option of the Tyendinaga band, which amounts to $60133.52, on the construction of the school building above mentioned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nThere is a recommendation for payment of half of the cost of a new school house on the Tyendinaga reserve, from band capital - the other half to be charged to Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe old school house became unsafe for use, and beyond repair at an economical figure. Tenders were called for, but owing to labour conditions no contractor would undertake the work. It was then arranged with Chief John Walker of the Tyendinaga band, who is a builder, to construct a building on a percentage basis of 5% of the total cost of labour and material. The building has been completed at a total cost of $6441.23, but there was realized from the sale of old material the sum of $126.35, leaving the sum of $6314.88 to be met, half of which is $3157.44. There are some heavy items already charged against the capital of the band for roads, buildings and bridges, and I thought that it would be advisable to relieve band funds to the extent of half the cost, the other half to be met from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nAn O.C. is necessary, under Section 89 of the Indian Act, for the expenditure of the portion to be paid from band capital, which amounts to $30,123.52.\n\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, January 17, 1920.\nOttawa, January 13, 1920.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAs per instruction from your office I have made an inspection of the eastern School on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, Ont., in order to investigate the remarks which have been made by the Provincial Inspector regarding certain improvements and repairs required at that school.

This not being advisable, I would recommend that a separate fresh air intake pipe be connected from the furnace to the east side wall of the school where the register could be placed in the vestibule of the pupils' entrance, thus affording a suitable place which will not interfere with the proper operation of the hot air heating system.\n\nSecondly. There are no blinds for the windows, but these have been ordered and are expected every day.\n\nThirdly. A cistern for the storing of soft water should be constructed under the stair landing of the pupils' entrance on the east side of the building. This cistern could be built of waterproof concrete at a cost of $40.00. The soft water would be obtained by connecting the save-troughs to the cistern. This water would be used for domestic purposes. A small wash basin will have to be installed in the receptacle room in the basement of the school in order to prevent the wasting of the soft water. The drainage of waste from this basin can be easily and economically installed owing to the high level of the basement floor above a ditch which passes through the school lot. The cost of the plumbing and drainage work would amount to $150.00.\n\nAs to the location of the seats in the school-room I beg to say that these appear to be in their right position. I would recommend that they be left as they are.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 1)\nJanuary 22nd, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that some alterations and changes were necessary at the Rydelmage Eastern School. I have to request, therefore, that you will attend to the following matters in your earliest convenience, and so that they are carried out in a satisfactory and economical manner along the lines suggested to you by Mr. Chene at the time of his visit to the school on the 8th instant in company with Chief John Walker.\n\nFirstly. The foul air register which is located near the floor in the chimney of the class-room should be replaced by a larger one of the same width, 24\" high. A new cold air intake with cast-iron register and louvre of same dimension as that already in place on the west side of the class-room should be installed in the wall of the vestibule of the school entrance and connected with a good size iron pipe to the furnace as was done for the above mentioned one.\n\nSecondly. You may arrange for the building of a cistern under the stair landing at the middle entrance for the storing of soft water. This cistern should be built of reinforced concrete and be provided with a suitable watertight cover lined with galvanized iron. The downspout of the roof will have to be continued to the basement and connected to this cistern, which should be equally provided with a cast-iron overflow pipe.\n\nThirdly. A small cast-iron enamelled wash basin may be installed in the recreation room in the basement with suitable connections to the cistern and drain pipe.\n\nFourthly. The drainage system as directed by Mr. Chene for the draining of the school building and plumbing fixtures may be improved. Great care should be taken in the system which will consist of a 4\" vitrified tile pipe will not be exposed to danger by frost, etc. It is not expected that any of the plumbing or drainage work outside of the building will be carried out until next spring. The rest of the work, however, may be attended to at once under the same arrangements as were made for the erection of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. M.

The roof is shingled with birds felt shingles and every wind that blows them up end and some of the shingles are cracking across where they turn up, the only remedy I can see is to have the whole roof tarred or have the roof gone over with a preparation which is made for felt or paper roofing, if this meets with the approval of the Dept I will have it done.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDEpt of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 11, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply to request that you will have the desks in the Eastern School on the Tyendinaga Reserve re-arranged in conformity with the suggestions made to you by the Public School Inspector.\n\nIt will not be possible for an officer of the Department to visit the reserve at the present time, to arrange for the selection of the sites for the new schools. You will be good enough to attend to this matter, as you have already been instructed.\n\nRegarding the leakage in the roof of the Eastern School, I have to request that you will take this matter up with the dealer, or manufacturer, of the Bird's felt shingles which were placed on the roof. It is considered that these shingles should have given better service and that the firm from which they were obtained should carry out any repairs required to have them made water tight. They should undertake this work without any charge.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department at a later date as to whether you can arrange with the firm from which the shingles were obtained to undertake these repairs. You should attend to this matter at once, in order that, if they refuse to do the work, we can then decide what is best to be done to have the roof repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

J. Clarke,\nInsp.\nOTTAWA, November 7th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Clarke again draws the attention of the Department to the leak in the roof of the Eastern school on the Tyendinaga Reserve. He states that this leak is continually growing worse.\n\nIn your letter of August 7th, last, you stated that it would be necessary to have the roof tarred or gone over with a preparation for felt or paper roofing. If it is impossible to have this roof repaired without being tarred or some other preparation being put on, I would be pleased if you would state the cost of having this work done. You should furnish a recommendation as to what you consider the best means of placing the roof in good condition, and you should also state the approximate cost of carrying out any suggestions which you may make regarding the proper treatment to be given. We would like you to attend to this matter at once in order that, if the work is authorized, it can be carried out this fall.\n\nThe Inspector further states that there are 6 broken panes of glass, and that he has reported this matter before but it has not received attention. You will be good enough to have 6 panes of glass put in where required, and this matter should receive your prompt attention. When the broken glass has been replaced, you should furnish properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that I went over this roof the last week in October and made some repairs. The leak in the teachers room has been stopped and the leak at the chimney was fixed and the teacher says that it did not leak the last rain we had.\n\nIn reference to the shingles I found several broken off by the wind blowing them up and I think if we had some cement to put under them they might stick fast now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. M. Campbell\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6225, file 494-5, part 2)\nOttawa, Nov. 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to state it is noted that you have had certain repairs made to the roof of the Eastern School building on the Tyendinaga Reserve, which have stopped the leakage. It is hoped that there will be no further cause for complaint from this source in future.\n\nIf, in your opinion, it is advisable to have further repairs made, in order to prevent the ends of the shingles from being blown up by the wind, you may arrange to have any work carried out which you consider would be satisfactory. You will, no doubt, be able to judge what is best to have done to overcome present conditions. No undue expenditure should be incurred in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.
