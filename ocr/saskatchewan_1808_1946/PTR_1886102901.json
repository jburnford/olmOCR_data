The following named committees were struck: Civil Justice, Judge Binnington, Col. McLeod, Judge Boyle, Mayor Macdonald, Board and Cayley; School and Mission, Col. McLeod; Judge Binnington, Mayor Macdonald, Judge Boyle; Towns, Mr. Hughes, Board and Cayley; School and Mission, Col. McLeod; Judge Binnington, Mayor Macdonald, Judge Boyle; Towns, Mr. Hughes, Board and Cayley; Mississauga, Board and Cayley.\n\nOn the committee respecting prairie fires, Mr. Marshall said he would like to be appointed on it, as he came from a district where prairie fires were prevalent.\n\nJudge Richardson made the suggestion that a special committee should be struck for this purpose.\n\nThe ordinance respecting Civil Justice was read a second time, and was referred to the standing committee on civil justice.\n\nCol. McLeod, on behalf of the special committee, moved that the House draw up an address in reply to the Lord Gover- nor's speech, repeated the reply.\n\nCouncillor Jolly asked that it be printed and sent to the Lord Governor.\n\nThe Council overruled the request, and the speech was read clause by clause, Col. McLeod in the chair.\n\nThe address follows:\n\n1. The members of your Council beg leave to thank you for the kind de- monstrations of your kindness and gratification shown us at the opening of your session, and to express our gratulation to your house as to the wonderful progress in the Northwest Territories.\n\n2. The completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway will have a great effect both in a Canadian and Imperial point of view. It is gratifying to know that railway facilities are being extended throughout the territories, and that there appears to be a good prospect that in the near future a railway through the Hudson Bay will be opened with its mother country. Although immigration has not been as large as was anticipated, it is satisfactory to know that those who have come to the country are well pleased with their lot.\n\n3. We join with your house in the opinion that the delegates to Ottawa performed their duties carefully and well, and we have no cause for complaint.\n\n4. The establishment of a Supreme Court, with appellate jurisdiction within the territories satisfies, we think, the desire of the people, and we are glad to know that the schools and municipal or diances passed last session are working satisfactorily.\n\n5. We assure your honour of the importance we attach to the suggestions in regard to the electoral provisions, because of the electoral districts with a view to a more complete representative character being given to the Council. We are in believing that the time has come when that character should be given to the Council, similar to that which the Legislative Assemblies of the older provinces. The census of the territory recently taken shows that the present system of electoral boundaries will bring the elected members of the Council up to the number provided for below on the territories the assembly is created in the Northwest Territories Act. It seems to be a matter of some such a distribution of seats as will have a beneficial effect in the country mentioned in order to secure the result desired by the framers of the act. The utmost consideration should therefore be given to the subject.\n\nHis Honour took his chair at 3 p.m. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and adopted.\n\nHis Honour thanked the Council for the attention. He said that they could agree with him on the subjects which he had brought before them.\n\nHis Honour gave the members public notice of the Territorial Act from Nov. 1st to Aug. 31st, 1886.\n\nA petition was presented from the settlers of Fort Simpson praying that they may be incorporated as a town.\n\nMr. Porter moved that it be referred to a committee on municipal law, but being explained that no such committee had been appointed, he agreed to lay it on the table in the meantime.\n\nThe petition of Robert Dunsdale, barrister, of Qu'Appelle, praying that the land held by him in the said place be sold in connection with the multitude of other lands held by the same person.\n\nMr. Cayley introduced and moved the first reading of a bill to relieve Calgary from the municipal disabilities of Carleton County, in behalf of the civil relations committee.\n\nMr. Crawford moved that a committee be instructed to inquire into and report on the causes of prairie fires and recommend such amendments to the present laws as would prevent the spread of the community from the evil. He regretted to state that there had been a great number of fires in the past season, and hundreds of settlers had lost their crops and buildings and even their cattle.\n\nThe present legislation was not only not sufficient, but it ought to be amended. The committee named were Messrs. Laidlaw, Marshall, Porter, McLeod, Boyle, Mr. Hughes, and Mr. Porter.\n\nMr. Porter, Mr. Boyle, and Mr. Hughes were also added.\n\nMr. Porter moved that the finance committee be instructed to inquire into the working of the bill respecting the homesteads in Qu'Appelle. Carried.\n\nThe Council then adjourned till Monday, the 18th.\n\nThe receipt and expenditures of the general revenue fund of the Northwest Territories from Nov. 1, 1885, to Aug. 31, 1886, are as follows:\n\nAmount on hand, Nov. 1, 1885, $5,762.90; Receipts, $6,479.71\u2014total, $12,242.81; Expenditures, $8,902.76; balance on hand, $3,340.24.\n\nThe chief topic of discussion just now is the cattle smuggling case, in connection with which three parties have been arrested, and rumor has it that more likely will be added. The cattle have been driven back, but after trying in vain to get a clue to the guilty parties the matter was let drop. Lately, however, the police authorities, with the assistance of the police, charged with the alleged smuggling of cattle. The arrest of the three parties of the police, charged with such a grave offense, it is to be hoped that justice will be done, and that the police will be able to prevent against a repetition of any such pastoral acts. The preliminary trial takes place today.\n\nIN TWO CHAPTERS.\n\nWe clip the following from the Regina Leader:\n\nThere was a young man took to steal the Queen's meat from its court. With nervous and guilty look, he stole, And escaped out Betta, Fiddler and Ark.\n\nOn the morning of the next day the post-punkled horseman took the tail end of one post-ranker and inscribed on a piece of paper the following:\n\nThis was the officer arrested. While the horseman had been with the ship to the other side, the horseman had been with the horseman to the other side.\n\nAnd now he goes posting in, And don't feel a little bit cold.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1886102901.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 4, "total-input-tokens": 6226, "total-output-tokens": 5488, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 11573, 1], [11573, 14805, 2], [14805, 15587, 3], [15587, 22393, 4]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false]}}]
