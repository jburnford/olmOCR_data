Indian Day School.\n\nIt is not possible to issue a cheque in your favour as the accounts which you forwarded have not been paid by you. You should submit a separate account, in triplicate, in favour of each of the firms from whom supplies were purchased. The accounts which you submitted are returned in order that you can prepare the vouchers required by the Department.\n\nI am also in receipt of your voucher for $673.21, covering the cost of labour and showing a balance on hand of $105.36. This amount should be returned to the Department.\n\nWhen returning the accounts for material, you should forward a detailed statement showing what work has been done. The expenditure incurred is somewhat larger than the Department expected and, therefore, we require a complete report from you in order that our files may show in what manner the money was expended.\n\nI wish, also, to refer you to the last paragraph of official letter of July 31st, last. Please advise if all accounts in connection with the construction of a gulley on the Notre Dame road in front of the street leading to the school have been kept separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nOttawa, October 3, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nSince writing you on the 30th ultimo, the Department has had an opportunity of checking your account of September 17th for $673.21, covering the expenditure made for labour at the St. Frances Indian Day School during the past summer. The pay sheets which you made out are so badly prepared that the Auditor General will not accept them.\n\nWith special reference to the pay list for the period July 31st to August 5th, I would point out that this pay list does not appear to be signed by the persons who received the money. On the pay list for the period July 12th to 20th, it is shown that Louis Robert worked 59 hours at the rate of 27 cents per hour, less 10 percent. The amount due him was $14.38 and not $15.37. I am, therefore, returning all the pay lists which you forwarded, and would request you to prepare these again on the proper forms, a supply of which is enclosed. You should also arrange to have them signed by the individuals who received the money.\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention, as these pay lists, properly completed, should have been forwarded to the Department some weeks ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McKeown\nSecretary\nRef.: Your Letter\n\nTo Dep. Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nSir:\n\nI beg leave to submit the following report on the matter of opening the school at the Story Point Reserve.\n\nThere are as nearly as I can tell from personal visits and inquiry seven children of school age on the Reserve who belong to the band and in addition three other Indian children who do not belong to the band.\n\nThese all reside convenient to one another and convenient to the school house.\n\nFrom the nearest corner of the Story Point reserve it is at least 3\u00bd miles to the Kettle Point school.\n\nThe children are all quite young.\n\nThe nearest white school is at Ravenswood about two miles from the nearest children.\n\nThere is on the Reserve in a quite central location a fairly good school house formerly used but abandoned some years ago on account of there being only one child attending. There are good desks and a teacher's table which perhaps wants a book or some trifling chairs and there is also a stove which has been taken out for safe keeping but can be got back easily.\n\nThe estimated cost would be $300 per annum for a teacher.\n\nWood, say $15-$25 per annum.\n\nCleaning & $10-$15 per annum.\n\nSome of the children have gone to school anywhere and will have to make a start at the beginning.\n\nFrom my own knowledge of the matter I recommend the opening of the school and have told the Indians that when the Department was made aware that there was 10 Indian children at Story Point it would likely insist on the school being opened.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam [Last Name]\nSir,\n\nI hereby transmit three resolutions of the Band Council which speak for themselves; two of them at least I will with enclosed a special report on one of them i.e., the one referring to the Story Point school in order to perhaps save extended correspondence on the question.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nWilliam Macleod\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 5, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent Nisbet, of Sarnia, forwards a resolution from the band asking for the reopening of the Stony Point school. This school was closed seven years ago on account of poor attendance.\n\nThe Agent has made a report on this application, which shows that there are at least ten children of school age who are receiving no education, on account of the distance from any other school.\n\nThe Band can well afford to maintain a school, and I would recommend that the resolution be approved and that it be given another trial after the summer holidays.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 7, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult., transmitting a resolution from the council of the Sarnia band for the reopening of the Stony Point school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no objection to the resolution being carried out, and you should consult with the Public School Inspector with a view to securing the services of a teacher to take charge of the school after the summer holidays at a salary of $300 per annum, and any applications received by you should be forwarded to the Department for consideration.\n\nAny repairs needed to put the school-house in order should be made in the interval.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Hissett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Office, Ottawa\n\nJ. D. McLean, Secretary\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that in compliance with instructions from the Department and after consulting with Inspector Mather - Public School Inspector for New London, I have received an application from Mrs. William Clark of the Stone Point Reserve for the position of teacher in the Stone Point School to be opened at the close of the summer holidays, which will be in the month of August. This is the only application received since it was resolved to open the Stone Point school and I recommend her appointment.\n\nShe holds an High School entrance certificate and after getting it attended the Forest High School for a year. She is about 25 years of age, is a widow, and a member of the band - i.e., the Chipewa of Carmaux Lake Band and Kettle Point - and appears to be clever and intelligent. The scholars will all be in the first book, none of them ever having attended school. I have made arrangements to have the schoolhouse repaired, the lock of the door being broken and the windows broken.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSchools Branch\n\nAUG 13 1907\nOttawa, August 14th, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant reporting that you have only received one application for the position of teacher for the Stony Point School and in reply I beg to say that in view of your recommendation Mrs. William Cloud may be appointed to take charge of this School at the salary mentioned, namely, $800.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSudbury, Ont.\nPainswood, Jan 17th\n\nSec.-Department of Indian Affairs,\nAttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg leave to make application for an increase of $40 per annum in my salary as teacher at Slaley Point School. I have already served 3 years and 6 months and I feel that I am entitled to have my salary raised by that amount. School teachers' wages now are much higher than they were when I engaged to teach that school first. My experience gained during the 3\u00bd years I have taught should make my services more valuable than they were at first. I feel that I am better qualified to do good work than at any time previously to this.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain Yours Truly,\n\nMrs. Robt. Wilkinson.\nSir,\n\nI hereby enclose an application from Mr. Robert McHannon of Stone Point Reserve for a raise of salary as teacher of the Stone Point School. There is no doubt as to Mrs. McHannon's energy and ability as teacher. She commenced at Stone Point school without any previous experience but although she was an Indian girl, born on Stone Point Reserve she had obtained a good education first at the Indian schools and afterward at Forest High School. When she first took charge of the Stone Point school she was the wife of William Bland, a Stone Point Indian. She is now married to Robert McHannon, a young Scotchman who lives in the neighborhood and is living in her own house quite close to the school. There is now no complaint made against her although owing to jealousy on the part of her own relatives and neighbors which seemed to arise from the fact that she was better educated and better dressed and after she got a regular salary seemed to be doing better than the other young Indian women\u2014there were a good many complaints the first two years principally charging her with drinking intoxicating liquor. I investigated all of these but there was no evidence to warrant even suspicion. Most of the stories when traced up had no foundation as regarded her. One woman had heard her crying on the road but that was explained easily on other grounds. Speaking candidly she has done very well and has been energetic and intent on succeeding and I think her fairly earned a reasonable increase. Mr. Bland the husband thinks she has done well all things considered and favors a modest increase in her salary.\n\n(Signed) Assistant Agent William Knight\n\nJanuary 7th, 1911\nOttawa, January 20, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant enclosing a communication from Mrs. McKinnon, teacher of the Stone Point School, in which she applies for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot comply with this request at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Jacobs\nSec.\nSir,\n\nWith regard to that portion of the Council minutes referring to the immediate dismissed of Mrs. McKinnon, Teacher at Ruby Point Reserve I would say the action grew out of the fact that she had been before a police magistrate & fined for being intoxicated four weeks ago today. I was present at the trial and felt from what came out that Mrs. McKinnon was not a proper person to have the young people in charge for without, but being but of short experience in such position I did not feel justified in being too severe especially as it was said she was in many respects a good teacher. So I did not report to the Department. Mrs. McKinnon assured me that she was not drunk but that Company with reference to whom I reported Feb 19th last her husband compelled her to drink etc. I have had an interview with Inspector Conn today and we decided to request the Department to allow Mrs. McKinnon to teach until Sept. 1st and allow her the\nSir,\n\nIn connection due for holidays,\nwith the understanding that her\nservices will be no longer\nrequired, and in the interests\nof new teachers be secured,\ntherefore await your\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR.

She should be informed that after that date her services will be no longer required and the Department will pay her the amount of salary due, as soon as the quarterly return is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe quarterly school return for Story Point has just been handed in this morning. It shows a very small attendance indeed. There are but few children on the reserve of school age and as you will observe only a fraction over one half are enrolled and only a fraction of these attend school. Perhaps a change of teacher may bring about a better condition of things. There is not a decided improvement & think something should be done to enforce attendance. What should be done to secure a new teacher? I am not aware as to the custom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.C. Palmer,\nAgent.\n\nP.S. Mr. Lea Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nOttawa.\n\nJuly 4\nOttawa, July 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that you should communicate with the Public School Inspector with a view to obtaining the services of a qualified teacher for the Stony Point School. The number of Indian children on the reserve is not sufficient to warrant the engagement of a highly qualified teacher at a large salary, but it may be that upon inquiry you will be able to recommend some person who will take an interest in the work and who would be competent to fill the position even although without any professional training of a high standard. A fair salary will be allowed and I would ask you to take up this matter at once and let the Department have the result of your inquiries as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nStoney Point, July 13th\n\nTo the Indian Dept.,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby ask to be re-instated as school teacher at Stoney Point, as I understand I have been dismissed through misbehaviour which is true to a certain extent, and I am sorry for it, and do not blame anyone but myself\u2014shall I be allowed to keep on until I can dispose of my improvements on my lot of which I will give due notice to the Agent so that there will be no inconvenience as to the appointment of another teacher, as there are only 3 or 4 children out of the 12 or 18 children of school age who attend the school.\n\n(Place, Etc., paper)\nit hardly enough to justify a change of the teacher just now, and I promise the Department that the offence of which I was accused shall not be repeated. If your Department is willing to give me this trial I would urge that the people should be made to send their children according to law\u2014 but that has never been enforced amongst Indians to my knowledge.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Place, Excerpts paper]\nOttawa, July 19, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant applying to be reinstated as teacher of the Stony Point School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Robt. McKinnon,\nRavenswood, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your 14th inst., Mr. Huntwood has been able to discuss the question of teachers for Stony Point School with Mr. Chinn, Public School Inspector. He has no one in mind whom he feels like recommending & suggests that we advertise in the Times Observer (weekly) and see what will show out. The paper is published each Friday. We would be glad to hear from you soon as possible so as to make the next issue fit under your approval. There is a young woman who has been engaged at St. Clair Reserve, anxious to secure the school, but we think best to publish the vacancy and see what we can get.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office,\nCaricca,\nJuly 24, 1911.\nOttawa, July 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion to advertise for a teacher for the Stony Point school and you may take action accordingly.\n\nTo a teacher with any qualifications the Department will pay a salary of $400.00 per annum. As you have already been informed the attendance of Indian children would not justify the engagement of a teacher at a higher salary. All applications received by you should be submitted to the Department for consideration, with any recommendations that you may wish to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. C. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nReferring to your application, we wish to inform you that the question of salary has been quite overlooked.

I think she would have an excellent influence over the children. She speaks of her purpose of instructing the children in needle work; and in the cultivation of plants and flowers on the lot. These added to the ordinary pursuits of school life I am sure will be of great advantage to the pupils.\n\nI am late in sending on these applications for two reasons.\n\nOne was that I was anxious to see if there would not be further applications; and it has been very difficult to get hold of Mr. Conn during the last week or so, and not until yesterday did I have an interview within that time.\n\nI am enclosing accounts from the two papers for advertising and would thank you for cheques for same.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.

In reply I beg to say that in view of your recommendations and that of the Public School Inspector the Department has decided to engage Miss Weaver temporarily. Her retention of the position will be dependent upon the success with which she meets in the work. Her salary will be at the rate of $350.00 per annum. The Department will be pleased to have Miss Weaver take up the teaching of sewing at once and also the cultivation of a garden next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a communication received today from Miss Agnes Weaver, Teacher at Stony Point requesting an advance of $10 per annum in her salary.\n\nI think Miss Weaver is doing very good work. The school is small; it is true, still it takes her time just the same as though it were large. She is pains-taking, and as she intimates, I think is quite successful in her efforts and a benefit to the Section in more than one respect. Inspector Conn thinks that she should have the advance and I have no hesitation in concurring with him in this matter.\n\nTrusting you will give it your favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

It is hoped that she will be successful in obtaining a rather better average attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. O. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Agnes Weaver, teacher in the Stone Point Indian School has informed me that she is making application for an increase in salary. I recommend that the increase be granted. In making this recommendation I am influenced by the following considerations:\n\n(1) Miss Weaver does the caretaking for the school.\n\n(2) The quality of Miss Weaver's work has improved since she took charge of the school; and there has been an increase both in the enrolment and in the average attendance.\n\n(3) Out of One Hundred and Twenty Eight teachers in the public schools of my inspectorate only two receive less than $450.00 per year.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPublic School Inspector.\nOttawa, January 18, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has granted Miss Weaver, teacher of the Stony Point School, not Kettle Point, an increase of $50.00 in her salary to date from the first of the current quarter.

The Indians tell me that they cannot get their children to go to the school. The reason they give that the teacher keeps them in one book too long. I suppose the reason is that they are not fit to promote them to another higher grade. I think Miss Weaver tries hard to make them learn. I do think that if the teachers would give up some of the foolishness that they have, such as drawing pictures of birds, flowers, houses and not bother so much with gardens which are there nothing gained on work out off and make the children do more of reading writing and figures it would serve its the hole after a great deal more Miss Weaver ought to bring on her school pretty well for I have been four times their since I was appointed and three was the worst was ever there.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nTimothy Maxwell\n\nJ.D.

C. on his Inspection of the Stony Point School\nSarnia Agency, dated May 15, 1915. Original on file\n458268.\n\nStony Point School.\n\nThe school is in poor condition, it is built in the\nwoods, the play ground is grown up with shrubs, etc.\nThe teacher, Miss Weaver, is trying to have a garden\nbut I can't see how she can have success, the ground is\nnot ploughed yet. Mr. Maxwell says it is impossible to\nget the Indians to work even when he offered $2.00 for\nploughing that should only cost 75\u00a2.\n\nThere is only an average of 4 pupils attend, and\nthese arrive up to 11 A.M.\n\nI would advise that this school be closed. The\nteacher receives $450.00 per year. It costs about $150.\nmore during year. If part of this money were used to pro-\nvide a rig to drive the children to school at Kettle\nPoint and the remainder to secure a better teacher there,\nthe condition would be much better.\n\nSgd. R. H. Abraham.\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nMr. Scott -\n\nSARNIA.\n\nOn July 1st I left for Sarnia, arriving there on the second instant; spent the afternoon of that day on the Sarnia Reserve, where I found things generally in very good condition. The prospects for good crops are excellent. My mission here was to look into the question of the amalgamation of the Kettle Point and Stony Point Schools. On Saturday the Agent and I visited these two reserves. I do not consider the suggestion that was made to amalgamate these two schools practicable, for two reasons; first, that they are far apart, the distance being over five miles, and, secondly, there is not proper accommodation now at the Kettle Point School for the children enrolled. Even if a new school were being built at Kettle Point, and\nif it were erected on the same location as the present one, the distance would almost preclude driving the children from Stony Point. There are about ten children of school age at Stony Point, but the attendance has not been what it should. It may be that this is due partly to the fact that Miss Weaver does not appear to have the full confidence of the parents, which may be partly owing to antagonism on the part of Mrs. McKinnon, a former Indian teacher, who would like to be re-instated in this school, and who, you will remember, was dismissed sometime ago for bad conduct. The Public School Inspector, Mr. Conn, whom I interviewed, speaks very well of Miss Weaver.\n\nI would recommend that the school be continued temporarily under Miss Weaver and that the Agent be instructed to inform the parents that they must send their children regularly to school, or, otherwise, resort will have to be had to the regulations, which provide for committal to industrial schools under such circumstances.\n\nI am of opinion that such a notice will have a salutary effect.\n\nA.F. [Signature]\nOttawa, August 4, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nAs a result of the inquiries made by Mr. MacKenzie of this Department into the suggested amalgamation of the Kettle Point and Stony Point Schools I beg to say that the Department does not consider that this would be practicable owing to the distance and want of suitable school accommodation. It has, therefore, been decided to continue both these schools and the services of the present teachers will be retained for the present.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to inform the parents that they must send their children regularly to school or otherwise the Department will have to resort to the enforcement of the Regulations, which provide for the commitment to industrial schools of children who fail to take advantage of the day schools in their vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss A. A. Weaver,\nTeacher,\nStoney Point Day School,\nR.R. No. 3,\nThedford, Ont.\nAs the holidays are drawing near, I thought you would like to hear something about school and how we are getting on. We have had a great deal of sickness. The school has been closed twice since Christmas. Influenza epidemic and measles have been prevalent. The result was that Reserve Member Johnston who helped us and who received first-class prize in his second grade at the school this year died last June and could not get any other class to take it up. This year he had to abandon it, was so sorry but could not help it, but hope to take it up again.\nWe have our school garden\nof beans, potatoes, beans, corn,\ntomatoes, herbs, lettuce and\ndifferent kinds of flower seeds.\nThey are all growing nicely\naltho' it seems to rain every\nother day. The attendance is good\nto bad, although they are out at school\nuntil half past nine and some\ntimes after that, some are not\nwell enough to yet be come.\nPlease excuse this long\nletter with kind regards.\n\nYours\nA.A. Weaver\nHedford RR#8\nMr. D.M. McLean\nPost-Sec. Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of June 16th received, and was addressed\nthat you were not notified by Mr. Maxwell in his monthly\nreport. The School was closed\nby order of Dr. Patterson and\nMr. Maxwell on account\nof the increase in the number\nand opened at June 25th\ndissapointed and sorry to find\nInspector Green visiting the\noffice while home on business,\nbut he was not in\nmeeting this will\nbe satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.A. Weaver\nRedford RR #8\nOttawa, June 15, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of the Department, in a recent report on the Stoney Point school, states that the teacher informed him that the children come late almost every morning and that you gave them permission to come 20 minutes late.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether you gave the children permission to come late and, if so, kindly state your reasons for doing so.\n\nMr. Abraham also states that the teacher should be provided with a set of the Ontario School Manuals. A set of these manuals is being ordered from the Government Stationery Office for the teacher of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nT. Maxwell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nIn replying to your of the above date with regards to the statement of Mr. Abraham it would not have hurt him to have told me what the teacher said regarding the children coming late to school. I have been up to the school several times all the way from Carnia and the children was not all there sometimes it would be ten o'clock and every time I would tell them that they must come on time or go back home again or get a thrashing that is what I told them and I told them also that if they did not come regular that their parents would be the ones would have to pay for it and I also told the parents at a meeting called for that purpose and as regarding the fifteen minutes I told the children that any one that was fifteen minutes late would be sent back home hoping that this will throw some light on the subject for I know the school has been spent fifteen years school trustees both in Carnia and on the farm.\n\nRemain your obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McKinnon, who was Miss Weaver's predecessor, as teacher in this school, at a salary of $550.00 per annum, and on referring the matter to Mr. Conn, public school Inspector, for this district, he would not recommend engaging Mrs. McKinnon.\n\nI might further add that I have had an interview with Miss Agnes Weaver and she states that she will be able to get a convenient boarding house in the Spring, by the first of April, 1920. As teachers are very scarce and difficult to obtain, especially to teach Indian Schools and as there are only about eleven or thirteen pupils on the register of this school, and the average attendance not very high it might be just as well to close this school, for the next three months, and re-engage Miss Weaver duties to commence the first of April, 1920.\n\nAwaiting your reply for further instructions,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

She is at present receiving $550.00 per annum, with bonus additional at the rate of $150.00, a total amount of $700.00.\n\nMiss Weaver has been teaching ten years at this school. She has no professional qualifications. The Public School Inspector states that she is making good success in her work. The general management of the school is good and the children are making fairly good progress. Agriculture (gardening) is being taught with good results; sewing and knitting were receiving proper attention.\n\nThe attendance at this school is not large. The teacher states that all of school age are enrolled and are in attendance. The enrolment is 11 pupils; the average attendance for last year was 5. The teachers in the other two schools in the vicinity, namely, Kettle Point and St. Clair, receive salaries of $650.00 and $600.00. The enrolment at both these schools, however, is much larger, being 31 at Kettle Point and 36 at St. Clair. The salaries at all these schools are paid from band funds.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Weaver, in view of her long service and the report of the Inspector as to the success in her work, receive an increase of $50.00, which would make her salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, and that such increase date from the 1st instant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I had to whip three pupils for running their fathers telling me to do so. But the mother of one pupil came to the school and told me before the child was sent to whip him, as he came to the school to learn and not to be punished.\n\nOur Inspector Mr. Conner tells me there is no law for one to whip the father of the child in a white man. If there is any child of school age coming soon, there is an other thing I would like to mention that is the well, we have not had any water for drinking since Sept. and the school has not been cleaned since closing in June. I wrote to the council about it but nothing has...\nbeen done. The Agent Mr. Paul had done all he could to get the Indians or white men to draw water but all claimed to be busy ploughing and do not want to take the horses off of the land. Yesterday I received a letter or note from the Councilman Robert George telling me he would put a third of water in the school and that will have to do till the rain comes. I do not like the idea of water standing on a dirty school floor as some of the children have sore throats all the time. Forget to say the well is twenty-four feet deep and surface water please let me hear from you soon. Sorry my letter is so long. Your truly,\n\nAgnes A.

Sections 9 to 11, inclusive, comprise the school regulations.\n\nCorporal punishment should only be inflicted in the case of insubordination or flagrant breach of discipline. It is considered that only in very rare instances should it be necessary for a teacher to resort to whipping a pupil. We have no regulations regarding this matter, and rely on the discretion of the teacher.\n\nRegarding the water supply, I beg to say that we took this matter up with Mr. Agent Paul. We are today in receipt of a communication from him, in which he states the well is still in good repair but lacks water. He informs us that he has made arrangements to have a supply of water placed in the well, and when this is done the difficulty will be overcome. It is hoped that the agent has attended to this matter and that there will now be water available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Agnes A.

You may inform Miss Weaver accordingly. We will be unable, however, to allow her salary or bonus for the period she does not teach.

Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAt the request of several members of the Kettle and Stony Point Band of Indians, I have ventured to write you concerning the appointment of Mrs Robert McKinnon as teacher of Stony Point school.\n\nThe people here think that Mrs McKinnon ought not to have been given the school again, as she was once discharged from there on account of misconduct and drunkenness carried on during school hours. There surely must be some record of it at the Department.\n\nAgain, later on she applied for, and was appointed substitute teacher, during the illness of the teacher at Kettle Point school, and when she was again discharged as being undesirable.\n\nWe therefore request that she be asked for her resignation at once, as she is no better qualified to teach now than when she was formerly discharged.\n\nIf it is impossible to get another\nTeacher for Sligo Point school, the people here concerned, would rather see the school closed, than to have Mrs. McKinnon as teacher for their children.\n\nTrusting that you will give this communication due consideration,\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nElmo Bressette,\nSurveyor-Officer for\nKettle & Sligo Point schools.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the appointment of Mrs. Robt. McKinnon as teacher of the Stony Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when the former teacher, Miss Weaver, resigned on account of ill health, Mr. Agent Paul was requested to obtain the services of another teacher. He received three applicants for the position, none of whom had any professional qualifications. As it was impossible at the time to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher, and as we did not desire that the school should remain closed, the application of Mrs. Robt. McKinnon for the position was accepted. We were informed that the Inspector stated that Mrs. McKinnon was quite able to teach this school.\n\nTaking into consideration the difficulty in obtaining a teacher at the present time, it is considered that Mrs. McKinnon's services will be satisfactory for the balance of the present school year, and we hope that the Indians will see that their children attend school regularly.\n\nIf possible, the services of a qualified teacher will be secured for this school at the beginning of the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Dan Bressette,\na.R. #1, Forest,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Dan Brossette, truant officer for the Stony and Kettle Point Indian Day Schools, protesting against the appointment of Mrs. Robt. McKinnon as teacher of the first named school.\n\nIn your letter of March 21st, last, you forwarded three applications. A term at high school was the only qualifications that two of the applicants had. You stated regarding Mrs. McKinnon's application that Inspector Conn was of the opinion that she was quite able to teach this school. We would prefer it, if at all possible, to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school at the beginning of the next school year, on or about September 1, 1923, but Mrs. McKinnon may continue as teacher for the balance of the present school year, or to June 30th, next. You should inform her that her services will not be required after that date. We will expect to receive definite word from you that you have notified her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nStoney Point\nMay 2nd 1923\n\nSir,\n\nWe the undersigned (members, parents, and guardians of the children who are attending the Stoney Point Indian Day School,) understand that action has been taken by some of the members of this band to put out Mr. Robert M. Simon, the teacher of the above mentioned school.\n\nNow this school is well attended, and the children are learning much faster than they did with the former teacher, especially the new beginners. They do not understand in English, she explains it to them in their own language, thereby making them learn easier and faster.\n\nBy putting her out of this work would be doing injustice to our children because a more suitable teacher cannot be found for this school.\n\nKindly oblige us by granting us our request.\n\nRobert George, Counselor, St. Point\n\nTo the Dept. of Indian Affairs\nWilliam George\nMrs William George\nAlbert George\nMrs A. George\nMary Cloud\nMrs Lucy Cloud\nGifford Henry\nWellington Elijah\nMrs John Elijah\nMrs Ida Wild\nMrs Robert George\nMrs Joe White\nMr Joe White\nSir,\n\nEnclosed you will find petition, signed by Members, of the Stony Point Reserve, favorable to Mrs. Robert McKinnon, as Teacher, of the Stony Point Indian Day School.\n\nI believe nearly all the resident Indians, of Stony Point have signed this petition. I might further add with respect to the letter received by the Department, from Dan Bressette, requesting Mrs. McKinnon's removal, as Teacher, that Dan Bressette, is a resident of Kettle Point, living probably five miles, from Stony Point School, and that his children attend the Kettle Point School. If Mrs. McKinnon is able to satisfy the Stony Point Indians, as a Teacher, I do not think that the Kettle Point Indians, should interfere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 14, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a petition signed by a number of the members of the Stony Point Band requesting that the services of Mrs. Robt. McKinnon be retained as teacher of the Stony Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of this petition, the Department will have no objection to retaining Mrs. McKinnon as teacher, provided you and the Public School Inspector consider that her services are satisfactory. Her remaining in the position will depend upon the report received from the Public School Inspector on the occasion of his next visit. You will therefore take no further action towards dispensing with her services, as requested in official letter of April 23rd. We note that the Indians of the Band in their petition are of the opinion that their children are making progress in their studies under Mrs. McKinnon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The desks are crowded too closely together and it is necessary in some instances to seat three pupils at one double desk. The building itself is old and rather than spend any money on repairs it would be advisable to erect a new school with teacher's residence included.\n\nThe parents are taking more interest in sending their children to school and are anxious to have better accommodation.\n\nIn this connection it would be as well to give some consideration to a central school for the two reserves. From a casual survey of the situation, I think that this is a matter which Schools Branch should give careful consideration. There are never more than ten or eleven pupils at Stony Point School. This seems to be too few to warrant the expense of upkeep and teacher's salary. The Kettle Point School would be better situated if built up on the hill near the church. This would bring it much closer to Stony Point reserve and an arrangement could probably be made for transportation of pupils daily to the school and return. I mention this only as a suggestion for consideration and not as a proposition, which has been given careful thought. I do, however, strongly recommend a new school for Kettle Point reserve and that the location be changed to a more central point.\nKettle Point\n\nEnroll - 30\nAverage - 16\n33 children of school age\n7-15 yrs\n\nLong Point\n\nEnroll - 10\nAverage - 6\n12 children of school age\n7-15 yrs\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Inspector Parker and Mr. MacKenzie, both of whom have looked into school matters at Kettle Point and Stony Point, and I believe that the present building at Stony Point should be used as long as there are sufficient pupils available to warrant the activity. At Kettle Point a combined school and residence should be erected at the first opportunity, on a site near the church. The Band Capital Account shows $44,912.08. Mr. Parker informs me that they will be under heavy expense for roads, etc., during the next few years and he recommends that a Vote of Parliament be secured. I am trying to arrange to have the money provided for the building season of 1925.\n\nNovember 25, 1924.\nIn regard to the Red Cross Junior League, I say that I am very interested in their work. I have talked it over with the children explaining it to them, and they seem anxious themselves, but the parents are so queer\u2014They imagine it is a catch of some kind.\n\nI am very much interested in the children here and feel something ought to be done to combat the parents' attitude. Some restrictions, so that they might send their children to school every day. There is no efficient cause why the children should stay home.\n\nThere's a girl here by the name of Rachael Henry who wishes to go to some institution. She told me herself that she would like to go to Winnipeg, if she were admitted there. She is not a member of the band, but her parents always hold on the reserve, and some of the members say that she would not be taken in. That reason, I do not see any difference between her and one of Dan Bessette's grand sons Leonard, who is at Winnipeg now\u2014I think he has much right as the other. The girl is just past fifteen years old. The family is very poor.\n\nThe mother of the girl is sorry now that she was so headstrong a year ago when she had the chance to send her girls away to Brandon.\n\nI really would like to see the girl get into some school where she could be trained different. I believe it is impossible for you to come here and see the way things are going. I think if you were to come and talk to the parents together and have a talk with them yourself\u2014perhaps they might think different\u2014I believe have a talk with you myself regarding...\nwriting about the school.\n\nOne of the members and I requested the Indian Council here to grant us a small sum of money towards buying an organ for the school and we were refused. I noticed when I was at Halford Island they have an organ in one of the schools where Mr. Angus George is teaching, and I thought it would be nice if we had one in our school. I even offered to pay part of the instrument myself.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. P.M. McKinnon\nParliament Hill\n\nRussell T. Ferrie\nDept. of Indian Education\nActing\nCdn.\nOttawa, March 7, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, I note you are having difficulty with the parents of the pupils of the Stony Point Indian Day School regarding attendance and also in carrying out the advice which you give them regarding health, personal cleanliness, etc., as recommended in the \"Red Cross Junior\" magazine which you are receiving. You should continue your advice to the children, and it is hoped that in time the parents will see the advantage to be derived.\n\nWe will take up with Mr. Agent Paul the case of Rachael Henry who wishes to attend the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey, Ont.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible for me to visit Stony Point at the present time.\n\nIf the Band refuses to provide the amount necessary to purchase an organ for the school, it will not be possible to provide the funds required from Parliamentary Appropriation.

We will also approve of Miss Ada Scott acting as substitute teacher during the absence of Mrs. MacKinnon. Please advise Mrs. MacKinnon and Miss Scott and arrange for the latter to take over the duties when Mrs. MacKinnon goes on leave.\n\nThe return for the current quarter should show clearly the dates between which Miss Scott acts as substitute and the number of days taught by her. This information is required in order that the proper adjustment can be made when salary is being paid. Mrs. MacKinnon's salary will be continued during the three weeks she is absent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nStoney Point, March 1857\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking this opportunity in writing this letter to you this evening. I am at a loss just at present not knowing what to do next regarding the children on the reserve. I hear so many rumours going around.\n\nRobert George (our councilor for Stoney Point Reserve) lives about half a mile from the school and he will not send his children to school. It is a shame the way he is bringing these boys up. He lets every one of them chew tobacco and smoke cigarettes\u2014Even the smallest, which is five years old. I tried to stop him but it is useless. Robert gives them the stuff.\n\nI feel sorry for the boys.\n\nJohn Johnson gave me a visit about three weeks ago and I did everything to help him. And while the supper was going on\u2014I had a little fuss with Rachel Henry. The girl was so interested in a year or so ago. I did nothing to her, I only told her to quit running around with one of our boys\u2014as she is not fit for any young man to go with\u2014according to Dr. McDonald (our doctor). I guess she got offended over me chastising her and I heard her talking about me later on in the evening, calling me all kinds of names.\nI asked her what she meant by doing it, and she got very angry at me. She shrieked in my face, but I gave it back to her.\n\nNow I get all the blame, that is why Robert George will not send his boys. And I am told that Stanley Cloud is pretty busy running around getting a petition signed trying to put me out of my job. Now I wish to tell you that these Henry girls are bad girls. They are on the roads every night and they stay around Ravenswood all hours on Saturday nights. I don't think it is right that some of the Indians should uphold such girls. Besides the Henry's are not members of the band.\n\nMyrtle Henry (the girl I had so much trouble with) is a daughter of George Henry, a brother of Rachel's. He is not married to the woman he is living with. Lucy Cloud is Belle Cloud's wife of Uncle Fritz, Stanley's father. If the Indian Department would investigate circumstances, they would find a lot of queer things going on. And I do not think that they would heed to such people. I am just informing you there stories. Hoping that you would not believe what they say. They are picking at me all the time anyway. M. Paul says that.\nI work hard helping in every thing on the reserve\u2014but the Henry's never do anything only making trouble\u2014You just ought to see some of the base writing on the wall outside of our school house\u2014it is just awful\u2014It was the girls that did it.\n\nMrs. Harris.\u2014I also wish to ask you if there is any chance of a change\u2014I like to go to some other reserve if I can't go school. I think I can get along far better among strangers\u2014I am related to nearly everybody around here except the Brevoets\u2014And I think that is why they do not care for me\u2014I got to do something for my living\u2014as my husband is not doing\u2014he can do the chores but no hard work and it is up to me to earn the living for both two\u2014I am in a fix too\u2014because my home is here\u2014I am tied right down\u2014unless I sell out.\u2014And I do not like to do that.\n\nI do not wish to have the Indians know that I have written to you\u2014I am afraid they might all pile on to me\u2014I like to keep on teaching for a few more years\u2014if they would only leave me alone\u2014but it seems that they can't do that.\nAnother thing I wish to mention or inquire about. Mr. Abraham said something to me some time ago about a Summer School up at Bracebridge. I would like to know what arrangement could be made so I could attend same during summer holidays.\n\nMiss Emma Brown (my husband's niece) is willing to come and keep house for me, if I went. She is a teacher at Moray near Parkhill.\n\nWill you be kind enough to inform me about this School? I will be very much pleased if you will, as I have decided to go if I get a chance.\n\nI remain\n\nYour Truly,\n\nE. L. M. Kinmore\nRavenwood P.O.\nOnt.\n\nMr. Russell Ferries\nDept.

I am told that a number of the children are unable to go to school and that conditions are rather bad on the Reserve.\n\nI would be glad if you would kindly let me know what action is being taken in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.G. Elliott\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 25, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Elliott:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to a petition from local Indians concerning Mrs. R. McKinnon, teacher of the Stone Point Indian Bay School. I may say that this teacher is related to several residents on the reserve and has difficulty keeping out of local squabbles. The result is that certain Indians are trying to secure her dismissal.\n\nMrs. McKinnon herself, feels that the situation is so trying that she would like a transfer and the Department is keeping her wish in this respect in mind. As far as her ability as a teacher is concerned, I wish to state that the public school inspector has reported quite favourably on her work and on the progress of the pupils. The average attendance is good, a percentage of approximately 75, which is remarkably high for an Indian day school.\n\nI note that you have been told a number of the children are unable to go to school and that conditions are rather bad on the reserve. I regret that I am unable to report in this connection, as I do not know what children and what conditions are in the mind of your informant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nHonourable J. C. Elliott,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNow another thing, which took place about three days ago, was warning the boys in my school against carrying sling shots, new and again.\n\nLast Saturday, I am told Stuart Elliott used one on my ducks and killed it. This afternoon, when he came to school, I asked him if he still had the sling shot. He said no, but I made him stand up and searched his pockets and found one on him\u2014and I gave it to my ducks. I stripped him twice on the back. I told him for telling the lie I sent him to bring me some work\u2014but he only grabbed his hat\u2014and ran away from school. I suppose he will go home and tell a big story to his parents.\n\nI have no idea it is not legal for any boy to carry sling shot & any kind. The Boarders should do something\u2014they should pass a resolution to stop every boy carrying one.\n\nSome time ago, I wrote to the Indian Department about being transferred to another Indian School\u2014but still nothing to be sent some place else. If there is an opening\u2014I would like to go among Chipewa. The Indians here are all related to me and they don't seem to give a care about me. The children like them, that is why I like to go among strangers\u2014Besides I would like a bigger salary.\nnot mind staying here, if my boy was a little bigger - I could think some about yet. (I have stood a lot already.) I would try and please the Indians if I can.\n\nI am not well and cannot do any house work without help and I cannot afford to keep me because of funds - And I really cannot even up my work - because my husband is not well either. (He has heart trouble)\n\nHe can work a little but he could never support me. So I start to work whether I want to or not.\n\nI would like to get a school up north somewhere - perhaps the climate would do me good. That is, if there is a chance) and more money.\n\nRobert George, the councillor acts very mean and now he has not sent his children to school - And it was through him. (They told) that the pump at the schoolhouse was broken by men who was doing road this fall.\n\nHe will not speak to me, therefore I cannot ask him to do any thing for me.\n\nWill be placed to hear from the Department regarding my inquiries by return mail.\n\nYours\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nRavenwood P.O.\nAtlanta, Ont.\nOttawa, October 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received complaints, from time to time, regarding the services of Mrs. Robert McKinnon, teacher of the Stony Point Indian Day School. We have also received a communication from Mrs. McKinnon, informing us of difficulties she is having with the parents.\n\nIt is considered that it would be in the best interests of the work at this school if a change in teacher was made at the end of December, next. I should be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether you would advise that this change be carried out at the time mentioned. It would appear, from correspondence which the Department has on file, that Mrs. McKinnon's usefulness as teacher at this school has been outlived, in view of the fact that she is constantly experiencing difficulty with the Indian children and their parents. Your early reply, giving your opinion, is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I have to say that enquiry is being made. We have no vacancy in any of our other Indian schools, to which you could be transferred.\n\nYour remarks regarding the arrangement of the prize list for the annual school fair have been noted. This matter is being taken up with Mr. Watts, teacher of the Kettle Point School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nMrs. Robert MacInnis,\nRavenswood P.

I am arranging for the appointment of a suitable successor as from January first. At the end of the December quarter, you should prepare your return, as usual, and show thereon to what address your salary cheque should be directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

You will note that her services will not be required after the end of the calendar year.\n\nYou should immediately get in touch with Mr. Public School Inspector Gunn and ask him to nominate two or three teachers who would be satisfactory for this school. A salary of $60 per teaching month will be allowed in the case of a qualified worker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

In reply I have to inform you that, owing to the attitude of some of the Indian parents in refusing to allow their children to attend and the complaints that have been made from time to time, it was considered in the interests of the work at this school to make a change in teachers for the beginning of the next calendar year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

P. McReynolds\nPavement Rd.\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI did not intend writing any more letters to the Indian Department, so I hope you will excuse me for writing this letter to you. I just had to write it because my mind is so distracted. I was talking to Mr. Paul, Indian Agent, a few evenings ago and he told me what you had said to him about me regarding the complaints that were made against me. Now, Mr. Ferrier, this is only spite work towards me from Robert George and his sisters, Lucy Cloud. I have found out lately they are the ones that make false statements about me and they may have the chance to appear in court and prove what they say. It is nothing but jealousy and envy on their part. It is too bad that they are so mean and low-minded. They hate to see me succeed for myself.\n\nStoney Point,\nNov. 14th/27\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the urgent request of several people, I write you in my capacity of Trust Officer; I beg to send in a protest against the action taken by the Little Point councillors, at their meeting on the 16th, in regard to their extending the time, three months and perhaps more, for Miss McKinnon to end her duties at the Long Point school. According to the department's ruling she was to quit teaching at the end of December 1927, and the people who signed the petition are asking that you will adhere to your original ruling, and as give the pupils who are waiting to attend school a chance to start in, without having to wait another three months.\n\nHoping that you will give us a favorable hearing, I remain\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nTrust Officer.\nStoney Point\nMar 9th 1927.\n\nWe the undersigned members parents and guardians of the Kettle and Stoney Point Band do hereby request the Department of Indian Affairs to leave Mr. Robt.

Mrs. McKinnon has stated to me, that she intended to quit, at that time. She also stated that she would be willing to quit, on March 31st, 1928.

Freeman, Port Rowan, Ontario; Marie Sheppard, Bridgen, Ontario, and Isabel Young, 145 Collingwood St., Sarnia, Ontario. Mr. Conn states, that he has no assurance, that any of those teachers, would accept the position, of Teacher, in an Indian School, but is writing them, to see if they would accept the position.

It is considered in the best interests of the work at this school that the services of another teacher be engaged.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will continue your efforts with a view to nominating the services of a qualified teacher to begin duties when the school reopens after the coming Christmas holidays, and you should submit the name, age and experience of the teacher recommended by the public school inspector and yourself.

If so, you should let me know what remuneration this Indian would expect for this service.\n\nIf this can be done at a reasonable cost, the Department considers it would be worth trying and we can further consider the matter at the end of June next and decide whether or not the Stony Point school should be re-opened for the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nGeo. W. Down, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nForest, Ont.,\n8th November, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nWhen Mr. McQuiggen was here last week he mentioned his thought that on the resignation of Miss Anderson of the Stony Point school becoming effective the school might be amalgamated with mine. I understand that he intended to discuss the matter with you. I have thought the matter over in the interval and this letter is motivated solely by my interest in the life of the reserve.\n\nWhile I feel that a school of six or seven pupils - the more especially where the average attendance is poor - is definitely anti-social, we have had an experience on this reserve in church amalgamation which has failed dismally. I am certain that this happened because the people concerned were never approached but were given an arbitrary decision by the churches concerned. I have a feeling that the same would happen if a union of the schools were attempted without putting the matter to the parents concerned before a ruling was given by the Department. I further feel that this should not be attempted by those within the Agency but by a representative of your Department.\n\nI have lived very close to these people and know them - perhaps largely through the community work that we do in the evening - and have come to be fairly accurate in judging their reactions.\n\nIf, however, the parents (and this applies to the Stony Point people) could be shown that their children actually suffer by the continuance of the small school, I consider that the plan has infinite merit.\n\nThere is the matter of transportation. The schools are approximately four miles apart, but with the exception of perhaps an half mile from this school to the highway the entire distance is Provincial Highway and should be open throughout the year. The road on our reserve is seldom blocked. It would mean one of two things as I see it, either the teacher or some responsible person\nwould have to be in charge of the transportation. If attendance has been a problem at Stoney Point, and I understand that the average attendance is low, I am inclined to doubt the wisdom of allotting the transportation to an Indian. I feel that the teacher would probably be the best person unless a farmer in the vicinity could be secured. I am doubtful of this because it would mean two breeds in his district all times of the year and he would have to be given the authority of a truant officer. Either the teacher might use his or her own car on a mileage basis, or the department might prefer to purchase a car for this purpose. This latter would necessitate the building of a garage here.\n\nThe saving should be of sufficient amount to make the idea appealing to the Department. The transportation should be really the only expense as compared to the maintenance of the school at present.\n\nWith certain small adjustments this school is capable of taking on as many as ten extra pupils I should say.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you feel the school should be maintained I would like to mention another matter. I have felt that the teachers of these two schools might conveniently share the residence here. The distance is comparatively small and the expense would be less than boarding I think. This would allow of combined and concerted work on the part of the two workers. If I am to remain here this arrangement would be quite satisfactory to me, although I would like someone who is used to -- shall I say the amenities of life.\n\nI hope that you will pardon my intrusion into this matter, but as I have said, I feel that it concerns a work in which I have a deep interest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Nov. 5th, and would report that I discussed this matter at the last Council meeting, and both Reserves strongly opposed the closing of this school. They give no definite reason as to why.\n\nHowever, as per instructions I have approached several Indians as to the cost of this service, and the lowest decision reached was $3.50 per day. This price seems out of all reason for a travelled distance of 24 miles, but if the Department sees fit to go ahead with the closing of this school, I will proceed further.\n\nI would also suggest that whoever is given the position of transporting these children, be also appointed truant officer for Stony Point Reserve only. This would give him some authority to pick up these children and take them to the Kettle Point School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nT. R. L.

However, he may improve and I hope to have a better report in February. The Stony Point teacher is very conscientious, clean and making every effort. I think he got into some little trouble in correcting one of the girls at the start, but after making enquiries I do not think it was very serious, and was able to get the child back to school.\n\nThere has been a little more sickness this month with colds and such terrible roads, it has kept the attendance down some.\n\nGeo.

You will remember in my report for the month of February I said I was disappointed. I am still a little disappointed with Kettle & Stony Point schools. I do not attribute this entirely to the teachers although I think sometimes they get a little discouraged. The percentage of children with any inclination to learn is small. The others show an utter disregard. I had a long talk with Mr. Howard, the teacher of Kettle Point School, and he tells me he has been taking a mental I.Q. of the Indians at Kettle Point School and he finds they have an average of sixty. Whether or not this is an excuse, I am not prepared to say. I am of the opinion that more effort should be made to memorize their work. It is appalling! You go over a lesson thoroughly\u2014you ask the class a question\u2014give them the answer\u2014review the lesson in the next five minutes and they can't answer.\n\nKettle Point was the dumpy school for the month of February. Stony Point showed some signs of improvement although I think they had concentrated on Lambton Country the whole month. But even at that if progress can be made we are at least accomplishing a little. The children at St. Clair are so much more advanced and have a good knowledge of their lessons. With the exception of two or three, any question is readily answered although I am told the Provincial Inspector's report on St. Clair School is not very good. I am inclined to think there is a little vindictiveness in his reports. He and Mr. Smith have claimed on occasions I thought of asking Mr. Howard and Mr. Tompkins to outline their lessons in the form of stories. It may help them to memorize, and instead of attempting a general knowledge, to concentrate on one subject until they have learned it thoroughly. What think you? Or would it interfere with the school curriculum as laid down by the Provincial? Reading and arithmetic can be clasped about the same\u2014St. Clair quite good, Kettle & Stony Point fair to bad. The writing in all schools is exceptional. There are some beautiful writers. This only tends to strengthen my opinion on manual and vocational training. They see something through the eye and catch on quickly. Writing, painting, drawing, whittling with a jack knife or similar tools of any kind are some of the things they love to do; but give them a mathematical or geographical lesson and they are not interested. Compared with February, I would say there is a little improvement.\n\nX X X\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nSarnia, Ontario.\nMay 6, 1941.\n\nPERSONAL REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAll schools in the Agency have been visited and continuing my reports on the monthly tests. I am happy to report decided improvement.\n\nSt. Clair school on the Sarnia Reserve with Mr. Robert Smith as teacher has been outstanding. Since the start of these tests the children have responded wonderfully, even the very lowest grades showed a marked improvement. Their ready answers to almost every question asked is amazing when one realizes that only a few months ago they would stumble over the simplest question.\n\nKettle Point School with Mr. Howard as teacher has also shown improvement. At this school I was particularly impressed with the subject of \"silent reading\". The subject of course, is not new but it is the first time I had heard it in an Indian School. I am enclosing a sample paper on the work. The answers given by the children were 80 to 100% correct. The higher grades also showed improvement, especially in geography. Mr. Howard informs me he notices the children coming from homes where they have radios are better informed. They often ask about particular countries they have heard mentioned and to have them pointed out on the map. Arithmetic at this school showed good improvement.\n\nStanley Point School with Mr. Tompkins as teacher is lagging behind. I would not say this is the fault of the teacher, but rather a lack of cooperation. A school of this type with its small number on the roll and an average attendance of 50% is most difficult and I am sure Mr. Tompkins is, at times, discouraged and feels his efforts are not appreciated.\n\nI have again discussed the question of monthly tests with the teachers in an endeavour to discover the reaction of the children, also the parents. They all agree that the children are very interested and express the wish that it had been started before. Mr. Smith asked one little fellow why he was talking to himself. He said, \"I want to tell the Mr. Agent that\".\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nExtract from Inspector Edwards' report on the Stoney Point Indian Day School visited on May 27, 1941.\n\nAttendance is still very irregular, only 55 per cent of perfect for the past year. Only three of the eight children enrolled were present the day of my visit. There is a family some distance in the woods, with four children who should be attending. The trail to their home is not bad. The teacher is well educated and widely read. He understands good methods of teaching, and is careful to present his work in a manner intelligible to the children. The three children read and write well and express their thoughts clearly, both orally and in writing. They cooperate nicely with their teacher.\nOttawa,\nJuly 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your personal report for the month of April, 1941, you referred to the very small average attendance at the Stoney Point Indian Day School. Inspector Edwards, in a report dated May 27, also mentions the same matter. He refers particularly to a family residing near the school in which there are four children who are not attending regularly.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would hold a meeting of the Indians in the near future and discuss the whole educational situation with them. In view of present conditions it is extremely difficult for us to justify the continuance of a school at this point when the parents apparently show so little interest in the education of their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nPERSONAL REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAll schools have been visited and with the closing for the summer holidays, I think, perhaps, a short report on the term progress and management would be appropriate. The pupils and teachers together with myself have found our monthly lessons and tests of some benefit. Whether or not the benefits will be carried through the vacation period is another question. Three months is a long time for any child to be out of school and almost a calamity for an Indian. However, we can only hope to pick up from where we left off.\n\nStony Point with Mr. Harry Tompkins as teacher is almost a failure. Little or no interest in anything. I have found Mr. Tompkins with sometimes two pupils and very rarely more than five or six. He is a very conscientious man but very discouraged and I find nothing of interest to report. It is just an Indian school.\n\nGeo. W. Down\nIndian Agent.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nJuly 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 29-3-1.\n\nAcknowledging your letter of July 4, 1941 re Stony Point School attendance, enclosed is a copy of a letter sent out to the parents of children who should be attending this school.\n\nA full report of this meeting will be submitted in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

It is necessary that we should arrive at some understanding as far as the attendance at this school is concerned.\n\nYou will, of course, realize with present world conditions and the pressing need of strict economy, the Department of Indian Affairs can not be expected nor are they justified in continuing the Stony Point School unless a better attendance is assured with more interest in the education of your children.\n\nPlease make it convenient to be present at this meeting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGEO. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nGWD:GF\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to your letter of July 4, 1941, re attendance at the Stony Point Indian Day School. A meeting was held in the school house on August 1 with the parents of the children of school age being well represented. After a lengthy discussion and listening to a number of petty grievances as to why the children were not attending school, I presented the views of the Department in an endeavour to impress upon them that the responsibility was theirs and if the school had to be closed it would be because of their own lack of interest in the education of their children.\n\nBefore the meeting closed there was a general promise given that the children would attend school. One thing was very noticeable\u2014they did not want the school closed. Here, again, I pointed out it was their responsibility and theirs alone should the school, through non-attendance, have to be closed.\n\nWe can now only await developments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

It is hoped that as a result of your efforts the attendance at this school will be sufficiently large during the coming academic year to justify its continuance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. George W.

However, the Department will allow you salary to the end of June, 1942. It is likely that the present Stony Point School will be moved to the Kettle Point Reserve to be used for other purposes than a school and consequently you may not be able to keep the school in operation until June 30. However, you should keep it open until it is finally decided to move it and, in any event, the Department will allow you salary to June 30.\n\nYour services as teacher will terminate on that date. At the present time we are not aware of any other vacancy to which you could be appointed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harry Tompkins,\nThedford, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1942.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter which is being forwarded today to the teacher of the Stony Point School. I understand that it is the intention to move the building used as a school at Stony Point to the Kettle Point Reserve where it will be remodelled for a home for an Indian family. When the building is moved you should, of course, arrange for storing the desks and other equipment in some suitable place on the Kettle Point Reserve. I understand from Mr. Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, that there will be no expense to this Branch in moving this equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nMay 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting matters of interest and activities at the Sarnia Agency during the month of April, 1942, I would advise as follows:\n\nAttendance at The St. Clair and Kettle Point Indian Day Schools was satisfactory. At the Stony Point School little or no progress was discernible and the attendance was low. This appeared to be caused by a lack of cooperation between the teacher and the parents. No action which an Agent might take could improve the situation existing at the Stony Point School.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSarnia, Ontario,\nJune 3rd, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 29-3-1 of May 21st, 1942, in connection with the moving of the Stony Point School to Kettle Point to provide a dwelling for one of the Indian families from Stony Point.\n\nRecently I was told by some of the Indians that this school was built about fifty years ago by the Indians who supplied the lumber themselves and also performed the labour. The Department apparently did not expend any appropriated funds in the original erection of this building. The Indians therefore, that this building is Band property in spite of the fact that the Department has spent a considerable sum in upkeep and repairs during the past several years.\n\nMrs. Joseph White of the Kettle Point Band is expecting us to move the school for her future use as a house. This Indian woman is at present occupying a brick house which cannot be moved and which has to be pulled down most immediately. Unless otherwise advised, I intend to have the school moved and remodelled to provide a house for Mrs. White. In view of the fact that the Band claim ownership, should consent from the Band be secured before the school is moved. If so, kindly advise. Also advise if the Band is entitled to compensation for what they consider is their property.\n\nThere are numerous other problems relating to the school such as the transportation to Kettle of the wood which is on hand at Stone School. I am endeavouring to locate storage space for the school equipment but this is also a problem. I expect that I shall have to engage a team or truck to move the wood and school desks. A voucher in payment will have to be submitted to the Department when this work has been completed.\nI thought I should mention now the matter of accommodation for pupils at Kettle next Fall. The children who are moving from Stony to Kettle will probably overtax the present school at Kettle Point and result in a serious problem of adequate accommodation in future. It is also possible that the present teacher, Mr. Howard, who has a large attendance already, will refuse to teach so many additional children. It is expected that accommodation for approximately fifteen extra children will be required at the Kettle Point school next October. At this time it would be next to impossible to obtain building materials if an addition to the Kettle Point school became necessary on account of increased attendance.\n\nIn view of the above it might perhaps be wise to consider all angles before the present Stony school is definitely abandoned. In the event that the Department decides to retain this building for use as a school at Kettle other arrangements would have to be made for a house for Mrs. White and I should be immediately advised providing such action is contemplated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I may say that the total amount received from the sale of the Stony Point Reserve to the Department of National Defence is being placed to the credit of the Stony Point Band. This amount includes, of course, an allowance for the school building.\n\nIt is noted that you are arranging to move the school and remodel it in order to provide a house for Mrs. White.\n\nIt is not our intention to enlarge the Kettle Point School at the present time as we have no funds for the purpose. If the teacher is not prepared to handle the additional number of pupils who will attend, you should obtain his resignation from him and forward it to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSarnia, Ontario,\nJune 11, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting matters of interest and activities at the Sarnia Agency during the month of May, 1942, I would advise as follows:\n\nThe school attendance was fairly good throughout May. Some garden tools and a lawn mower were purchased to enable the teacher and pupils to properly care for the grounds at the St. Clair Indian Day School. Vocational training equipment was also supplied. The School at Stony Point is to be abandoned and the building moved to Kettle Point to provide a dwelling for one of the families.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSarnia, Ont., July 2, 1942.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF JUNE.\n\nSchools were in operation throughout the month. Attendance at the St Clair school on the Sarnia Reserve was excellent. A very low attendance resulted at both the Stony and Kettle Point schools. This irregular attendance will be a very difficult problem to rectify as the parents offer very little co-operation. The Stony Point school will not be in operation next fall and its equipment has been moved to Kettle Point and stored in the school there.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nORT ON SARMA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH AUGUST, 1944.\n\nsecured two qualified teachers for Kettle Point.

The Department would like this matter attended to without delay.\n\nThe Inspector also reports that a roof and window closets are required. The Department would like a report from you as soon as possible in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of July 29th,\n\nI have carefully looked over the blue print and made a bill of materials in accord with the plans viz., studding, sills, rafters etc. and I can get an Indian quite capable of doing the work but I would have to buy the materials and pay him by the day. I can get the lumber cheap for the time and place at $1.50 per ft. So the whole job as nearly as I can estimate in advance would cost about $2000. To wit $1250 for lumber and hardware (nails and hinges etc.) and $750 for teaming and labor. I think if everything goes right it will be done for less but not very much so that may safely be accepted as approximate.\n\nWith regard to the water supply, I cannot report as satisfactorily as I would like. The school house at Stony Point is about two miles from the lake (Lake Huron) and the steep descent in the level of the country is between. The soil there is clay and there does not seem any certainty or even a good chance of getting a good supply by digging. The Indians when asked about the water can give no information. Most of them have just surface wells, do them fairly well for a small supply. They give all kind of answer when asked how far it is to the rock vary from 15 feet to 60 and said some neighbor there had bored to the rock and got salt water. Still I think if anything is done to is what to do - as in all this section of country boring to the rock furnishes a plentiful supply of hygienically wholesome water and is the only permanent source of supply. Well water are easily got - and should not for that depth cost over $5?\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nCasing and a pump would cost about $25 to move. To dig a surface well about 15 or 20 feet deep four feet in diameter and thickened up would cost $25. In the meantime they carry water from Mr. Johnston's and the attendance is very small so that though inconvenient during the warm weather the labor is not burdensome. I will make more inquiries about well-borers and the tests in that vicinity and advise you. I have arranged to have the school house scrubbed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Hallett\nOttawa, August 9, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st inst., and in reply I beg to say that you are authorized to have a closet built for the boys at the Stony Point school, at a cost in the neighborhood of $20.00.\n\nWith reference to a water supply, the Department agrees with you that the best plan would be to bore a well, and you will be good enough to obtain prices for this work, including the casing and pump, when you will be further advised.\n\nNo mention is made in your letter of the banking of the foundation. This should be attended to in good time, and you should also obtain prices for a porch and wood-shed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of July 19th\n\nNo. 153980-5\n\nIn further reference to the matter of a well at Story Point School I am afraid that there is no use of putting down a bored well just there, as the water appears to be impregnated with mineral matter so as to make it unfit for use. But I have an offer to dig a well - 20 feet deep and brick it up for \u00a3120, we'll furnish the brick which will cost \u00a3120 more. This will furnish a sufficient supply of water for the school. The pump will be additional with the flint. I would mention that the future of the Story Point School is a little uncertain although I do not anticipate that it will need to be closed again yet the attendance is very small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Hubert\nOttawa, 17th August, 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the water supply for the Stony Point School, and in reply beg to say that as you state the water would most likely be impregnated with mineral matter if a well were bored, the Department has decided to let the matter rest for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Oct. 12th, 1914.\n\nMemo for Mrs. Stony Point School.\n\nIn letter of Oct. 9th, No. 2579, Mr. Agent Michel reports that the new closet at this school has been completed and there are now two separate closets.\nExtract from Mr. Inspector Conn's report on the Stony Point school. Original on File 153980/6.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to keep the school in operation I would advise that the building be put on a cement foundation this summer and that a small lean-to wood-shed be put up at the back of the school building. There would then be less justification for irregular attendance during the winter months.\nOttawa, May 11, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Conn, Public School Inspector, in his report on the Stony Point school, recommends that a cement foundation should be placed under the building and a lean-to woodshed erected at the back.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you on this matter with an estimate of the cost of carrying out the suggestion, if considered advisable to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 11th\n\nNo. 153980/5\n\nI have made an estimate of the cost of a cement or concrete foundation for the Stony Point school. I may say first that this will be necessary in a year or two at the latest. It will do all right this year but it is standing on wooden block which have been in for over ten years. I believe ever since that school was built and they cannot last much longer. An concrete idea is that it would make the school more comfortable besides being permanent.\n\nI submitted the matter to the Butteridge Co. here. Being at Stony Point it is out of their reach for contracting but the manager was kind enough to go into all the details with me and gave me his prices for everything. For 1\u00bd feet under ground and 32 inches of cement blocks which is the most common and modern above ground, his estimate is $85.00. This allows for a wall 1 foot wide below the surface of good concrete pounded in the usual way and cement blocks - 4 rows. Blocks $8.75\n\nThis estimate I think is high. Sand and gravel is handy there and by bringing the under wall a little higher and allowing for joint 8 rows of blocks would do as well as four. This we easily make it 36 inches high which would be all right.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI also consulted a cement worker who has had a good deal of experience though not now in the business - and like me he thinks the Butteridge Co.'s estimate is high. I think by making the alteration I suggest I can strike off ten dollars. Also I do not know of any body in that neighborhood who makes cement blocks.\n\nIf cement blocks are not used - it will take ten cubic yards of concrete which should be put in there for $6.75 per cubic yard.\n\nI like the block plan best myself and if they can be got handy they are not any dearer than last estimate & allows for the same height about 30 or 32 inches above ground.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\nWilliam Hallett\nIndian agent\n\nP.S. For a lean to wood shop I estimate $410.00\n\nW. N.\nOttawa, June 21, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in which you state that you have received an offer from Mr. F. Gutteridge to place a cement foundation under the Stony Point school-house for the sum \u00a345.00, the portion below the surface to be 1\u00bd' deep by 1' wide of good concrete and that above the surface of the ground 32\" in height to be of cement blocks 8\" by 16\".\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if this work is completed in a satisfactory manner the Department considers the price reasonable and you are hereby authorized to have it done during the approaching summer holidays. You may also have a lean-to woodshed erected at a cost of \u00a340.00.

D. Item 13. End of accounts for the foundation placed under the Story Point School as tendered.\n\nTime bill for labor raising ashlar, excavating, driving material and putting 1/2 ft good concrete to surface of wall in chimney $40.99\nWilliam Ironside - Sheldrake cement - 5 barrels $9.25\nFred Page and son - providing and laying 200 cement blocks $24.00\nJames Williamson - brought cement forward $1.25\nTotal $75.49\n\nAs far as I know this is the whole. There might be a few cents for a mortar board, but as the lumber will be used in putting up the wood shed it will not be charged to the foundation. This is inside the estimated cost but owing to the difficulty in raising up and supporting the old house as well as the great height it would make it preferable to the width of the building what is 14 feet. Also we have 3 rows of blocks instead of four as was contemplated. There is enough money in the appropriation to have done it 5 & 6 blocks being required for a sound, but there is no doubt it is plenty high enough now. Up the floor is almost 3 feet including all of building from the normal level of the ground. There was no provision for door stops but they are put in and are included in the Page account. The frame work being made of cement blocks. I have not yet seen the job since it was finished, but I have personally purchased the cement and made the bargain with Mr. Page and looked over the raising up of the building and profiting it off and was there when the men put in the concrete under the surface and made the trenches & put it in. I do not think if I had let it would have been done at all unless by contracting which I was not to do as Butteridge in Sarnia wanted freight paid and transportation and drayage from Sheldrake and thus was no contractor in the business who at Story Point which is over\nthirty miles from Sarnia. Mr. Pugsley is reasonable being 12 cents each for blocks including the mason work & providing cement for the mortar. John Elijah when he has any body to buy the material and tell him in detail what it is a good assistant and I am satisfied that the work will be durable and satisfactory.\n\nUntil the foundation was in it was impossible to erect the lean-to wood-shed but I have arranged to have this done now. Hoping this is all satisfactory.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Hallett\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nOct. 5\n[Signature]\nD.R.C.S.L.A.\n\n[Handwritten note]\nChas.

As soon as this is received the matter will be dealt with.\n\nThe Inspector also reports that the platform at the front of the school has not been completed. You will be good enough to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam Nibbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGarnie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter 153980/5-Dece711\n\nI beg leave to say that Mr. J. Pearson, furniture dealer at Sarnia, has a plain oak cupboard which I think suitable for Stony Point school. It measures about 4 ft high by 4 ft wide, three shelves and can be booked\u2014which he will deliver at the station at Guelph or Shedden for $5.50. It has a little back on top but is quite plain\u2014and oiled.\n\nThere will be carriage from the station to the school besides\u2014perhaps a dollar. Possibly we could with regard to the platform. It was not finished when Mr. Cowan was there but arrangement had been made and it was all fixed up November 29th last. The accounts have passed Council and are now sent to Department and I expect the cheques back every day. I have not seen the work myself yet but was informed that it is satisfactory in every respect, being good concrete steps\u2014the sides being made with concrete block matching the foundation\u2014I reported myself that the steps were unfinished and dangerous although they were temporarily joined up using part of the old steps but I knew as soon as I saw them it would not do to leave them like that but I understand they are all right now. The cupboard referred to was made in Ottawa but seems to be more suitable than anything I see round here.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nWilliam Innes\nIndian Agent\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, December 20, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter I beg to say that you may purchase the cupboard referred to therein for the Stony Point school at the price mentioned and see that it is delivered before the re-opening of the school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam Nisbet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNarwin, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of 16th inst., I beg to say that as nearly as I can gather the cost will be as follows:\n\n54 Rolls of 7 line wires @ 48\u00a2 per roll = $26.16\n500 ft. of 10 gauge wire @ 3\u00a2 per foot = $15.00\n25 Good Cedar Posts @ 15\u00a2 each = $3.75\nCleaning wire from 70 feet of hay = $2.50\n\nPutting up fence about 100 feet long = $10.00\nClearing off Christmas tree limbs = $10.00\n\nTotal = $47.95\n\nI inquire when at closest the price of about wire fencing is quoted at 7\u00a2 per roll. If so, MacKenzie, Valcourt & Co. will deliver at closest price 25\u00a2 per roll. Of course, this is the place to buy. But the Indians are most anxious that the work should be done at once. So it may be that some arrangement can be made with MacKenzie Co. for the improvement of the highway. I could go up and direct work all together. You will please say what you think about a lot of fence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR. B. Palmer\nAgent.\n\nP.S. Mr. Leam 827\nAct.

Jacobs,\nSec.\nOttawa, September 28, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the minute of the Council of the Sarnia Band in which they ask that a well be dug at the Stony Point School I beg to say that this matter was given consideration a couple of years ago and it was then thought that if a well were bored the water would likely be impregnated with mineral matter and it was decided to do nothing for a time. Would like to have your opinion as to the advisability of sinking a well either by digging or boring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI was at Cattle Point on Monday. Mr. Jacobs went there with me. We visited the schoolhouse and saw the work being done. The well is dug and filled, and work is being commenced on the concrete house at once.\n\nAt Stone Point I found the ground nicely cleared, but nothing done toward leveling them or getting up the fence. The ground is too hard to plant potatoes and level the road. I told them not to undertake that work at present. I am enclosing account of work done for your thanks.\n\nJ. D.

While at Stone Point last week, I inquired of Elijah as to who would complete a well for $150 per foot? He said there was a man near by who dug & bricked up wells at that price, but when I reminded him that he provided for the whole, including brick for $150 per foot, he said he would digging & brick up. He replied as C. does, it takes nearly 3/4 of a thousand bricks for each foot of a lift well, and they think it will be necessary to put a well down about 20 ft. This being the case, he brick cost $100 per thousand. The well completed with a pump will cost well on to $50, but it seems necessary as they now go half a mile for water, which cannot be very good when it reaches the school.

They should be for such an expenditure of course. The well, I think, is going to prove all right. When I was there on the 16th inst., gathering up these accounts and looking about the place I found there was about 4 feet of water in the well and when pumped it looked clear and pure so this of course is very satisfactory. John Elijah, the Chief of Stoney Point had charge of the work; employed men and worked himself and claims that there was no waste of time or material in connection with the job.

There is no vault in one. John Elijah says one has to be moved about ten feet. I will put screens in front of both closets; ventilators in both closets; vault in one closet; springs on both doors; one window in one closet; move the one closet to its proper place and finish work that was never done on one closet; ridge boards on school house. I will complete all work that needs to be done in order to put them in sanitary condition, find all lumber and hardware for twenty dollars ($20.00). John Elijah said the door in the school should be made open out instead of in. If you want it changed it will be $1.00 extra.\n\n(Sgd.) S. M. Watson.\n\nThe price asked looks a little high to me but there does not seem to be any parties in the locality prepared to undertake the work excepting this man Watson. I am of the opinion that nothing would suffer very materially during the cold weather and perhaps the work could be done to better advantage in the Spring when evidently other work will be required.\n\nHowever, you will kindly instruct me with reference to this particular work and I will carry out your instructions as best I can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR. C. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy & Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the repairs to the closets, etc., in connection with the Stony Point School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it would appear desirable to have this work attended to as soon as possible and not leave it, as suggested by you, till spring. You will be good enough, therefore, to have it done, the price not to exceed the sum mentioned by you, $20.00. The account should show in detail the nature of all the work performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReceiving the Yours of 28th July 1911, and enclosing herewith a small account which Mr. Kelly piece has been very slow in rendering, and will thank you to have cheque for the $100 in his favor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. R. W. Leau Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nOttawa.\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, 17th June, 1912.\n\nSir,-\n\nI return herewith the account rendered at $1.00, which you forwarded in favor of \"The Forest Free Press\" for advertising for a teacher for an Indian school. It will be necessary for you to attach thereto a clipping of the advertisement charged for, as it is required for the King's Printer, to whom the account must be sent for taxation previous to payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. C. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 22nd November 1911, I find the improvements authorized have been attended to. This long delay grew out of the fact that Mr. Watson of Sherbrooke was to do the work removed by Mr. Stone, who came on when it was inconvenient to do such work, especially in a place like Stone Town. When we this spring visited Stone Town we met Mr. Watson with the understanding he would attend to the matter but he too failed. So on the 15th I found also that the school lot was overgrown with weeds, grass & shrubs about the stumps of the trees which were cut away last summer. We will proceed to clear out and arrange with Mr. Stone & Mr. Watson the whole work himself and to put all through without further delay. This seems to be the best which could be done.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\n[Stamp]\nSir,\n\nMy action meets your approval. I propose visiting Stoney Point next week from today and will report other options as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.H. McLean,\nApril.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.H. McLean Esq.,\nChief Deputy Secretary,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th inst., I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in arranging for the necessary work in connection with the Stony Point school, and hopes you will be able to report a satisfactory job at an early date.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

When up on the 24th the screens had been installed and everything more of a fixture so that we decided that there should be a drawer placed in the closet also. I, therefore, arranged with John to go to Theford and get some more lumber and excavate for the drawer; make it and place it, which he thought would take a day besides a half day for the going for the lumber with his team. I therefore, allowed him 1\u00bd days, one half day for his team and a day for himself in this connection, which is included in the account herewith enclosed.\n\nEverything seemed very satisfactory to me and I trust will meet your approval and I would thank you for a cheque in favor of John Elijah for the full amount.\n\nHe had helpers but I paid them to save complication and he is to refund the amount to me when his cheque comes to hand.\n\nYou will kindly send the cheque forward at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Deputy & Secretary\nOttawa, Ont.\nKettle Point Aug. 6/13.\n\nMonthly Council.\n\nThe Council as a whole examined the school house ad\nand the grounds at Stony Point and recommended as\nfollows:- That the school house be painted inside\nand out and re-shingled and the south west corner of\nthe grounds be reserved for a garden and the ground\nto be prepared for Spring work and that the expense\nof the same be paid out of the Public Funds of\nthe Band.\n\nMoved by John Elijah sec. by Wm. Rogers that the\nrecommendation of the Council as a whole be\nadopted. Carried.\n\n(Signed) F. W. Jacobs,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, August 19, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a resolution of the Sarnia council that the Stony Point School be painted inside and out and reshingled and that a portion of the grounds be prepared for a garden to be worked in connection with the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase the necessary materials for this work and have it done by members of the band, the materials to be purchased at the best possible prices and fair rates of wages paid for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. O. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nOn the 2nd inst., I received a communication from Mr. Thomas Parkinson of Thedford, stating that John Elijah said it would take about Thirteen Dollars for material to paint the school house and the roof would require to be shingled, as it leaked; that shingles were Four Dollars per thousand and that he could get the work done any time.\n\nThis was previous to the meeting of the Council which convened at Kettle Point the 6th inst., composed, as you are aware, almost entirely of new members. I replied to Mr. Parkinson, asking him to let me know what the cost of painting the school house inside and out and shingling it would be. He was away from home and I received no reply.\n\nOn the 14th inst., I was called up by John Elijah who stated that he was shingling the school house. He had one half done and had secured the paint for the purpose of painting. I said, \"Why, who authorized you to do anything like that? I have just been waiting for a communication giving me some idea of the cost of the work with a view of forwarding it to the Department and asking for instructions.\" He simply said, \"Why, the Council said it was to be done, and the roof leaks and it has to be done.\" I said, \"You know the Council has no authority to order work done in that way\" and his reply was simply, \"Well, it had to be done\", so I had simply to drop him.\n\nI then received a letter from Mr. Parkinson saying, \"I met John Elijah today and he informs me that the shingles cost $19.00 and labour of putting them on, $4.50, carrying (that means no doubt, teaming them from Thedford) $2.00, painting material $12.50, labour $7.00, adding, I understand, \"The roof will be completed tonight and the painting will be commenced at once.\"\n\nOf course, as stated above, this is all irregular and doubtless the new Council, not being guided by the old members, thought that they were at liberty to proceed in this way. Unfortunately, I was too ill at the time to attend the Council which I regretted very much, but it is evident the\nSir,\n\nwork was all necessary, the painting needed and the roof indispensable, so, I would be glad if the Department could overlook this irregularity and as soon as I am satisfied that the work is done and properly done, and the prices fair, I will make out vouchers and send them forward.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nD.

The very thought of such a condition of things makes one feel sick and I at once wrote Miss Weaver to employ a white man who might employ an Indian as helper and have him undertake to pump out the well and clean it thoroughly and cleanse the pump, replacing it and properly covering the well so as to prevent a repetition of the kind. I asked Miss Weaver to employ a white man because the Indians cannot be trusted in a matter of this kind. They have been tried two or three times and failed.

The desks are crowded too closely together and it is necessary in some instances to seat three pupils at one double desk. The building itself is old and rather than spend any money on repairs it would be advisable to erect a new school with teacher's residence included.\n\nThe parents are taking more interest in sending their children to school and are anxious to have better accommodation.\n\nIn this connection it would be as well to give some consideration to a central school for the two reserves. From a casual survey of the situation, I think that this is a matter which Schools Branch should give careful consideration. There are never more than ten or eleven pupils at Stony Point School. This seems to be too few to warrant the expense of upkeep of teacher's salary. The Stony Point school would be better situated if built up on the hill, near the church. This would bring it much closer to Stony Point reserve and an arrangement could probably be made for transportation of pupils daily to the school and return. I mention this only as a suggestion for consideration and not as a proposition, which has been given careful thought. I do, however, strongly recommend a new school for Kettle Point reserve and that the location be changed to a more central point.\n**Indian Trust Fund**\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTo William George.\n\n| DATE       | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------|\n| June 10th, 1925 |        |\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. dated 21/26.\n\nTo putting up new blackboard, and fixing the floors, and repairing the steps, and putting on new screen, on the windows, and door.\n\n$4.00\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\nStoney Point June 8th 1925\n\nTo put up new blackboard and fitting the floor and repairing the steps and putting on new screen on the windows and door.\n\n$4.00 (four dollars)\n\nWilliam George\n\nJULY 11 1925\n\nC.A. by Mr. Raff.

Reserve. They think it is very unfair to give everything to Kettle Pt. and we do not get a thing for our school. They are positive that the attendance would be larger if we had a different school house. I know myself it would be so much nicer if our school was a little larger and if we had a bell besides. Most of the pupils come in so late and it is impossible to follow the program the way we should. I think it would make a lot of difference if we had a bell and about twenty single desks.\n\nI expect to have three signatures for help right away, and I have not the room unless I put two in a seat and I do not like that. I do sincerely wish that the Indian Dept. grant us the seats and the bell, if we cannot get a new school.\n\nThere are a lot of little children on the reserve and in two or three years time, this little school house will not hold them all.\n\nI hope I am not asking too much; I am writing this letter to please the pupils because they are at me every day to write. I would be very much pleased if we can get the seats & the bell. Trusting you will consider this matter and grant us our request.\n\nI remain,\n\nMrs. Ruth M. King\nOttawa, April 26th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the attendance, etc., at the Stony Point Indian Day School, and requesting that, in the interest of the work, 20 single desks and a bell be supplied, in order to encourage the Indian children in their attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring your request to Mr. Agent Paul. I may add that our funds are limited, and unless the Agent considers that the desks are absolutely necessary, we would not be prepared to supply them at the present time. However, we will await the report of the Agent before definitely deciding this matter.\n\nWe are also asking the Agent to furnish further particulars regarding the bell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If you recommend that these new desks be furnished, it will be necessary to give the sizes and number of each size, also full shipping directions. For your information, I may say that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n- No. 6 - Pupils 5 to 8 years,\n- No. 5 - 6 to 10 ,\n- No. 4 - 9 to 14 ,\n- No. 3 - 12 to 18 ,\n- No. 2 - 16 to 20 .\n\nOur funds are limited, and unless you consider that new desks are necessary, we would not be prepared to supply same at the present time.\n\nRelative to the bell, please give full particulars as to the type of bell required, the approximate cost of same and whether you would recommend that same be supplied or not.\n\nYour early attention to the request made by the teacher is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

She states, that there are just 10 double desks in the school, at the present time. She feels that the pupils would be in a better position to do more work, if they had single desks. In the school, she would like the desks in the following sizes:\n\nNo. 6 - Pupils 5 to 8 years, ........... 4\nNo. 5 \" 6 to 10 \" ........... 12\nNo. 4 \" 9 to 14 \" ........... 2\n\nWith reference to the bell, for the school, she states that same can be purchased from George Henry Co., Toronto, Ont., at a cost of $24.00. This bell is to be placed on the roof, with a rope, to pull for recess, etc.\n\nAs the Department has stated that the funds are limited, I feel that the Stony Pt. school should be able to carry on the work quite successfully, without the purchase of either.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

In reply, I would say that on receipt of your letter, I took this matter up with the Teacher, Mrs. McKinnon, and her idea was that the Department might furnish a light lunch, as well as cocoa, for the dinner hour. She said that if the Department would only furnish the cocoa, for a hot drink at noon, it would not be worth while. I would not recommend any further action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McClean, Esq.,\nAsst.

If weather conditions permit, I have to request that you will arrange to have a small porch erected at the front entrance, with space for cloakroom purposes. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that a suitable porch is erected, and at the least possible expense, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job. You should arrange to have this work carried out as soon as it is possible to have it done.\n\nThe Inspector states that the front steps are completely worn out, but if this porch is erected, the steps can be done away with.\n\nHe also states that the boys' closet needs a new screen, and that a urinal should be installed, also that a wood box should be provided for the classroom and that the chimney should be pointed to secure some loose bricks, and that the board walk over the culvert at the road entrance is worn out and should be replaced at once. He further states that the front fence requires repairs and that the wire should be stretched and stapled.\n\nYou should arrange to have all the above repairs mentioned by the Inspector carried out. You should see that the work is satisfactorily completed, at as low a cost as possible.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a teacher's desk and chair be provided. You should obtain prices for the supplying of a desk and chair, and arrange for the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. It is not intended that any expensive articles be supplied.\n\nAfter all the above authorized work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

If the porch is built, the steps can be done away with.\n\nThe boys' closet needs a new screen and a urinal installed. A wood box should be provided for the classroom. The chimney should be pointed to secure some loose bricks. The front fence is sagged; it should be stretched and staples. The boardwalk over the culvert at the road entrance is worn out and should be replaced at once. A teacher's desk and chair should be provided. A dilapidated kitchen table is in use as a desk.

At the St. Clair School it would require an extra expenditure to fix up a gas plate, as there is no stove for the children in the classroom.\n\nI think it would be a good thing for the children if hot soup, etc., could be provided and would suggest that $5.00 be allowed Stony Pt. and $10.00 for the other schools, for supplies.\n\nTrusting this will receive favourable consideration, and an early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.C. McCormick\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 18th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to serving midday meals at the schools in the Sarnia Agency. In reply I beg to say that you may authorise an expenditure for the purchase of midday meal supplies to the value of $5.00 at the Stony Point School and the amount of $10.00 each at the Kettle Point and St. Clair Schools.\n\nIt is understood that the above amounts will supply the midday meals necessary during the winter of 1933-34.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. C. McCormick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSt. Clair Indian Day School,\nNov. 22, 1933.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the first quarter of the current year this school was closed for four weeks because of an epidemic of \"flu\" and measles.\n\nAt the present time there are three admitted cases of scarlet fever from the school and many cases of cold etc., which are causing the absence of the pupils concerned.\n\nKeeping these facts in mind and from observation of the lunches brought to school, I suggest that the increase in illness over past years may be partially attributable to under-nourishment.\nThis condition might be rectified to some extent by serving some form of hot lunches at noon hour.\n\nIt would be necessary to install some sort of stove or gas plate in the school. The children would probably be willing to supply their own dishes etc.\n\nIn the only other school from which I have been able to secure any data, the cost of food per pupil was $1.50 per meal for the winter of 1932-33. In this case they served a bowl of vegetable and meat stew, one slice of bread and a cup of cocoa or milk.\n\nI am fully aware of the need for economy at the present time and will not feel in any sense aggrieved if you take no action in this matter. I am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nHon. E.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept.

The toilets may also be repaired and the cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nIt is noted that the material required for the fencing would cost, approximately, $38.00. Please let me know the amount that would be required for labour to erect the fence. As there are many demands on our appropriation, it is doubtful if this work can be authorized this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Office,\nSarnia, Ont.\nJune 25th, 1934.\n\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn answer to your request for prices on material for school fencing, we quote as follows:\n\n| Item       | Price |\n|------------|-------|\n| 12' farm gate | $6.60 |\n| 3' farm gate   | $3.50 |\n\nBoth of these gates would have steel tubing, electrically welded frames, and these frames would also have two coats of aluminum paint.\n\nWe refer you to our price list for Style T-40-0 and Style L-7-40-0, quoted at .46 cents and .40 cents respectively. This we believe is the type of fencing that you require.\n\nAs for steel posts, we would recommend our studded T-Bar, 7 feet long, at .47 cents each.\n\nAll of these prices would be subject to 10% discount to you and quotation is f.o.b. Sarnia, or f.o.b. railway station in this vicinity. We could, of course, deliver by truck if it is not out of the usual trucking route, but if it is off the route usually travelled by these trucks, there would be extra charge for delivery because the trucks would charge us extra. These prices we feel sure you will find satisfactory and the material is of the highest quality.\n\nYou will note you can have the seven wire fence, 48\" high, at a slightly higher price if you wish. Any order sent us will have our very best attention and be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHE SARNIA FENCE CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\nANGLE PICKET FENCE\nPainted Green, Black or Aluminium\n(8 foot Panels)\n6\" Sq.

McGOOKIN, Inspector,\non his visit to the S A R N I A Agency -\nReport dated October 22, 1935.\n\nOriginal on ....\n\nThe Stoney Point School is in poor condition\nand too small. The classroom is 18 X 23, average\nattendance eight, eleven on the roll. There are ten\ndouble seats, badly worn and too large for the pupils.\nThe building needs painting inside and out. The two\nclosets are past repairing and should be replaced\nwith new ones.\nOttawa, October 29, 1935.\n\nSIR:\n\nIn a report on his recent inspection of the Stony Point Indian Day School, Inspector McGeckin states there are 10 double seats badly worn and too large for the pupils. He states, further, that the inside and outside of the building should be painted and that the two closets should be replaced, as they are past repairing.\n\nRegarding the desks, I would request that you take up this matter with the teacher, with a view to ascertaining the size and the number of each size of single school desks required to provide adequate seating accommodation at this school. In arranging the seating, it would be advisable to have one row of the same size desk with a front and rear seat. When the Department receives the information requested above, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided to supply new desks this year.\n\nWith reference to the replacing of the closets, I would request that you will furnish particulars regarding the type and size of closets you would recommend and the approximate cost of material and labour in the erection. Please state, also, if you consider these closets should be built this fall.\n\nThere will be no funds available to paint the exterior and interior of the school building this year. Early next spring, you should report regarding this matter, stating what painting you would recommend be done and the cost of material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. C. McCormick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nS A R N I A, Ont.\nForest, Nov 25, 1935.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter careful consideration of the size and needs of the children and a study of Hendry's catalogue I decided that the most satisfactory seats would be 5 Preston 85C single desks size 2 priced $7.75 each and a Kindergarten Primary table No. C priced $5.50 with 6 chairs No. 57 at $1.40 making a total of $26.65. These seats are adjustable and the children are small. We have a larger Primary than Senior Department as the children leave school at an early age.\n\nBefore replacing the seats the floor will have to be repaired as there are large cracks between the boards and Mr. McHutchin spoke of removing the platform at the front of the room.\n\nThe closets are neither safe nor sanitary. The estimate made by Conlee Lumber Co in Shedden was $45 for\nmaterial. I have been unable to obtain an estimate for the labour but I believe they could be erected in 5 days at $2 a day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary E. Anderson,\nForest, Ont.\n\nTeacher at the Stoney Point School.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th ult., I am inclosing letter from Miss Mary Anderson, Teacher, of Stony Pt.

It was necessary that she should have warmer clothing in order that she could attend school and I think it is a just charge against the appropriation for Indian Education and could be submitted for payment with the other purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.C. McCannick\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I would point out that clothing for children attending day schools has always been considered a charge against the appropriation for relief purposes and not against the appropriation for Indian education. In future, therefore, clothing that you are authorized to supply for children attending day schools should be vouchered on separate forms from those used for articles purchased for use at day schools.\n\nWith regard to the account for $6.85 in favour of the Forest Farmers' Trading Co., the amount of $2.60 is being charged to the Relief Appropriation and $4.25 to the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Therefore, the first item on Page 2 of the account should read $43.00 (2 toilets @ $21.50 each).\n\nI note that the account is now totalled at $86.45. I enclose an adding machine statement of the account, and it would appear from this that the account should read $86.95.

School yesterday I inspected the work being done on the woodshed being built there. I found that the lumber from the old shed which they intended to use as siding on the new shed was too badly rotted on the ends to be of any services except for sheeting on the roof.\n\nI therefore issued an order for enough Matched Siding to complete the job, about 400 ft. in all. This will conform with the siding on the school, and as the shed is attached to the school, it will make a better looking job. I trust this will meet with your approval.\n\nI would also say that this school needs a new roof badly and should also be painted this summer during the holidays. The shingles are badly gone on both sides of the roof, and in one or two places are off altogether.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. Tremouth,\nAct Indian Agent.\n\nA.F.

I trust this meets with your approval.\n\nThe Teacher, Miss Anderson has requested permission to employ a man for a few days to put the flower beds and grounds in shape for the winter. As the pupils are all young they cannot do this themselves and I would recommend this be done. The cost should not exceed $10.00.\n\nRegarding the school building itself. The foundation seems to be alright but the frame of the building is settling towards the front or entrance. Evidently when constructed it was never properly braced. The front of the building is now three or four inches out of plumb, at the top, with the result that the doors and cupboard doors do not fit well and are hard to open and close. The building should also be painted inside and out next year.\n\nI think it would be advisable to have whoever comes up for the Fall Pay make a report on this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The attendance is poor. There are seven on the roll with an average attendance of four. I could find no reason for this only indifference. The parents have been warned time and again by the R.C.M.P. Police to send their children regularly, they attend for a few days and drop right back again. The same applies to the Kettle Point School.\n\nThere are a few parents who have persistently neglected to send their children to school. I would recommend that the school attendance regulations be enforced on the Kettle & Stoney Point Reserves and that the Agent be authorized to proceed against the delinquent parents. With the two well equipped schools and efficient teachers provided for their benefit right at their door, it is too bad that these boys and girls should be permitted to face life without the advantages of some education.\n\nThos.

Corp. Chisholm of the R.C.M.P. was on the Reserve the morning of April 18th, and Miss Anderson reported the matter to him and he is investigating it. Nothing appears to have been taken unless there was some dry wood taken. It looks as if it is the work of some of the Indians living close to the school.\n\nAs the shed should be locked it will be necessary to purchase another padlock and I would ask authority to do this.\n\nIn your letter of Oct. 6th, 1936, F.29-3-5 authority was granted for an expenditure not exceeding $10.00 to fix up the grounds of this school. Owing to the weather I was unable to have the work done at that time, and I would request authority to have it done this Spring. There should also be a couple of loads of gravel put on the walk from the road into the school. This would probably cost about four dollars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. C.

Hence the 5\u00a2 for delivery charge, which is given to a little Indian boy for delivering the 3 quarts of milk daily.\n\nLast year Mr. Tompkins was boarding at this particular farm house and carried the milk to school with him.

He is, I think, referring to library books and some pictures for the walls of the school. I believe I remember Mr. Phelan mentioning these things, when he visited this Agency in September. If you have any such books and pictures Mr. Tompkins would like to have some.\n\nKETTLE POINT SCHOOL\n\nI also visited Kettle Point School on the same day and Mr. Howard is very interested in a loom, asking me if the Department would consider the purchase of one if he could buy one cheap enough. I told him, \"No\". Mr. Phelan had mentioned looms to me during his visit and said he would see if you could have one sent on for this school.

Better results would be secured if the west side were renovated so as to admit the maximum amount of light. The interior of the class room needs repainting. There is only one chair.

Better results would be secured if the west side were renovated so as to admit the maximum amount of light. The interior of the classroom needs repainting. There is only one chair. Ventilation would improve if sloping boards were placed at the base of the windows so that the incoming air would be directed upward and warmed before reaching the children's heads.\"\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the school you should ascertain the approximate cost of making the improvements suggested by the Inspector and advise the Department.\n\nIt will not be possible to provide funds for any repairs or improvements at this school between now and the end of March but if you recommend the improvements suggested by the Inspector and their cost is reasonable it may be possible to secure the necessary funds from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nFebruary 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Stony Point Indian Day School\n\nYour File No. 29-3-5\n\nReplying to your letter under date of February 8, 1940, I visited the school referred to on February 15. After a careful survey, I submit my comments on Inspector Edward's suggested improvements.\n\nThe school is a very small building and quite old as noted by the approximate square feet of space. It is built north and south with two windows, each 29\" by 53\", on either side, east and west. Mr. Tompkins informs me the day Mr. Edwards visited the school it was very dull and naturally a school of this type would be dull and uninteresting. The day I called was a nice bright day and the appearance was altogether different. However, I have pointed out before that the interior of this school is badly in need of decoration. As far as the windows are concerned, unless you are prepared to tear the side walls down it cannot be changed. In any case it would not be an recommendation. The building does not warrant such an expenditure. I asked the teacher if he found any difficulty from any angle in the room in reading the blackboards. He reports no. I had the children reading small letters from every angle with satisfaction. I also asked the teacher and the children if they found it dull or hard on the eyes. They didn't think so.\n\nThere are 2 chairs, 6 kindergarten chairs, 15 desks, 1 teacher's desk, 2 tables, 1 sand table, 1 work bench, 1 organ, and 9 pupils, on this floor space of approximately 540 ft. What they would do with even one more chair in such\nRe: Stony Point Indian Day School.\n\na small room, I do not know. I think if the classroom was redecorated, it would add greatly to the appearance and, to a certain extent, improve the light. It would cost approximately $75 to do this work. However, if you decided to increase the window space, it would possibly cost $300 to $350. You would still have an old lopsided building.\n\nTrusting this will assist in determining your actions, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nT. R. L.

Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 16th instant the Department considers it inadvisable to change the windows in the Stony Point Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to the recent dissolution of the House I am not in a position at the present time to state definitely what amount will be available for repairs and improvements at Indian day schools during the fiscal year 1940-41. However, I hope that it will be possible to provide the amount of $75.00 required for decorating the interior of this school. You might write to me again in this matter early in June in order that, if funds are available, the work can be done during the summer holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Indian Day School, received.\n\nIt is rather difficult, at this time, to define the expenses in connection with the said decorations. The school in question will need some painting, some repairs to the woodwork; also labour costs. You will readily understand materials may have to be purchased from different merchants i.e., perhaps $20 or $25 worth of paint, paint brushes; possibly $10 or $15 worth of lumber, nails, etc.; and labour which would, of course, be Indian labour. With such a small amount I propose to purchase the materials as required. In this way the $75 may not all be expended.\n\nI know of no other way to give you the estimate on such a small job. However, if you have any other suggestions as to how I can work it out to a material cost of $50 to have it purchased through the Purchasing Branch, I would request your advice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

I simply wanted to make certain that they would not cost this much as, in that event, you can purchase from approved sources of supply, whereas, if the cost of the material were over $50.00, purchase would have to be made through the Purchasing Branch. An accountable cheque for $35.00 will be forwarded to you for labour.

I should appreciate it if you would arrange to have the necessary repairs attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSARNIA, Ontario,\nOctober 27, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 20, 1941, in reference to a Well at Stony Point School.\n\nThe Wells, both at Stony Point and Kettle Point, have given cause for annoyance and while cleaning out would perhaps help, it would only be temporary. They are both surface water wells and will contaminate every year. The only way to correct the situation would be to drill new wells. As far as Stony Point is concerned the possibility of getting water would be good, but in the case of Kettle Point I am doubtful.\n\nHowever, if you are agreeable to have the Wells cleaned, I will get estimates and submit for your consideration. I would also mention that both Wells need new pumps. Should this also meet with your approval, I will submit estimates with the cost of cleaning.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. G. Palmer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nReferring to yours of 17th Feb., last.\n\nWhen at Stony Point on the 26th April I took measurements of the acre desired as a lot for the school-house on which also the church stands and have prepared a plan, which I enclose herewith and trust it will be sufficiently intelligent to meet with the requirements.\n\nMy idea of describing the lot is as follows:- Beginning at a point 153 feet from the line between lot 2 range A and lot one range B to where a post has been planted; thence easterly along the high-way 292 feet to a point where a post has been planted; thence northerly 149 feet to a point where a post has been planted; then westerly 292 feet to a point where a post has been planted; thence southerly to the place of beginning.\n\nThis encloses an acre of land all but a fraction and seems to meet the requirements. I don't know that there is anything further that I can say with reference to this matter that will assist in preparing the necessary papers.\n\nYou will be good enough to instruct me at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The teacher of the Kettle Point School spent $20.00 to purchase Vocational Supplies but Mr. Tompkins has not made any expenditures for this purpose.\n\nAs lumber and other materials for teaching this important work are completely exhausted at the Stony Point School, I would recommend that the Department authorize an expenditure of $10.00 so that this work may be carried on for the balance of the 1942 term.

Butterland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa 16th July 1896:\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that, owing to the unsatisfactory manner in which the schools of the St Regis Band of Indians have hitherto been carried on, the Department has at the request of the Indians decided to continue only one school on Cornwall Island, in lieu of the Methodist and Roman Catholic Schools formerly carried on at that place, which will be conducted as a purely undenominational school. The Department will, however, gladly consent to religious instruction being given to pupils of your faith, at certain fixed time in the morning or after as best suits the convenience of your missionary in charge.\n\nI may add that this affords the only solution of the difficulty regarding the schools on Cornwall Island, as the Indians have absolutely refused to make any further contributions from their funds for the support of two schools at that place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A Sutherland, D.D.\nMethodist Mission Room\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn an interview which the Rev Dr Carman had with the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs early in November, the case of the Methodist Indian day school on Cornwall Island was referred to. I had previously given Dr Carman a brief memo of the facts in the case, and I think that memo was left with the Superintendent General. As it seems absolutely essential that the Methodist school should be reopened, I sincerely hope that the Indian Department has favorably considered the question of a grant, and I trust that the item will be included in the estimates to be laid before Parliament.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 12th December, 1896.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland urging that a salary be provided for in the next estimates for the re-opening of the Methodist School on Cornwall Island, I beg to remind you that until the end of the school year 1895 there were two schools on Cornwall Island, one under the Roman Catholic Church, the other under the Methodists; but at that time it was considered that it would be advisable to combine these two schools into one common school, which was done. The Roman Catholics did not appear to have raised any objections to the change, but the Methodist Indians have never seemed to be quite satisfied.\n\nThe salary of the teacher of the present undenominational school is $350, which is entirely out of the funds of the band. The former Methodist school was supported jointly by the Indians and the Methodist Missionary Society, each contributing half the salary, which was $200.\n\nIn a report from the Public School Inspector, Mr. McNaughton, dated the 28th September 1896, the following remarks appear: \"In my opinion the former arrangement of two schools was more beneficial and satisfactory. Although the Methodist Indians do not appear to be thoroughly satisfied with the present arrangement...\"\nschool, it is not known that they would be willing again to contribute half of the salary of the teacher if the Methodist School should be re-opened.\n\nH.C. Ross\nOttawa, 14th December, 1896.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, urging that provision be made in the next estimates for the re-opening of the Methodist School on Cornwall Island.\n\nIn reply I am directed to inform you that the Department does not favourably entertain this application, as it is considered that the present undenominational school does the work very satisfactorily, although possibly not so much so as the two schools formerly did. On the ground of economy, however, it is not thought that a change should be made, at all events, at present.\n\nThe Department has not received any complaints from the Roman Catholic Church in respect to the present undenominational school, and I have not heard the Catholics say anything unsatisfactory about the school, and no direct dissatisfaction has been expressed by the Indians in respect to the present school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ontario.\nOttawa, 14th December, 1890.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, urging that provision be made in the next estimates for the re-opening of the Methodist school on Cornwall Island.\n\nIn reply I am directed to inform you that the Department does not favourably entertain this application, as it is considered that the present undenominational school does the work very satisfactorily, although possibly not so much as the two schools formerly did.

As a result of these objections the Protestant children are without any educational advantages. At present only two boys attend the school. The Missionary informs me that he called a meeting of the parents and guardians, and urged upon them the importance of sending their children to the school, but no one would consent to do so except Louis Benedion, the father of the two boys above referred to. The Missionary has urged from the pulpit, and in person intercourse, that the parents should send their children, but without effect.\n\nUnder these circumstances I am constrained to repeat the request of the Missionary Committee for the re-opening of the Methodist school on Cornwall Island, and that provision be made for that purpose in the estimates for the coming year.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nreferring to former correspondence respecting the re-opening of the Methodist school on Cornwall Island, and a reply to the effect that the Department was opposed to such a course, I beg to submit for your consideration some additional facts. After receiving the Departmental letter I wrote to the Missionary in charge at Cornwall Island for definite and reliable information upon certain points. He informs me that according to Government returns of the 30th of June, 1897, there are 139 called Methodists, and that this number has since been increased; that there are 25 children of school age belonging to Methodist families on Cornwall and Pelo Islands, while the entire number of school age on the reserve is 293. There are several schools (4 I believe) within the boundaries of the Reserve, but the Protestants are nearly all on Cornwall Island, where we desire the school to be established.\n\nIn reply to my question, \"Are the Methodist Indians satisfied with the present school arrangement?\" The answer was emphatically \"No.\" And that for various reasons. For some time after the school was announced as non-denominational, a Catholic teacher was employed, the Catholic Catechism was taught, and the Church holidays were observed, leading to the conclusion that it was still a Catholic school. Recently Mr. Agent Long showed the Missionary a letter from the Department in which he was authorized to inform the teacher that he must\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, 22nd February, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe Dr Sutherland's application for the re-opening of the Methodist school on Cornwall Island, and provision in the Estimates for the salary of a teacher, I beg to say that a similar application was made last November and submitted to the Deputy Minister who directed that Dr Sutherland should be written to and informed that the Department could not favorably entertain his request.\n\nI may say that at present there is no possibility of school matters on the St Regis Reserve being placed on a good footing until the two factions on the Reserve become reconciled.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nMEMO.\n\nSecretary,\n\nOf the 28 children of school age on Connell and Rydell (Rydell not known) there in the last named can more conveniently with more advantage to themselves attend a rural school half a mile from the island.

It will be improper & discriminate against a sect. The Catholic children should of course not be taught, but this charge is of the park. If the school was denominational the inclusion would mean many of them who came to teaching it, that was unfortunate till whom child be removed. It was certainly fair third Catholic exercises on holy days.\n\nIf the majority of pupils were Protestant then would be no difficulty in answering the teacher should stop that. However believe that Catholic children are more prone here bad language than others. Benedict shows his good sense; the question answered into so stated (one was not in a separate school but in an Ind. school (semi state) in place of Catholicism.

Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in further reference to your application for the re-opening of the Methodist school on Cornwall Island; and in reply I beg to state as follows:\n\nThere are now only two schools in operation on the St Regis Reserve,\u2014the undenominational school on Cornwall Island and the Roman Catholic school at St Regis. When the amalgamation of the two schools on Cornwall Island took place, some three years ago, you were informed that the Department would gladly consent to religious instruction being given to pupils of your faith at a certain fixed time in the morning or afternoon as best suited the convenience of your missionary in charge, and the same privilege was granted to the Roman Catholics. The Department will give instruction to its Agent to see that the teacher imparts purely undenominational tuition, and it is not aware that anything to the contrary was being done. If these instructions are carried out, I do not see that either denomination would Methddist Mission Rooms,\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.\n\nToronto\nwould have just cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nOTTAWA, 23rd February, 1893\n\nSir,\n\nAn application has been received from the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society asking for the re-opening of the Methodist school on Cornwall Island, as it is stated that the Methodist Indians are not satisfied with the present school arrangements for various reasons, one being that the Roman Catholic catechism is being taught in the school. The second is that the children are constantly fighting with the few Protestants who attend, and further, that the pupils use such profane and bad language that the Protestant parents refuse to allow their children to go to school at all.\n\nAt the time the two schools were amalgamated into an undenominational school, arrangements were made for the imparting of religious instruction to pupils of each faith by their respective missionaries, and no such instruction was to be given by the teacher. The Department wishes you to see that the teacher does not act contrary to these instructions as his teaching is to be purely secular.\n\nMr. Milloran should be able to maintain discipline.\n\nGeo.

Permit me to say that your letter does not meet the real point at issue. It is not with us the question of imparting religious instruction to the pupils at certain fixed times; it is simply a question whether the Protestant children, who constitute a majority of those of school age on Cornwall Island, shall have school privileges or not.\n\nUnder the operation of the present system they are practically deprived of such privileges, and we expect the Department to take the necessary steps to remove this disability, and concede the same rights which are conceded to other Churches under similar circumstances.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 20th April, 1899\n\nRev.

J. Atherton, Father Superior at\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nat Garden River.\n\nUpon receipt of his letter I wrote Revd. Father Stowe asking if he could verify Mr. Bernard's statement. In reply the Reverend gentleman stated that in his opinion Mr. Bernard is well authorized to emphatically deny every charge made against him. He further stated that he had been present in the school when she was teaching and had found that she taught with authority, intelligence and method and that he might even say that Mr. Bernard is one of the best teachers he ever knew in our Indian schools. The Revd. Gentleman further says that he went himself to Theresa for the purpose of making investigation in the matter and had failed to find proof as to many accusations.\n\nI then felt satisfied that the Indians had no serious cause for complaint and accordingly took no further action in the matter.\n\nI have the honor to state that when I was at Theresa in the 15th and 16th inst., the matter was again brought before me by the Indians who informed me that Mr. Bernard for some time back had had improper relations with an Indian alleged to be from Drummond Island, and that same she has had illegitimate issue which is attributed to that source.\nI have further the honor to state that the Chief at this school has written me under date 16th inst., and enclosing a letter from himself, Father Albert to Chief Kawawit (not Chief) which confirms the guilt of the teacher.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that she be at once discharged and that steps be taken to obtain another teacher for this school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.M.

The Shesalak Indians advised the Church gentleman that they would like him to nominate a teacher for their school and Mr. Walsh has been installed in consequence.\n\nChurch Father Sturges telling him that the teacher's appointment must be confirmed by the Department before he could recognize his services, and also advised the fact. I state that the usual Certificate of competency and character will be sent forthwith. Father Sturges replied, stating, that the reason he took the liberty of selecting Mr. Walsh as the Reverend was because the school had been vacant for so long a time, and because\n\nThe Deputy Chief of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nI am satisfied that the Indians would be very much pleased to have Mr. Staley for teacher.\n\nAs for his appearance and character,\" says Father Sartain, \"I may give him a good certificate; the result of my enquiry about him having been very satisfactory.\"\n\nI have further the honor to state that the Indians were very anxious to have a male teacher; moreover, Mr. Staley has been teaching very satisfactorily in the Public school of Spanish River, having been advised of this fact by Rev.

It must be borne in mind that no payment will be allowed for holidays, i.e., the actual number of days that school was open being counted.\n\nIt would appear from your letter that Mrs. Bernard is now Mrs. Bisaillon.

I understand his family are in pretty bad shape. Do you not think that he should be given the full government's salary anyway? He had an opportunity of coming up another position, so he paid for the term he began on.\n\nAlderman\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA 3rd November, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe the closing of the Thessalon Indian school\n\nOn the 16th ultimo, Mr Agent Hagan was informed that the Department approved of his suggestion to close this school as the Indians had nearly all left the reserve, and he was instructed to inform the teacher that his services would no longer be required.\n\nNo mention was made in the letter above referred to of any allowance to the teacher in lieu of notice. I think it would be only fair, as Mr Dyment suggests, that he should receive the salary in full for the current quarter, which closes on the 31st proximo, this allowance being equivalent to two months notice.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 3rd November, 1899\n\nDear Mr. Dyment,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 31st ultimo, I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion to pay Mr. Walsh, late teacher of the Indian school on the Thessalon Reserve, which has recently been closed in full for the current quarter, and a cheque will be sent him for the amount due him to the 31st proxime, in lieu of notice.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA. H. Dyment, Esq., M.P.,\nThessalon, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe were speaking to your agent here on behalf of Mr. H. J. Walsh, late teacher at the Indian Reserve. Mr. Hagan did not seem inclined to discuss the matter, as he said his duty was simply to report on the amount of work done by Mr. Walsh.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Walsh started at the commencement of the term with the expectation of teaching for the year, and the fact that school was closed before the first month of the second quarter had expired has placed Mr. Walsh in rather bad position financially. He has a large family of small children, and his opportunity of getting another school will be very slim before the commencement of next year, and we take the liberty to write you on his behalf, calling attention to the fact that this is a real hardship to Mr. Walsh, and unless he gets a payment for more than the actual days taught, his family will suffer.\n\nWe have known Mr. Walsh since he started to teach here, and owing to his numerous family he has been obliged to live up to his income, and we trust you will excuse the liberty we take in thus writing you on his behalf. This is written from no pecuniary motive on our part, but simply from a desire to see Mr. Walsh leniently dealt with.\n\nWhile your agent here might not feel disposed to discuss the matter from a business standpoint, we feel sure that his feelings of humanity would prompt him to report in favor of Mr. Walsh receiving a full quarter's pay.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nDict.\nOTTAWA, 6th November, 1899\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, asking that Mr. M.J.

No further action was taken until October last when the Indians asked for the re-opening of the school. The Department again wrote the Agent asking to be informed as to the number of children likely to attend if the school were re-opened and he says that there are about twelve children who could attend regularly and that the Indians of the Band have promised him that they will stay on the reserve and support the school.

There is a bedstead and a mattress but perhaps not very clean. $50.00 would pay for the rooms and furnish some furniture. It is about 1\u00bd miles to the nearest house; it would be too far to go for board.

The place I had arranged for her to board has sickness in the house. The woman of the house took some nasty disease in her hands and has been away doctoring for the last few days. Then we took a second trip, as I think the lady wished to stay, but we could not get a place nearer than 2\u00bd miles that would suit her.

Although she is reported to be an excellent teacher and has successfully taken the summer course at the Ontario Agricultural College, making use of it in her school in the teaching of gardening and domestic science, she has only an average of about seven pupils. I told her that I did not think that the Department would be disposed to grant her the increase, but that I would submit her application to you. She informed me that if she did not get the increase she would have to leave the school after the summer holidays. She told me that she was put to considerable expense in getting to and from the reserve to Thessalon, as the school is about seven miles from the village, where her people reside.

HAGAN'S AGENCY\n\n==============================\n\nThessalon Reserve.\n\nThis school was closed although in good order and several children available for attendance. Great antipathy shown toward the idea of sending their children to the convent.\nOttawa, March 17, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that there are several children of school age on the Thessalon Reserve who are not receiving any education, as the school there is closed for want of a sufficient number of children. There is no reason why these children should not be sent to the Spanish River Industrial School, where there is room for them, and the Department would like you to endeavour to have them sent there, where they will be well looked after and receive a good education.\n\nUnless the Department can be assured that there would be a much larger regular attendance than formerly it would not be disposed to re-open the day school on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSpanish, Ont.\nAug. 3rd 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Rothera... The Indians of the Les Sable reserve are anxious to have a teacher there for the coming year. There are eleven children of school age and only one of them has been attending school. The closest school to the reserve is about two miles and a half and they claim that it is too far for their children to walk especially in winter time and on rainy days. Besides that the Indian children are teased and laughed at by the white children. So for these reasons none of the Indian children would use my school for that purpose. All the department would have to supply as a teacher and the necessary books.\n\nThis would be a saving to the department as there will be eight or nine applications for Spanish school if they do not get a teacher there.\n\nRecently the Indians had a meeting and passed a resolution to apply for a teacher.\n\nHoping you will do your best to help them out in this matter, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.J. Dwyer, s.j.\nTheodore O.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the undersigned want a teacher for our reserve this year. We can use Father Dewier's chapel for a school. There are eleven children ready for school now.\n\nChief - Oliver Wabigoon\nCousins - Ernest Bisaillet\nWillard Bisaillet\nDan Bisaillet\nGeorge Wabigoon\nLucie Bisaillet x two marks\nJoe Bisaillet\nAugust 12th/35\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed resolution passed by the Indians of Thessalon Band asking that a school teacher be appointed to teach the children living on the Reserve, there are II ready for the school. The nearest school is at Maple Ridge a distance of two and a half miles. The old school is too far away, the Indians have abandoned that part of the Reserve and are living nearer the main road. The priest has a dwelling which could be used and the desks are at the Reserve from the old school. If a teacher is appointed the children would be able to attend the school and live at home, if not they are going to make application to attend the school at Spanish, believe it would pay to send them there.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 15, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a resolution passed by the Indians of the Thessalon Band, requesting that a teacher be appointed and a school conducted for the benefit of the Indian children of the Band, and also enclosing a communication which you received from Rev. Father Dwyer, regarding the matter.\n\nIn reply I regret the Department has no funds provided to pay salary of teacher or to pay the costs involved in carrying on day school activity for the Thessalon Band during the coming academic year. The matter of the re-establishment of this school will receive consideration when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, and it may be possible to provide salary for a teacher.\n\nIf it is absolutely necessary, no doubt you could arrange to have some of the children placed in the Spanish Indian Residential School. You might take up this matter with the Principal, to ascertain if he has accommodation. If so, you should forward applications and certificates of health for the admission of the pupils who, in your opinion, should be placed in the Spanish School. These applications should be forwarded to the Department for approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI just returned a few days ago from the Les Sables Indian reserve, which is about five miles from Thessalon.\n\nWhile I was there the Indians came to me wanting a teacher this year on their reserve.\n\nThere are eleven children there of school age and the closest school to the reserve is about two miles and a half. They said it was too far for their children to go to school. In fact only one attended school last year and that was for about two months of the school term.\n\nThey asked me if I would give them my chapel there for a school house, which I willingly agreed to, so all they really need is a teacher and the necessary books. The desks from the old school are still in good order.\n\nThe Indians of that reserve came to me with a petition and a resolution which they had passed in their council to this effect. They were to take one copy to the agent Mr. Rothera at Thessalon and the other copy they asked me to send directly to the department. I am enclosing it in this letter.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Rothera, the agent, about it and he said he would take the matter up with the department.\n\nI also would like to have a teacher there if the department sees fit. None of the children are able to read or write except one or two who have attended Spanish school.\n\nIn the event of their not getting a teacher there, there will be five more applications for Spanish, so would you kindly let me know as soon as possible the decision of the Department regarding this matter so that I may get them to sign the applications for their entry to Spanish School.\n\nI am leaving this P.M. for Sagamok and will be away for seven days through that reserve.\n\nI was expecting a letter from you re- the Sagamok School.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nI am sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSpanish, Ont.\nAug. 14th 1935.\n36-4-1\n\nCLOSED\n\nFROM 19/7/1894\n\nTO\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6023)\n\nFile 23-2-9, part 1\nPierreville - Pierreville R.C.

The school house to be 24 x 18 with a room at one end the width of the building and two feet 12 feet further which would make the building 36 feet foundation and to have the work done immediately.\n\nCarried unanimously.\n\nI have made a careful census of the children and find 22 within a half mile of the school 14 of which are of school age and wish to go to school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nS. Hogan\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 11, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., in reference to the reopening of the Thessalon River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to see that the Band has shown a desire to have their children educated, but it is considered too late in the season to undertake the erection of a new building, as when the work is done the Department would like to put up a modern school-house that will be a credit to the reserve. Any repairs necessary to make the old building habitable for the coming winter ought to be made at once; it is presumed that none of an extensive nature will be required. The room should be thoroughly cleaned, and you will be good enough to advise the Department what will be needed in the way of desks and other equipment.\n\nYou should also communicate at once with the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, with a view to securing the services of a teacher. The Department would like\n\nSamuel Nagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nto obtain a competent teacher, with proper qualifications,\nand will be prepared to pay a fair salary, if such can\nbe had.\n\nKindly give these matters immediate attention,\nso that as little time as possible will be lost in\ngetting the school [illegible] into operation, and report\nwith reference to the equipment as promptly as you can.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nThessalon\n\nAugust 13th, 1909\n\nReferring to your letter of August 11th, 1909\n\nI beg to say in answer to yours of above date and number, I visited the school and found that there should be a foundation of stone feet under it. The wind was almost new and should be shingled and some of the shingles are rotten at the lower end which should be replaced. The desks are all right, everything is in good shape. That is the school furniture. There ought enough of desks and good ones at that. The lesson cards are there and I presume there is some book but they were locked in the Teacher's Table. Down the building is well worth fixing up as if they do build a new school house, it will make an excellent council house. It is 20 feet wide and 26 feet long with a porch at one end 10 feet long and the width of the building. The porch at the front door is almost down would you advise it put up again? I would think that a foundation should be 2\u00bd feet above the ground. Kindly let me know at once what to do with the building.\n\nI think about $2000 or so will fit it in good shape.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nS. Hagan\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 19, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst. with reference to the repairs needed to the school-house at Thessalon River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to have a stone foundation put under the building and have the windows and sills repaired; and the roof reshingled. It is also thought advisable to have the porch repaired. The Department will expect you to see that the work is finished in a proper manner and the cost kept within the sum mentioned, $200.00.\n\nNo mention is made by you of the action taken to secure a teacher, but the Department would like to impress upon you the necessity for immediate action on the part of the Church authorities, so that no time may be lost in getting the school into operation. For the same reason you will be good enough to rush the repairs as fast as consistent with good workmanship. The question of a new building will receive due consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.

The gentleman above mentioned thought that if we spent about $400.00 on the school house it would do to serve all purposes both for a school house and a council house. He suggested that we paint the house and plaster it both up stairs and down. It would be a comfortable place and it would perhaps cost about $400.00 whereas if we build a new house it will cost about $1200.00. If you think the best way is to fit the old house please let me know as soon as possible so we could have it done during the holidays.

In reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be better to thoroughly repair the existing building rather than erect a new one. The rooms upstairs and down should be plastered and the exterior given two good coats of paint and the interior wood work should also be painted. You will be good enough to obtain from competent workmen a detailed estimate of the cost. This should then be submitted to the council and a resolution obtained authorizing the expenditure from their funds. As soon as you obtain this estimate and resolution, you will forward it to the Department with as little delay as possible as it is desirable that the work should be undertaken at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The children complained on more than one occasion that the said Mr. Peters had been away at his post and for this reason many of the parents do not send their children to school.\n\nMr. Peters has often been told by those in authority to leave the intoxicating drinks alone but in vain.\n\nWe did not complain before, hoping that the said Mr. Peters would reform, but has not done so.\n\nJohn M.

School Files (AC 10), Volume 6024, File 40-3-1, part 1)\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT OTTAWA 3rd February 1897\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to inform you that a complaint has been made against Mr. Peters teacher of the No:3 School on Walpole Island, by Chief Louis Fisher and other Indians of the Band that he is in the habit of using intoxicating liquor and often under its influence setting a bad example to the pupils under his charge. It is also stated that Mr. Peters has been frequently warned but without effect.\n\nMr. A. McClelland, the Police Magistrate at Wallaceburgh certifies that these complaints are true, such being the case Mr. Peters is not considered to be a fit and proper person to have charge of the school and he should be dismissed at once.\n\nThe Department is surprised that you have made no mention of this matter in any of your reports on this school, and it would like your report thereon.\n\nYou will kindly communicate with the Public school Inspector with a view to obtaining the services of a properly certificated teacher to take charge of this school with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. McKelvey, Esq:\nIndian Agent\nWallaceburgh, Ont:\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\nHalifax Feb 11th 1897\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 5945\u2014IA\u2014Dated 3rd instant informing me that a complaint had been made against Mr. Peter Labine of the school at Malpeque School in that he is in the habit of using intoxicating liquor and is often under the influence of the same thereby setting a bad example to the pupils under his charge.\n\nI beg to state in reply that I had already received a similar complaint (copy enclosed) which complaint I at once sent to Mr. Breton who I am ordered by the Department to consult, and have always been in the habit of consulting in all matters connected with the schools, and from whom I am myself to be able to learn. I have always received kind and sensible advice, and with whom I have from the first been in closest accord in matters connected with the schools.\n\nI await an answer to my letter from Mr. Breton in due course giving me the advice which advice I had intended to send to the Department with the complaint and give the report thereon, and would have done so before this if I had not received your above mentioned letter. I now beg to state that I want to see Mr. Inspector before reporting, will try and go tomorrow and will immediately thereafter report fully.\n\nTo the Deputy Agent\nof Indian Affairs\nHalifax\n\nYour obedient servant\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT OTTAWA 16th February 1897\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant I beg to say that the Department does not see why you thought it necessary to consult Mr Inspector Brobner in regard to the complaint against Mr. Peters teacher of the No:3 School for using intoxicating liquor to excess, as your instructions were only to communicate with the Inspector when looking out for a new teacher. This matter should have been reported at once to the Department, and the Department would like to know what you have done further than communicating with Mr Brobner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nAlex. McElvey, Esq:\nIndian Agent\nWallaceburgh, Ont.:\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 152945, dated 16th instant, relating to the complaint against Mr. Peter, teacher of the school for whom I am responsible, and stating that I should have reported the matter at once to the Department instead of connecting Mr. Breton.\n\nWith regard to this, regret that my attention was not met your views. It was certainly not taken with a view of suppressing the complaint which I wrote to Mr. Breton, as I fully intended and have already stated, leaving the whole matter before you, as soon as I could procure the information on the subject necessary to be able to report.\n\nIn reply to the inquiry as to what I shall done further than communicating with Mr. Breton, I beg to state that I first laid the complaint before Mr. Breton and asked him to tell me truth of mine had been any recent action of his to cause this complaint to be made at this time, as there had never been any complaint laid against him before, except occasionally I would hear from individuals (not in the school) say that William was in the habit of drinking when he was away. In reply to my question he (Mr. Breton) told me and I believe truly, that there had been less cause to make a complaint against him within the last year than there had ever been, as with the exception of taking a glass of beer occasionally he had not drunk any.\n\nHe said however that when he saw the name of\nDavid Reynolds on the complaint, it had been known when connected with a circumstance that had happened lately, that the object of the complaint at this time was to create a vacancy in the teacher's chair which vacancy could be filled by placing David Reynolds on Cornelius in it; at the same time had been at Larnia and had been examined by Mr. Inspector Brebner as to his qualification to teach a school, and had given a certificate permitting him to teach Indian schools though not the names and third class certified.\n\nMr. Brebner said if this were the case, that he was to be removed for sometime, it would hardly do both while to put Cornelius in his place, as Cornelius was in the habit of drinking to an extreme extent as he (Cornelius) knew how, and he (Brebner) assured me and fully believed him that he was making the worst of his life to stop it altogether. As to his behavior in all other respects, he did not consider himself guilty of it, he said some other things with regard to Cornelius which as he is not on trial I will not repeat, but which he said he could prove beyond peradventure.\n\nNow as to this young man Mr. Brebner,\n\nAnd in answer to your question as to what I have done further than report to Mr. Brebner, I have taken much pains to find out and verify what has been told me, and have to report that it is not in the interest of public morals, it is not from any fear that his example will be imitative, neither is it from any holy horror that any of the signers of the complaint have against drinking.\nagainst Winans, that this complaint is made.\n\nIt is from this and like praiseworthy motives\n\nThe first is to put Mr. Peter out of the\n\nschool, and to put Bernhard Hywell in his\n\nplace, and the last is to disgrace him by being\n\ncalled for drinking, so as to discredit him\n\nand disgrace him among the people with\n\na view of putting him out of the race when\n\nthe time comes (only now) to elect officers\n\n(Chief Council) for the ensuing three years, it being\n\nin this collection that at the last Election\n\nhe ran for Chief and met two with some one\n\nand came within one or two votes of being elected.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nI feel to say that if it had been worth while\n\nto try to save this young man, we have been\n\ntrying to do for the last seven years, it is\n\nworth while. Now he has got the idea, which\n\nwon to me a little longer. It is admitted by\n\nall that he was not what over the river before\n\nthey all went to go to get intoxicated near as much\n\nor as often as he used to and for the last two years\n\nhe has certainly picked up considerably. He\n\nhimself and family in good shape, always\n\nclean and well dressed, and I say and I\n\nhave had a good chance to know, that this\n\nis not a man, woman, or child, or white\n\nIndian, who ever saw him in the school or\n\nany where near it. When on duty that he was not\n\nrespectable. I have called on a great many\n\noccasions with almost a lot of hard feeling, my\n\nmyself on this point. And in the school during\n\nall the years he has kept it I never saw the sign\n\nof liquor.\nin him, and but once, and that was when he was off duty and not in the school.\n\nHe has inherited his father and mother and all (name) (father's name) and them comfortable in addition to helping his own family wife and child. All the years that he has been teaching, he has not been able to save anything. Therefore, and if he is to be dismissed, it should be for some cause other than to make a vacancy for one who could not be expected to give satisfaction in the school.\n\nHe is still teaching the school and is subject to your orders either to be dismissed or retained, which will be obeyed without another word from me.\n\nI have not seen Mr. Bubner nor heard from him. I intended to go to farm on Saturday last, but could not have time to go.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo complaining that Mr. William Peters, teacher of No. 5 School on Walpole Island, is in the habit of using intoxicating liquor and often under its influence; and in reply I beg to say that after careful enquiry into the above charges the Department is advised that Peters, who until very recently had been occasionally overstepped the bounds of sobriety, has given no cause for complaint for the past year. It is further informed that the complaint now made is the first that has been received and refers to events long since past, and that no one ever saw him in the school or anywhere near it when on duty, that he was not perfectly sober.\n\nSuch being the case the Department does not think it would be fair to dismiss him, especially as the motives which led to the charges being laid are said to very questionable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\n\nJohn V.

Kindly look into the charges laid against Peters and report as soon as possible; as if these complaints are well-founded, immediate action to dismiss Peters must be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nA. McKelvey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWallaceburgh,\nOnt.:\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 152945, dated 1st Dec. 1897.\n\nEnclosed Copy of a Complaint sent to the Department with regard to Mr. [Name] (Teacher No. 3 School), habits of drinking, and getting into mischief.\n\nI was in the island yesterday (28th) and intended doing the same, but by the time I got through both other business, it was time I was off the island. The weather being rough, the road bad, and I thought I am going again today. And will be about the matter and answer fully.\n\nI may say however that the complaints had to go a good ways back for their complaints to be received and mentioned at the occasion on which he had been called back being at a time when he was at liberty to have to go where he liked. During the Summer Holidays when the School was closed, and the time and late offence being at the time of the Board Meeting which was held at the School House door, or just across the Road from the Post Office, strictly speaking, and if he was intoxicated then, it was owing to the fact that the means of returning intoxicated was brought dangerously near to him by the Provost and Visitors at the Board Meeting, and as for the late offences on the previous day, there had been all about that before, and knew that he\nAnd know that he is not blamed by any\nmember of people who were on the ground or\nroute with being intoxicated, it being only\nthree who for reasons entirely outside\nof public morals, who are constantly con-\ntaining about his habits of drinking.\n\nI'm Retros have here a few minutes\nago in response to my request to come in\nand let me hear from him about this\nChapel before I would deliver your\nmore distinguished letters, and he does\nnot deny that he has been here on\nthe occasion here to and at Red River\non the days mentioned, but that he was\nnot at all intoxicated, and was able\nto attend to the duties which included\nhim on both days, and he says\nand testifies that not one of those\nwho make these complaints ever\nsaw him drink a drop of any kind\nof intoxicants within within question\nhours or places, and he says it\nis with a two-fold object in view that\nthese Complaints are put forward at\nthis time, one to create a vacancy in\nthe Church to be filled by himself,\nhis self, and the other to keep him\nfrom being a candidate for the office\nof Chief, to which office he ran the\nformer Chief to a dead stand still at\nthe last Election. I have made an effort\nin every way I could in the town of\nRed River, and I have failed to find one\narticle\nof disinterested evidence to show that he (Mr. Raine) did any thing more than take a place of his occasionally along with and the same as the rest, and acts his behaviour in general. I say him here occasionally, and at the school frequently, and I have to report that I have noticed a very great improvement in his personal appearance, which has been very good, and whom I have followed a man on the down hill road, and have taken great hopes from that he was trying to do with.\n\nAnd I believe he is trying, and I repeat that it will be a pity to let a young man of as much capacity as he has go to the doos. When there is a possibility of having him, and I do not hesitate to recommend that he be left on in the school, he is beyond from being a habitual drunkard, and is one of the best persons who would take to be a drinking man at all from his present appearance. I may say in conclusion that this agitation and these complaints keeps him in an unsatisfactory state, and keeps him from doing his best in the school.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the\n\nDy.

It has now been decided, however, that in view of the subsequent make in your letter to dismiss Mr. Peters, it would be neither fair to Mr. Peters nor advisable; and the Indians making the complaint have been so informed.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.D.

Date 1st instant,\nReceipt of which Letter is hereby acknowledged.\n\nRequisition for Teacher Salary\nfor March Quarter 91. $6.00\n\nAnd\n\nRequisition for School Material\n\nWith regard to the attendance of children at this school, it would seem as if the parents of children who should be sent to this school had decided to discontinue sending their children to this place. At while the daily attendance at No. 3 is from five to ten, the attendance at the other two schools was never so great as at present. There not being able for many all that are sent to these schools (No. 1 & 2). And children are being sent from the doors of No. 3 School a distance of 1/2 miles at least to No. 7 School after having traveled at\nWhat's the rule before making No. 3. Now in public school education of this nature there is nothing but prejudice to be found by. It will be remembered that several attempts have been made to create a vacancy in the teacher chair of No. 3 School by forwarding complaints to the Board of Education. Previous to Induction in No. 3 School (Mr. Butler), which induced him an unfit person to teach a school. Retiringly with the Native people in view, we really to make a place for another young man known to himself \"Cornelius Reynolds,\" son of David Reynolds who was then the master in all this town claimed. And a man who never spoke up any time, and who has not been to try for the end certified the Master. In my opinion on these complaints I have not concealed the fact that this teacher has been in the habit of quitting and getting intoxicated when away from his duties, and away from the Reserve, and since Mr. Adams that he be dismissed because, he has never been known to go to the school under the influence of liquor. None of the complaints ever said that he did. \"Secondly, because he is a high capable young man, of whom the Indians, Mr. Charles for the Co. of Hamilton (Mr. John Breton) said in a letter to the Board several years ago.\" Mr. Butler \"has no certificate but he is the best Indian Teacher I know of.\" And who if dismissed from\nfrom the school would be best to go down. Which if kept on would make the keeping of the position an increasing task. Him in coming at the latter period which has over taken him. And I have felt that I might be able to reclaim this young man. The idea of whom he has been too many times. Indeed I have not recommended his medical though I have visited his residence.\n\nNow however he has arrived at a stage where it is (or seems) questionable whether it is worth while to keep up the expense of running the school with so slight a teacher or otherwise the teacher and improving himself.\n\nThough I would advise leaving the present teacher alone for this consideration and order the Council to meet and divide the reserve into three divisions and let the children of each division go to their own school when there would be plenty of room for all. And as far as the teacher is concerned, he is equally as good as either of the other and has not given anything like the Welsh Dance for Don Head of late as formerly, as to living the school should succeed. I have already reported that he can not have drunk as much as Mr. Hunter did.\n\nI am in your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address]\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nI am of the same opinion as you that the midsummer vacation is the best time for a change of teachers.\n\nAs to the present state of No. 81 - The pupils did well when examined but they are members of Mr. Peter's family or his relations. Those who were not related to him did not do so good work. Likely they did not attend so well.\n\nMeet some of the Indian children going to the school on the mainland and saw others of school age playing around their homes. Believe Mr. Peter's drunkenness and immoral conduct are the cause of their absence, and as he will not quit such conduct he ought to be dismissed and a man who has a decent moral character appointed in his place.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 30th, 1901\nWalpole Island Agency,\nWallaceburg July 7th\n\nSir,\n\nI hope to receive your letter.\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Smith that he has received a letter from Mr. Smith dated June 25th, in which he states that he has been instructed by Mr. Smith to investigate the matter of the school at Walpole Island. He further states that he has been instructed to make a report on the condition of the school and to recommend any necessary improvements.\n\nI am confident that Mr. Smith will be able to provide the necessary information and recommendations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (AG10, Volume 6024, File 40-3-1, part 1)\nVery often, that I have heard him, and I don't believe anyone else can hear him, under the influence of his native custom in the school room during these hours, and if he has to go, I should without hesitation say to give him the liberty belonging to the position he holds and whom joined with that estate, he had nothing to read, so he improvised on the subject then, and I don't know how much he obtained it to immediately to work for his family.\n\nI know that he has from the first anticipated his salary and by the time it gets here he always has his collection up, and if the Indians decide to whom have the benefit of the present salary, the money should be withheld. In deed, before the reason to be carefully examined for the actual neglect of his own mother and his wife, I have let Mr. Smith to take the two daughters of his brother Isaac (Deceased) and his son Daniel (whom only one) into the Mount Elgin Institute, so they will be provided for, and the ladies salary will keep them in provisions until such through the winter. All this in anticipation of what will surely happen, by whom as he does not name the school he will go down very fast. All the foregoing is subject to any change you may direct to be made, and is not laid down at a permanent by any means.\n\nIn the last,\n\nIndian Affairs Ottawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nO. M. [Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 9th July, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMr Agent McKelvey in reporting on the Walpole Island No.3 school taught by an Indian named William Peters, reports that he consulted with Mr Inspector Brebner as to the advisability of retaining Peters after the close of the last fiscal year and forwards a letter from the Inspector in which he states that he believes that Mr Peters drunkenness and immoral conduct are the cause of the irregular attendance at the school, and that as he will not quit such conduct he ought to be discharged and a man of decent moral character appointed in his place.\n\nComplaints of a similar nature were made against Peters as far back as '97 which were considered to be not well established and the Department decided that it would be unfair to dismiss him.\n\nThere appears to be a good deal of jealousy in the charges against Peters but this is the first time the Inspector has stated that he has seen Peters the worse of liquor. The Agent, however, states that he has never seen Peters under the influence of liquor when at the school, and he does not believe that anyone else ever did, either in the school or during school hours. The Inspector does not state that he was drunk in school, but that he frequently hears of his being drunk at Wallaceburgh, Port Huron and elsewhere.\n\nAt all events the school is not progressing\nfavorably, and objection to the teacher on the grounds mentioned is given as the cause. The Agent recommends that he be allowed to teach until the end of the September quarter so that some provision might be made for his family, thus giving him pay for the summer holidays. I think that this suggestion might be carried out and arrangements made to secure a new teacher from the 1st of October.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 10th July, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a copy communication from Mr Public School Inspector Reebner as to the advisability of retaining the services of Mr William Peters as teacher of the No.3 school on Walpole Island; and in reply I beg to say that in view of the statements made by yourself and the Inspector the Department has decided to dispense with his services. Owing to your recommendation he may be allowed to continue in the position until the 30th September next. You will therefore be good enough to consult with the Public School Inspector in regard to the appointment of his successor to take charge of the school from the 1st of October. You may inform Peters that his retention for September quarter is conditional on his allowing his salary for that quarter to be expended for the support of his wife and mother.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. McKelvey, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nWallaceburgh, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\nDear Mr. Kelby,\n\nFully concur in all you say re No 2 School. Combined would make it and be likely to turn out much better than in No 3. I have no fear but Arthur could get most of the children to attend No 3 and you can get him to look them up for they need it.\n\nHe complained to me that he had too much to do and certainly he gets too little pay. I have told the Department so repeatedly. I am sorry for Mr. Peter but has only himself to blame.\n\nYours truly,\nJohn Brebner\n\nFarnia, Canada, July 21st 1900\nWallaceburg July 24th\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2945\u201419. Date 18th instant in answer to my letter of the 14th instant enclosing a communication from Mr. Pothier School Inspector regarding the advisability of retaining the services of Mr. Peter as teacher of the school at Wolf Island.\n\nI have delayed answering your above described letter till I should have received an answer from Mr. Inspector Pothier on the subject which answer I enclose herewith.\n\nThis answer dated 6th instant is in reply to a proposition contained in my letter to him, viz:\n\nregard to changes to be made in the schedule at the end of the last term December 31st.\n\nI proposed to let Mr. Peter finish up on eight quarters as in my letter to the District dated 7th June giving notice to that effect (which has been done and terms agreed on) then on the following 1st Dec. Dr. Smith (C.M.S.) Rev. Arthur Maclean Teacher of our school for Oct. 3rd and next December his wife accompanying him the 1st in Oct. 1st as teacher of that school.\n\nThe reasons given for such change being \"that Arthur's energy and abilities would fit him for putting two together and at the same time give him a kind added rest from the extra work during which he was engaged by the mission to teach and small remuneration and to attend to the mission and church Sunday School meetings and much occasionally for nothing which adds...\"\nwhich adds to his duties insufficient to make him Down so will not be able to bear at all. Which it is very much desired will not occur, as he puts his whole strength into the work, and if the work is increased he will undertake to continue in the school, even if he had to give up his other work.\n\nShould the change be made and he was put into No. 5 he would have nothing to do but to get the school together and teach that, which he would be quite able to do. This school being such a Protestant school, supported entirely by the Indians, his duties would cease with the closing of the school each day, which now is not far.\n\nAs to Cornelius, you will see what the Inspector says about him being able to take that school. The Missionary Mr. Richard would be quite satisfied with Cornelius, as he says Cornelius is a good young man, and a Christian. Mr. Richard being satisfied on this point, and the Inspector being satisfied as to his qualification to teach, it would seem as if Cornelius could be fairly sure of the job.\n\nNow if the District has the proposed change, and is satisfied to have them tested, I think I could with Mr. Richard's residence, get the changes made to the satisfaction of all.\n\nI have certified Mr. Peter that his term expires further at the end, and he will tender his resignation.\n\nSam in your old manner,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 21st\nOTTAWA, 1st July, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in which you propose that Arthur Nishkomen be transferred from the charge of No. 2 School to that of No. 5 and appoint Cornelius Miyushk to replace him at No. 2; and in reply I beg to say that before going any further in this matter the Department will have to consult with the authorities of the Methodist Missionary Society under whose auspices Mr. Nishkomen has been working. When the reply of Dr. Sutherland, the Secretary of the Society, has been received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA. Vokelvey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWallaceburgh, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the schools on the Island were to be closed, and were, indeed, closed at 27th June, the summer holidays.\n\nAnd in accordance with instructions contained in your letter No. 157945...A., dated 16th July, I beg to inform you that the former teacher Mr. Smith has been dismissed from his duties and will continue the position till the 3rd September next, or till the end of the September quarter, before which time he will receive no compensation.\n\nHe was quite willing that the school should be closed, but (the present) teacher wished to be appointed as stipulated by the Government.\n\nThe subject of his wife and mother, I had him with me last week five days during the Christmas holidays (but) was always kept with me at intermediate times when they visited their nearest relatives and could not well go with me. I visited him (myself) and only let him go this afternoon because he had to give the school.\n\nI am now sorry that it became necessary to take the school away from him, having heard by him on several occasions that he was very much at the complaints against him being made in the interest of public morals, and because here the school seems like a lot of money that he had been carrying to carry, and they are so surely decided until the situation was brought and thought over a vacancy could be made whenever one of them (not half as good as this) could get.\nChurch which was to make a complaint that he had not a proper person to teach the school the former being that he was in the habit of getting drunk, instead of doing something to cheer himself or school days, and when they decided to get him out of the school he made complaints to the Indians and to the Department on the charge of drunkenness they began to press the parents mind and succeeded in such a way by designating the school that it was a question of a new teacher or close the school. Nevertheless he has been succeeded in convincing the Inspector. And the movement that he was a bad character in other ways than drinking, till there was nothing for it but to tell him he must give up the school and to give it at once as little man to be had as he was and is. But he signed and will not die. And while it will do him good, and therefore he has to have him if all hands are not taken from under him. And there are two hands which will try very hard to hold him in, as they have had to press the matter. We have him in the ground here done it for the best which purpose, upon once looking to the public morals part of the case, and where the young man Cornelius keeps his job with the No. 2 School (he could not be got) the Methodist Church people will not have the best man in the world to the lack of Indians.\nWilliam, Otter teacher of No. 3 School Walpole Island agrees to let his salary in the current quarter be postponed for the benefit of his wife. I think he had better serve a year of duty to Mr. McKeown to earn the salary. Yours Truly, [signature]\nOttawa, 27th August, 1900.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, and previous correspondence, I enclose herewith form of Power of Attorney for execution by William Peters to admit of his salary being paid to his wife.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Therefore we unhesitatingly say that he was ever diligent as a student and we believe he would be as a teacher. Systematic in his work, he is a sober young man and an earnest Christian.\n\nWe believe Mr. Joseph Sampson is thoroughly competent to conduct the school for which he now applies.\n\nTrusting you may see fit to do all that in your power lies to secure him the appointment.\n\nWe Remain\n\nYours very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSimmon W.

I am informed in the above described letter \"that in view of the statement made by Mr. Inspector Brown and myself, the Department has decided to dispense with his services, and owing to the recommendation made it may be allowed to continue in the position until the 30th September next.\"\n\nIn obedience to further directions contained in your above described letter, I have communicated the Inspector with regard to the appointment of a successor to take charge of the school from the first of October. I have also directed him to inform Mr. Peters that he would not be required to teach the school any longer than the 1st of October, and that his position in the school for the balance of this month is conditional on his allowing his salary for that month to be paid for the support of his wife and mother, to all of which he has consented, and will under his resignation before the end of the month relinquish such as teacher of the school.\n\nWith respect to the appointment of a successor, I beg to enclose herewith\nI wish to enclose herewith a note from Mr. Joseph Brown with regard to the application of Joseph Campbell to teach the school.\n\nJoseph Campbell is an orphan boy in the care of a single woman named Mrs. Peters. A teacher's note will be enclosed with the request that he be appointed to the position of teacher. I would also recommend him for a position here, well enough educated to teach and fit for Ontario in the highest degree.\n\nThere was a delay in the time of his application, which was not due to any fault of his own but to the fact that he did not apply to me until the educator had mentioned in his letter enclosed with the request (one) why it should not be advisable to appoint him, while in the case of the other applicant there will be no two parties and I hope he will be appointed, he will be able to get the attendance of scholars which is desirable.\n\nIf the appointment of Joseph Campbell meets your approval as successor to Mr. Peters, to take charge of the school from the 1st of October, please let me know so I can notify him to be prepared on that date.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAlex W.

I pray to state that up to the present time there has been no complaint about Joseph Thompson from any person except David Kay and his family. And only from them because they want the School for Cornelius and do not hesitate to follow the same course they have pursued with Mr. Potts for the last two years or more. And I beg to say that Joseph Thompson is a good well behaved young man, with a good record from his school home and from the families he has visited a boy of young man without a single bad habit.

Joseph Sampson draws no Chippewa annuity money.\n\n3. Several of the ratepayers have refused to send their children to this school on account of Sampson being the teacher.\n\n4.

Kelso\n\nApril 1st\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8ques et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nI beg to enclose herewith a petition addressed to the Hon. Minister of Indian Affairs Ottawa, relating to the present teacher of no. 3 school, Maple Leaf, giving reasons why he is not eligible to teach the school.\n\nThe first reason given under No. 1 is \"That Daniel Sanderson is a Potawatomi and should not be entitled to teach a Chippewa school, when there is a Chippewa in the district who is qualified to teach.\"\n\nWith objection.\n\nSecondly, Drama No. Chippewa annuity and several of the rate payers have refused to send their children to this school on account of Sanderson being the teacher.\n\nAnd under head of No. 5 it is said of a properly qualified Chippewa, such as Cornelius Henry, it taught this school, all of the children in the district would be sent to school.\n\nNow as to the first objection,\n\n\"Daniel Sanderson is a Potawatomi,\" answer. \"The Potawatomi school has been taught by a Chippewa teacher for the last seven or eight years, and is now being taught by a Chippewa while there are Potawatomi boys who are better qualified to teach than Cornelius Henry is.\"\nWith Affection,\n\nSmith Hampton does not draw Chipewa annuity-money. \"Wanted\" written here. Arthur Nicholson is the teacher of No. 2 Post School drawn into the Potawatomi mission.\n\nWith Affection, though have refused to send because Hampton is unwilling answer to this. None of the Parents of children of school age except two have signed this petition. This is until the Parents of 23 children to be heard from who have not signed the petition.\n\nNext under the heading of \"Note.\"\n\nIt is said if a properly qualified Chipewa such as Cornelius taught the school all of the children would attend. Answer to this Mr. Borden the Inspector said Smith was not satisfied to teach the school, and as he had applied, and Cornelius had not. And learning Cornelius and he the Inspector did notwithstanding to say, \"That he was well satisfied and on the straight path and by order of the Department he had engaged to teach and he had done as well as any boy could under the discouragement he has had to endure, as to what is said about East Bay as there are no East Bay or Walla Walla Indians.\"\n\nTo the Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. W. H. Kellogg\nEXTRACT from report of Mr Agent McKelvey on No.3 School, Walpole Island for month of December, 1900.\n\nThis school is now in very good shape to go on and prosper. All that is needed is to have the children that belong to the school attend it.\n\nThe feud between the David Kiyoshk party and those who are sending their children still exists. David has relaxed none of his determination to break the school or have his son placed in it as teacher.\n\nAs to the present teacher, he would do well with the school in a very short time if the parents would send their children, but is discouraged by the non-attendance. I have given notice of compulsory attendance after the holidays. Will I be supported if I attempt to enforce it.\n\nA. McK.\nOTTAWA, 16th January, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a petition from certain Indians of Walpole Island asking for the dismissal of the present teacher of No.3 school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no intention of dismissing the present teacher, Joseph Sampson, who is doing good work, and even should a vacancy occur, it would not give the position to Cornelius Kiyoshk, whom the petitioners evidently wish appointed. Kindly advise the Indians who signed the petition accordingly.\n\nIn reply to the enquiry contained in your report for last month on this school, I beg to say that you may use your own judgment about enforcing the regulations for compulsory attendance, and in this connection I have to refer you to Departmental letter of the 9th November last, relative to the opposition of David Kiyoshk.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have urged many times that children of school age who do not attend should not receive their annuities.\n\nYours truly,\nJohn Brebner\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter No. 525, \nDate 16th January, with regard to \nthe School Wallace Island, and \nwith regard to the chance of teachers \napplied for by some of the People \nliving in the vicinity of the School, \nin a Petition enclosed in my letter \nof the 10th January, and as mentioned \nby Mr. Brebner (two Inhabitants) in the \nSchool Note, \"Hope they will now be con-\nvinced of the futility of their attempts to \nget Cornfields into Nos. and Strictly Obeyed,\" \nI enclose the note from Mr. \nInspector Brebner, the latter part of \nwhich speaks of Cornfields of attendance \nand at the conclusion he suggests \nwithholding their Interest Money till \nit is proved that they have put in a certain \nnumber of days in each Quarterly \nSchool term of the Opinion that an order \nto that effect from the Department \nwould be obeyed. Without any \ndanger of it having to be put in force, \nI do not think David could with \nany decency act the Parent to \nkeep their children at home in the face \nof such an order.\n\nYours ever,\n[Signature]\n\nIn the Name of\nDepartment of\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n[Signature]\nEx'd.\n\nOTTAWA, 16th February, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing a communication from Mr. Inspector Maclean recommending the withholding of annuities from Indians who do not send their children to school; and in reply I beg to say that you have already been authorized put the regulations for the compulsory attendance of Indian school at school, in force in your Agency, and the Department thinks that if you do so, it will have the desired effect of compelling the Indians to send their children to school.\n\nI may add that the Regulations in question do not provide for the withholding of annuities, the penalty provided being for fine or imprisonment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The Department would like to whether Muskojeman obtained any authority from you to use the schoolhouse for such purpose, and unless he has done so he should be notified that this practice must cease at once.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.B. McDougall, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nWallaceburg, Ont.:\nWalpole Island Oct 25th 1897\n\nSecretary Dept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 152945 dated 9th inst. reporting complaint of School Master that there has been only one entertainment held in this school house that I know of and did not know anything about it until the day before when one of the trustees Peter Thomas came to me and wanted to know if the school house could be used for that purpose. I told him that I did not know what the law was regarding Indian schools but that if the teacher felt he could hold any entertainments in the school house the teacher or Mr. Thomas came to see me about the matter. He said that Mr. John Barlow, a respectable citizen of St. Lambton had consented to bring a phonograph and give an entertainment to the children charging a fee of 10 cents each and giving half the proceeds to the children for the purpose of purchasing a football for use in the summer at school as the weather was cold and the council house quite a distance from the children so he thought that there would be no objections which was the reason that he had not consulted any person about the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nI told him that I did not know for sure who controlled the school houses, the chief and council or the agent, that if the chief had no objections I would not object as all arrangements had been made and it would be a disappointment to the children if they were not carried out from this end. I will tell you that the school houses are not used for any other purpose but for school. If it had been any of the other teachers I do not think their words would have any objections raised. The whole thing is a little while work. Misfortune was prevalent at the agricultural fair held here last fall and he strongly objected to Peter Shores one of the trustees holding a public dance in a field adjoining the fair grounds in opposition to a concert held by the band today and he thought it a good time to settle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

However, due to the weather conditions, it was found that the whole of the plants might as well be replaced at once as they had all come up. It would be difficult to fix the plants where it was entirely off, and make any kind of a job of it. So it was decided to take them out and plant them anew at the time the school house was built. It was late in the fall, and the plants had evidently been frozen before it got dry, hence the coming off.\n\nThe blackboard had been condemned frequently by the students as too small; it was also cleared over the end of the school room, and there just five inches wide.\n\nThe work was ordered by the Chief and Council before it was commenced, and finished and delivered by them after it was finished. I feel so confident that it is a good job well done, and may be used for many years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Superintendent\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the enclosed letter from the Department, including Cheque No. 14, dated 27th June, for \u00a36.50, in payment of his account for whitewashing and scrubbing the school house, and for whitewashing water closets, painting the same, and repainting fences around the school grounds.\n\nAccount for which together with copy of Resolution of Chipewa Council authorizing the Raymond & Co.

The old ones being made of such lumber are badly built and have become loose so that the movement of each pupil in front of the desk causes the seat to squeak. We think the pupil who is trying to work is scarcely able to do so, as for fixing these seats, they have been given away recently and should be replaced. The cost of the seat \"factory made\" which were put in the other schools and which have given most satisfaction, was about $5.00 each, which included seat and back, and there could easily be fitted seven on each side when would be $35.00 before putting them down about $5.00 more or say all told inside of $60.00.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nAre funds available to the extent of $50 for the purchase and putting up of desks for the Walpole Island No.3 school.\nOTTAWA, 25th July, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant reporting upon the necessity for procuring new seats and desks for the Walpole Island No. 3 school; and in reply I beg to say that you may purchase the 14 seats and desks required, the cost of which, together with carriage and putting in position should not exceed your estimate of $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Kelving Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWallaceburg,\nOnt.\nTHE\n\nSnider Automatic Desk.\n\nBeauty, Strength, Durability, Comfort, Convenience.\n\nSTRICTLY UP-TO-DATE IN EVERY RESPECT.\n\nMade in six sizes of Single, Double and Double Separate Desks. Rears and Fronts to correspond to each size. Made by\n\nJohn B. Snider,\n\nWATERLOO, ONT.\nTHE Snider Automatic Desk.\n\nThe Interlocking Method of Fastening the wood to the Cast Standards has the merits of the Dovetail fastening without any of its disadvantages. It is the most perfect fastening for combining wood and iron that has yet been discovered. Holds the wood firmly from one end to the other without the aid of bolts, keys or wedges. Desk cannot get loose or work out of form. Easy to set up.\n\nWOODS\u2014For Seat and Back, Selected Maple Finished Natural; Top, Sycamore, Stained Dark, Which Makes a Very Fine Contrast, All Thoroughly Air Seasoned and Kiln Dried.\n\nAll woods put together with Tongue and Groove Joint, which gives large glueing surface and makes a solid back, seat and top.\n\nNarrow Slats, giving perfect curves for seat and back. Planed and sanded into perfect form. Finished in best grade Hard Oil.\n\nThe Automatic Hinge is About the Most Ingenious Contrivance Yet Produced.\n\nThe seat is so hinged that the least pressure of the body in rising will cause it to fold back, and in sitting down the least touch will cause it to fold down. Not necessary to step out in the aisle in rising or sitting down.\n\nSolid Hub. Trunion joint. A part of the main casting.\n\nLARGE BEARINGS.\n\nNo strain on the bolt whatever. It is not necessary in getting up or sitting down to touch the seat with the hands, as it works perfectly automatic.\n\nTHE RUBBER BUFFERS\n\nWhich form the stops and rests for the seat, are the Best Hard Rubber pressed into position in taper sockets, therefore becoming tight instead of loose by wear, as is the case in most seats.\n\nIt is absolutely noiseless and will remain so.\n\nCASTINGS\u2014Best Grade of Pig Iron Used.\n\nDesigned to give the greatest strength by a uniform distribution of the iron, so there is no undue strain which causes so many castings to crack. This point should not be overlooked.\n\nThe Castings are artistically designed. Best grade Baking Japan finish. Flush top, air tight inkwells in all sizes of desks.\nTeachers' Desks\n\n**No. 60.**\nFlat Top. Antique Oak, Ash or Walnut. 52 inches long and 32 inches wide. Top veneered with quartered sycamore and polished.\n\n**No. A1.**\n26x50 inches. In Oak inclined plane, raised centre fine finish, centre tray, two drawers with locks and keys.\n\n**No. A4.**\n26x44 inches. Made in selected Red Oak, paneled back, inclined wood top, two drawers with locks and keys.\nIf Interested in Office or Church Furniture, Write for Special Catalogue.\nDouble Entire Desk\nFor Two Scholars. Made in Six Sizes.\n\nDouble Separate Desk\nMade in Six Sizes. Allowing One Pupil to Stand at Desk Without Disturbing Companion.\nRears and Fronts to Match all Sizes.\nIN ORDERING SCHOOL DESKS\n\nSpecify plainly the number of each size desk wanted, and whether single or double. If double, state whether entire or individual seats are wanted. Give address of party to whom you wish the goods shipped, distinctly, stating name of R. R. Station, County, number of S. S. and Post Office.\n\nSee that a majority of the members of the School Board sign the contract.\n\nState a definite time when you wish the goods to be shipped and a definite time when you wish to pay for them. In short, see that everything relating to the contract is plain (not to be misconstrued) according to law and correct business principles. Accuracy promotes good-will amongst business men.\n\nCompliance with above suggestions will make it possible for us to serve you without annoying you with otherwise necessary correspondence.\n\nOUR AIM IS TO PLEASE AND SATISFY OUR PATRONS.\n\nAll goods are securely packed and delivered on board the cars, free of charge, and particular attention is given to the securing of lowest possible freight rates.\n\nAll necessary screws, etc., for setting up and fastening to floor, accompany each shipment.\n\nSTANDARD DIMENSIONS OF SEATS AND DESKS.\n\nSingle Seats and Desks for one Pupil.\n\n| SIZE | Seat, Inches High | Seat, Inches Wide | Desk Top, Inches Long | Height to Top of Desk from floor in inches | Inches from Desk to Desk | Average Age of Pupils Suitable for these Seats |\n|------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| No. 1 | 18               | 12               | 23                    | 29                                       | 28                      | 16 to 21                                      |\n| No. 2 | 17               | 12               | 23                    | 28                                       | 27                      | 13 to 18                                      |\n| No. 3 | 16               | 12               | 23                    | 27                                       | 26                      | 11 to 15                                      |\n| No. 4 | 14               | 11               | 21                    | 26                                       | 24                      | 9 to 13                                       |\n| No. 5 | 13               | 11               | 21                    | 25                                       | 22                      | 7 to 10                                       |\n| No. 6 | 12               | 11               | 21                    | 24                                       | 21                      | 5 to 7                                        |\n\nDouble Seats and Desks for two Pupils.\n\n| SIZE | Seat, Inches High | Seat, Inches Wide | Desk Top, Inches Long | Height to Top of Desk from floor in inches | Inches from Desk to Desk | Average Age of Pupils Suitable for these Seats |\n|------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| No. 1 | 18               | 12               | 40                    | 29                                       | 28                      | 16 to 21                                      |\n| No. 2 | 17               | 12               | 40                    | 28                                       | 27                      | 13 to 18                                      |\n| No. 3 | 16               | 12               | 40                    | 27                                       | 26                      | 11 to 15                                      |\n| No. 4 | 14               | 11               | 37                    | 26                                       | 24                      | 9 to 13                                       |\n| No. 5 | 13               | 11               | 37                    | 25                                       | 22                      | 7 to 10                                       |\n| No. 6 | 12               | 11               | 37                    | 24                                       | 21                      | 5 to 7                                        |\n\nSchool Boards will find the above Tables correct and valuable.

I found that only two pupils had attended from February 2nd until April the 2nd, and for the 3 weeks immediately preceding my visit there had been no school at all.\n\n5th. The teacher reports that she has been present at the school-house to attend to her duties, but having no children to teach.\n\n6th. The people on the Reserve complain that the teacher has not done her duty towards the scholars. She seemed to have lost all interest in the working of the school and thus, they claim, accounts...\nfor the small number of pupils who attended.\n\nAs this teacher was hired by my predecessor in Office I await orders as to what I shall do concerning the school for the coming year.\n\nOn the whole I would report the school as being very unsatisfactory to all concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nCharles Harlow,\nAgt.\n\n\"The Secretary,\"\n\"Department of Indian Affairs,\"\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 23rd May, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on the New Germany school.

I received a letter from the teacher February the 18th, but she did not give me the date that she closed the school. She said on account of sickness she had to give up the school.\n\nI waited thinking she would be able to commence the school again until I heard that she was not going to teach again. I have been trying to get a teacher for the school but have not yet succeeded. I have written to Mrs. Foster in the province to know if they knew of any teacher that would take the school but have not heard from her. Will refer to you soon if I can get a teacher.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharles Walton\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 25, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th inst., I beg to say that you should communicate with Miss Hawkesworth, if you know her whereabouts, and ascertain definitely the date on which she closed the New Germany school.\n\nIt would be advisable also for you to write to the Public School Inspector for the county with a view to securing the services of a teacher for this school, in order that it may be opened as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nCharles Harlow, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaledonia,\nQueen's County,\nN.S.\nNeogdak\nAntigonish Co.,\nN.S.\nJuly 18th 76\n\nCharles Harlow, Esq.,\nCaledonia Corner,\nQueens Co., N.S.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLearning through Mr. Walsh, Chester, that you are \"Indian Agent\" for Indian Reserve in Lunenburg Co., I beg to apply for same.\n\nI am a D.

Mr. Harlow is to be congratulated on securing the services of one so efficient. I visited the school, remaining an hour and a half, and was well pleased with the manner in which the pupils present acquitted themselves, showing that correct methods are being used to instruct them. In this connection, I wish to say that I think it would be well if the Department would insist on the employment of only Normal School graduates as teachers in Indian Schools. Their professional training gives them a distinct advantage over other teachers, as may be readily observed by any one in a position to note, and compare results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.J.

If, however, she does not wish to continue the school, you are authorized to engage Miss Gillis at an initial salary of $300.00 per annum.\n\nBe good enough to attend to this matter at once and report to the Department the action taken.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharles Harlow, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaledonia,\nQueen's Co.,\nN.S.\n\nSecretary.\nMary A.

Gillis,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn your report on the New Germany school for the current year you state that the attendance is very irregular owing to the lack of interest taken by the parents in the school.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether you make it a part of your duty to visit the parents in their homes and impress upon them the necessity of their taking advantage of the facilities provided for the education of their children, and also whether you have any suggestions to offer as to ways and means of procuring a better attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Mary A.

Freeman\nSir,\n\nMy school report for 1912-13 contains the following:\n\n\"New Germany School,\nLunenburg Co.\n\nThis school was closed when I went to inspect on the 11th. ultimo. I called on the teacher and asked her to explain the situation, when, to my surprise, she stated that it was customary for the families sending children to school to furnish the fuel gratis, each in turn; that the family whose turn it was then, had defaulted; and that, as a consequence, she had to close the school for the time being. Another result of this unique arrangement, that a couple of families made it a point to keep their children at home during the cold weather season, in order to avoid the responsibility of contributing to the fuel supply. I forthwith engaged one\" (I should have said very two) \"of the residents of the place, for a moderate consideration, to furnish the school with fuel, and to act as janitor, for the remainder of the school term. Recently the teacher wrote me that under the new order of things the attendance of pupils had considerably improved.\n\nI hope the above will sufficiently explain\n\nthe\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

I am returning the certificate herewith.\n\nWith reference to the janitor I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of somebody to do this work and will allow a salary of $25.00 per annum payable quarterly. The arrangement for supplying the fuel apparently is not satisfactory and it is considered advisable for the Department to pay for the wood. You will be good enough, therefore, to advise the Agent accordingly and ask him to instruct the janitor as to his duties, which will include keeping the school-room clean and lighting the fires in the winter season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.D.

Her resignation, however, is accepted, but we would prefer that, if possible, she remain and complete the balance of the school year. If she is not able to complete the present school year, this school will have to remain closed during the month of June, as it will hardly be possible to obtain the services of a teacher for that time.\n\nI also acknowledge the application of Mrs. Rose L. Ford, at present teacher of the New Germany Indian Day School, to be transferred to succeed Miss McGinty at Bear River. This transfer to take effect when the schools reopen after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next. Mrs. Ford should remain at New Germany and complete the present school year at that point. In making this transfer Mrs. Ford will be allowed salary at the rate of $450 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.

Scott,\n\nYou might let me know what the practice is in connection with the appointment of teachers at Indian Day Schools. I require this information to reply to a communication received from Mr. Wm. Duff, M.P., for Lunenburg, who complains that he was not consulted in connection with the appointment of Mrs. E.M. Penny, who is the teacher at the New Germany Indian Day School in Lunenburg County.\n\nThe information given in your memorandum of March 28th to the effect that the last return received for the quarter ended December 31st last, showed an enrolment of 8 pupils and an average attendance of 7 at the above mentioned school was submitted to Mr. Duff and he states in reply that his information is to the effect that although we are employing a teacher and pay her $500 a year, there are no Indian children on the New Germany Indian Reserve to go to the school.\n\nKindly let me have a further report in connection with the above in order that we may be in a position to make a definite reply to Mr. Duff.\n\nJ.T. Heatherston\nApril 20, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Featherston,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum of April 13th, dealing with the appointment of day school teachers, I have pleasure in informing you that as our school system is denominational, the appointment of day school teachers has never been considered a matter for political patronage. Very infrequently teachers have been recommended by Members of Parliament and have been appointed, but the instances in which the Department has applied to Members of Parliament for nominations have been extremely rare. Some schools require Roman Catholic teachers, some schools Methodist teachers, some schools Anglican teachers; that is to say the religious belief of the majority of the pupils governs the appointment of the teacher.\n\nWhen the present Civil Service Act came into force I purposely did not hand over the appointment of the teachers to the Commission, and we continued to conduct our policy in the well established fashion, and I see no reason, in fact there is every objection, to altering it. If we were to hand it over to the Civil Service Commission, I would immediately suggest that the appointment of day school teachers be exempted from the operation of the Civil Service Act.\n\nIn view of the contradictory reports received with reference to the operation of this school, I think that it would be well to have a special report from our Agent or Superintendent and I propose to ask for it.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 18, 1923.\n\nMemorandum -\n\nMR. D. G. SCOTT:\n\nReferring to the correspondence from Mr. Duff M.P., with regard to the appointment of Mrs. Penney as day school teacher at the New Germany Indian School (Lunenburg Co.). Please refer the report of the Department's Agent or Supt. (which you are asking for) with reference to the operation of this school, together with your remarks to this office when the same is received.\n\nWith regard to the general question of appointment of day school teachers (domestications) - it is considered desirable that the name of the proposed appointee should be submitted to this office for approval before the actual appointment is made.\n\nJ. C. Featherston.\nSir,\n\nIt seems it is hardly given an opinion to admit that the expenses are high for the sake of 5 or 6 children but at the same time they are receiving an education which will mean a lot to them in years to come.\n\nWhat steps could be taken to move the families from Black Hill, Gold River, Poveshull, Dearsdale, etc., would settle everything.\n\nIn the meanwhile I am working with the Police Dept. of the S.P.C.A. & Health to improve these conditions on this reserve; I will report any action taken towards improving conditions here & am assured that as noted in your letter the first of this month your dept. will assume responsibility for expenses incurred.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Stanley Christie\n\nM.D.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nAND\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\n99-5-1923\n\nSir,\n\nI visited the Mohawk Reserve at\n\nScarsdale Township on May 23rd. I found\n\nthree families settled there, but they seem to be getting\n\nalong nicely although they have only a few acres under\n\ncultivation.\n\nI inspected the school and found it in fair\n\ncondition. The roof will have to be repaired this\n\nsummer as it is leaking in two places.\n\nThe blackboards need repainting & there is\n\none broken window.\n\nThere were seven pupils in attendance at the time\n\nof my visit. One family with children of school age\n\nlived near the school but was not seen during\n\nthe district. I did not take any action to compel their\n\nattendance.\n\nMrs. Penny, the teacher, is in my opinion quite\n\ncapable and is doing just properly attending to her\n\nduties. Any complaints you have had are not\n\njustified, I believe.\n\nReference to keeping the school open next\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn March, last, the member for Lunenburg County made inquiry regarding the expenditure for school purposes in connection with the New Germany Indian Day School and also regarding the attendance and the services being performed by the teacher. These matters were referred to the Indian Agent J. Stanley Hutchison, Esq., D., and he reports as follows: \"There were 7 children in attendance at the time of my visit. Mrs. Penny, the teacher, is in my opinion quite capable and is, I am sure, properly attending to her duties. Any complaints you have had are not, I think, correct or justified.\"\n\nThe agent states that it is hard to form an opinion regarding the keeping open of this school next year for the sake of 5 or 6 children, but at the same time they are receiving an education, which will benefit them in years to come. A few repairs are required to the roof; the blackboard needs repainting and there is one broken window.\n\nFrom returns received, there appears to have been a regular attendance by the children on the reserve, and if this school was closed I do not know where we could arrange to have the children sent. Consideration is now being given to moving certain families from Beech Hill and Gold River to this reserve. They have large families and if this was done it would add to the number of children who would attend.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether you would approve of this school being continued for another year and the slight repairs required carried out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

F. PENNEY, J.P.\n\nNew Germany, N.S., March 6, 1895\n\nCharles Stewart\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn looking over the annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs, I notice an expenditure for the education of the Indian children on the Indian Reserve at New Germany, Lunenburg County, N.S. It is stated in said report that there are 4 boys and 6 girls attending school on said reserve under the heading of Indian affairs. This would naturally lead the reader to believe that the above mentioned children attending said school where Indians or Half-Breeds. This is not so; there is not one Indian child in said school. Neither is there one Half-Breed there all white children. Therefore the writer takes this as a matter of public interest and feels it his duty to inform you with the facts regarding the Indian Reserve in Lunenburg County. The facts are as follows: The Indian Reserve of one thousand acres is inhabited solely by white people who do not pay one cent of taxes. Have free school, free land, free use of the public highway, right of way, tax on all other property of the surrounding country. This in the writer's opinion is not British policy and should not be tolerated by a government whose hall of deliberation the British flag floats. However, stated if there is any doubt in your mind about the correctness of this statement you can have it verified by witness under oath, or you can consult William Huff, Esq., for Lunenburg County, trusting this will give you an idea how Indian affairs are handled over to white folks awaiting your early reply. I am Yours for British policy.\n\nJacob F. Penney\nOttawa, March 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has been informed that there is not an Indian child in attendance at the New Germany Indian Day School, but that, of the number enrolled, they are all children of either white or half-breed parents. The last return received from the teacher shows that there are ten children in attendance, viz., 5 boys and 5 girls, whose names and ages are as follows:\n\nSusan Marie Beeler, 13; Elmer Douglas Penney, 8;\nAnnie Louisa, 11; Oscar Lamont, 6;\nJohn Howard, 8; John Laurie, 5;\nCarrie Vera, 5; Madalyn Marie Zinok, 8;\nAgnes Verna, 5; John Freeman Pictou, 10.\n\nYou should state the names of the parents of each of the above children and whether they are bona fide Indians or white, or half-breeds. The Department is not responsible for the education of white or half-breed children, and if, as reported, there are no Indian children in attendance, the Department cannot continue operating the school. We note that the last census return shows that there are 30 Indians belonging to the New Germany Reserve. The Department desires a full report regarding the status of the children who are attending the New Germany School, and it is expected that you will give full and definite information regarding each child whose name appears on the school register.\n\nWe are further informed that the reserve is inhabited solely by white people and that not a bona fide Indian is residing thereon. You should give the Department facts regarding this statement.\n\nYour early reply is desired,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. S. Chisholm, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the New Germany Indian Day School. We note your statement that, of the children who are in attendance at this school, not one is a bona fide Indian child; but that they are either white or half-breed children. The last quarter return which we received from the teacher shows an enrolment of 10 children - 5 boys and 5 girls. The names and ages of the children are given as follows:\n\nSusan Marie Beeler, 13; Elmer Douglas Penney, 8;\nAnnie Louisa, 11; Oscar Lamont, 6;\nJohn Howard, 8; John Laurie, 5;\nCarrie Vera, 5; Madalyn Marie Zinok, 8;\nAgnes Verna, 5; John Freeman Pictou, 10.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will examine the above list and be good enough to state the names of the parents and whether they are Indians, half-breeds or whites. I may state further that the last census return shows that there were a total of 30 Indians belonging to the New Germany Reserve. We are making other enquiries regarding the status of the children who attend the New Germany School, but will be pleased to have further information from you as requested above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nJ. F. PENNEY, J.P.\n\nNew Germany, N.S. March 16, 1925\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nCanada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 12, 1925, asking for further information in respect to the lineage of the children named in your letter, as pupils attending the so-called Indian School on the Indian Reserve at New Germany, Lunenburg County. First in order are the five Beeler children all of one family; the grand-father of the Beeler children is a white man. The grand-mother of the Beeler children had a small portion of Indian blood in her veins. The mother of the Beeler children is a white woman sprung from English stock, and the father of the Beeler children has a white father. So you can readily notice that the children could not be Indians nor the half breed. For greater brevity, and are white children with scarcely any Indian blood in their veins. The child Madeline Maria Finch is a white child, the three Penney children spring from the same stock as the others, and there is not a drop of Indian blood in them. The only child attending the above mentioned school that can claim a right to be educated by the Government of Canada is the Dita child and he belongs to the county of Annapolis. Whether he is an Indian Reserve for the Indians of said county, therefore the tax payers of Lunenburg considers it an outrage for the Government of Canada to furnish the white inhabitants on the Indian Reserve with free school, free land, free road, free bedding, free house for teacher and his three children, free fuel for said house, free medical attendance, and at death a free burial.\nJ. F. PENNEY, J.P.\n\nNew Germany, N.S.,\n\nI may further say for your information that the present teacher at the school is Miss Frank Penney who is at present doing a good barber business in the village of New Germany and the three Penney children at school on the Indian Reserve are the sons of Frank Penney and his wife is their mother and teacher at the above mentioned School.\n\nTrusting this will be a satisfactory answer to your inquiry and that you will give this very important matter your prompt attention and if you find my statement is based on facts you can your self accordingly, and by so doing you will do a great public service.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJacob Penney\nOttawa, March 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to draw your attention to official letter of the 12th instant, relative to the status of the children who attend the New Germany Indian Day School. I shall be pleased to have your reply, giving the information asked for in the letter above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. S. Chisholm, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nOttawa, May 15th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to draw your attention to official letters of March 12th and 30th, last, requesting you to furnish a report as to the status of the children who attend the New Germany Indian Day School.\n\nIt is necessary to have definite information as to whether these children are Indians, whites or half-breeds, in order that the department can come to a decision as to the continuance of the school next year, and it is expected that you will give at once the particulars asked for in our letter of the 12th of March, last. Full information should be given regarding each child in attendance, and also as to whether there are any Indians residing on the Reserve or not. Your further neglect in replying to this communication will receive the serious attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. Chisholm, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to yours of the 30-3-25 re No 42-1-1 re New Germany School, I can inform you that of the students there one is pure Mohican from an half-breed but do not know whether his father is Mohican or white. This will certainly let you know in a few days as I intend making my quarterly call this week & will get parents names. The balance of the pupils from five are white.\n\nJ.S. Chisholm\nAgent Lunenburg Co. NS\n\nP.S. If the child's father is an Mohican the children are looked on as Mohicans. So this correct as some of the half-breeds have I believe Mohican fathers.\n\nJ.S.C.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the status of the children who are in attendance at the New Germany Indian Day School. We note that you intend making a visit to this Reserve and will report definitely as to whether these children are Indians, whites or half-breeds.\n\nI may say for your information that a child takes the status of the father, i.e., if the father is an Indian the child is classed as an Indian. If, however, the father is a white man the child is classed as white. It would appear from your letter that there is only one bona fide Indian child in attendance, and in that case serious consideration will have to be given to the closing of the school at the end of the present school year, as we are not responsible for providing education for white children or half-breeds. We will, however, await a further report from you before definitely deciding the matter, and will be pleased to have same after you have visited the Reserve. If there are a number of whites residing on the Reserve, you should state by whose authority and under what circumstances they are doing so. Your early reply giving full information is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. S. Chisholm, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nIndian Reserve, May 25th\n\nTo the\nHead Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nMessrs. Gentlemen:\n\nI am going to write you\nwith reference to the Indian Reserve near New\nGermany in Lunenburg County N.S.\n\nAs I live on the Reserve myself and married\na Penney girl born & bred on the Reserve I should\nknow something about the place, I do not understand\nhow we people can have a free school and no taxes\nof any kind where there are no Indians. If any\ngentleman visit the Reserve and see if they can\nfind any Indians, the school teacher at present,\nis married to Frank C. Penney who is also born\non the Reserve and has a house here, while his wife\nthe teacher of this place gets her wood free, and no doubt\na large salary for teaching. The government also pays\nfor the cleaning of the school house and the wood that\nis burned there and yet there are no Indians. The\nfirst settler of this place was John Hammond\nhe was only half Indian his daughters married\nwhite men and from stories down to the 4th\ngeneration all married whites so I can't understand why this place can't be sold and the people put under taxation the same as other places and then what we have we could call our own. The people of the Reserve cannot talk the Indian language with the exception of John Bartlett who came here some years ago, and James Hammond a native of this place but sold out his right and only lives here part of the time, and John Patten from Armadale County and his wife & child who just came in this place for the winter as you see they don't belong to this Reserve whatever. I think the people whom are in favor of this place being an Indian Reserve, and free schools are the very ones that are getting good salaries out of the government so I am just writing to put you wise with the topic of this place and ask if you can't have it settled.\n\nGeorge H. Zink\nScarsdale P.O., Indian Reserve.\n\nP.S. If you doubt my statement written here kindly refer to Jacob F. Penney and W. Hamm both of New Germany and also Councillors.\nOttawa, May 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, relative to the New Germany Indian Reserve and the status of the children who attend the day school which is being conducted at that point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have requested the local Indian Agent to furnish a report as to whether the families residing on this Reserve are bona fide Indians, whites or half-breeds. We have already had communications from Jacob F. Penney regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. George H. Zink,\nScaredale P.O.,\nLunenburg Co.,\nN.S.\nF. D. McLean Esq.,\nOttawa, Canada\n\n(Answer to letter No. 42-1-1, 15-5-23)\n\nI visited the New Germany reserve in May 1924. I am in position to verify the facts given in my last letter to you.\n\nPure Indians living on the Reserve are:\nJames Hammond - Property Holder\nJohn Pictou - Property Holder\nFrank McLeod\nJohn Bartlett - Property Holders living together\nJohn Penall - Property Holder\n\nChildren attending school are:\nJohn Freeman Pictou - Pure Indian\nSusan Marie Beeler\nAmelia Louise Beeler\nJohn Howard Beeler\nCarrie Verna Beeler\nJennie Elizabeth Beeler\nAgnes Verna Beeler\nMachelyn Marie Beeler - half breed, adopted child of George Beeler\nFather Indian & mother a breed.\n\nThere are also three or four children of the teacher Mrs. Penny.\nSir,\n\nwho are white.\n\nThe teacher Mrs. Penny tells me the nearest school is about six miles distant.\n\nThe Beal's children are more Indian than white, although the father is not a pure Indian so it would be a pity in some respects to close this school as it would mean that none of them would be educated.\n\nHowever, that is for the Department to decide.\n\nI trust this information will be satisfactory.\n\nJ.S.

McLean,\nOttawa,\nN.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter received yesterday; am pleased to know you have had communications with Jacob F. Penney. The Indian Agent has been on the Reserve last month, he went to the school-house and as school was out at the time, the teacher went from her house down and met him at the school-house I cannot say what these business was but he didn't visit any other place on the Reserve. I cannot understand why we can't have this place paid for the same as any other place, as the roads here are far from good and no Indians or even Half-breds here so if the government are not going to have it changed I would like to have some title by which I can sell out as the position it is in now, we cannot sell and give anybody a title of the land over.\nhoping this will rally fixed up soon so we can call our land our own and perhaps we can have a road that will be like the other places will close.\n\nGeorge H Zink\nScarsdale P.O.\nL.Burg County\n\n76.8\nSir,\n\nMay I also at well as George Finch a man whose home is 10 miles from here also Jacques Penney 7 miles from here who is trying to cause disturbance on our Reserve leave us John Pierson, Jack Bartlett Howard Rele (last name Howard) Fosse and Mary Paul Mary Ellen Hammond James Hammond Frank MacLeod\nJoe Penall and half-breeds are the rest, & heirs of John Hammond and Jim Hammond.

J. Stanley Chisholm, M.D.\nAgent.\nCommunications have been received protesting against the Department continuing the day school on the New Germany Indian Reserve, Dunsman Co., S.S., and providing for the cost of its maintenance and payment of the teacher's salary. It is stated in these letters that there is not a bona fide Indian living on the Reserve, with the exception of one family (John Pietou) who moved there last winter from Minneapolis Co. On the other hand, petitions have been received signed by a number of the residents in which they request that they be left alone and the present arrangements continued.\n\nIt would appear that through intermarriage with whites over a long term of years practically all traces of Indian blood have been lost.\n\nJacob N. Penney, who is a Justice of the Peace, and has land on the Reserve, in a letter to the Honourable The Minister, states as follows:\n\n\"In looking over the annual report of the Department, I notice an expenditure for the education of Indian children on the Indian Reserve at New Germany. It is stated in said report there are 14 boys and 6 girls at school. This would naturally lead the reader to believe that these children are Indians or half-breeds. This is not so. There is not one Indian child in said school. Neither is there one half-breed. They are all white children. The Indian Reserve of 1300 acres is inhabited solely by white people, who do not pay one cent of taxes, have free land, free use of the public highway, free school.\"\n\nHe further states that if there is any doubt as to the correctness of his statement it can be verified by witness under oath.\n\nGeorge H. Zink, who resides on the Reserve, states as follows:\n\n\"As I live on the Reserve myself and am married to a Penney girl, born and bred on the Reserve, I should know something about the place. Let any gentleman visit the Reserve and see if they can find any Indians. I cannot understand why this place cannot be sold and the people put under taxation.\"\n\nHe further states that he would like to sell out, but as the position is now he cannot sell and give anybody a title to the land.\nOur Agent, Dr. Chisholm, Mahone Bay, to whom this matter was referred, after being written on three occasions, finally reports that several of the families living on the Reserve are Indians. Judging from his letter, he has not enquired very carefully into the matter and has taken very little interest in ascertaining the facts as to the status of the residents on the Reserve.\n\nThe census of 1924 shows that there were 30 Indians on the Reserve, as follows:\n\n- Under 6 years - 2\n- 6 to 15 - 7\n- 16 to 20 - 14\n- 21 to 65 - 4\n\nThe school has an enrolment of 10 children - 5 boys and 5 girls. I am of the opinion that as long as this Reserve is organized as such, the Department is responsible for the providing of education, although the people residing therein are through intermarriage practically white, and I should like to have your ruling as to whether the school is to be continued or not. The nearest white school to the Reserve is stated to be 6 miles distant.\n\nIt would further appear from the facts that consideration should be given to the enfranchisement of the families living on this Reserve.\n\nA blue print is hereunder showing the locates.\n\nRussell V. Farrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, July 15th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to previous correspondence regarding the status of the children who are in attendance at the New Germany Indian Day School, I beg to say that after fully considering this matter it has been decided to continue the school for the new school year ending June 30, 1926. The Department is of opinion that as long as this Reserve is organized as such it is responsible for the providing of education, although the people residing thereon are, through intermarriage, practically white.\n\nIt is intended to have an official visit the Reserve during the course of the year and make a recommendation as to what future action he would advise be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

After being aware of the facts regarding the matter in question, this is a serious matter and calls for prompt action by the Board that be. Had we a Joseph Howe or a George Brown or a Ryerson in the public life of Canada today, and the facts known to me, I have every reason from reading the history of those men to believe the public would get redress in the earliest possible moment. But instead of men such as those, we have men that seem to be afraid to do right. Where are we going to land financially if Lunenburg County is a sample of the public business of the Dominion of Canada. This you may find strong language but the matter in question is of such vital importance to the taxpayers that these interests cannot be expressed in milder language. Trusting you will be consider this matter and in justice to your public trust and British fair play to all concerned, stamp out this outrage on the public funds of Canada once and for all at the earliest possible moment awaiting your earliest reply.

PENNEY, J.P.\n\nNew Germany, N.S., July 18\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th, sentence carefully noted, and in reply would say I greatly disappoind to learn that your department intend to continue the school on the Indian Reserve at New Germany, Lunenburg after learning all the facts in connection therewith over six months ago. This I consider an outrage on the public funds of Canada. It was bad enough to have a school last year when all the facts were not explained to your department but it is still worse this year with the Bealer children moved to other quarters and the three Penney children and their mother the present teacher leaving her husband living in a school section where there is a graded school and going to the Indian Reserve with her three children in order to draw public funds and get clothin for white men and women and bedding and foot ware. This in the writer's humble opinion is an outrage on the public treasury of Canada and should not be tolerated by men who have been intrusted with the safeguarding of the\nJuly 24th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant relative to the continuing of the New Germany Indian Day School, and in reply to state that the same has been noted.\n\nAs you were advised in our letter of the 15th instant it is the intention to have an Official of the Department visit the Reserve during the course of the year and make full enquiry into the status of the families who reside on the Reserve, and to recommend what future action he would advise be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Penney, Esq., J.P.,\nNew Germany, N.S.\nJuly 24th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to conversation had with you during your recent visit to the Department regarding the status of the families who reside on the New Germany Indian Reserve and the matter of the continuing of school facilities, I have to request that you will, upon the occasion of your next visit to this Reserve, enquire fully into the status of each family and ascertain whether they are Indians, Half-Breeds or Whites. As you are aware from the correspondence which you read, there have been protests against the Department continuing the expense of conducting a school. It would appear that through intermarriage with whites for a long term of years practically all trace of Indian blood has been lost. We have authorized the continuing of the school for another year, as we are of the opinion that during such time as this Reserve is organized as such the Department is responsible for the providing of education although the people residing therein may be practically white.\n\nPlease furnish a report on each family stating whether they are Indians or Whites and also furnish a full recommendation as to what action you would advise be taken in continuing the school or in arranging for the enfranchisement of the people or any other solution of the problem which you are of the opinion should be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

You will note that it was decided at that time to keep it in operation for the academic year that is now ended. I have lately received Mr. Inspector Boyd's report, which reads in part as follows: \"Pupils who attended the school at New Germany the past term were not Indians at all, but the children of white parents, and therefore the Department should be no longer responsible for its maintenance. As a matter of fact, the permanent residents of this reserve are not Indians.\" In view of these facts, the school should be closed and you should so inform Mrs. Penney, who was the teacher last year.\n\nYou should make an inventory of the equipment that is in the school and teacher's residence, indicating its condition, and see that all Department property is properly placed under lock and key until you receive further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I note your remarks that the pupils who attend the New Germany Indian Day School are children of white parents and that the permanent residents of the reserve are not Indians. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Chisholm, instructing him that the school is to be closed indefinitely and I am also directing that no further relief be granted to those on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Maclean, Esq.,\nSecretary to Chief Deputy,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing you in reference to your letter of Aug. 17th, 1926 No. 42-1-1 in which the following statement from Inspector Boyd is quoted: \"Pupils who attended the school at New Germany the first time were not children Indians and all had the children of white parents and therefore the Dept. should no longer be responsible for its maintenance. As a matter of fact the majority residents of this town are not Indians.\"\n\nI beg to submit that this is an entirely false and misleading statement and as such makes me out to be an unworthy and untrustworthy person in view of my effort in the children attending this school.\n\nTo take them up in detail first John Freeman Pieton son of John Pieton is not Indian & there can be no question of his status secondly Maclayne Zuck is an Indian child whose real name is Hammond but is living with the Zucks & has used their name.\nAgain Sir, John, Lewis, and James Becker are Indians and not whites; their father Howard Becker being the son of a pure Indian whose real name is Forte, and whose permanent residence is in Ettafole County. Forte married a white, and their son Howard also married a white, but under the ruling of the Deptl. that the father is not the mother being Indian, their offspring is Indian all their children must be regarded as being Indian.\n\nExplain as regards residents on the Grant the following:\n\nJames Hammond, John Picton, Frank McLeod, John Bartlett, Howard Becker are undoubtedly pure Indians and all make their permanent residence on the Sandale Grant during the summer months to sell their baskets & other work over the country side but always returning to the Sandale Grant in the Fall.\n\nI also wish to point out that James Hammond is an old man now seventy as is also Frank McLeod & unless they receive some support during the winter I do not see how they can live.\nI wish to remind you that being a resident of Huntingdon County I am in a much better position to get the facts regarding the above than Mr. Boyd who makes one or two calls a year and whose home is in safe Britain.\n\nMr. Boyd of the way has never had the courtesy of notifying me when he intends to visit this district & I have not seen him for the past four years. If I saw him I would be able to enlighten him as to the effects results of the grants & their lineage.\n\nI also wish to point out that Mrs. Penny has been hardly dealt with being given no notice of the closing of the schools until the eve of opening and making it impossible for her to secure another position for the coming term as all the municipal schools have now supplied and it means she will be without work for the coming term also the fact that some eight or nine children will grow up without any education as they will not be admitted to the municipal schools, making the prospect of so many more illiterates whose future years will be an added charge upon the public all because of a false statement to the Dept. & the saving of a few hundred dollars to the Department.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt .........................................\n\n...........................................19...\n\nSuch the Indians who originally owned the school of Lunenburg be all entitled to some consideration & trust that upon Department in view of this report which I am much for as being accurate will do its way to reopen the school at Scarsdale and when necessary grant relief to some of the herein mentioned Indians.\n\nAll of which I humbly submit for your information and future action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Stanley Christie\nM.D.\nAgent for Lunenburg County in the Province of Nova Scotia.\nSeptember 14, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd:\n\nI wish to refer to official letter of this file number of July 24th, 1925. Our files do not show that you have investigated the status of the families who reside on the New Germany Indian Reserve, and I should be grateful if you would make an immediate inspection with a view to determining the departmental responsibility for the residents there.\n\nOn the 17th ultimo, as you were informed, the Department wrote Mr. Indian Agent Chisholm, instructing him to close the school indefinitely and to stop granting relief. He has protested this action and claims that there are Indians living on the New Germany Reserve and urges that the day school be continued and some relief allowed when necessary.\n\nYou should report fully on each family, stating whether they are Indians or not. You should ask the assistance of Dr. Chisholm, and it might be advisable to also discuss the matter with Mrs. E. B. Penny, the other worker on the Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Accordingly, I made the necessary inquiries on March 30th, when I inspected the school in operation there at the time. As a result, I satisfied myself that the permanent residents of this reserve are in no sense Indians, but Whites, according to my interpretation of the Indian Act.\n\nIn my report on the Indian Day Schools in Nova Scotia for the term ended June 30th, I stated as follows:\n\n\"Pupils who attended the school at New Germany the past term are not Indians at all, but the children of White parents, and therefore the Department should be no longer responsible for its maintenance.\"\n\nI did not think that a more detailed statement was necessary, although the last paragraph of the letter you quote asked for a report on the status of each family.

Stanley Christie\nAgent for Huron Bay C. M.\n\nP.S. I trust that in the near future you will see fit to have this school re-opened for the benefit of the Indian children residing there.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.S.C.\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, I beg to report as the result of my visit to the Indian reserve at New Germany, N.S., on the 7th instant, that its permanent residents are unquestionably white people, with the possible exception of Howard Beeler, who is the illegitimate son of Agnes Hammond before her marriage to Hosiah Beeler. Howard's mother is dead, but his aunt, Mrs. Dorey, states that her sister made a declaration under oath in the usual way, at or about the time of his birth, that his father was a white man named Dennis Jedrey. Mrs. Dorey's husband is also a white man. Howard himself states that he always heard his father was Dennis Jedrey. He does not follow the Indians much of life, and in fact there is nothing so far as I can see, to indicate that ever Indians inhabited this reserve. Now these are the facts, and it will be for the Department to decide whether I am right or not in my opinion that Howard (Jedrey) Beeler is a white man. He has always used the surname of his stepfather, who brought him up.\n\nMr. Agent Chisholm, of Mahone Bay, N.S., accompanied me on this visit to New Germany Reserve, where we met by appointment Mrs. E.B. Penny. It was very anxious that I should give Howard (Jedrey) Beeler the status of a white man; but I had to tell her that my duty was to submit the facts to you should decide the point. Both she and Mr. Chisholm are agreed that Beeler is the only permanent resident of the reserve, who may possibly be regarded as an Indian.\n\nHoward (Jedrey) Beeler, whose\n\nDunlop C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwife is a white woman, has six children of school age, who attended the Indian Day School at New Germany, when it was in operation. The other pupils were four purely white children, three of them the teacher's - and occasionally an Indian boy named John F. Pictou.\n\nNow, Mrs. Penny complains that if she had been given timely notice of the Department's intention to close the school, she would have been able to secure another position as teacher, as she is qualified to take charge of any of the common schools in Nova Scotia, but that when she received notice it was too late for her to make application for such position.\n\nHoward (Jodrey) Beeler also complains that if he had known the school was to be closed, he would have endeavoured to make arrangements by which his children might attend some other school. But I do not see how he could accomplish anything in that respect, in view of the fact that the nearest public school to his home is some four miles away.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I would suggest that the school be re-opened and kept in operation for the remainder of the present term, which ends on June 30th. next, giving all concerned due notice that it will be permanently closed after that date, unless it be decided in the meantime that Beeler is an Indian, and that his children should be educated by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, October 21, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, reporting on the status of those living on the New Germany Reserve. I note that we have no wards there now. After reading your report, I am satisfied that we have no responsibility for Howard Beeler - who is not an Indian - or for his children.\n\nI am writing to the Indian Agent, authorising the re-opening of the school for the months of November and December. I am clearly stating, however, that the school will be permanently closed at the end of this calendar year. Of course, no further relief will be allowed these people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nN. S.\nOttawa, October 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the Department's responsibility for the residents of the New Germany Indian Reserve, I have now to inform you that Mr. Indian Superintendent Boyd's report has been received. The Department is satisfied that there are now no wards of ours there. In order that adequate notice may be given to the teacher and pupils you are authorised to re-open the day school for the months of November and December. It should be clearly understood, however, that the school is to be permanently closed at the end of this calendar year.

As you were informed in this letter, it was to be understood that the school would be permanently closed at the end of this calendar year.\n\nYou should inform the teacher accordingly and arrange to see that the building is securely fastened up and that all school material on hand is stored. You should furnish the Department with a list of the classroom supplies and other material, the property of this Department, on hand in the school building.

Up to about two years ago there was an Indian School there, supported by the Indian Department. Since then there has been no school on the grounds that there are no Indians. Although this is probably the case, still there are about ten children living at the Reserve of remote Indian descent and these have had no opportunity to attend the school since it was closed. This in itself might not be so serious were it not for the fact that all the property at the Reserve is owned by the Government in trust for the Indians. We have no money, nor means of raising any, nor school house as everything belongs to your Department with the result that these children will grow up with practically no schooling. For the sake of the children, cannot the property at the Reserve be turned over to us for the support of a school, or, if not, cannot you continue the school there?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.F.

Mr. Stewart, the Superintendent General, I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo, referring to the question of school facilities on the New Germany Indian Reserve, in the County of Lunenburg. This matter will continue to receive our attention and it is possible that an effort may be made in the near future to obtain a surrender of this reserve in order that it may be sold and the lands therein become, therefore, taxable by the Municipality.\n\nI shall be very glad to see that you are advised of any subsequent action in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR.

I would beg to you to grant us a school as you did before not even as you did before but as you did in my time going to school. We had to get the firewood ourselves and keep the school house clean and tidy. But now and though but it was the teachers that wanted more or more. You know I am unable myself about this school although it is a big ashamed to have this school stoped here is twelve children at school age.\n\nI am a widow woman living with my aged parents.\n\nSearsdale\n[Signature]\n\nNote:\nSchool district board\nfrom Mr. Lee & Board\nI have two of my grand children with me. We just started to go to school a few weeks before school closed. He learned to read well and the other one is at school age too.\n\nBut the truth is we mixed in with the Indians so the children is just about the same as they were. The ages of the people are too young to get a school. Other wise if the Indians have been here some 200 years it would have been better when all was younger. So there is doubt they would have got something here. But now we are so attached to our homes or no means to get away. Just a living & that's about all.\n\nI am a widow among living with my aged parents.\n\nLearsdale\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nNote: School education.\nI do not feel like leaving them in their old days and doing for myself, so I feel as though these boys I am bringing up may help me in my old days. It is only after sundown here, and I cannot see how they could get a school here without your help, as we all live here on the Indian Reserve and are connected with the Indians here. The outside people are very distant with us, so it would be very hard for us to try to get our children to go to the nearest school. So please let what you can do for us and let me know I have God will send you if you will give us a school. Yours Truly Mrs. Ruben Edmison Leardsale, C.B.S.\nOttawa, October 19, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, requesting that the Department reopen the day school on the New Germany Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this Department does not feel that it has any further responsibility in providing education for the children resident in the vicinity, and it will, therefore, not be possible to favourably consider your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It might be possible, however, to arrange for the free use of the building for school purposes by the residents in the vicinity if they are prepared to carry on teaching activities and provide all the necessary expense themselves.\n\nThe Department is referring the matter of the use of the school building to the local Indian Agent, Dr. W. A. Hewat, Mahone Bay, N.S., for a report, and you will be advised at a later date of the Department's decision in regard to using the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Abednego Penney,\nScarsdale P.O.,\nLunenburg Co.,\nN.S.\nOttawa, April 9, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Abednego Penney, Scarsdale, Lunenburg Co., N.S., requesting that this Department sell, to the residents in the vicinity, the school building located on the New Germany Indian Reserve in order that they can carry on school activities for the benefit of the children residing at that point. The Department is unable at the present time to sell the land comprised in this Reserve owing to legal difficulties which may arise regarding any reversionary interest the Province of Nova Scotia may have in this land. It might, however, be possible to arrange for the free use of the school building for school purposes by the residents on the Reserve providing they will undertake all necessary expense required in conducting the activity.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you stating whether you would advise that the use of this building be granted for school purposes. You might consult Mr. Penney and other interested parties and inform the Department of the arrangements you would recommend be made for the use of this building. The Department might consent to sell the building, but, in that event, it would have to be removed from the Reserve to another site. Please state the approximate value of this building and its contents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nW. A. Hewitt, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nI have consulted Mr. Penny and other residents of the Scarsdale Reserve and also inspected the school building. Due to the rough hilly nature of the immediate vicinity of the school, it would be too difficult to move the building the distance required to get it off the Reserve. The residents are anxious to have the use of the building and would undertake to provide for the expense of maintaining a school. I would recommend that they be allowed to use the building and be required to keep it in repair.\n\nThe contents of the building are:\n\n- One small table\n- Two chairs\n- One stove\n- About twenty school books of different grades and subjects, all out of date\n- Three maps\nSir,\n\nOf a total value of about $15.00\nthe building itself is worth about $125.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. Stewart\nAgent\nOttawa, May 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, informing the Department that, owing to the nature of the surrounding country, it will not be possible to move the school building from the New Germany Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Department will have no objection to the residents in the vicinity having the free use of this building for school purposes during its present location. The privilege of using this building will be granted during the pleasure of the Department. It is expected that for the free use of the building it will be kept in a good state of repair. Any of the contents at present in the building may be utilised in carrying on the work of the school. You may inform any interested parties accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. Hewat, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nLiverpool, Nova Scotia,\nJuly 1, 1929.\n\nHon. Charles Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Sept. 10, 1928 I wrote to your department concerning the Indian Reserve near New Germany, Nova Scotia. I have a reply from the Deputy Superintendent General, dated Oct. 10, File 42-1-1, stating that the Department was about to surrender the Reserve and sell all the property there belonging to the government. Lately I have heard that you have passed over the school house to the inhabitants there but the remaining property is still as before. There are about ten children, or perhaps more, whose parents are clamoring for a school and there does not seem to be any visible means of support. The dwellers there have no property to be taxed as they are all squatters. I have also heard that there is some doubt as to the ownership of the property, whether or not, that these people, having held the lands for so many years, hold them by possession.\n\nFor a full year's school, from local sources, I could probably raise about $150 for the support of a school but, as you can readily see, this amount is not more than half enough to support the school. Until these lands are disposed of, could not your Department continue in its support as I am anxious for these children to get a school?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.F. Morton,\nInspector of Schools\nJuly 6, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Merton:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the first instant, requesting the Department to assist in the maintenance of a school on the property which was formerly the New Germany Indian Reserve. In reply I regret to state that the Department cannot favourably consider a grant from Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education for this purpose. The residents on this property cannot be considered wards of this Department, and, while I am willing to grant the use of the old school building, I cannot expend public money in this connection. The expense will have to be borne by those interested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. F. Merton, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nLiverpool, N. S.\nMahone Bay, Oct. 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following quarterly report.\n\nSCARSDALE\n\nThe residents of Scarsdale requested me to thank the Department for giving them permission to use the school.\n\nW. S. Hewat.\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 18, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will note from the enclosed letter that it refers to the conduct of the Tony children at Gold River. I would appreciate your investigating the complaints in the letter and advise the Department whether or not you consider any action should be taken.\n\nWhen replying, this letter should be returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nN.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. B.W. Skinner,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI take a few moments of your valuable time but I think it is time someone was making a complaint about that boy of Mr. Mrs. Charles Jones of Cold River. That boy should be in school instead of running around here causing disturbance among the neighbors. There is a law for white children to get schooling and it should also apply to Indian children. On Dec. 10th instead of being in school where he should be he destroyed my shop tools while his parents watched. Do you think this is a good way for parents to bring their children up? Do the white people have to stand for that. I am not the only one she is annoying. You no doubt will hear from many.\nother if she keeps being allowed to try to rule the people. We who know Picton are Indian people and nobody ever has any trouble with them. I close hoping some attention will be made by this letter.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\nAubrey Hall.\nTo The Dept. Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\n\nMahone Bay,\nNova Scotia,\nDec. 27, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 42-1-1 dated Dec. 18/37, in reference to the query concerning children attending school:\n\nI would state that I have interviewed both parties and in my opinion, this child should be in school somewhere.\n\nThis man, Mr. Aubrey Hatt, is a half breed negro, who does not own any property and is living in Gold River.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nB.W. Skinner,\nMahone Bay,\nNova Scotia.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, January 3, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of December 27th with reference to the Toney children.\n\nAt the present time there are no vacancies in the Shubenacadie Residential School and, consequently, they cannot be sent there.\n\nWould it not be possible to arrange to have them regularly attend a \"white school\" near their home. Please make enquiries in this regard. The Department will be prepared to allow the usual grant of $12.00 a year for each of the children, based on the average attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacLean, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg leave to inform you that I opened school on the new Germany Reserve last week ago, and until the \"pile\" is fixed, I don't think school can be kept open very long, for the people tell me it might fall down any time it storms, as it is badly cracked and quite a little of the plaster has fallen down.\n\nMrs. Harlow visited the school in July and said all necessary repairs would be made during the holidays. The slabs are bought to be nailed down as quite a few are getting loose, and the outside painted.\n\nNothing has been heard from Mrs. Harlow since she visited here, so I thought it proper to inform you before the weather gets cold enough to have fire in store, for\nI don't think the place is safe enough to have fire in store.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Harlow of his duty,\n\nand oblige,\n\nObedient Servant,\n\nMary C.

Gillis,\nTeacher,\nNew Germany, N.S.\nOttawa, September 16, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn May, last, you were authorized to have certain repairs made to the New Germany school. The teacher now writes in stating that the school cannot be kept open very long unless the chimney is fixed as it is in a very dangerous condition. Some of the plaster has fallen and some of the clapboards are loose. From the above it would appear that it is necessary to have these repairs done at once and you will be good enough to see that these matters are attended to at once. The Department expected that the repairs to this building would have been made during the summer holidays so that the work of the school would not be interfered with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

(Repairs and improvements have been completed in connection with the schools at Bear River, Whycocomagh, Middle River, Sydney, and Salmon River - the school house at Bear River having received the finishing touches this week.)\n\nIt was my intention to leave the other schools for next year, because repair work, especially when it includes painting and plastering, cannot be done to satisfaction in Nova Scotia during the fall and winter months. However, as I know that the statement of the teacher at New Germany regarding the condition of the school house there is quite correct, I shall endeavour to have it attended to, at least, in so far as unavoidable repairs are concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

MacLean Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince writing you my last letter about the building school house, I beg to say that Mr. Harlow, \"Indian Agent,\" is getting the work done.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMary A. Gillis\n(teacher)\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT,\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just received your letter of the 19th instant by Mr. Scott; and, to say, in reply, that some days ago I wrote the Indian Teacher at New Germany inquiring if some person could not be got near the place who would be able to make such temporary repairs to the school house as to make the roof watertight, and the building otherwise comfortable for the winter. I have not been favored yet with the desired information, but expect to be at any moment, when I shall know better what to do; but I hope it may not be necessary for me to travel nearly 300 miles to superintend such work as sweeping a chimney, or putting a stove pipe in order, or nailing a few shingles on a roof. I think the Agent Mr. Harlow, would attend to such matters, if the teacher brought them to his notice. But, at any rate, I expect to have the school house at New Germany put in condition for the winter at an early date. Of course, it requires somewhat extensive repairs; but there is no use in attempting to have them made until warm weather comes again. I did all the work in that line that I possibly could during vacation this year; but was not able to overtake what requires to be done at New Germany.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Bayly\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nD. C.

Consequently the flue had to be taken down and is being rebuilt.\n\nI do not think the Department will be troubled any more this term on account of the condition of the school-house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nD.

I have made inquiries and calculated the cost per pupil for carrying the teacher to and from the school, which comes out to $0.50 per trip. I consider this amount reasonable and suggest that the department should make arrangements accordingly. However, I would suggest leaving the school closed during an occasional stormy day when roads are impassable, as this would practically be no pupils there on those days, thus saving costs.\n\nThe death of Mrs. [last name] has opened another question as to the disposition of the property on which she lived, since she left no children.\n\nThere is considerable dispute over the Indian Board's decision, and I would suggest the department take this matter into full consideration.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

She has just the one stove for the whole building and possibly she should have had a better one, but to me it seems to answer the purpose for this year anyway. If the Department had felt honored to furnish the very stove, the ten dollars for the one should be deducted from Mr. Beeler's account of $1297.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nE. M.

The door is broken, sides cracked etc., it has been there since the school house was built about thirty years ago. I have made enquiries here and find I can get a good stove, about the same kind, for $25.00. That is the wish of the Department concerning it.\n\nAlso Mr. Beeler thinks that a well should be dug for the teacher's use. As it is now she has to carry the water quite a long distance from a spring which is hard until weather is hard.\n\nHe says there is a good chance for a well across the road from her house and thinks it will not cost more than fifteen to twenty dollars to dig it. Please advise me in this matter also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEliza Greenan\nOttawa, October 7, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo stating that the stove in the New Germany Indian Day School is unsafe and requesting that you be granted authority to purchase a new one.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should obtain prices from a number of dealers for the supplying of a suitable stove for this school and purchase from the firm quoting you the lowest price. The type of stove to be supplied will be left to your discretion and the cost should be approximately the amount stated by you, namely, $22.00.\n\nWith reference to the digging of a well for the teacher's use I have to request that you will be good enough to state whether it is intended to have the well dug on the school property, what probable depth of the same and whether you would advise that it be dug or drilled. You should furnish an estimate of the cost of digging the well, together with the cost of equipping the same. As soon as this information is received the Department will be in a position to decide on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

The letter was lost on the way to\nthe Post Office, but may have been picked up\nand mailed by the sender.

I presume the Department will take up the matter with Mr. Cochran the new Indian Agent.\n\nI wish to report that Mrs. Frank Parnell, widow, with her eight children has moved to Calgarian, Queen County in order to send the children to school. I shall be able to meet the monthly rent of thirty dollars until he located again by the Agent of this county.\n\nSince I expect to go away after a few weeks for the winter, I am glad that another appointment has been made and will hand over all the papers to Mr. Cochran as requested.\n\nI am to report a small balance on hand from the following sales:\n\n- 100 yards of wood - $7.40\n- 2 loads of sand - $2.50\n\nShall I remit it to the Department or give it over to Mr. Cochran.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nElizabeth Freeman.\n\nP.S. Shall I send in my bills for the month of October or will the full quarter pay be allowed me?\n\nE. L.\nOttawa, November 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMrs. Freeman, while Acting Indian Agent for the Indians of Lunenburg County, forwarded a request in October last, for authority to purchase a new stove for the use of the New Germany Indian Day School. She stated that a stove of the type required could be obtained for about $50.00. She was authorised to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers handling the stove desired and to purchase from the one quoting the lowest price.\n\nI should be pleased if you would inquire whether this purchase has been made and, if not, you should attend to the matter yourself. It is necessary, before any purchases are made, that competitive prices be obtained from a number of dealers and the purchase in each case made from the firm quoting the lowest price. You will be good enough to carry out these conditions and, if the stove has not already been supplied, you should attend to the matter at once.\n\nA request was also made that a well be dug for the teacher's use. The late acting Agent forwarded a communication from Osias Beeler, the janitor of the school, who states that the well would not be on school ground, but on the teacher's lot near her house, and that the well would have to be dug and would require to be walled with stone, with a frame or box on top and equipped with a pole or wheel and rope for drawing the water.\n\nIf this lot is the property of the teacher the Department could not undertake the expense of having the well dug. You should inquire as to the ownership of this lot and, if it is the property of the Department, you should obtain particulars as to the cost of having a well dug and walled with stone and properly equipped for drawing water.\n\nYou will be good enough to give these matters your early attention and have the stove purchased, if it has not already been supplied, and furnish full particulars regarding the well and the cost of the same. As soon as the stove has been supplied you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

I must also say the amount of children attending school are unable to provide for them anything with which I could teach sewing or crocheting, any work of which I think would be very helpful so the girls would be able to make themselves sweaters, caps, stockings, mittens, etc. If the Department would consider this for me as for former teacher I should be pleased to receive some silkoline or wool or a cotton mixture to use. I am sure it would take about 3 dozen 1\u00bd balls. Color suitable would be dark red, brown, navy. I say 4 balls for each child, they stand well in need also of goods by the yard to make ties or aprons and shirts.\n\nI am,\n[Signature]\nMrs. E.H. Penney, Teacher\nOTTAWA, November 20th, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, requesting that a quantity of sewing material be supplied in order that you can teach the pupils of the New Germany Indian Day School sewing, knitting, etc.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are authorizing Mr. Agent Cochran to expend an amount not exceeding $15.00 in the purchase of the supplies required by you. You should prepare a list of your requirements and hand it to Mr. Cochran who will then make the purchase. I may add that the articles when made are to become the property of the pupils.\n\nA copy of the Indian Act will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Penney, teacher of the New Germany Indian Day School, in which she requests that a supply of sewing material, wool, silkline, etc., be supplied in order that she can teach the girls sewing, knitting, etc.\n\nThe Department will approve of a small quantity of material being supplied for this purpose, and you may expend an amount not to exceed $15.00 in the purchase of the supplies the teacher requires. You should get in touch with Mrs. Penney before making the purchase and inform her of the amount authorized and she should furnish you with a list of the material required.\n\nI may add that the articles when made by the pupils are to become their property.\n\nWe are informing Mrs. Penney that authority has been given you to expend the above amount in the purchase of the sewing material, etc.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

H. G. Hirst, Medicine Bay, for goods shipped New Germany Reserve School. I had difficulty in getting material. Miss Lunnery requires that we not yet proceed with any further shipments until we have received your instructions regarding the order. We will follow your instructions.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, February 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a communication from Mrs. E. B. Penney, teacher of the New Germany Indian Day School, regarding her salary and bonus for the December quarter, last, the furnishing of wood for the teacher's residence and material for sewing.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque covering the amount of salary due, viz: $125.00, and a cheque for the twelve days Mrs. Penney taught in September, last, and for the three months in the December quarter, amounting to a total of $51.00, were sent her on the 25th of January, last. We hope that these cheques have reached her before this date.\n\nRegarding the wood required for the use of the teacher's residence, I beg to say that the Department has allowed 5 cords each year. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of this quantity for the teacher's use. Competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained, and the purchase made from the person quoting the lowest price. When the wood has been delivered, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the persons asked to quote a price and the prices quoted by them. You should arrange for the purchase and delivery of this wood as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the wood required for the school building, I beg to say that we allow the janitor salary at the rate of $20.00 per annum, for which he is to keep the schoolroom clean, light the fires and furnish the fuel required. We, therefore, presume that the janitor is furnishing an ample supply of wood for the use of the school.\n\nWe note from the teacher's letter that she has purchased some wood for her residence. You should obtain accounts from her covering the amount she has paid for this purpose, and you should attach them to proper vouchers, in duplicate, and send to the Department, when consideration will be given to reimbursing Mrs. Penney.\n\nRegarding the supplying of sewing material, wool, etc., for the purpose of teaching the girls sewing and knitting, I beg to say that in official communication of November 20th, last, we authorised the former Agent to expend an amount not to exceed $15.00 in the purchase of material for this purpose. An account to the amount of $6.18 was paid for material furnished. You may, after consulting the teacher as to what she requires, expend an amount not to exceed $10.00 in the purchase of sewing material, yarn, etc. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering this expenditure. The purchase of the wood for the teacher's residence and the sewing material should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. S.

CHISHOLM, INDIAN AGENT,\nMAHONE BAY, N.S., DATED MAY 29TH, 1923, ON THE NEW\nGERMANY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI inspected the school and found it in fair condition. The roof will have to be repaired this summer as it is leaking in two or three places. The blackboards need repainting and there is one broken window.\nOttawa, June 5th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the New Germany Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you found the teacher to be quite capable and properly attending to her duties, also that there are 6 or 7 children of school age who can attend. It is considered, in view of your report, that it is in the interests of these children to keep the school in operation during the next school year, and Mrs. Penny, the present teacher, may remain as teacher if she desires, for the school year ending June 30, 1924.\n\nRegarding the repairs which you state are required to the building, you may arrange to have the repairs to the roof carried out, and the blackboards re-painted, and any broken panes of glass replaced in the windows. These repairs should be carried out during the coming summer holidays, and no unnecessary expense should be incurred. You should arrange for the purchase of any material required and for the labour in having the work done. Only the repairs absolutely necessary to the roof should be carried out. When completed, properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI should be pleased to have the report of the officer of the S.P.C.C. after his visit to investigate conditions at Gold River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. S. Chisholm, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am obliged to relate to you the condition of the school-house. The roof, I might say both sides again shingling, the wind blows the shingles off and it leaks in more than 5 different places.\n\nThe inside, that is the walls which are of plaster, is breaking and falling down. Some of this may be due to rains also frost. Nevertheless it requires according to the Rules of Health the walls to be cleaned and either fixed or sheathed with Beaver Board or Metallic Sheeting.\n\nThe Toilet (Girls) require a new door.\n\nThe Well requires a Base and cleaned and fixed with cement or bricks to prevent surface water from running in.\n\nI might say Carpenters which are capable\nof doing this work would be.\n\nMrs. Wellington Langille Baris' corner\nLeonard Delong Baris' corner,\nboth of Lunenburg Co., N.S.\n\nThe Black Boards want to be renewed by paint as they are 2 boards, the lights shining on these boards prevent children from seeing work, as it will not hold chalk.\n\nI feel sorry to have to relate so much but I feel it my duty therefore I do trust the Department will give this a little attention and have it repaired during my holiday moreover I trust that my service has proved satisfactory I have done my best.\n\nMrs. A.J. Boyd, Sup't of Indian Affairs has marked the Progress Satisfactory\n\nI am,\n\nYour Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find letter from Mrs. Penny the school mistress at Seawolfe, Lumulst, to.\n\nKindly let me know what action you wish taken with regard to the necessary repairs of the school building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Stanley Christie\nAgent of Lumulst\n\nOttawa N.S.\nOttawa, June 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing a communication from Mrs. E. B. Penney, Teacher of the New Germany Indian Day School, requesting that certain repairs be made to the building. As you were instructed by official letter of the 8th instant, you should arrange to have the repairs required to the roof carried out. Also have the plaster repaired where necessary and the walls cleaned.\n\nThe girls' toilet requires a new door. You may arrange to have the same put on.\n\nThe teacher further states that the well needs a box and that it should be fixed around the top with cement or bricks to prevent surface water from running in. Please have these repairs carried out.\n\nAs already authorized, you should have the blackboards repainted.\n\nThe Department does not wish to have any undue expenditure incurred at this school. While it is intended to carry on the school work for another year, the further continuing of the school will depend entirely upon the attendance during the next year. Until we are definitely assured that there will be a sufficient attendance to warrant the expenditure we are not prepared to authorize any large expenditure in fitting up the building. The above work should be carried out during the coming summer holidays. You will arrange for the purchase of any material needed and for the labour. Properly certified vouchers in duplicate should be forwarded covering all expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. Chisholm, Esq., M.D.\nIndian Agent,\nMahone Bay, N. S.\n\nJ. D.

Freeman M.D.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI suppose it is time for me to write you a few lines about a boarding place for our teacher, as you know the teacher's always had board at Mrs. Ann Foster, but she has passed away, so the family living in her house is not capable of boarding a teacher as Mrs. Foster belonging will be administrated on probably part of her house closed, so the teacher was obliged to move to new quarters.\n\nThere is no convenient\nplace for her near the school house so she was obliged to go to a place where it is impossible for her to travel to her school during the fall or winter season as the road is overflowed with water during the wet season which she would have to wade in a foot deep in winter time, no track whatever some times for a week at a time so she can never teach school if she must stay where she is.\n\nNow I understand that the Government is supposed to grant a building near the\nschool for a place for the teachers to live in to board themselves while teaching on Reserve now we would be very thankful if you will apply to the Department for such a building & have it erected as soon as possible as the wet weather will soon be here & the road impassable so it is time to get busy Would not ask such a thing if it was not necessary so now I will close hoping to hear from you soon Yours Truly Wm H. Beeler (signature)\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nBridgeport No.\n\nOct. 20th 1916\n\nSir,\n\nDue to the death of Miss Ann Foster at Indian River who has been the teacher, it will be necessary to provide a building for her to live in \"in the district\" which to continue the School\" as there are no residents there with whom she wishes to work. I will enclose her letter to me also a Communication from the trustees or jointor.\n\nYou will please join this matter your consideration and advice and concerning it. It would also require a small place about 20 by 30 ft. Wood and shingle constructed.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH. P. Freeman\nOttawa, October 24, 1916.\n\nMr. Ogilvie,\n\nCan anything be done to provide accommodation for the teacher of this school? If you will read Mr. Agent Freeman's letter and the enclosures you will see that unless teacher's quarters are provided the school will have to be closed. This would be a pity, as, although it is a small school with an enrolment of from 12 to 15 and an average of 8, Mr. Public School Inspector McIntosh reports that Miss Ford is a capable teacher and well suited for the position and he states that he is pleased to report as satisfactory everything in connection with the school. Apparently Miss Ford would be content with a small three roomed house.\n\nCould you give you an approximate estimate of what a small building of this class would cost and whether it could be put up this fall?. The Department would have to secure a site, but before taking any steps in this direction I would like to have the above information.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, October 24, 1916.\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nA residence appears desirable for the teacher at New Germany school, N. S., and the plans prepared for Shubenacadie will no doubt meet their requirements. The season is rather late to commence the erection of a building on a concrete or stone foundation in that locality. It might, however, be accomplished, as the plans and specifications are already prepared, if the Deputy Minister approves of its erection.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, October 31, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with enclosures in which it is stated that, owing to the death of Mrs. Foster, with whom the teacher of the New Germany Indian School, Miss Rose L. Ford, was living, teacher's quarters are required, as there is no other suitable place on the reserve where she can live.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that, owing to the lateness of the season and the want of funds, it will be unable to provide quarters for the teacher this year.\n\nIf the teacher can find accommodation in the neighbourhood the Department would be willing to pay for her transport to and from the school until the cold weather makes the roads passable. Kindly state the distance she would have to be conveyed and what would be a reasonable price to pay for it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nN. P.
