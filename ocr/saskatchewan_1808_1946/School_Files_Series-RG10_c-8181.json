The Department is not prepared to consider water-proofing the basement but is interested in the possibility of draining it satisfactorily. At the time the school was built, there was a drain installed to keep the lot clear of water, and it should be possible to connect up with this at much less expense than a total of $115, which you estimate. Please ascertain who installed this other drain, get a definite idea concerning its location and let me have a further report with estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. R. L.

Bristo,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending out the can for coal oil again this morning. We have saved as much on lights as we can but it seems to be of no avail.\n\nWe are not wholly to blame for using so much coal oil. The people here hold services (Church) in the school two nights a week. The lamps are lit for two hours each night and as there are eight lamps it takes a lot of oil. You may bring this to the notice of the Department if you wish as services here are unnecessary when they have the church in the village and anyway I do not see why the Department should have to pay for the lights for church services here.\n\nWhen I took charge here I was promised light and heat by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert Smith.\n\nHow about the stove shaker?\nFebruary 16th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nYou will find herewith voucher no 317 amounting to $2.63 in favour of J.A. Cadieux together with the original of a letter sent me today by Mr. Smith teacher relative to the large expense of coal oil at the School.\n\nAs explained by Mr. Smith it seems that the holding of services in the School is responsible for the use of so much oil. I would be glad to receive orders from you relative to these expenses, because at present I cannot refuse to authorize the purchase of oil although I know that they are using the School too much for all kinds of meetings.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing account for $2.63, for coal oil used at the Oka Country Day School. This account is being paid.\n\nIt is noted, from the teacher's letter, that the use of a large amount of oil is due to the fact that church services are frequently held in the school. As our Appropriation for Indian Education is greatly reduced, it will not be possible to consider payment of similar accounts in future. If these meetings continue to be held, it will be necessary for those interested to make other arrangements for securing oil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

It is also suggested that, if, this proposition is accepted, to have this work made by Indians instead of giving the contract to white people as it used to be done in the past.\n\nI would recommend this work as this school needs painting in order to protect it and I would also recommend to employ Indians on the relief list for this job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFr.

Quotations should be for a good grade of paint, etc. When we have particulars as to the total cost involved in giving the exterior of the school two coats of a good grade of paint, you will receive authority to arrange for the purchase of the paint and other materials required, also for the labour and oversight of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Prices are as follow: Paint Ramezay \"Unicorn\" $3.95 a gall., quantity required approximately 9 gallons of white and 2 gallons of green paint. Shellac \u00bd gall., $3.00. Porch paint 1 gall., $3.95. Green stain for roof 9 gallons at $1.50. Paint brushes 5, 3 large ones and 2 small ones $4.00. 1 Steel brush for scrapping the old paint $0.50. Labour at $2.25 a day, approximately $50.00, there will also be the cost of replacing a few window panes and of a few pounds of putty. It is understood that the work would be made by Indians on the relief list and preferably by head of large families, providing they can work satisfactorily as painters. The above mentioned estimate was made to the best of my knowledge, and I beg to assure you that this work, if authorized, will be supervised very closely in order to keep it as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Frs.

You should arrange for the purchase of the quantity of paint and roof stain, also paint brushes and one steel brush for scrubbing the old paint. The purchase should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration. The work should be performed by Indians on the relief list, provided they can do it satisfactorily. You should supervise the work as closely as possible and see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts in triplicate, covering the cost of the paint and other materials. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Proper returns of the labour employed should also be kept, in triplicate. Each column on the return should be filled in, as requested under the various headings, and the return should be certified by yourself and forwarded for payment.\n\nI enclose an Encumbrance Certificate, authorizing the funds to cover the cost of the material and labour to an amount which must not exceed the sum of $125. When forwarding the vouchers, as requested above, please state on each copy that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R.

In your letter of November 15, 1932, you stated that a hot lunch was not required at the Village School as all the pupils attending it lived close to the school and consequently could easily go home for their meal. I would appreciate your advising if children living at any distance are attending the Village School this year.\n\nI may add that our funds have been so reduced that it is doubtful if we can provide any large amount for midday meal purposes.

It is not well understood why Mrs. Paul Gabriel requested a hot lunch for her children at School as they are the most irregular in attendance at the Village school. Last winter none of her four children went to school according to the teacher, and at present only one of this family is attending. The children from the Country attending the Village school are very irregular in attendance and I would not recommend any expenses for a hot lunch.\n\nAccording to the teacher Mrs. Tupper the giving of soup at the School by the Department is a waste of money. When a hot lunch was served at this School the Department was paying $15.00 a month for five months a total of $75.00, this amount was paid to feed an average of three or four children from the country every day. When this hot lunch was discontinued last year, the Indian parents did not request same and this year apart of Mrs. Gabriel I have not had any request for the lunch.\n\nInstead of paying for a hot lunch I would rather recommend to supply the few pupils from the Country attending the Village School with a \"Thermos bottle\" this arrangement would avoid any waste of food, and the parents who really want their children to have soup would supply same themselves when their respective children would be going to School. It would also cost less than the price of a lunch during the whole winter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Fra.

The Department, therefore, approves of it being discontinued during the coming winter.\n\nWe are not prepared at the present time to supply a thermos bottle to the few pupils from the country who attend this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Brisbois,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I ask why there is a shortage of coal delivered to this school this year? By my computation there is approximately a half a ton of a shortage. I cannot do with any less than seven tons.\n\nWill you please communicate with the department and ascertain whether they intend to continue the supplying of soup to the school children this year from December 1st. to March 31st.? And if this is the case, will Mrs. Smith serve it as in former years?\n\nWill you also ask if we are to get the usual treat of candy for the pupils of this and the village school?\n\nI am obliged to requisition the Department for the following:\n\nLaundry soap to the value of 25 cents. (Janitor work)\n1 cake of Bon Ami. (For cleaning windows)\nToilet soap to the value of 25 cents.\n4 yds. cheap roller towelling.\n1 Floor mop.\n1 Small bottle of O Cedar polish for dusting school desks.\n1 Stove shaker to fit Legare's Jewel heater.\n\nThe school clock is broken; I believe it is the spring, as it seemed to uncoil when I was winding it one day last week. Will you see about getting it mended and at your earliest convenience will you get me a time-piece of some sort as I have no watch and we have to use the kitchen clock which makes it very inconvenient.\nWill you also arrange to have the school water-tank mended if it is at all possible? Every time the inspector comes he complains of the open drinking water container. It has been out of order now for nearly two years and I am of the opinion that it can be mended if taken to a competent person.\n\nI should like it very much if you would write also regarding the supplying of coal oil to this school residence this year. Please make it clear that the bill last year which seemed exorbitant was really for two months supply of oil. When other residences are lighted I do not see why this one is not.\n\nYou will also inform the Department that from now on I will not be held responsible for any damage to the school desks and walls as long as religious meetings are conducted in the class-room. I have tried hard to make the people see that they must not scratch the desks or write on the walls, but it continues and I am at a loss to know what to do further regarding these defacements.\n\nAll of the above is very respectfully submitted and I ask for the co-operation of yourself and the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAlbert E. Smith\n\nTeacher-in-charge\nOka, November 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith the original of a letter received from Mr. Smith, schoolteacher, in which he is requesting some articles to use at the School of the Country at Oka.\n\nI would recommend to supply the School with the articles such as laundry soap, bon ami soap, toilet soap, roller towelling, one mop, O Cedar polish and also with a stove sacker. I would also recommend to have the clock repaired and the water-tank of the School mended.\n\nRelative to the supplying of coal oil I beg to say that this item was cut off last year.\n\nIn connection with the supplying of soup and also to the usual treat of candy for the pupils of both School I will send you a recommendation in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Frs.

In reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 6 cakes laundry soap,\n- 4 yards cheap roller towelling,\n- 1 cake Bon Ami,\n- 1 small bottle O-Cedar polish,\n- 6 cakes toilet soap,\n- 1 stove shaker.\n\nYou may also purchase a clock of the Big Ben type. It is considered that this would be cheaper than to have the school clock repaired. After you have made the above authorized purchases, you should obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost.

Brisbois:\n\nI wish you would ask the department if I may have 5 links of stove pipe. The school is too cold this year and I intend taking the stove out of the dining room in the residence and setting it up in the school. On a very cold day such as we had last week I find it impossible to keep the school warm enough for the pupils or myself to keep warm enough for good work. The residence is so cold that we are going to close the living room and use only the kitchen and dining-room which can both be heated by the kitchen stove.\n\nThe first winter we were here we found the place quite warm but last winter it was pretty cold and this winter it is worse. It would seem as if the building had been built of green lumber and it shrinks as it dries thereby making cracks between the boards.\n\nI shall need a new ash sifter. The one I have was worn out last year and I thought I could patch it up to do the year, but it is going fast so I shall have to have a new one. I also need a mop.\n\nWill you please send me 4 report forms for reporting the attendance for the term. Will you send me a couple of requisition forms as I have need of books for pupils who have passed to a higher grade.\n\nI should like if you would find out if the department is willing that the children have soup at school during January, February and March of 1934 and if so will it be under the same terms as last year and the year before.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith\nTeacher-in-charge.\nOka, December 20, 1933.\n\nSir;\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith a letter received from A.E. Smith, teacher of Oka Indian Country Day School, in which he asks to be supplied with 5 links of stove pipes, a new ash sifter and also inquire if the Department is willing that the children have soup at noon during January, February and March.\n\nRelative to the supplying of soup I beg to inform you that I have not received any request from any Indian for same and I do not recommend the supplying of a hot lunch at least for the month of January. If same is necessary for the month of February I will communicate with you in due time.\n\nIn connection with the above mentioned request for stove pipes and ash sifter I beg to say that I would recommend it.\n\nThe price of stove links is $.20 a link and an ash sifter is $0.35.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of five lengths of stove pipe and an ash sifter. After the purchase has been made, please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRelative to the request of the teacher, that soup be supplied the pupils at noon during January, February and March, I have to say that the Department is not prepared to supply this during the month of January.

There\nwill have to be another stove set up. Will you please get\nin touch with the Department and find out what can be done.\nIf possible get one without a jacket so that the children\ncan get to it to get warm. They arrived here this morning\ncrying with the cold and we had to take them out to the stove\nin the kitchen to get warm. I never was so dissatisfied with\nanything as I have been with this jacket stove. As I told you\nbefore I rented a stove last winter for the school and paid\nfor it myself but I do not intend to do that this year. If\nthe Department can not rent a stove we will do without, but\nI will not hold school in a building that is not properly\nheated. The fault lies in the material used in the building\nin the first place. The only way that this can be remedied\nnow is to install a furnace in the basement.\n\nFor this winter an old stove will do providing it\nwill burn coal. There is a small one at Ernest Simon's that\nwould do well if they would rent it for the winter. We shall\nneed some new pipes too if you get a stove, because the old\npipes are full of holes from rust.\n\nThanking you for past favours,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher-in-charge.\nOka Decembre 11th, 1934\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nYou will find herewith a letter received from Mr Smith, teacher of the Indian Country Day School.\n\nMr Smith ever spoke to me about a stove, but in that time he was not in need of a stove because the weather was very mild, but now he pretend that it is too cold in the class to stay, and if the Dept. do not want to rent him another stove that he will be obliged to close the School for the winter.\n\nWhen they built the School the wood was not dry enough, and now that make some space between the board and the wind come in, and it is very cold for the children.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDept. Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nSir,\n\nReference your letter to me dated Sept. 19 # 20-1-5.\nRegarding estimate of the cost of construction of a wood-\nshed at the school here.\n\nI have given this my spare time and thought\nand have arrived at the following conclusion; After asking\nthe price of lumber from Mr. Marinier of Oka who is on the\napproved list I find that his price is prohibitive and that\nwe could not erect even a very small shed of rough lumber\nfor $60, if we were to buy the lumber from him. I have been\nto visit several mills not on the list and find that the\none situated at St. Andrews East has the best grade of\nlumber and at the same time the cheapest $24.50 per M. This\nis the price delivered here. Planed spruce is $31 per M.\nMay I make a suggestion that the contract be given to an\nIndian here, Lindsay Bonspille, who has had experience in\nbuilding, having helped me erect a summer home at Restoule.\nAfter talking to him in this respect he thinks that it would\nbe possible for him to get his material from St. Andrews\nand put up the building for $60 but only out of rough lumber.\nIf the Department were prepared to allow an extra $20 making\n$80 in all he could put it up using planed spruce.\n\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing a plan\nwhich I have in mind. The plan is not well done as I have\nhad no experience in blue print work but I hope that I may\nmake myself understood by it. The size would be 12'x18'.\nThere is very little use in putting up a shed unless it is\nto be used as a garage. I have not got a car but I may have\nbefore I leave, or my successor might have one.\nThe length would have to be 18' so as to accommodate the new build of cars. On the width 9' would be allowed for the car and 3' for the wood which would be piled along the side. The roof would be flat and sloping with sufficient slope to allow for drainage of water. A slide window in the back and a small door in the side besides the two large doors in the front.\n\nThe following is a list of the required materials with the approximate cost of same:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 1012 B.F. rough inch @ $24.50 will cost | $24.50 |\n| 335 B.F. 2\" scantling etc. @ $24.50 \"    | $ 8.20 approx. |\n| 3 rolls roofing @ $3.00               | $ 9.00 |\n| 2 small windows @ $2.40               | $ 4.80 |\n| 35 lbs. nails @ 5\u00a2                   | $ 1.75 |\n| Hinges, hooks, etc allowing           | $ 1.65 lowest. |\n\n$50.20\n\nThis, you see, would allow the man $9.80 for his labour in putting it up. This is figured on the basis of a shed 12'x18' of rough lumber only. As I consider it inadvisable to erect one any smaller than the only material we could use, but as I pointed out before if the Department will allow an extra $20, it would be possible to erect one the same size of planed spruce.\n\nThe estimates and drawings have been done to the best of my ability. If I have been of any service to you in this respect I am very thankful to have been offered the privilege of doing. It has been one way in which I can thank the Department for the many favours conferred in the past.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert Smith.\nSuggested plan for a woodshed to be erected at the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nIn my estimate on page 2 of my letter I did not allow for suitable foundation. This, we had thought, could be done with 4 Butternut or Cedar logs 18' in length. The cost would be about $3.50 for the four logs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted, from Mr. Smith's letter, that the cost of material and labour will not exceed $60. In order to keep the expenditure within this amount, the woodshed might be built a little smaller than the plan shown by Mr. Smith. The Department sees no necessity for building this woodshed large enough to serve as a garage. The Department only wishes to supply a woodshed for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Marinier told me that the lower prize he can make is $60.00 beside $4.00 for the paint and $10.00 for the Lindsay Bomspille labour total prize $74.00. This is the lower prize that I can obtain to build the said shed.\n\nOn your letter of the 4th instant you voted only $60.00. Then I will to know if you are willing to pay $14.00 more, otherwise we cannot build a smaller shed than 10 x 12.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 16, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the woodshed for the Oka Country School, I beg to say that you may inform the teacher of this school that the Department is only prepared to expend $60 in the erection of this building. This amount is intended to cover the cost of both materials and labour.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 4th instant, the Department does not consider it necessary to build as large a woodshed as that shown on the plan submitted by Mr. Smith.

They have almost enough names on their list now. I was approached by one of them last night to see if it would be likely that the Department of Indian Affairs would put the lights in the school if the line went through.\n\nI am accordingly writing to you to have you write to the Secretary and see if they would be willing to wire the school and residence for the lights.\n\nSince I have never asked for a raise in salary in my five years work here I do not feel that I am asking too much in this request. It is so unhealthy getting coal oil in from the village and lights are such a convenience, much more so since we have been accustomed to them before coming here. I do not know how much would be the cost of the wiring, but I know that there would not be the extra expense of poles or extra wire as the school is right on the highway #25.\n\nIf you would write at once and ask for an early reply as they want the information complete by Feb. 15th.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nAlbert Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. E. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nThe Country Day School,\nOka, Que., Sept. 16, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nSir,\n\nOn Sept. 2nd, I asked Mr. Brisbois, the agent, for a broom, a boiler, wash tub, wash board, and a bread box. An indian asked him a few days later for the job of painting the woodshed. Brisbois called today and brought a broom, and said that you had not mentioned anything about the other articles on my requisition. He also brought a gallon of white paint and part of a two quart can of green paint which was left from painting the village school this summer. He said that you had said that I was to paint the wood-shed myself. I doubt that very much. In the first place I was hired here as teacher and not as painter. Secondly it puts me in a bad light with the indians as they will think that I am being paid for it when some of them should have the job. Thirdly, there are very few people who work for the government for nothing. I would advise that the work be given to one of the indians; four dollars I think should be ample. Regarding the articles mentioned they were here when we came but the bread box got so rusty that we had to discard it. The painters stood on the boiler to paint the school two years ago. The wash tub and board just plain wore out. May we not have them replaced?\n\nWhile we are at it, may I know why it was that we were not given new pipes for the school last winter. I can show you stove pipes we used last winter that had holes in them as large as quarters. I asked twice for them but funds were too low. The insurance company would not care about such evidence were it presented in case of the place being damaged by fire. May I ask also why the supply of kerosene has been cut off. When I came here in 1930 Mr. Ferrier told me that the Dept. supplied lamps and oil. Two years ago it was cut off. That is quite all right providing the payment of lights is curtailed in other schools and residences. But it is still being paid for other schools and teachers. It seems a little unfair.\n\nPlease pardon me for writing this letter direct to you but I can do nothing else. I have proof for all these statements and am willing to furnish it when needed. I do not blame you for the above. You and Mr. McGookin have been very nice about anything I have asked for in the past, and I thank you both for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

After giving this request further consideration, it has been decided to authorize the following equipment:\n\n- 1 wash boiler (copper bottom),\n- 1 tin bread box,\n- 1 bottle O'Cedar,\n- 1 zinc wash tub and board.\n\nIt would be well for you to consult the teacher before making the purchase and ascertain the type of the above equipment he requires. You should then arrange for the supplying of same.\n\nRegarding the painting of the woodshed, you may engage the services of an Indian to do this work, under the supervision of the teacher. It is understood that you have already supplied the paint required.\n\nThe Department understands that new pipes are required for the stove. You should arrange for the purchase and supplying of the quantity of stove pipe necessary.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all authorized purchases. There, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe teacher has requested that a supply of kerosene and some lamps be supplied. The Department has not furnished oil to this school during the past two or three years, but, in view of the fact that accounts are paid for lighting at the Village School, it is considered that the teacher at the Country School should be allowed a reasonable quantity of kerosene for lighting purposes only. You may purchase from a suitable retailer, 5 gallons of kerosene and also, if the teacher requires same, two lamps of an inexpensive type. We are informing the teacher that you have been instructed to arrange for the above purchases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nPaul E.

In this connection I have to say that Mr. Agent Brisebois has been instructed to arrange for the purchase of the following:\n\n- 1 wash boiler (copper bottom)\n- 1 bread box,\n- 1 bottle O'Cedar oil,\n- 1 zinc wash tub and board.\n\nThe Agent is also being requested to arrange for the services of an Indian to do the painting of the woodshed. In this connection I may say that it was considered, as only a small amount of painting was necessary, that you would be able to do this work. However, in view of your letter, the Department has authorized the Agent to arrange, as stated, for an Indian to do the work. I should be pleased, however, if you will see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nMr. Brisebois is being instructed to purchase and supply the quantity of new stove pipe required and also to arrange to supply, in a container, 5 gallons of kerosene and two lamps of an inexpensive type.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I should like to see this carried on. There are a great number of underprivileged children in this school they need it. There are 28 pupils who live an average of 1 and \u00bd miles from the school. They need it very badly when we consider the weather and roads they have to contend with in the winter here. In past years Mrs. Smith served the lunch supplying everything herself and being paid at the rate of $15.00 per month. When she counted up at the end of the term she had an average of $4.60 a month for her work. She served soup which was a good nourishing meal in itself. Why not consider the lunch as in former years for the four months of Dec., Jan., Feb., March. It really is needed badly here.\n\nAlbert E.

Harbour,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI should like to know if you have made any further arrangements regarding the installation of a furnace in the school and residence here.\n\nYou will remember that, at the time of the visit of Mr. Thibault in May, we discussed with him the advisability of putting a stove in the basement and decided that the fire hazard would be too great. I understood then that the matter would be taken up at Ottawa and that steps would be taken to have a furnace installed which would heat both school and residence.\n\nA furnace to supply the required number of units of heat for the cubic footage of this whole building should not cost very much. There is a place in the basement for a furnace with smoke and heat pipe holes already arranged.\n\nIf a furnace is not installed there will most certainly have to be a stove set in the basement to warm the floors. This would be a waste of time and money because there will have to be a furnace installed eventually. If the furnace is not put in we will have to have new lining for the both stoves in the school and for one in the residence. There will also be 20 new pipes bought to replace the ones which are now too old to do further duty. The saving on coal I believe would pay for the furnace in a few years. I would be willing to give any labour I could to help with the installation of the outfit. I am always willing to help in any way so as to save on the cost of any repairs here.\nLast winter we had two stoves going in the school and two in the residence and then we could not warm the floors. There seems always to be about a foot of cold air on the floors. Every winter we have to close school a few days owing to the cold; I teach on Saturdays to make up lost time but I do not feel like continuing this plan since the place could be warmed by a furnace.\n\nWhen I took charge of this school eight years ago I was assured that, the place being new, it would always be warm. From our first winter here we have found it to be anything else but warm and it gets worse from year to year. We have a four months old baby this year and she will have to be on the floor for a part of each day. I do not see how we can warm the floors if there is no other way of heating the residence than the method now employed.\n\nYou would be doing the pupils, my family and me a great favour if you would take this matter up with the proper persons at Ottawa and give me their decision in the very near future.\n\nThanking you for all past favours, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher-in-charge.\nOka, September 21st, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending you herewith two letters which I just received from the teacher of the Country school in Oka.\n\nI would recommend that something be done regarding the heating system of this school.\n\nAs regards to the second letter, I beg to say that a requisition was sent in June and that I recommended same by that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF Harbour,\nIndian Agent\n\nMr. P.

Do you consider that there is sufficient room in the basement of this school for a furnace and can it be taken in through the present door leading to the basement?\n\nI think it would be well to have the outside of the school banked.

I would recommend such installation because the school house is really cold.\n\nThe kitchen stove of this school would also need new fire box and lining; the price would be $13.40 and if the furnace is purchased, the replacing of the stove linings would be free of charge; that is to say the handwork.\n\nKindly let me have your immediate answer because the roads from Montreal to Oka may close at any day thus delaying the installation of the furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. R.A.

In the Country School, the outside privies are repulsing and the adjoining lot is used as a dumping ground. In the village, the privies outside are also in a very bad condition. I cannot see the reason why these children are not given modern facilities by adopting for these schools inside chemical toilets. And surely cleanliness should be strictly in force in these establishments.\n\nThe Law and our Provincial Rules demand that no child should be admitted in school if not vaccinated against smallpox. Out of 66 pupils only one is vaccinated. It is my duty to ask you to see that vaccination will be made in a very near future. I will make a control visit in eight days, after which the person in charge of the schools shall refuse to admit any child not vaccinated.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nP.S.

Elle donne une couche color\u00e9e solide et, en m\u00eame temps, p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans le bois, assurant ainsi aux bard\u00e9aux une longue dur\u00e9e et les emp\u00eachant de gauchir.\n\nMODE D'EMPLOI\n\nPreservitt est pr\u00eate \u00e0 l'usage, mais, si n\u00e9cessaire, on peut l'\u00e9claircir avec de l'huile de lin.\n\nBard\u00e9aux neufs \u2014 Une couche au pinceau ou par immersion donnera d'excellents r\u00e9sultats. Si on immerse les bard\u00e9aux il faut les faire s\u00e9cher au pied afin de permettre au surplus de peinture de s'\u00e9goutter.\n\nVieux bard\u00e9aux \u2014 Une couche, appliqu\u00e9e librement, suffit d'habitude.\n\nUn gallon de Preservitt suffit pour l'immersion d'environ 500 bard\u00e9aux, une couche. Un gallon pos\u00e9 au pinceau couvrira d'une couche environ 300 pieds carr\u00e9s.\n\nGarages, Granges, Cl\u00f4tures \u2014 Deux couches sont recommand\u00e9es pour assurer une couverture permanente et un beau fini.\n\nBoiseries d'int\u00e9rieur, Toitures en composition, Surfaces m\u00e9talliques, etc.\u2014Une ou deux couches, sans r\u00e9duction.\n\nUnequalled for the preservation of shingles\u2014protects against warping and rot.

It gives a solid colour coat to shingles and at the same time penetrates and ensures long wear and prevents warping.\n\n**DIRECTIONS**\n\nPreservitt is ready for use, but if necessary can be reduced with linseed oil.\n\n**New Shingles**\u2014One coat brushed or dipped will give good results. When dipped stand shingles on end to permit surplus to drain off.\n\n**Old Shingles**\u2014One brush coat freely applied will in most cases be sufficient.\n\nOne gallon of Preservitt dipped will cover approximately 500 shingles one coat. One gallon brushed will cover approximately 300 square feet, one coat.\n\n**Garages, Barns, Fences**\u2014Two coats are recommended for a permanent coating and a fine finish.\n\n**Exterior Woodwork, Composition Roofing, Metal Surfaces, etc.**\u2014One or two coats, without thinner.\nQuebec\nJuly 3, 1939\n\nAttention of R. H. Hoey, Esq.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFrom actual experience and inside information furnished to me by teachers who instruct in schools or who preserve, the school rooms are too dark, especially in the winter time, the following interior treatment is advisable\u2014to have the ceilings and walls washed thoroughly, then rinsed free of all traces of soap. Then one coat of Glidden Base or Priming paint over all; next the ceilings finished in cream or some reflecting color, the walls finished in delicate Green Speedwell Paint, and harmonizing trim. The net result would be a brighter and more livable school room where that was effected.\n\nThis is only a suggestion of mine, if interested I am in a position to quote you a fair and equitable price after I would have measured the size of room in question. There is one school with a northerly exposure, the other, westerly, hence suggestion.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJohn J. Angers.\nQuebec\nJuly 3rd 1939\n\nC. A.

Then one coat of Glidden's Endurance House Paint (price $2.00 per gallon) in desired color, and trim to harmonize, two coats of Glidden's Porch and deck paint on steps and porches.\n- Windows to be repainted where necessary.\n- All window wash, casing etc. to receive two coats.\nof above brand and quality. Our buildings to receive same treatment as main buildings. All material for erecting scaffolds to be supplied by me, with minimum nail holes, and repainted where they necessarily occur.\n\nThe paint to be applied evenly and just thin enough to prevent scaling, nothing in the way of linseed oil to be added to the paint and no more than one-half pint of turpentine to each gallon of house paint. Two coats of single stain on roofs. With such treatment, I can safely say that it will not be necessary to repaint within six or seven years.\n\nPrice - each school - with above specified one hundred and forty dollars, all paint to be furnished by me, so I am prepared for this district. Will be ready to start after the Oka United church shall have been repainted by me, about July 10th, ready to start with the village school, as my material is right close by, for scaffolds.\n\nBelow for your convenience, color chart and card for harmonies.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJohn Anger.\nOttawa, July 13th., 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of letter dated 3rd. instant, from John Angus, quoting a price for painting the exterior and interior of the two Day Schools on the Oka Reserve.\n\nPlease advise Mr. Angus that this letter has been received, but that as no funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for painting these buildings, it is not possible to consider quotations.\n\nI wish, also, to direct your attention to official letter of May 15th. last.

A separate voucher for $5.37 should be issued as this expenditure is charged to tuition grants. With reference to the voucher for $12.27 for supplies to the Oka Village and Country Schools you should state definitely the amount chargeable to each school. I would also point out that your account covers the period January 1 to October 7, 1940. As you are aware the items for January, February and March occurred in the fiscal year 1939-40 and should have been forwarded for payment before the end of March, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Under these circumstances the soup was quite necessary for their health. The attendance was also better during the months we served soup so we feel it should be carried on this winter if possible.\nWill you please give this matter your consideration and let me know what you decide. Thank you.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nC.J.

I was to receive $3.00 each for doing this work, making a total of $6.00.\"\n\nIf this work has been undertaken and accomplished and if you believe this is a reasonable charge, you should send forward a voucher for the amount at the earliest possible date.\n\nYou might explain to Mr. Simons that the delay in making this payment was due to the fact that no voucher for this amount had been submitted to the Department. In view of the fact that the fiscal year closed on March 31, it is of the utmost importance that vouchers for such payments should reach the Department prior to this date, if at all possible. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. F.

It was necessary for me to go to Montreal with my wife & the twins to see the hospital doctor so I got permission from the Dept. to have a holiday.\n\nI am enclosing another requisition. Since you were here Mr. Beatty visited the school and wishes me to get the French texts I have ordered. The present book we are using he said was too difficult, so advised me to order the Elson Basic Reader.\n\nWe asked for an indoor toilet before but thought the Dept. understood we wanted 2 with septic tanks for the use of the children so we are enclosing a cut of what we want and stating what is for use in the residence.\n\nI forgot the typewriter. I would like to have one as I do a lot of business correspondence and would find it very useful. The other articles we found we needed after your visit.\n\nI trust the Dept. will not think we send our requisitions too frequently as this should be for the year 1941.

However, the following improvements are necessary.\n\nIndian schools: The hydroseptic latrines should be installed in both schools. The interior of both schools should be painted white. We also beg to remind you of the following recommendations:\n\nLighting: The pupils should be placed in such a way as to receive from the left side the greatest quantity of light. They should never receive such light from in front.\n\nCloakrooms: A separate ventilated cloakroom should be provided in each school and contain a sufficient number of coat-hooks.\n\nSweeping and washing: The daily wet sweeping and the monthly washing of floors are compulsory.\n\nWells: The wells should be of good construction and well protected. In the week preceding the reopening of classes, they should be sufficiently disinfected and flushed.\n\nWe thank you for your cooperation ...\n\n(Sgd) L\u00e9onard Milot, M.D.,\nMedical Officer.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nJuly 12, 1944.\n\nR.A.

As you know, we have already authorized the painting of the Oka Country School. If you consider it necessary to paint the interior of the Oka Village School, you should let me have an estimate of the cost.\n\nIt is not our intention to install, at the present time, the type of toilets recommended by the Medical Officer. However, you should make certain that the toilets at present in use are clean and are kept in that condition throughout the academic year.\n\nIf it is possible to change the seating arrangement in the school in order to have the light from the left side, you should do so.\n\nIf any repairs are required to the wells at the schools the Department approves your arranging for the necessary work.\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6096, File 323-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAt my last visit at Oka at the beginning of this week, Mrs. Sloan, teacher at Oka Village School, complained that the roof of the School was leaking. An examination of the roof revealed that it leaked at two different places and a carpenter was requested to make an estimate for the work and material needed to repair the roof.\n\nThis was estimated to cost about $8.00 or $9.00 at the most, labour and materials.\n\nWhile at the School Mrs. Sloan requested me to apply to have a small window cut on the side of the building, in the toilet and bathroom, as when this was installed no provision for an air outlet nor window was made. This window would provide light in that room and at the same time would air the premises. This work is estimated to be of about $15.00 completed.\n\nThe teacher also pointed out that there are no lights in the back of the residence nor in the wood shed, which is located, about 35 feet from the building, this she claims is needed as she often have to go to this shed for her fuel etc., at night when alone with her two children. Although I could not obtain a price for this work from an electrician it is believed that to install a light on the veranda and in the shed would not be expensive.\n\nKindly let me know if the above requests will be granted. I wish to say that instructions have, however, be given for the patching of the roof in order to prevent deterioration of the building.\n\n(Frs.

Stensrud, teacher, pointed out that ever since she came to that School, she lacked an ice box. She is using an ordinary tub to put her ice in which she covers with a piece of tarpaulin.\n\nWhile at Oka on that same day I found a metal ice box which had only been used for about one season (the owner has recently acquired an electric refrigerator) for the sum of $22.00. This white metal ice box was paid $40.00 in September, last.\n\nWill you please authorize this purchase which is quite acceptable to the teacher, and is a bargain at that price.\n\nThe old kitchen stove which has been in use for many years is now out of order. It has been repaired on several occasions but can hardly been used at the present time.\n\nA suitable stove could be obtained locally for a sum of $159.00. This stove would be of Belanger makes. Style Marina with a warmer. Other stoves would be more costly.\n\nPlease give this request your kind consideration.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nSeptember 14, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs.

This is a branch of work which I consider vital to the cause of Christianity; since nothing can be so insensibly connected and so absolutely dependent on the education of the people for its progress.

The teachers and the pupils deserve hearty congratulations. The answers and the corrections with which questions have been answered are marvellous. Should this be taken as an indication of the teachers' competency for the work I am sure the Department will be very grateful.\n\nI have great pleasure in submitting to the Department these impressions which I received while attending the closing services of the two schools.\n\nAnd if they be allowed still further to make the following suggestion\u2014and one which I believe & therefore of the schools is that some form of recognition be made to the teachers as a sign of our appreciation of their work.\n\nThis would be of use to them in applying for other schools, as by purpose leaving this\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am here in New York doing the Indian Affairs work, and have had a lot of trouble to get what I want. The Indians are afraid to speak up for themselves, and when they do, they talk in an English manner, so that it is hard to understand them. Besides, I don't understand English.\n\nI have seen all your old men and Indians, but I have not been able to get any information from them.

Our services as teacher of this school were engaged by the Methodist Society and this Department pays only one-half your salary, that is $150.00 per annum. The other one-half is paid by the Society. On account of the very favorable reports received on your work at Oka, the Department is willing to increase its contribution to $200.00 per annum, and it may be that the authorities of the Methodist Church will be prepared to increase their grant by $50.00 also.

Sir,\n\nOn the 1st July 1909 the Department increased its contribution towards the salaries of the teachers at Oka country and Oka village schools to $150.00, upon the understanding that your society was to contribute a like increase of $25.00 in each case making their salaries $300.00 per annum. This was done upon the request of the late Rev. Dr. Sutherland. The Department is now advised that during the year which closed on June 30th last Miss White and Mrs. Smith, the teachers at Oka were paid only $250.00 per annum. You will thus see that there is owing to each of these $50.00 from your society and the Department trusts that this amount will be forwarded to each of these teachers at an early date.\n\nI may also add for your information that the Department has decided to grant Mrs. Smith a further increase of $50.00, but this was made unconditionally. It is very desirable that Mrs. Smith's services should be continued at the village school and as an inducement to retain this increase was offered. Her salary will, therefore, be next year at the rate of $350.00 per annum, unless you can see fit to grant also a sum equal to that promised by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T.

A.\nOttawa, September 25, 1913.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nReplying to your inquiry of today's date in regard to the Oka schools I beg to say that the Department contributes to the Oka Country School $150.00 and to the Village School $250.00, the Methodist Missionary Society being responsible for the balance of the salary in each case.\n\nThe discrepancy in the contributions of the Department may be explained in this way. Up to the year 1909 the salary allowed at each of these schools was only $250.00, one-half of which was paid by the Department and one-half by the church. On July 1, 1909, the salaries were increased to $300.00, one-half to be paid by the Department. On November 30, 1910, in order to retain the services of Mrs. Smith, who is a very competent teacher, at the Village School, the Department increased its contribution to $250.00, making her total salary $400.00. The salary at the Country School was not increased for the reason that the teacher in charge was not so competent, being an Indian girl named Miss White. Since 1910 there has\nhas been no change in the contribution of the Department to either school. Miss White resigned last year and in January of the current year Miss Lunan took charge of the Country School. Although she has not professional qualifications she is well recommended. There is not much difference in the average attendance at the two schools for the past year, being 11 at the Country and 14 at the Village.\n\nThere is no application on file from the Methodist Church for an increase in the grant to the Country School, but there would not appear to be any reason why, if the present incumbent is competent, the grant to the Country School should not be increased by $100.00.\n\nI may say that there is no inspection made of these schools by the school inspector of the district and so far as I know they have never been inspected by any officer of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe this has been recognized, but there are five or six heirs entitled to share in it and one of them is away in the States and his signature cannot be obtained. The others have all signed and I think that it would be only fair to pay the money to the people that have signed and hold the balance for the man that is entitled to it, unless a release is obtained in the meantime.\nOttawa, September 1, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to the question of the amount of rent owing for the Oka Village School building I beg to say that the Department holds this building under lease for five years from the first of October, 1910, at $60.00 per annum. When the building was leased it was agreed that the Department should have it repaired and deduct the amount expended for the repairs from the rent. On the first of October, next, the rent would amount to $300.00 and as the sum of $289.48 was spent in the repairs there is only $10.52 due. Kindly advise the Department to whom this amount should be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Thos. Whitebeans,\nOka, Que.\nI beg to say that everything has been restored from the Oka village school. I removed myself all the desks and the books to the Oka country school hall and the store and the desk for the teacher have been put into storage in the shed of the Methodist church for a while.\n\nNow what shall I do with the key of that house?\n\nAs far as to read you soon I remain\n\nYour servant,\n\nC.F. Bertrand\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 4, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo stating that you have had everything removed from the Oka Village School and asking what you are to do with the key of the building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should hand the key to the owner of the house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Bertrand, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Can.\n\nSir,\n\nRE: Village School rent.\n\nReplying to your letter No.152216/1, I beg to say that if there is any rent due on the school house in the village it should go to Mrs. Cyrus Cooke. She and her brother Baptiste Gaspe owns the building, but Mrs. Cooke has the sole use of the property.\n\nI think there is a mistake in your figures by one year. You say that on the first of October next the rent would amount to $300.00 but I say $240.00 as it will only be four years since we leased it. So according to that we are entitled to the house for ten more months, but I would beg the Department to give Mrs. Cooke this, as she is a poor woman. She has been moving about a lot since we took her house and the Department would be doing her kindness to give back her house unconditionally.\n\nI remain,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n(Rv) Theo Whitecans\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the building formerly used for the Oka Village School.\n\nOwing to a clerical error it was stated in official letter of the last instant that the amount of rent due on October 1st next would be $300.00. Instead the Department finds that the amount of rent due on that date will be $240.00 and as there has already been expended the amount of $250.00 on repairs to this building, no further payment is due by the Department.\n\nAgent Bertrand was requested in official letter dated September 4th to hand over the key of the house to the owner. Mrs. Cyrus Cooke should, therefore, apply to Agent Bertrand for the key.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Thos.

A part of this statement which is of interest to the Indian Department is presented herewith.\n\nI should be very glad to learn the attitude of the Department on this question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nRev. J. J. Oke, the minister in charge of the Oka Mission, pointed out that there were twenty-three children of school age within a radius of three-quarters of a mile of the village, who would attend a school at the village, if one were provided.\n\nIn addition to this there are four children of school age living about three and a half miles from the village who are now attending a Roman Catholic School in the country because there is no protestant school at Oka.\n\nRev. Mr. Oke, who is also a member of the band, has three children not included above who are beyond the public school grades and desire further education. For this they would have to go away from home.\n\nThere is a Protestant School five miles from Oka which has an attendance of about eighteen pupils. Of those attending this school the farthest is about seven miles from the village.\n\nIf a school with two teachers and taking the higher grades could be provided at Oka Village and the school closed in the country, two of the Rev. Mr. Oke's older children would thus be provided for and two children of other families would attend also.\n\nIn the event of this arrangement being carried out it would be necessary to provide a team to carry the children now attending the school in the country to the school at Oka village.\n\nIt was moved by Mr. J. T. Ewart and seconded by Rev. W. G. A. Wilson that in view of these facts we strongly recommend the Mission Board to take steps to secure a school with two teachers and teaching the model grades at Oka village. It was unanimously agreed.\n\nA building for such a school is available but in order to have two rooms it would be necessary to raise the roof four or five feet. This building was formerly used as a school. It is understood that the Indian Department would be asked to bear a considerable part of the expense of such a school.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nIn reference to Rev. Mr. Arnaud's letter and enclosure attached I beg to make the following comments.\n\nWhen I was at Oka last year I was informed that there were thirteen children of school age in the village and this number included those of Rev. Mr. Oka's family. There are about eleven Protestant families in the village and about thirty-nine in the country, eight of which might be said to be nearer the village than the present country school. This shows that the great majority of the Indians permanently live in the country while the villagers are comparatively few and migratory and the population is on the decrease yearly as the Indians are going on farms.\n\nWith regard to the statement that four children are attending Roman Catholic school. I assume that this has reference to Joseph Cree, who lives among the French farmers some five miles from Oka and whose children are attending the Cote Rouge Public (French) school, which is not half a mile from his place. Last spring he told me that his children were attending this school, but were not being interfered with in their religious beliefs by the priest or any individual in the Township of the District and the teacher in this regard. Knowing the condition of the road between Cote Rouge and Oka, I do not think that Cree's children would ever become regular attendants at a village school if the same were re-opened.\n\nAs regards Rev. P. Oka; he is the local missionary to the Indians and native - member of the St. Regis band. He has a family of eight. Being an outsider and whose influence is unknown to the Indians, it is impossible for him to be called upon to distribute the scanty allowance to the dissolute are of the majority of the Indians. In order to give his children the advantages of schooling practically at their own door, he is well equipped to send his children to the country school as he has a team of oxen driving horses. Moreover the change would involve considerable additional expense. The building which is held in view for a school would have to be rented and altered. The item of conveying the country children to the village would be considerably increased as it is likely it will be necessary to provide two riders. The matter of conveying the children to school has been tried at Oka two or three years ago and has proven unsatisfactory. The present officer has complained more than once that few of the country children who live near the school do not attend owing to lack of proper clothing. It would therefore be out of question to expect these and others to go five or six miles to school.\nThe finding and action of the Commissioners of the Montreal District of the Methodist Church appear to be based on information received from a single and apparently interested source through the present local missionary who has, ever since his return to Canada been agitating for this change. If the Department is disposed to give additional educational advantages to the children of the village, I would suggest that a school be opened as an experiment, and then during the winter months only, Mrs. (Rev.) Macdonald holds a teacher's certificate and could be engaged as a teacher for $25.00 a month and a house could be rented for $4.00 a month. This arrangement might be a little more expensive than engaging a man to drive the children to the country school, but I am of the opinion the results would be more satisfactory.\n\nChas. Clarke\n\nNovember 23, 1918.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the memorandum which accompanied the letter from the Rev. Mr. Arnup, Assistant Secretary for Foreign Missions of the Methodist Missionary Society, regarding school matters on the Oka Reserve I beg to say that there are not enough children of school age on this reserve to justify two schools being maintained there. The majority of the Indians live in the neighbourhood of the Country School and apparently Mr. Oke's desire for the re-opening of the Village School is more in the interests of his own children than the rest of the band.\n\nThe Department has done very well by Mr. Oke, as it allowed him $200.00 a year for the education of his children in Cornwall for four years while he was missionary on Cornwall Island. Since he has been at Oka he has been driving the remainder of his family who are old enough to attend school up to the Country School, as he has horses of his own. In fact he told me that, if the Department would undertake to drive the children to school, he would like to do this work.\n\nAs Mrs. Oke is a qualified teacher, she is quite competent to look after the education of her own children on any days that they are unable to attend the Country School.\n\nThe Department tried the experiment of collecting the children and driving them to school, but it was found to be a failure, and I agree with Mr. Cooke that there is no need for another school on this reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6097, file 324-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDecember 4th, 1918.\n\nRev Sir -\n\nI have given consideration to your letter of November 20th, in reference to the representations made to you regarding school facilities on the Oka Reserve.\n\nAs you may be aware we conducted a school in the village for sometime, but were forced to close through lack of attendance. The majority of the Protestant children on the reserve reside in the rural district and not in the village. Even there the attendance is very unsatisfactory among those who are within a reasonable distance of the school.\n\nWe tried the experiment of conveying the children to the country school, but that proved a failure, and I do not think that we could favourably consider conveying them from the country into the village.\n\nIt seems to me that a school must be conducted in the country for the benefit of the Indians now resident there, as well as for those who in the future may wish to leave the village to follow agriculture, as some are now doing. While I sympathize with Mr. Oke's ambition to have his own children educated, I cannot see that the Department should be called upon to establish a second school in the village without reasonable certainty of success, and, from the information I have, any degree of success is highly problematical. In no event could I consider the establishment of a higher grade school where there are no children of the band (Mr. Oke is not a member) to obtain any practical benefit therefrom.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances I regret that I cannot see my way clear to make any change at present in the existing arrangement on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. H. Arnup, B.A.,\nAsst.

The non-success was due to the fact that the driver did not satisfy the parents or his conduct with the children and did not feel comfortable with the Department's instructions regarding the complaint made by the parents in that case.\n\nIn regard to the driver, I have been informed that Mr. Howard Oke will be a suitable man to do the work for he has two good strong horses, but he has no suitable furs.

Oke, Missionary at Oka, and also from the teacher of the Oka Country School that arrangements be made to have the Indian children residing in the village and vicinity conveyed to and from the school. This application is endorsed by Mr. Agent Bertrand.\n\nThe Agent has forwarded a list of the families residing in the village and vicinity, comprising 24 children of school age, and also a list of the families having children who reside on the main road between the village and the school and over a mile and a half from the school, a total of 12 children. This comprises a total of 36 children who do not attend the Oka Country School on account of the distance they have to travel. The distance from the village to the Country School is about five miles. There are 61 children of school age on the reserve, who should be in school, but the return received for the June quarter shows an enrolment of 28, with an average daily attendance of 7, and for the September quarter an enrolment of 19, with an average attendance of 5.\n\nThe Department arranged for the driving of the children in the village and vicinity during the winter of 1915-16 and, after giving this system a trial, it proved unsatisfactory, mainly owing to the fact that the driver did not have a proper rig or sufficient rugs to keep the children warm during the journey.\n\nBoth the Agent and Rev. Mr. Oke advise that another attempt be made this winter to have the children conveyed.\nconveyed to school and recommend that G. Howard Oke, a son of the missionary, as a suitable man to do the work. He has two good horses, but no suitable rig, and they request that the Department supply a covered bus and robes, which could be used in all seasons. The cost of conveying the children during the winter of 1915-16 was $35.00 per month.\n\nMr. Oke suggested that, if the conveying of the children be not entertained, a school be re-opened in the village. He stated that a suitable building could be rented for the purpose and, if this were done, it would be necessary to provide desks and school material.\n\nI submit this matter for your consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is a serious situation that demands immediate attention.\n\nThe appointment of a driver only would partly meet the demands of the situation. I know this was a failure three or four years ago, but the appointment was made without any regard to the comfort of the children, many of whom are not clad warmly enough for a drive four miles without cover. And I may say the moral character of the driver had a great deal to do with the failure.\n\nThe primary need, in view of the circumstances of the children is a covered vehicle which would be some protection from rain & cold.\nThis should be furnished the driver by the Department. Of course an ordinary express or democrat for the time being could be pressed into service until a better one is secured, and I may say my son Howard who was asked by the Agent to drive has that as well as robes.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nJ.J.

If so, you should give the size of the building, its present condition, the name of the owner and the amount or rent per month for which it could be secured. At the time the school in the village was closed there was a good equipment of school desks, a teacher's desk and blackboards. You will be good enough to state where these desks are and if any of them are available for use and the condition they are in, also whether it would be necessary to obtain any new desks. It might be more in the interest of the children residing in the village to re-open the school there than to have them conveyed to the Country School.\n\nBefore the Department can deal with either the question of re-opening the village school or arranging for the transport of the children to the Country School it will be necessary for you to reply as fully as possible, giving the information asked for above.

I enclose herewith a list of children living on these sections of the settlement.\n\nThe scheme of driving these children to the present Country school, if put in operation, would, in my opinion, not meet the desired end, owing principally to the distance and the widely scattered settlements to be covered, and the antipathy of the parents to the scheme. The cost will be in the neighborhood of $500. Agent Bertrand is prepared to undertake the work for $500 a year (10 months) and provide his own equipment, while A. Howard Oke, an Indian, will do the same for $400.00 a year and the Department to provide the equipment - vehicles, robes, etc., which will at least cost $200.\n\nThe only alternative is to re-open a school in the village and I would recommend that this be done. The building formerly used as a school, belonging to Chief J.B. Gaspe, is available and in good condition and\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncan be had for $6.00 a month. The out-houses - wood-\nshed and closets-are also in good repair. The desks\nfor the teacher and pupils are still in good condition\nand can be had at any time. The children's desks are\nat present in the country school, not used, and the\nteacher's desk is with the resident missionary, Rev.\nMr. Oke. A wood stove and stovepipes costing about\n$20.00, 15 cords of wood at $5.75 per cord, a hand bell\nand a supply of school material will have to be purchased.\nA caretaker at a salary of $50.00 a year will have to be\nappointed. Chief J. B. Casey is prepared to accept\nthis position. I am told by the Methodist missionary\nauthorities that there would be no difficulty in secur-\ning the services of a teacher by the 1st of January,\nnext. The teacher can readily find quarters in any of\nthe several boarding houses kept by the Indians and\nwhites in the village.\n\nThe expenditure incidental on the re-estab-\nlishment of a school in the village may exceed the cost\nthat would likely be incurred in driving the children\nto the Country school, but it certainly will be much more\nsatisfactory to all parties concerned. The children in\nthe village will certainly all attend, and some of those\nin the country as well, but there is a doubt as to what\nsome of the parents of the latter will do. The mind of\nthe parents, like the Gabriels, Crees, Rivers, Coles,\netc., living on this section of the settlement, is so\nclotted with distrust against the Department that any-\nthing that is done for them finds no response not even\nappreciation. In view of the long-standing hostile\nattitude of these Indians and the duty of the Government\non the other hand to see that it gets proper returns\nfor its efforts and expenditure of means for these people, that I am at times led to the belief that it would be far better to hand the matter of their education over to the provincial authorities. It would at least have the effect of awakening them to the fact of their gradual and ultimate assimilation with the whites.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas H. Croker\nOttawa, December 3, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in reference to the re-opening of the day school in Oka Village.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that it has been considered in the best interests of the Indian children to re-open the Village School, rather than to arrange for their transport each day to and from the Country School. I have, therefore, to request that you will at once take the necessary steps to secure the house of J. B. Gasp\u00e9 at the rent mentioned by you, namely, $6.00 per month. You should obtain lease of the house from Gasp\u00e9 and forward it to the Department.\n\nAs soon as this has been secured you should have the desks, which formerly belonged to this school, brought back from the Country School, where they are at present, and the teacher's desk from the resident missionary and have them installed in the house to be used for the Village School.\n\nYou will also be good enough to arrange for the purchase of fifteen cords of wood at $5.75 per cord. This wood can, no doubt, be obtained from Joseph Cree and the amount charged therefor can be applied to his loan from the Department.\n\nA wood stove and the necessary stove pipes will also be required, and I have to request that you will obtain prices from a number of dealers and purchase the stove from the firm quoting the lowest price for a suitable one. It is considered that the stove and stove pipes should not cost more than $20.00.\n\nThe Department would like to have the house fit up and ready to re-open the school on or about the first January, next.\n\nThe Methodist Missionary Society, under whose auspices the school will be conducted, are being requested to nominate a suitable person as teacher. The Department is informed that a teacher can readily find accommodation in one or other of the several boarding houses kept by the Indians and whites in the village. As soon as a teacher is secured you will be informed.\n\nIt will also be necessary to secure the services of a competent man as caretaker. The Department is informed that\n\nO. F. Bertrand, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6007, file 324-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthat J. B. Gaspe is prepared to accept this position at a salary of $50.00 per annum, and you will be good enough to engage his services, to commence duties as soon as the school re-opens.\n\nIf blackboards are required, you will be good enough to furnish at once the dimensions of the same. A supply of school material will be sent you in due course, which you will be good enough to see that the teacher receives.\n\nYou may inform the Indian parents of the Department's intention to re-open this school at the beginning of the new year. It is hoped that they will send their children regularly and that every assistance will be given by you to make this school a success.\n\nThe Department is informed that the house which you are asked to secure from J. B. Gaspe is in good condition and that the outhouses, woodshed and closets, are also in good repair.\n\nYou will be good enough to attend to all the above matters at once, in order that the building may be fitted up and ready for the teacher to begin duties the first of the new year.\n\nThe Department is informed that there are thirteen children of school age in the village of Oka and fourteen who reside in the country, along the middle road and near the village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 3, 1919.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department, after making full inquiry into the educational facilities on the Oka Reserve, has decided to re-open the school in the village. The building formerly used as a school has been secured and the necessary equipment will be installed. It is hoped to have the school ready to re-open on or about the first of January, next.\n\nAs this school will be conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, I have to request that you will be good enough to obtain the services of a suitable teacher. The name, age and qualifications of the person secured by you should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. A salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum will be paid for a qualified teacher.\n\nThe Department will be pleased if you will give this matter your prompt attention and endeavour to have a teacher engaged, to begin duties by the first of the new year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

WEST\nTORONTO, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring again to your letter of December 3rd - No.152216/1 - I beg to say that I am today in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Robert Smith, Chairman of the Montreal District of the Methodist Church, explaining the appointment of Miss Helen Earl, as school teacher at Oka.\n\nA quotation from his letter will probably answer your enquiry about as fully as it is possible to do it. He writes as follows:\n\n\"Miss Helen Earl, who is at Oka, has a fair education, having had High School privileges, is a graduate of the Deaconess Training School, and has had charge of Fresh Air Camps at Whitby, Ont., and some other place, for years. She seems to be well adapted to the work in which she is engaged at Oka, but has no diploma. I have had the impression that a diploma was not essential in schools among Indians, provided the teacher was satisfactory otherwise. Miss Earl thoroughly enjoys her work and, as I stated before, Rev. J.J.Oke says she is doing splendid work.\"\n\nMiss Earl was very highly recommended to Mr. Smith. She is from Spencerville, and has been engaged subject to proving satisfactory. She began her duties on November 4th, and has an enrolment of fifteen scholars. Our information is to the effect that the children are taking great interest in her work, and are attending school regularly.\n\nI hope the appointment will be satisfactory to the Indian Department.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 15, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant furnishing information regarding the appointment of Miss Helen Earle as teacher of the Village School on the Oka Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is satisfactory and the appointment of Miss Earle is approved. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as was paid Miss Stetler, the former teacher, namely, $500.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $100.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. It is noted that she took up her duties on November 4th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning,\nGeneral Secretary Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto, Ont.\nwould be a good time to gather in the children by officers outside of Okan. The excursions offered by the parents during the winter would not be valid now.\n\nI might say that having acquainted myself with the school situation here in Okan I find that the present arrangements for the enforcement of school attendance is\n\nyours respectfully,\n\nHelen Earl (teacher)\nOkan Village School\n\nThe Indian agent is in buying carrying on a provision and grocery store. Strict enforcement of the law on his part would mean the loss of custom and\nI have a personal knowledge of two cases where (Paul Nelson and Mrs. A. J. Jacobs) were served with summonses to appear before the Agent for refusing to send their children to school. To protect his business interests the Agent let these two cases off in suspended sentence.\n\nI am personally convinced that the only effective way to secure compulsory attendance is for the Department to send in reality is single handed in officials (mounted police) to be on the ground. The more fact of their presence will go a long way towards changing the attitude of the parents. In fact to deal successfully with the whole situation would be too deal with his personal feelings and once his business interests are broken the buck stops at the Agent's in general in matters.\n\nThe winter is over and summer practically here. This\nOttawa, April 12, 1921.\n\nMadam,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant regarding the school attendance on the Oka Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is well aware of the apathy of the Indian parents regarding education. The Department has recently taken this matter up with Mr. Agent Bertrand with a view to securing the services of another truant officer, if the present officer does not perform his duty.

He has arranged with Miss Vera Simons to take charge of this School in September, subject to the approval of the Indian Department.\n\nHe says that Miss Simons is a Deaconess, who has been engaged as Travellers' Aid in Montreal for the last three years. She has taught art and music for years. When she left Albion College, Michigan, she was qualified for freshman's standing and would have been entered as such had she remained there. She has in addition a Diploma in Religious Education, and he feels satisfied that she is well qualified to do the work at Oka, and besides would render great service in the homes of the people there by her visits among them.

Saunders' services as teacher of the Oka Country School be dispensed with and that another teacher be engaged. I am taking this matter up with the Chairman of the Montreal District and will report to you when I hear from him.\n\nYou state in your letter that it will also be necessary to obtain a teacher for the Oka Village School, as Miss Helen Earl, the former teacher, has resigned. In a letter received from Mr. Russell T. Ferrier under date of May 15th, he approves of the appointment of Miss Vera Simons as teacher of the Oka Village School, in place of Miss Earl; also stating that he is informing the Agent at Oka of the resignation of Miss Earl and the appointment of Miss Simons to succeed her.

Robert Smith, Chairman of the Montreal District, secured as a temporary supply for the school Mrs. Oke, the wife of the Missionary of the Methodist Church at Oka.\n\nHe has now succeeded in securing as a permanent teacher for the remainder of this school year, Miss Helen Earl. A letter from him this morning informs me that she is now in charge of the Oka Village School. Is this arrangement satisfactory to you?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 23rd, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that Miss Vera Simons has resigned as teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, and that the Chairman of the Montreal District has succeeded in securing as a permanent teacher for the remainder of the present school year, Miss Helen Earl.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are pleased to approve of the appointment of Miss Earl for the balance of the school year. Miss Earl's services during the period she formerly taught this school were satisfactory. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $500 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nWe are informing the local Indian Agent of the appointment of Miss Earl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. E. Manning, P.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nMethodist Church,\nWesley Buildings,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 23rd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nWe are informed by the authorities of the Methodist Church, under whose auspices the Oka Village Indian Day School is conducted, that Miss Vera Simons has resigned her position as teacher and that, pending the appointment of another teacher, the temporary services of Mrs. Oke, the wife of the missionary, had been secured.\n\nThe General Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the Methodist Church now informs the Department that Miss Helen Earl has been engaged for the balance of the present school year, and that she is now in charge of the work. Her appointment has been approved, and the salary allowed her will be at the rate of $500 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department the date on which Miss Simons gave up duties, the number of days taught by Mrs. Oke, and the date on which Miss Helen Earl began duties.\n\nI shall also be pleased if you will give Miss Earl any assistance you can in her work at this school, and endeavour to have the Indian parents see that their children who are in good health attend each day school is in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. P. Blanchette, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd of November, I wish to say that Mrs. Vera Simon left the school on the 31st of October, 1922, and Mrs. Oke, wife of the Minister, took charge from the first to the 15th of November, and Miss Helen Earl started on the 16th of November. There was, therefore, no interruption at the school and the attendance of the children is good.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nL. P.

Mr. Barner, Superintendent of our Indian Missions, with whom I have discussed the matter, thinks that I should apply for a salary of $600, with any bonus provided by law. Could not the Department see its way clear to grant this amount?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa December 12th, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the salary allowed Miss Helen Earl, who was recently appointed teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that the Department, in view of the qualifications which Miss Earl possesses, will allow her a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, from the date she begins duties, this will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law. We are informed by our Agent at Oka that Miss Earl began duties on the 16th of November last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E.

A request has been received that Miss Earl be allowed $600.00 per annum. In view of the qualifications which she possesses and the success with which she has met in her work, the Department is allowing her salary at the above rate from the day she resumes duties at this School. I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Earl accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. P. Blanchette, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nWith regard to the school question -- this also requires attention, but it seems to me that owing to the condition of the roads at the present time, on account of snow, no action should be taken outside of the Village itself at the present time; but the matter should be taken up by the Department in the spring.\n\nSgt. L.J. Robertson.\nDear Sir,\n\nRecently I have been annoyed by one of the mothers of the school children calling at the school complaining that her son is being ill treated and abused. I may say that the alleged ill treatment is purely fabrication.\n\nBefore taking any steps to stop the repeated annoyances, I would consult the Department what in this matter I should do? I understand that Mrs John White gave similar trouble at Gibson Reserve.\n\nI might say that I do not believe in making more or less of her son than the other children, otherwise the\ndiscipline of the school would be destroyed entirely and I as a teacher would lose the confidence of the people.\n\nAwaiting an early reply,\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl.\n\nAka, June:\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI am sending you herewith a letter from Miss Helen Earl the village school teacher in which she is complaining about annoyances from scholars' parents.\n\nMiss Hilda Oka from the country school had also the same case some time ago and the trouble was caused by Mrs Peter Nelson.\n\nI would ask the Department to arrange in such a manner as to stop those troubles.\n\nYour kind attention to the matter will greatly oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nI am sending you herewith a letter from Miss Helen Earl the village school teacher in which she is complaining about annoyances from scholars' parents.\n\nMiss Hilda Oka from the country school had also the same case some time ago and the trouble was caused by Mrs Peter Nelson.\n\nI would ask the Department to arrange in such a manner as to stop those troubles.\n\nYour kind attention to the matter will greatly oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, Feb. 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Helen Earl, Teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, in which she complains about the annoyance caused by the repeated visits of some Indian parents to the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, on the occasion of the parent's first visit, the teacher should receive them courteously and endeavour to explain the work that is being undertaken for the good of their children. However, if they persist in calling at the school, they should be refused admission and warned against trespassing. If, after this warning, they still refuse to cease annoying the teacher, they could be arrested for trespassing on the school property. You and the teacher should inform the parents who have persisted in visiting the school that they must cease disturbing the classes, or action will be taken to have them arrested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nPossibly the fact is unknown that Oka is a summer resort and entirely different from rural conditions. The cost of living is very much the same as the city. The consequence is that the teacher is at a greater expense in board, lodging etc., than she would be teaching in a rural community.\n\nThe personal appearance as will be seen in a situation like this is an important factor in the success of the work. This is not so prominent in a rural condition. The dress is another factor which all concede as important in the education of people, especially Indians.\n\nI purposely leave unmentioned qualifications which I think will be taken for granted.\n\nIn view of this a salary at the rate of six hundred per annum is entirely inadequate. Teachers elsewhere under similar conditions receive nothing less than nine hundred.\n\nI love my work & see satisfactory\nresult and should be exceedingly sorry if I should be forced by necessity to leave it. I may say the conditions in the Country school is exactly similar.\n\nI trust in view of this the Department will be generous and just in determining the salary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHelen Earl.\nSir,\n\nI am receiving from the school teacher, Miss Earl a letter in which she is asking the Department for an increase of her salary. After reading the letter over, I may say that the facts related are true and that I cannot do otherwise than recommend said letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Harbour,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 18, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Helen Earl, Teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, in which she applies for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Earl was granted an increase of $100 in her salary when she resumed charge of this school in November, last. She is now in receipt of a salary of $600 per annum, supplemented by a bonus at the rate of $150 per annum, which, together, work out at approximately $75 per month. I might point out that Miss Earl has no professional qualifications, and it is considered that the salary she receives would compare favourably with that paid teachers in the neighbouring rural white schools. We are not prepared, at the present time, to grant an increase in her salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to letter written you some time ago re. increase in salary, as I have found it difficult to meet expenses with present salary, would appreciate it if you could let me know before I make application for school for another year if you would give me $75 per month with bonus.\n\nI have enjoyed the work in the school this year and trust same has been satisfactory.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl\nSpencerville RR 2,\nOntario.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, requesting that an increase in salary be granted you as teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after fully considering your request, the total amount of increase we can allow is $50. This will make your salary at the rate of $60 per annum, which, supplemented by bonus at the rate of $150 per annum, will work out at approximately $80 per month, for the ten teaching months in the year. I would point out that you have no professional qualifications, and it is considered that this salary will compare favourably with that paid teachers in the neighbouring rural white schools.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear definitely at a later date as to whether you will accept the position for next year and be prepared to resume duties on or about September 4th, next, when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We informed her that we would allow her an increase of $50, making her salary at the rate of $650 per annum, which, supplemented by the bonus at the rate of $450 per annum, would work out at approximately $80 per month, for the ten teaching months in the school year. We have asked her to state definitely whether she will accept the position or not in view of the increase which has been offered her.

Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to call the attention of the Department of one Ralph Gabrielle who since he came to school in November last has played truant and otherwise committed depredations about the school.\n\nHe is absolutely incorrigible. He is the son of Chief Jos. Gabrielle. He came to me with no home training whatever. He has been a problem to me. I have exhausted all means of helping the boy and all my efforts have proved useless.\n\nThe outlook for this boy is anything but promising. I am sure if he is not taken in to some Correctional Institution he will prove dangerous, as he shows symptoms of anti-social tendencies. I cannot have him coming to my school for the sake of the other children. His influence over the others is immoral and reactionary.\n\nCan the Department do something for this boy. If placed in a Reformatory just at this time it might prove his salvation.\nHe would at least be occupied with some constructive program, but home he has nothing to do but loaf and does worse at school. It is impossible to influence the boy through his parents to something better.\n\nAfter studying his case in his home life and his social environment I have come to the conclusion that he can only be saved by taking him now to a Reformatory of some kind.\n\nI'm quite positive for the sake of the school discipline he should not be allowed to attend. I make this suggestion to the Department because of my interest in the welfare of this boy.\n\nAwaiting an early reply,\n\nI am\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl.\nOttawa, April 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the letter of the 9th instant, signed jointly by Miss Helen Earl and yourself, with reference to Ralph Gabrielle who has been attending the Oka Village Indian Day School. I have noted this lad is incorrigible and that you recommend a reformatory term. In reply I have to inform you that this boy should not be allowed to attend the village day school. Please inform the teacher as well as the parents.

I examined some of the work being done by the pupils and found it very creditable. The teacher at this school appears to take a great interest in her work and when given a proper school building should show excellent results.

My regular pupils demand all my time and I cannot give these children the proper attention. Before dismissing them I wish to know if there any way of securing a teacher for these little ones.\n\nAs you well know the Indian child is naturally slow to respond.

Manning,\nMission Rooms,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a recent interview of my Father with Russell T. Ferrier, of the Indian Department, he was informed that there have been no names submitted as yet to him for teacher for the Village School at Oka.\n\nI concluded from this, rightly or wrongly, that there was no appointment made yet for the Village School and decided to apply for the position.\n\nI have passed and obtained my teaching Diploma at Macdonald College, Teacher Training School. I have also obtained certificates in Physical Training and Music.\n\nIn addition to these qualifications, may add that I have perfect acquaintance with the demands and difficulties of this school, as I have been intimately in touch with the school work all these years and often supplied during the illness of the teacher.\n\nMoreover requests have been coming in from the parents of the children urgently asking me to apply for the position and become their teacher. I have thus far submitted to their wishes in making this formal application for the position.\n\nI am aware, through my father, of the attitude of Mr. Ferrier towards the teachers who are Indians. No doubt this attitude is justified but I may say he can hardly with justice place me in the same category.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(signed) LAURA HILDA OKA.\nThe United Church of Canada\nBoard of Home Missions\n\n299 Queen St. West\nToronto 2, Ontario\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

I note that in a letter from the Department, bearing date of July 12th, doubt is expressed as to the advisability of appointing Miss Oke as teacher at the Oka Village School. You may have reasons for objecting to her appointment with which I am not familiar, but from any information I have I am inclined to think that she would make a success of teaching this school. Her mother, as doubtless you know, is a white woman and her father is an Indian of rather exceptional ability, and I would take it from her letter that she has undergone a thorough training.\n\nThe other application is from Miss Kathleen F. Armstrong who served as supply teacher for a time at the Mount Elgin Institute. I do not know much about her qualifications other than that she has Normal School training. I am inclined to think that Miss Oke would be the more efficient. Would it not be advisable to give her a trial?\n\nI appreciate the fact that the school opens on the first of September and that action must be taken immediately. Since I came to the office a week ago I have been doing the best I could to secure a teacher for the Oka Village School, but so far have no one to recommend except Miss Oke whom I believe would fill the position more satisfactorily than Miss Armstrong. Could you not see your way clear to agree to her appointment?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nIndian Affairs.

I received my academic training at the Goderich Collegiate Institute and my professional training at the Ottawa Normal School.\n\nI have had twelve years' experience in the actual work of teaching \u2014 six years prior to my marriage and six years subsequent to it. Three of these years were spent as primary teacher in a four-roomed graded school (Blyth, Ont.) and nine years in country schools. I have also had experience in Fifth Class work so that I am conversant with all phases of a teacher's work.\n\nI spent five years in my last position, S.S.W. 4, Holland Township, Grey County, and would still have been there had I not had to resign June, 1927 in order to take care of my mother through a long and fatal illness.\n\nWhile in this school I had conspicuous\nsuccess with my Entrance pupils. During three different years my pupils obtained the highest standing at the Bhatworth examination centre and all my pupils in this school made excellent progress.\n\nI am Protestant in religion\u2014a member of First United Church, Owen Sound of which Rev. W. J. Scott M.A. is the minister. I will, very cheerfully, assist in church choir, Sunday School or any community work, if I am desired to do so.\n\nI have excellent health, am of an active, equable temperament and possess a strong, robust physique.\n\nMy family consists of my husband (a returned soldier), a nineteen-year-old daughter, who is a teacher, and a thirteen-year-old son. The only one to accompany me will be my young son. Should you regard my application favourably, I presume it will not be against regulations for my son to attend the Indian School. He is in the Entrance Class and a well-conducted, healthy boy. Also, providing I am the successful applicant, I should like to know if the school is at Lake Croker or at Port Elgin near Kinondoni. I am not quite clear on this point. I am enclosing copies of testimonials from the School Board of the various schools of which I have been teacher.\n\nIn conclusion, sir, should my application meet with your approval, you may rely upon my doing my utmost to promote the physical, mental and moral welfare of the children intrusted to my care.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Mrs.) Bertha Tupper,\n2345-4th Ave West, Owen Sound, Ont.\n\n(Phone 11837)\nOttawa, August 13th, 1928.\n\nMrs. Bertha Tupper,\n2245 Fourth Ave. W.,\nOwen Sound, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent Moore Cape Croker has forwarded your application for Port Elgin Indian School STOP This position has been offered to another teacher but Indian Department can offer you ninety dollars per teaching month at Oka Village Indian Day School twenty miles west of Montreal duties to commence September fourth STOP Furnished heated residence supplied STOP Telegraph reply collect\n\nA.

It is my desire to give my children a Protestant English education. The school has started and the oldest one had trouble getting into it. I went to investigate and Mrs. Tupper, the Oka Protestant school teacher, told me she was not obliged to teach white children as the school was for Indian children. I am willing to do all that is in my power to cooperate with said teacher to have my children educated. I know my children are unruly at times, but if the teacher could comply with my request, I can vouch to say my children will be educated. If at any time I am notified my children are unruly, they are white father married to an Indian wife should not obstruct our children being educated in Oka. Please confirm and a word of reply would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGeorge Albert\nOttawa, April 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the attendance of your children at the Oka Village Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that the Department is making enquiry regarding the matter, which will receive consideration upon receipt of the report which is being requested. However, I would point out that, as you are a white man, this Department is under no responsibility to provide education facilities for your children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. George Albert,\nOka,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, April 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from George Albert, of Oka, Que., regarding his children, who, it appears from his letter, have been attending the Oka Village Indian Day School. He states that, owing to the fact that there was trouble created by these children, Mrs. Tupper, the teacher, has refused to admit them.\n\nThe Department understands that George Albert is a white man, married to an Indian woman. Please state if he is living on the Oka reserve. If he is a white man, this Department would be under no responsibility for the education of his children. Is there no white school near where his children could attend? I shall be pleased to have a full report from you at your earliest convenience, regarding the attendance of this man's children at the Oka Village Indian Day School. Please state the names and ages of these children and if there is accommodation for them in our school, and also whether you would recommend that they be allowed to attend or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant relative to a communication received at the Department from George Albert, of Oka, in which he complains that Mrs. Tupper has refused to admit them to Oka Indian Village Day School. Albert is a white man (Greek) married to an Indian woman; they used to live at Toronto, but at present are living in this village. They have five children, who are in age of attending school.\n\nMrs. Tupper never refused to admit them to school. In fact, the five children were going to Oka Indian Village School, but lately, the oldest girl of this family, Catherine, 11 years of age, refused to obey the teacher and, moreover, was very impolite to Mrs. Tupper. On this occasion the teacher called Albert and told him that Catherine would have to apologize before coming back to school, but never mentioned that the remaining four children should stay home. Albert did not send his children back to school since.\n\nYou also ask me, if there are white schools near, where these children could attend. I beg to inform you that there are two white schools in the village where they would be received, but these schools are French and Catholic, while this family is English speaking and Protestant.\n\nI would recommend that these children be admitted at the Indian Village Day School, as Mrs. Tupper is willing to receive them and also because they are English speaking and Protestant, but the oldest girl should make excuses to the teacher in the first place, owing to the bad example she gave to the Indians pupils, and these people should be given to understand that they are only tolerated at school and should they make any trouble they would not be admitted anymore.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Ps. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the attendance of the children of George Albert at the Oka Village Indian Day School, and furnishing particulars regarding this man's family.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, provided there is accommodation for these children and their attendance would not interfere with the regular classroom instruction to the Indian pupils, the Department would have no objection to their being granted permission to attend. This permission is granted, however, on the distinct understanding that they will comply with the discipline of the school. Before the oldest girl is allowed to return, she should make the necessary apologies to Mr. Tupper, the teacher, and if she or any of the other Albert children do not conform strictly to the discipline of the school, they should be refused permission to attend. You may inform both the teacher and George Albert accordingly.\n\nMr. Albert should also be informed that the Department is under no obligation to provide educational facilities for his children, and that permission for them to attend is granted as a favour and will be withdrawn if the children misbehave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P.Q.\nIndian Country Day School,\nOka, Que., Apr. 2nd., 1934.\n\nMr. F. Brisbois,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing my report for the last three months. You will see by this that the attendance has been very low; eight has been the average; the number on roll has been very low also.\n\nOne might state a number of reasons for this state of affairs. Bad roads, inclement weather, etc. In most cases, however, I am led to believe that it is resentment to discipline, and especially since I am insisting on the use of the English language. Of course it may be due to \"poor teaching\" and I may be at fault, but since the regular ones are progressing favourably both in my opinion and that of the inspector, I feel that I am not wholly to blame. However if the Department feels like having an investigation I should be only too willing to do all in my power to assist them.\n\nWould you be so good as to tell the plumber that the sink pipe has thawed out and I am pretty sure that the well pipe has also. He told me to let him know when they had thawed.\n\nThanking you for past favours, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She holds an Ontario certificate and has had several years' experience. The classroom appeared to be in good condition, as well as the rooms occupied by the teacher as a residence.\n\nMr. Agent Brisebois, who accompanied me, stated that he considers her services very satisfactory.

I am still unemployed and would like to be given courteous consideration in this case, and have already set out my qualifications in some detail. I need not elaborate except to say that my certificates make that the most logical school for me.

They understand no English when they enter school and the attendance is so irregular that very little progress is made. The upper grades make fair progress, especially in Arithmetic and Spelling. The writing is of rather poor quality and the exercises are carelessly done. Little art is taught and no handwork and no projects are attempted. Singing is not taught, except in preparation for an occasional concert in connection with the Sunday School.\n\nThe nine months session is beginning to show an effect on the amount of progress being made, as the attendance has always been low here in the spring months. It would be much better to open at the first of September and close the end of May, as is the custom in this province with the few nine months schools that remain.\nOttawa,\nJune 14, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Oka Village Indian Day School\nNo. 324\n\nIt has been decided to dispense with the services of the teacher, Mr. Morley Oke, at the end of the current academic year. No further salary should be paid to him after June 30.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJune 14, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nSchool Inspector Brady visited the Oka Village Day School on May 13 and he reports in part as follows regarding the classroom work:\n\n\"The First Grade pupils present had done not more than white pupils would have covered in one month in reading. The writing is of rather poor quality and the exercises are carelessly done. Little art is taught and no handicraft and no projects are attempted. Singing is not taught except in preparation for an occasional concert in connection with the Sunday School.\"\n\nIt appears from the above that Mr. Oke is making no attempt to advance the pupils in this school and I feel certain that you will agree with me that it is time for a change. I am, therefore, advising the Indian Agent that Mr. Oke's services will not be required after the end of the current academic year. It would be appreciated if you would nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1941-42. Salary is allowed at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month and the school term will be from October 1, 1941, to June 30, 1942.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo.

Mr. Wilkinson, who is about thirty-five years of age and unmarried, has his M.A. degree from McGill, a B.D. from our Theological College, and took post graduate work at Harvard. After preaching for a while, he decided to go in for teaching and taught for a couple of years in Argyle School in Westmount and later in Lachine. Inspector Brady thinks he would do well.\n\nMr. Wilkinson has the French language and lacks only one subject, History of Teaching, from having his permanent teaching certificate. Inspector Brady thinks there will be no difficulty in his getting a permit to teach.\n\nRev. Dr. Lloyd Smith, Chairman of our Board and Convener of our Committee in Montreal Conference, writes very highly of Mr. Wilkinson and thinks we are very fortunate to have him willing to accept the school at Oka. I trust that we may have your approval of this nomination.\n\nWhen replying, would you please let us know whether or not there is a house for the teacher of the Oka Village School.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn June 14th, you wrote Dr. Dorey, notifying him that you had advised the Indian Agent that the services of Mr. Morley Oke would not be required after the end of the current academic year, and asking us to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the school year 1941-42.\n\nAs you know, we acted on your request and have already nominated Mr. Wilkinson for the position. To-day we are in receipt of a letter from Rev. J. R. Wheeler, our minister on the Caughnawaga-Oka Indian Mission, to say that Mr. Morley Oke had told him that he has neither resigned nor has he been notified that his services would no longer be required.\n\nWe thought that your letter indicated that the Indian Agent would notify Mr. Oke that his services would not be needed after the end of June. Were we wrong in this assumption? Should we have notified Mr. Oke ourselves? I should like to know so that we may be sure what the Department expects under similar circumstances in the future. It would look to me as if the Indian Agent should have notified Mr. Oke and did not do so.\n\nIn any event, I am sending a copy of your letter of June 14th to Mr. Oke, via Mr. Wheeler, so that he will have this official communication in his hands within a few days.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC JLT\nOttawa,\nJuly 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of June 14 instructing you to immediately notify Mr. Morley Oke that his services would not be required at the Oka Village Day School after the end of June, 1941.\n\nI am now advised by the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada that Mr. Oke states that he has received no such notification from you.

As Mrs. Keddy is expecting a baby in about fifteen days from now; Mr. Keddy has come to me to ask permission for his wife and family to occupy the Village school building until the expected baby is born. The reason is that Mrs. Keddy being alone with her children would be nearer the doctor in the village of Oka.\n\nOwing to the circumstances I would recommend that this family be allowed to occupy the village school building for the above mentioned period.\n\nAwaiting the favour of an early reply, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 8th instant the Department approves Mr. C.J.

Keddy,\nIndian Country School,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Wilkinson:\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to your school Mr. Doucet intimates that he stressed the practical side of education rather than the strictly academic phase. You are probably aware that Mr. Doucet has had very wide experience as an instructor both in vocational and academic subjects and was, prior to his appointment to this Department, an instructor at the vocational school in Regina.\n\nThe Department's aim is to prepare the pupils to cope with the exigencies of life as they are found in the community in which they reside. The school programme, we believe, should begin with social settings that surround the community. Education is really an affair of action and not simply an affair of acquiring ready-made responses through mechanical repetition. We incline to that process of education by means of which meaningful experiences prepare for life.\n\nAs a result we are anxious to have manual training wherever possible. We are certain that you will do your best to introduce and encourage this phase of educational effort in your school.\n\nI realize that carrying out our wishes will necessarily involve a considerable departure from the provincial curriculum but our experience in Indian work has proved to our satisfaction that the policy we now suggest is best suited to Indian children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. George Wilkinson,\nTeacher,\nOka Village Indian Day School,\nOka, Que.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI had a phone message from the Minister's office yesterday suggesting that I write to you with regard to Mr. Wilkinson, teacher of the Oka Village School. During the past year we have received several communications from Mr. Wilkinson and, to say the least, they indicated that he lacked good judgment. He has apparently espoused the cause of the Oka Indian Band in a case which was settled by the Privy Council years ago.\n\nTo be fair I may say that we have received no complaints regarding his teaching ability. However, taking everything into consideration it is felt that he is not exactly the right type to be in charge of an Indian school.\n\nI should appreciate your giving the matter early consideration in the hope that you can nominate a different teacher for this school for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

We believe we have\nnever ripped any woman's skirt, and to be going\nto be the one to call us, the Gabriel are just\nBlood thirsty for trouble true enough, he has\nbeen against us almost since he came and we\nwill stand any more of his bad words. I shall\nwait for your honor and justice, which I hope\nto let me know at an early date. Please understand\nthis has been going on and getting worse all the time\neven the women are now getting bad talk and feeling\namong the third of the men, we never had before.\nThis week we do not bad in those whose heads, he\nhas turned. The people here are poor enough and he\nmade them bury him, a tree under coast there $45.00\nover that no one knows how to use it only.\nHonorable Hon. Alex. Crear\nMinister of Mines and Resources\nParliament Buildings\nOttawa, Ont.\nhimself most of us were doing it wasn't necessary just being we knew.\n\nHe opened a meeting at the school house burning lights for nothing but comes to the bottom what can they do? But get around and pay for it he has three or four sticking right to him and beside that most of them don't understand half of what he says. Poor thing all they have to do is to go on with the rest. This is the way he treats our people.\n\nI will now remain as truly.\n\nfrom Samuel Gabriel\n\nP.S. Sorry I missed out that he turned out three of us Gabriel out of the school room. But we thought of a way to settle it instead of making more trouble in the room. We had said a word or anything, we left the room with no trouble to show. We can fix things out side of that. How ever please give me an answer at an early date. I wait with great hope. But my greatest hopes is not to see him for only a few more days.\n\nSamuel Gabriel\n\nUpon former please excuse my mistakes it my last sheet.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJuly 23, 1942\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER - Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. Wilkinson, School Teacher,\nOka village school.\n\nAttached is a letter (July 22) which has been addressed to the Minister by Samson Gabriel, of Oka, submitting complaints against Mr. Wilkinson, School Teacher at the Village School.\n\nThe letter is referred to the department for attention.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nFor attention.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 28th, 1945.\n\nRe: Mr. George Wilkinson - Oka.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of July 27th and also Mr. Phelan's personal letter of July 23rd. I am not sure that I quite see the point in Mr. Phelan's letter. I do not want to avoid responsibility, but I seriously question the advisability of this office writing to Mr. Wilkinson to say that his services are no longer required. We appreciate greatly the courtesy which the Department extends to the Church in connection with these Schools, that is, the privilege of nominating teachers, but having made our nomination, I think that the teacher becomes the responsibility of your Department in case you desire to terminate his services. I say this particularly in view of what Mr. Phelan has written concerning Mr. Wilkinson's teaching abilities. Whilst I am aware that Mr. Wilkinson has been active in certain matters, these have not come to me in any official way, and if they had, I am not at all sure that Mr. Wilkinson is not fully justified in taking some interest in this matter although it was settled by the Privy Council some years ago. I am not making any apology for Mr. Wilkinson's language, as reported in the Agent's letter, copy of which you have sent me. The fact is that whilst the Privy Council has given a judgment, I do not think the case of the Oka Indians can be considered absolutely concluded.\n\nHowever, what I am writing about is to ask whether your Department has notified Mr. Wilkinson that his services are no longer required. In that case we shall give consideration to the making of a nomination. I note the Agent suggests Miss Doris Diabo for this position. I thought she was teaching at Caughnawaga but as I was away from the office for two months last year, it may be that I have not the correct information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD/HL\nOttawa, July 29, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRE: George Wilkinson - Oka, Quebec.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th instant and note with interest your comments on Mr. Phelan's letter to you of July 23rd.\n\nIt is just possible that a misunderstanding has arisen in respect to this matter. It was not Mr. Phelan's intention that you should notify Mr. Wilkinson that his services were no longer required. This decision has already been reached by the Department and Mr. Wilkinson is being notified to this effect. Mr. Phelan wrote to you in response to a suggestion made by one of the officials of the Minister's Office. Mr. Wilkinson, it would appear, visited Ottawa a week or so ago. I was absent at that time on holidays. He did succeed, however, in interviewing Doctor Camsell, and in discussing conditions at Oka with the Deputy Minister used very abusive and very insulting language. Doctor Camsell, who is, as you know, a very considerate and sympathetic man, could not understand how such a man had been placed in charge of an Indian Day School. In telephoning Mr. Phelan, therefore, the official at the Minister's Office was actuated, no doubt, by a desire to secure information about Mr. Wilkinson that would enable Doctor Camsell to understand more fully why he had acted in such an insolent and threatening manner.\n\nI have no desire to discuss with you by letter the details of this case, nor have I any desire to prevent Mr. Wilkinson from interesting himself fully in any problem that may be engaging the attention of the Indians in the midst of whom he is working. I do feel, however, that where school teachers encounter these social and economic problems on Indian Reserves that are not directly related to their school work, they would be better advised to communicate with the churches, in your case the Home Mission Board, rather than with\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If, however, teachers insist on interviewing Members of Parliament I do not know that there is anything we can do to prevent them.\n\nI have today received a letter addressed to the Minister from Samson Gabriel, an Indian of Oka, who complains very bitterly against Mr. Wilkinson. In view of all the circumstances, therefore, it would be appreciated if you could send forward the nomination of a teacher to take charge of this school prior to the opening of the school in October.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

I shall write you later about my intentions. Some friends of mine may come here during my absence and I hope it is satisfactory to you if they use my place.

No further payment of salary should be made to him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Wilkinson's letter of July 27 addressed to you. In this communication he says he is leaving for Montreal. Please communicate with him immediately and advise him that his services as teacher of the Oka Village School will not be required during the coming academic year. He should remove his personal belongings from the residence immediately.\n\nApparently Mr. Wilkinson has assumed authority to authorize some friends of his using the residence when he is absent. He has no right to do this and you should take the necessary steps to prevent any outsiders residing in this building during the holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Wilkinson to inform him of his dismissal and in this connection to say that upon receipt of your communication I phoned to Oka only to be informed that he had already left for Montreal. Inquiries as to his address did not succeed as he left no address to the postmaster nor to any other. However he had intimated that he would come back to Oka before leaving for Newfoundland, at his mother's home. May I say that a letter carrying out your instructions was mailed him at Oka.\n\nWith regard to his authorization to authorize some friends of his to use the house I wish to let you know that a visit at the School proved that the family of Mr. Reddy had already moved in, on the invitation of Mr. Wilkinson. However there must have been a mistake somewhere as Mr. Reddy stated that last Sunday four people coming from Montreal had arrived at the School and wanted to stay there for two weeks, but as they saw that the Reddy's family was already there they left, after a lengthy discussion as they claimed to have been sent by Mr. Wilkinson.\n\nI understand that Mr. Reddy wants to apply for a transfer from the Country School to the Village and Mrs. Reddy requested permission to remain at the Village School pending the decision of the Department on her husband's request for transfer. Will you kindly let me know if that family should be requested to move back to their own school, which is at present empty. Mr. Reddy presently works, for the holidays, in a war industry at Montreal and claims it is more convenient for him in the Village.\n\nR.A.

Francis Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois,\n\nI promised to let you know as soon as possible my decision regarding the Oka School for next October. As I explained to you sometime before leaving everything would depend on my Mother's condition and our family business affairs. At one time since returning here I had thought we might be returning to Canada in which case I should have liked to be kept in mind by the Department of Indian Affairs. As Mother's condition is very feeble, therefore, I must relinquish any hopes of returning there at least in the near future.\n\nI am working here on a Defence project. Perhaps under these circumstances an extension of time might be granted me by the Department of Indian Affairs. Of course if I should return there I would want to see the prospects of higher grades with a salary commensurate with same. I would under these circumstances stress Commercial studies. Whether this fits in or not with ideas in official circles I cannot say of course; but it is one way in my opinion you must make these people there on the Reserve independent: give them a sense of economic values.\n\nWishing you the very best at all times,\n\nYours Very Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6007, file 324-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nGaughnawaga, Que.,\nSeptember 14, 1942.\n\nENCL.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nre: George Wilkinson,\nTeacher, Ke Indian Day School.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant dealing with the above named and in reply to say that in the same mail a communication was received from him, which I enclose herewith.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Wilkinson who is now residing at 158 Hamilton Avenue, St. John's Nfld., did not propose to take up his duties as teacher for the coming school year.

Hatcher Esq., M.A., Supt. Protestant Schools of Lachine (Tel.

There I was engaged in war work as well, and am now trying to get back into the teaching game.\nRe Academic standing, I hold the M.A. degree (McGill); was granted a Scholarship in Education by the same University; and hope to write off the full requirements for a High School Diploma this year.

Yesterday I received a telegram from Mr. Wilkinson, as follows:\n\n\"Understand Oka School appointment awaiting your nomination. Am ready accept same. Rev. Lloyd Smith writing you today my behalf. Deeply appreciate your backing my application. Writing reply collect.\"\n\nI have this morning a letter from the gentleman, a copy of which I enclose. I should be very glad if in the future the Department would not put us in the position which now obtains, presuming that Mr. Wilkinson's statement of what Dr. McGill said is correct. I do not think there can be any objection to the statement that the Department has always allowed the United Church to nominate the teacher and are awaiting a nomination from them before making any decision.\" That seems to me purely routine; but I should very much regret sending to Mr. Wilkinson a copy of your letter of September 2nd, in which you state that the Department is not prepared to consider his re-appointment. Of course, I am not going to do so and will have to find some other way of dealing with the matter; but I think you and Dr. McGill ought to play the same tune. It makes for lack of harmony in a band when one instrument player plays one tune and someone else in the band plays another! At least, that is my understanding.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MT\n\nEnc.\n\n(Dictated by Dr. Dorey, but signed in his absence)\nRev.

Dr. Lloyd Smith at Presbytery today promised to write you in my behalf. I would have applied sooner but have been writing a book on U.S.-Canadian post-war relations with Newfoundland; the title will be, Is Canada's Sovereignty At Stake? Dr. Smith wished me to give you this information about myself.\n\nTrusting you will back up my application for this Oka position, which the Oka people are doing, as well.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) George Wilkinson.\n\nP.S. Owing to a semi-invalid sister in Newfoundland I must return there any day now. Any haste on your part would be all the more appreciated. I could be back within a couple of weeks but want to make sure of a position before I leave here. Please send any wires \"collect\".\n\nG.W.\nOttawa, September 13, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nYour reference to myself in your letter of September 6 to Mr. Hoey has been brought to my attention. In this letter you imply that I have been guilty of introducing discords into the harmony of our official relations. As I am most unwilling to lie under such an imputation any longer than necessary I hasten to explain my small part in the matter under review. A little more than a week ago a man phoned me by long distance from Montreal giving the name of Stuart Wilson, and enquiring whether or not the Oka school position had been filled. While he was still on the line I secured the information from Mr. Phelan that the position was still open and passed on the information to Mr. Wilson as he then called himself. It is quite likely, although I am not sure of this, that I told him that if he were interested in the position he had better make application.\n\nThe following day an application did come in but to my surprise it was signed by one George Wilkinson. The next day an Indian from Oka phoned me in Mr. George Wilkinson's behalf but could give no explanation of the apparent case of dual personality displayed.\n\nAssuring you of the continuance of my high regard I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nMr. W.A.

Miss Dalby and I feel that with that number and all the grades, one teacher would find the work very difficult.\n\nI was glad to hear that Miss MacDougall had sufficiently recovered her health to be able to again take up her duties at Rama.\n\nI do hope a teacher may soon be found for the Oka school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If I understand it correctly, you are concerned about discord in the relationship which exists between us. I had no such intention. What I did mean to say to Mr. Hoey was that it seemed to me a strange situation that we should get a letter from him one day \u2014 which, of course, may not have been intended to be official \u2014 to the effect that the Department would not appoint Mr. Wilkinson, and then to be told in a letter from Mr. Wilkinson the same day that he had been given to understand by you that all he had to do was to apply and that he would be appointed. I was quite sure that if you and Mr. Hoey had compared notes about Mr. Wilkinson, you would have come to the same conclusion. I did say to Mr. Hoey that I thought the Officials should play the same tune, in the same band, at the same time. I am afraid that my intended facetiousness has miscarried.\n\nIt is evident that from the telephone conversation you understood that it was a Mr. Wilson who was applying for the position at Oka, when it was really Mr. Wilkinson.\n\nI hope to see you in Ottawa before very long and we can talk these things over.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\nOttawa, September 25, 1944.\n\nMr. W.H.

From 1936-37 I was employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway as an office clerk. For the past two summers I have been doing vacation relief work. First with Imperial Tobacco Co., Ltd., in the Accounting Dept. This past summer I was employed by Beaton Bros., as cost estimator. Both firms offered me permanent positions which I was unable to accept at the Union account of family responsibilities.\n\nI have lived very close to the Indian life and feel I know the Indian mind and its psychology. All of which is essential to the success of a teacher in the mission schools. Moreover, I have had excellent training in music and could well serve as organist if necessary in the...\nMy son Church.

Probably the fault is mine because I reported that I had taken over my duties on Oct. 14. I did so because that was my first day of actual teaching, and I thought that my salary would be based on teaching days.\n\nHowever, I actually arrived here on the 14th of October and began preparing for school on the 15th. Thus I should have been paid for 21 days rather than 18.\n\nWill you please see that this adjustment is made?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRoy A. Speer\n(Oka Village Indian School)\nOttawa, November 20, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Speer:\n\nOka Village Day School,\nOka, Quebec.\n\nI have answered your letter of November 11th.\n\nIn your Staff Questionnaire you reported that you assumed duties on October 11th. Therefore, we arrange for Miss Fairservice to be paid up to October 13th and have you paid from October 11th on. If your salary is to be adjusted back to October 11th as claimed, then, it will be necessary for a similar adjustment to be made to Miss Fairservice and also to the teacher whom she replaced at Caughnawaga.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.A. Speer,\nTeacher,\nOka Village Indian Day School,\nOka, Quebec.\n\nBFM/HM.\nDear Sir:\n\nFrom your letter of the 20th inst., I judge that you wish to know whether or not I still desire an adjustment on my Oct. salary. Now, if I had only myself to consider, I might let it drop; but I have a wife and three children to support and consequently I need every dollar I can earn. With regard to Miss Fauservier and her predecessor at Caughnawaga, they actually only taught to the 9th of Oct. before the change was made. Therefore, they are being well paid for time spent in teaching and certainly should not object to this error being rectified.\n\nIf you wish verification of the fact that I arrived here on the 10th of Oct. I am sure Mr. Bussiere would be glad to supply it for you.\n\nTrusting that I shall receive full justice at your hands, I am,\n\nYours Truly,\nRoy A.

Particulars of the course will be found in the enclosed circular of information.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nZ/F Director of Protestant Education.\n\nEnclosure\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nQUEBEC\n\nAnnouncement of the Summer School for Teachers\nMacdonald College, 1948.\n\nThe seventeenth annual summer school for teachers, under the auspices of the Department of Education, will be held at Macdonald College from Monday, July 5, to Saturday, July 31, inclusive. This summer school is intended for teachers holding elementary and intermediate diplomas valid in the Province of Quebec.\n\nThe purpose of this summer school is to enable certificated teachers to supplement their previous training, to become better acquainted with modern educational movements and methods, and to qualify for more advanced diplomas, in accordance with the regulations of the Protestant Committee of the Council of Education.\n\nElementary and intermediate certificates shall remain interim until the holder thereof shall have taught for two years successfully and shall also have successfully completed one summer session at an approved professional summer school, when the interim certificate shall be exchanged for a permanent diploma.\n\nAdvanced elementary diplomas shall be issued to holders of interim elementary certificates or permanent diplomas who have taught successfully for at least two years and have successfully completed two sessions at an approved professional summer school.\n\nPermanent intermediate diplomas shall be issued to holders of interim elementary certificates upon the successful completion of three summer sessions at an approved professional summer school provided, in each case, that the holders have taught successfully for at least two years and have completed the academic requirements for admission to the intermediate class.\nIntermediate certificates shall be granted to teachers holding elementary certificates or diplomas provided they pass successfully the senior high school leaving examinations. The senior high school leaving examination may be taken in two sections for this purpose.\n\nAdvanced intermediate diplomas shall be issued to holders of permanent intermediate diplomas who shall have taught successfully for two years and completed satisfactorily three sessions, one of which must be a professional summer school, at one or more approved summer schools.\n\nTeachers whose diplomas have lapsed are eligible for attendance at summer school only after receiving special permission from the Director of Protestant Education.\n\nApplicants will be admitted who for some sufficient reason are unable to take the whole course in one year but could take one complete course in two sessions of the summer school. No credit or bonus can, however, be given unless a complete summer school requirement is fulfilled. Applications for admission will be considered from students who wish to take partial courses without regard to credits or bonus.\n\nEach application must be accompanied by a preliminary deposit of $10. Money orders or cheques for this amount, with the bank charge included, must be drawn in favour of the Secretary, Macdonald College.\n\nCandidates will be admitted, subject to available accommodation, in the order of the receipt of their applications, preference being given, if possible, to students who have attended previous summer sessions.\n\nAll applications must be made on or before June 19, 1948.\n\nStudents who apply for, and receive, admission certificates, but who, for good and sufficient reasons, find themselves unable to attend the summer school, may ask for and obtain a refund of their preliminary deposit at any time up to June 19, 1948. This date for withdrawal is necessary in order to allow vacant accommodation to be made available for other applicants.\nDear Sir:\n\nI received the April 1st Indian School Bulletin late in June wherein I read about summer sessions. I wrote at once to Mr. Percival but you will see by the enclosures that I was too late to take the course. I haven't attended any summer sessions since 1924.\n\nAccording to the Indian School Bulletin a maximum of five years of experience is also considered by the Dept. when setting the salary of a teacher.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH.

Massicotte,\n184 Bayle Street, (Apt. 17,)\nMontreal, P.Q.\n\nSchool: Oke Village\n\nYour application for classification under the 1945 Revised Salary Schedule for Indian Day School Teachers has been received.\n\nThis is to inform you that after a review of your qualifications, teaching record and inspector's reports, you have been classified as an Indian School Teacher, Grade III. Your salary for the 1948-49 academic year will be $180.00 a teaching month for 10 months' service.\n\nIt is hoped that you will avail yourself of future opportunities of attending Summer Schools as required by the regulations of our salary schedule.\n\nBernard F.

I find that she was granted an increase of $50, making a total of $700 for the 10 teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law, and that your office was not notified. This increase was granted because of certain expenses this teacher has met in fixing up a room for herself over the present school.

The cheque was drawn to cover payment for the months of December, 1920 and January, February and March 1921, the fact having been overlooked that payment of the December rent had previously been made. Under the circumstances you should obtain a refund of $6.00 from J.B. Gaspe, if he is able to make the same. If he can not refund the money you may submit a voucher in his favour for $6.00 for rent of the building during the present month (April) and a cheque for that amount will issue in favour of the Receiver General, and in that way refund will be made, as Gaspe will not be paid rent for April.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nIndian Department.\n\nAtt'n: Mr. Joint\n\nRe: Sir,\n\nOur school teacher in Aka has been the most difficult to find, owing to the fact that there was no property that could be secured for a school site building.\n\nThe school work has been carried on in rented buildings for the last fifty years, all of which were unsuitable from the point of view of school architecture.\n\nWe have been offered a new building with ample playground in a suitable locality for two thousand nine hundred dollars. The offer\nwill hold good for several weeks and for that reason I hasten to bring it to the attention of this Department.\n\nThe like opportunity has never presented itself in the last fifty years and I share the opinion of all that if possible immediate action should be taken to secure it, otherwise it will be lost forever.\n\nI am of the opinion that the price is fair and would meet all possible development it would also serve at least for this year as school as well as a home for the teacher which has always been one of the difficulties that a teacher has to overcome.\n\nI trust that the Department will give its earliest and most favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChief Noah Corrinthe\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 11th inst., I beg to say that I went to the Village school house to see the stove in there.\n\nThat stove is an old boxstove which is not worth much; the door is broken.\n\nIn my opinion, a coal stove would be a great improvement to that school that I hardly recommend, having already spoken the matter over in a visit to the Department.\n\nA coal stove for that building would cost around $15.00, and it would take 3\u00bd to 4 tons of coal.\n\nHoping that you will approve said demand, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. HAREBURN\nIndian agent\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1923.\n\nF. HARBOUR,\nOka, Que.\n\nMr. Ferrier will be in Oka tomorrow Thursday morning - STOP -\nPlease inform Reverend Oke.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN.\n\nChg. Dept.

A.\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the advisability of providing a coal stove for the Oka Village Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that you may purchase a suitable stove. The cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $15.00. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the quantity of coal required for the schools on the Oka Reserve, you should arrange to obtain and have the same stored at the schools. If possible, competitive prices should be secured and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. The Department will leave in your hands the matter of securing the quantity of coal required. Please make the best arrangement you can and forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department will allow a grant of $10 per month, from November to March of the present academic year, for eggs, milk, soup, meat and biscuits, so that Miss Earl, Teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, can give a hot meal to those children who carry their lunch to school because of the distance they live from the village. You may allow Miss Earl to purchase the food necessary, and you should instruct the merchant who is given the business to render an account to you at the end of March. You will then certify and submit it to the Department for payment. The amount of $50 should not be exceeded, and the arrangement is for this academic year, only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nSir,\n\nM.J.B.Gasp\u00e9 the village school caretaker was here this morning about some repairs to be done to the school house. The front and rear steps and the doors would have to be repaired. I saw a carpenter this morning and he says that the work could be performed for about twenty dollars including the materials.\n\nKindly let me know immediately if you authorize that expenditure and oblige\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Harbcur,\nIndian agent.\nMr. R. Ferrier\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe school stove no. 4 was this afternoon delivered.\n\nI found on inspection that it was entirely too small for the school and moreover it was a stove without grates making it difficult to manage and regulate.\n\nIn stating that the stove would be entirely unsatisfactory the agent advises to try it for a month and if found so he will get another.\n\nI do not see the sense of doing business that way. Why not get one immediately big enough that would be satisfactory all around?\n\nIt would save the inconvenience of being without a stove for fifteen days which is the time required from the time of ordering until the stove is delivered and it would be in November or perhaps later.\n\nAs the coal is not yet delivered I will not have this stove put up.\nuntil I hear from you.\n\nI trust you will give this your immediate attention as already fire is required in the school to be comfortable. It is my opinion that a teacher who has to manage the stove should pick out a stove which would be satisfactory as to size.\n\nChief Noah Corinth\u00e9 also the caretaker think the stove entirely inadequate.\n\nAwaiting your immediate answer.\n\nYours,\n\nHelen Earl\n\nAka, Que.\nOttawa, October 11th, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the stove which has been supplied for the use of the Oka Village Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that this stove is unsatisfactory for the purpose. We are today instructing Mr. Agent Harbour to have it returned to the firm from whom it was obtained and to arrange for the purchase and delivery of another stove that would be suitable to heat the school building. We are also requesting him to take immediate steps to obtain the quantity of coal required for the winter's use, and to consult you as to the type of stove required. We hope that a suitable stove, as well as the coal required, will be delivered at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Helen Earl,\nTeacher, Indian Village School,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, October 11th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss Earl, teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, informs the Department that the stove recently supplied is not satisfactory. She states that it is too small for the school, and as it is without grates it is difficult to manage and regulate. As this stove is not satisfactory, you should have it returned before it is used and another stove purchased\u2014one that would be entirely satisfactory to heat the school. The Department will expect you to attend to this matter at once, as the season is getting late and it is now necessary to have heat in the school building. You should consult the teacher as to the type of stove that should be purchased and arrange for the purchase of same. You should also take immediate steps to obtain the quantity of coal required and have it delivered. We will expect to hear that a suitable stove has been purchased, that the stove now on hand has been returned and also that the coal required has been delivered.\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the repairs required to the front and rear steps and the doors of the Village School. In reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have these repairs carried out. We note that you estimate the cost of the material and labour to be approximately $20.

After investigations, I found one from Mrs. Mitchell Frett.\n\nThis house has already been rented for school purposes some years ago.\n\nMrs. Frett would rent both upstairs and downstairs floors. There is a suitable shed for coal and wood.\n\nThe rent asked for is $10.00 a month, and her daughter Miss Nancy Frett, who is supporting her mother, would accept the charge of school caretaker at the same price paid last year, viz: $20.00.\n\nI think we should accept that offer, as long as it is the only one.\n\nKindly let me hear from you immediately, so that, if you accept the offer, I may have the school furniture installed for the opening of the school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1924.\n\nF.

Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI find in the new old house school conditions almost intolerable. The children have no playground whatever. They have one common toilet which is tumbling down. The classroom which I am told is rented outright for the year is a common room for all, the water tap being in that room. It can be seen from this that discipline in the class is almost impossible. We are constantly interrupted, moreover we have not sufficient light to make efficient work possible and the floor space...\nis entirely inadequate, making seat arrangement entirely out of the question.\n\nThe upper part of the house where I'm supposed to make my home is one large room and would be most uncomfortable, besides being cold it is infested with bugs. To make it comfortable would require a considerable outlay of expense.\n\nIn view of this I would ask the question, is it not possible even at this time to acquire a house where we could have some semblance of sanitary conditions? I am thoroughly convinced that renting the present building is a mistake and I am positive in my conviction that other buildings more suitable could have been had.\n\nAs I am most concerned in a situation\nlike this I could do no other than to give you\nthe facts. I and my work would suffer as the\nefficiency of the school work and my comfort were\nnot thought of in renting the present building.\nI am\nyour obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6097, file 324-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, Sept. 6, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the house that has been rented for the Oka Village Indian Day School. I immediately communicated with Mr. Harbour, by telephone, and I instructed him to see that the house was made as satisfactory as possible. As you know, the arrangement is only temporary, as we hope to have a proper building as soon as a reasonable tender is secured.

It will be ready for use in a couple of weeks. They are old toilets, but as it is just for the year, I would not recommend the building of new ones. Or if you decide to have one built, we could have it strongly built, with a partition one side for boys and one side for girls, and when the new school house will be erected, it could be transported on the new school property.\n\nAs to the communication door, it can be locked from the school side, so that the teacher has only to fix a hook and the door is closed.\n\nThe report from the teacher about the upstairs being cold and infested with bugs is not of great importance, as far as I am concerned, for I knew by herself that she did not move in the school house yet. Then how can she say that the house is cold? By this time of the year, it is pretty hard to say that a house is cold, as it is not cold outside yet. With reference to the insects, the teacher told me somebody told her there were some. I visited the upstairs and it looks clean, and moreover Mrs. Frett is going to wash it all over these days.\n\nThere are two small doors to be fixed to the upstairs rooms, and a water pipe has got to go through a wall. I think you will authorize me to have these small repairs made.\nSir,\n\nAs to your last question, I beg to say that I rented the house for one school year, in conformity with your telegram of August the 23rd, which was reading as follows:\n\nRENT BUILDING FOR VILLAGE SCHOOL FOR ONE SCHOOL YEAR.\n\nNow, if you would decide to have a school house built this fall, I beg to say that the Okanogan school commission of Okanagan built one last year for about $4000.00, not more, and it is a very suitable school.\n\nI am positive that a building like this would be in all points the school house required; and it could be made right now and delivered before winter.\n\nIf this suggestion suits your convenience, I can have all the details explained to you and from Tuesday next, on your call, I can go to your office and talk the matter over with you.\n\nHoping this report will receive your approbation, I remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, reporting on the action you have taken to make comfortable the teacher's residence at the Oka Village Indian Day School. I have to thank you for attending to this matter.\n\nWith reference to the building of a school house this year, I do not consider it necessary for you to come to Ottawa. If you have any suggestion to make, please do so by letter. Bear in mind that the Department wishes to have, not only a classroom, but a teacher's residence in the building and that woodshed and closets are also required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to make application for a grant to be used in buying material for our sewing class at the Oka Village School.\n\nThe girls are quite anxious for these classes to commence as they wish me to teach them to crochet wool hats and knit sweaters. They did splendid work last year.\n\nHoping this meets with your approval. I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nHelen Earl\n\nOka, Que.\n\nSept 27th 1924\nOttawa, October 1, 1924.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting a grant for the purpose of buying sewing material for the sewing class at the Oka Village Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may expend an amount not exceeding $15.00 in the purchase of wool and other material which you consider could be used to advantage.\n\nYou should obtain itemized accounts from the merchant from whom you make the purchase and these accounts you should hand to Mr. Agent Harbour, who is being informed of the authority granted you to incur the expenditure. Mr. Harbour will be requested to certify these accounts and send to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nI shall be pleased if, in future, you will forward requisitions of this nature through the office of your local Indian agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nMiss Helen Earl,\nTeacher,\nIndian Village Day School,\nOka, QUE.\nOttawa, October 1, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nWe are authorizing Miss Helen Earl, teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, to expend an amount not to exceed $15.00 in the purchase of wool and sewing material to be used in the teaching of sewing to the pupils of the school.\n\nMiss Earl will hand the accounts, which should be in duplicate, to you. Please attach them to properly certified voucher forms and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, QUE.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 17th inst., in regard to the building of a school house this year, I beg to submit the suggestions as follows:\n\nMr. Dicker has a house built right in front of the lots bought from the Indians for the erection of a school house. He has three lots and a house built on these lots. There is no shed. The partitions of the house would have to be taken from downstairs and fitted up upstairs so as to make the teacher's residence upstairs. Dicker would sell his house and lots for $200, and would take the Department's lots in exchange.\n\nThe other suggestion is the building of a school house immediately. Mr. Fraser has built for the Oag School Board a school house with shed attached to it and closets for boys and girls. I am sending you herewith the plan of said school and the modifications Mr. Fraser has given to me. Their price would be $4,200.00. If you intend to build immediately, I would suggest you to do so and see the building that was erected last year, and I am sure that it will suit you. Mr. Fraser would be ready to begin at once and have the building delivered this fall.\n\nIn the case you should decide not to adopt said suggestion, I shall ask you to send me back the plans, as Mr. Fraser has only one copy.\n\nRespectfully submitted by\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent\nNous soussign\u00e9s J.

I would like at least ten dollars.\n\nThe school term is drawing to a close and I am quite anxious to know if the Department will grant this favour.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nHelen Earl.\nOttawa, May 29th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the communication which you forwarded from Miss Earl requesting a grant to purchase prizes for the pupils of the Oka Village Indian Day School to be awarded before the school closes for the coming summer holidays.\n\nIn connection with grants for prizes, I have to inform you that the practice of the Department is to allow a grant either before the midsummer holidays or at Christmas at the option of the teacher. We can, however, only provide this grant once each year. The schools on the Oka Reserve were allowed a grant of $8 each for prizes to be distributed before the schools closed for the summer holidays last year, and again at Christmas a grant of $15 was allowed for a treat for the children on the Oka Reserve. You should ascertain definitely from the teacher whether she prefers a grant before the school closes for the coming summer holidays or whether she would prefer to receive same next Christmas, as we can only allow this grant for one or other of these occasions. Owing to the many requests received for grants for prizes or treats for the children of the various schools, a considerable sum is expended each year, and we have, therefore, found it necessary to allow the grant once during each year only.\n\nPlease consult the teacher in this matter and let us know definitely what she decides.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nMr. F. Harbour,\nAgent.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-grants for school for purposes of prizes and treats I may say that I understand from your official letter no20-2-5 dated May 29th, that a total grant for my school in the village was $15 that is $8 for prizes and $7.50 for Christmas treat. I thought it would be good policy to take half of this amount for school purposes now to be expended on prizes as children are working hard and looking forward to this. Next year they could be definitely told that there would be a change of policy in regard to prizes and treats. In this way we could avoid unfavourable reaction which I am sure would follow otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the letter of the 6th instant from Miss Earl, teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School, in further reference to her request for a grant for prizes to be awarded the pupils before the school closes for the coming summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow at the present time an expenditure not exceeding $8. It is understood that, as this amount is allowed at the present time, approximately only the same amount can be provided for a treat next Christmas. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of prizes at the present time, the total amount of which should not exceed the sum of $8. Please inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.

Good progress is being made on this building, which was commenced two weeks ago. The foundation is complete and the entire frame work of the building up and sheeted in, and the men are now employed in shingling the roof. If weather conditions are favourable I expect the building will be ready for occupation by the middle of September.\n\nThe labour and material to date are very satisfactory. All of the labour employed on the building with the exception of the foreman are Oka Indians and to date their services have been satisfactory.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Forget,\n\nWill you please arrange for a second advance of $500.00 to Indian Agent Harbour at Oka, for labour in connection with the combined day school and teachers' residence now under construction at Oka village by day labour.\n\nI am attaching hereto pay lists amounting to $366.98.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to enquire if you would purchase our house for a school house. We have heard you were not going to build a school house in the village because it costs too much. As our house is half way between the village and the new country school, we thought it would be a convenient place for a school. There are more children living on Indian Road than there are in the village. The house measures 26 x 36 feet. It has a brick stone foundation, has a large cellar, built with walls of red cedar all well finished outside. Two chimneys inside walls plastered wood very bright rooms, all hard wood flooring, good style barn, good shed for pigs, also a new well 22 feet deep finished inside with stones, near house, 1 barn size of lot, 192 feet deep by 88 feet wide. Price sixteen hundred dollars. It will make an excellent school house. There is plenty of accommodation for the school teacher to live here, also plenty of room for the children to play, also an ideal spot to put wood, as it is near time for the children to start school. We thought you might consider buying our house.\n\nYours Truly,\nGeo. Cree\nOttawa, August 25, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you offer your house near Oka Village, for school purposes.

In all probability two or three days work will complete it and will be ready for occupancy.\n\nIn view of this I would make requisition for a National Flag which should remain the property of the school. Without it in my opinion the school would be inadequately equipped.\n\nIf I understand correctly the objective of our work in Oka, as it should be in all other Indian Reserves is to develop new Canadians and the National Flag will be a big factor in the development and fostering of a National Spirit.\n\nIt will be seen how vital and important the flag will be in the life of the growing generation of Indians. It will occupy a place all its own and I can see nothing else to substitute it.\n\nI do hope that the importance of this feature of our work will not be overlooked.\n\nWith this must go the erection of a flag staff and so far I have seen no indications of one to be erected.\n\nThe staff of workers are still on the ground and with little or no trouble these men could put it up.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl.\nOttawa, October 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from the teacher of the Oka Village Indian Day School in which she requests that a flag be supplied and also that a flag pole be erected near the school building.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that a 9 ft Union Jack will be sent from the Department. You should arrange with the men who are employed on the work at the new School building to put an inexpensive flag pole on the grounds near the school building. You should purchase the materials required such as guy wire, rope, and pulley. The Department will expect you to see that while a serviceable flag pole is erected the work be carried out at the lowest possible expense.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred.

I have been planning to observe it as in other years but having moved into our new school and location the celebration would demand many new ideas and schemes.\n\nIn the first place the grounds should be levelled, which requires a lot of planning and work but the scheme in my opinion is well worth the work. In the second place the trees should be planted along the street and a few trees facing the Teacher's Residence, already I have some flowering shrubs planted.\n\nHow much would the Department allow towards carrying out this scheme?\n\nA team of horses would be absolutely necessary and I am interesting the male population to give their labour free. It would require several ladies also to help me prepare meals for these men who volunteer their services.\n\nIt will be seen that the expenses which will be incurred are for a team of horses and meals for the men.\n\nThe Department will notice that in celebrating the Arbor Day we are departing somewhat from our custom viz: having an objective.\n\nI may say I have postponed celebrating Arbor Day to the 14th instant to allow time for a reply from the Department.\n\nI am sending one copy of this letter to the Agent.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHelen Earl.\nOttawa, May 6, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to improving the grounds of the Oka Village Indian Day School.

(RG 10, Volume 6007, file 324-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 24th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your Voucher No. 954, for $40.00, in favour of Aqueduc Municipal d'Oka, Oka, Que., covering the cost of the water service for the Oka Village Indian Day School from May 1st, 1934, to May 1st, 1935.\n\nIn past years, the Department has only allowed either $6.00 or $7.00 for water service for this school, the last voucher received from you being No. 925, for $6.00, covering the period May 1st, 1933, to April 30th, 1934. This voucher was issued in favour of S\u00e9minaire de St. Sulpice, Oka, Que.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have any previous correspondence on file regarding the large increase in the cost of the water service for this school. Please let me know on whose authority the water is, apparently, being obtained from Aqueduc Municipal d'Oka. You should, also, state why they ask $40.00 a year instead of the amount previously allowed. Payment of the account will be withheld until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nOka, August 27, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in connection with Voucher No. 954, for $40.00, in favour of Aqueduc Municipal d'Oka, covering the cost of the water service for the Oka Village Indian Day School from May 1st, 1934 to May 1st, 1935.\n\nYou asked me some informations relative to the increase of the cost of the water service pointing out that the Department had only been paying from $6.00 to $7.00 for the same service in the past years.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that since the foundation of this Village and until May last, the water had been supplied by the S\u00e9minaire of St-Sulpice, who were the owner of the aqueduct. Last year, however, as the water service was insufficient for the needs of this locality, the aqueduct was bought by the Municipal Council from the S\u00e9minaire, and the whole system had to be built entirely anew, which necessitated an expense of over $45,000. Owing to the considerable expenses encountered in the acquisition and the building up of a new system for the water the Council had to set up a new scale of rates for all the customers.\n\nThe commercial and public buildings were charged $40.00 a year for the service of water and the private houses are being charged three times the price they were paying to the S\u00e9minaire when on the old system.\n\nHowever I beg to say that this considerable raise in the cost of water could not be avoided as it was automatically transferred from the S\u00e9minaire to the Aqueduc Municipal when the latter took possession of the water service on an order from the Public Utility Commission of the Province of Quebec.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 6, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the voucher which you forwarded, in favour of the Shawinigan Water & Power Company, St. Therese, P. Q., covering the cost of the electric light service at the Oka Village Indian Day School for the months of June, July and August, last.\n\nThe Department does not understand the manner in which the accounts for electric light service from this company are rendered. In the account referred to, it is shown that the consumption during the three month period was 40 k. w. h. and the rate, $5 per k. w. h., while the amount charged therefor is only $1.20. There is also claimed $2.00 arrears. It is thought that, instead of showing arrears and if the rate as mentioned above is correct, the account should be $3.20 instead of $1.20, thus dispensing with arrears. The account shows that a discount of 1/2\u00a2 per k. w. h. consumed - 10 days - is allowed. On the enclosed account, the discount is shown as 20\u00a2. Should not the discount be 60\u00a2, that is, 1/2\u00a2 for 40 k. w. h.?\n\nPlease take this matter up with the Company and obtain a corrected account, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The vouchers which you submitted are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

Mrs Tupper only came back at the beginning of this present month.\n4...The Company claims that they do charge a minimum of $1.00 a month, and that in any case no discount is allowed that would bring the total under one dollar for any one month.\n5...In the present case the account being of $3.20 for the three months, the discount of .20c allowed bring the total to $1.00 a month as stated in printing on the account.\n6...I am explained by the Company that if their account submitted was allowing the .60c of discount the cost of the three months would be as follow $3.20 for 40 k.w.h. less .60c discount-$2.60 and $1.00 a month for July and August $2.00 as minimum for rent of the meter, bringing the total to $4.20 instead of $3.20 as presently charged.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Agent\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nVoucher No. 8.\n\nTo: The Shawinigan Water & Power Co., St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Co.

It is very urgent to replace those logs in a couple days by the fact that the floor is almost sunk down in the class and they can hardly pass on, and if we do not repair soon they will be obliged to make a new floor later.\n\nPlease answer me soon if you authorized me to make that floor repair because it is very dangerous for the children to walk on such a floor.\n\nProbably that you will find that I ask much and often for clothing and material for houses. The Indians are all asking for clothing and material. In that case I will like if the Inspector Mr. McCooking can pass on the Reserve soon, by the fact I am a new agent I do not like to make too many recommendations, and I think it will be better if it is possible for Mr. McCooking to come for both satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAct Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, regarding the condition of the floor at the Oka Village Indian Day School and the necessity for having urgent repairs made.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will give an estimate of the cost of materials and labour in repairing the floor. When this information is received, consideration will be given to authorizing the work. Our funds are extremely limited and it is hoped that a large expenditure will not be required in connection with these repairs.\n\nYour request, that Mr. Inspector McGookin visit the reserve, will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In that case I think we are better put temporarily logs, and make the new floor in the Christmas holiday, if you authorize to do it.\n\nMrs Tupper teacher of the Oka Village Day School applied for the following material, one cord of dry wood, 1 broom, 1 mop, one 2oz laundry soap for cleaning school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPaul E.

From this an inference may be drawn as to the actual condition of the furniture.\n\nThe thing necessary for the living-room is a stove. That I think is the ideal arrangement to correct the state of affairs in the living-room.\n\nIn the kitchen, new stove pipes are needed and a metal shield to place directly behind the stove to avoid any fire hazard from that source.\n\nI hope these requests are attended to as soon as possible because they are very much needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMorley J.

I would recommend the supply of a small studio set and also a linoleum rug 9' x 10'.\n\nThe kitchen stove does not work good; it smokes terribly; I am going to have the new stove pipes put up, and both the chimney and the stove cleaned up and I shall make report.\n\nI would insist on the fact that the studio set and the rug be supplied immediately, because they are a necessity.

Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nMontreal, Quebec,\nFebruary 6th, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Christianson\nMr. Phelan\n\nRe Oke Village School\n\nUpon my visit to Oke, Quebec, on the 1st instant, I made a special visit to the above school, and beg to report as follows:\n\nFloor: Beams supporting floor appear to have rotted, although this is rather a new building. Insufficient ventilation has certainly caused timber to spoil. There is no cellar, foundations are of concrete, with very small openings to ventilate. To put the floor in safe condition for the next school year would necessitate the expenditure of about $200.00. The Agent had some supports set under the floor for the time being.\n\nClassroom: Desks should be set on runners to keep them in line; this is not an expensive thing to do. 24 desks have not seen any varnish for a long time and should receive a coat or two to preserve them.\n\nAn extra blackboard 10 or 12 feet long is also needed.\n\nThe children should be supplied with individual drinking cups. Three dozen enamel cups should be supplied.\n\nThe stove in use is obsolete and should be replaced at once; I consider it is a fire menace. It is too bad to keep taking a chance with this one; it would be cheaper to purchase a coal stove than to build a new school. This matter requires immediate attention.\n\nResidence: The walls of one room, 10' x 12' approximately, in the residence, are in great need of varnish, as well as the stairs which were previously painted white. The teacher, Mr. Morley Oke, has offered to put on varnish and paint if it is supplied to him. May I recommend the purchase of one gallon of varnish and three pints of white paint, to cover desks, walls and stairs.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a recent report regarding his inspection of the Oka Village school Inspector Thibault states that the stove in use is in bad condition.\n\nApparently we have had no report from you regarding this stove and the Department cannot understand why you have not written if it is in as bad condition as the Inspector states. Please let me know if it is not possible to make some minor repairs to this stove in order that it will last for the balance of the current winter without being a fire menace. You should also let me have an estimate of the cost of supplying a new stove but our funds are so limited at the present time that it is unlikely that any such expenditure can be incurred between now and the end of the fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

In the Country School, the outside privies are repulsing and the adjoining lot is used as a dumping ground. In the village, the privies outside are also in a very bad condition.

Apparently, the floor in the school needs repairing. The sills have rotted away and the floors have sunk, leaving cracks through which cold air blows, and it makes it impossible to keep the building warm with a stove, unless some repair work is done.

The joists are almost all rotten and the only support to the building are the posts which have been put from time to time to support the floors. The only thing left is the hard wood floor and it is feared for the safety of the pupils as the floor might give way at any time.\n\nIn view of the condition of this building I would strongly suggest that an official of the Branch be sent to Oka in order to make the necessary suggestions.\n\nIt is believed that the repairs needed will cost a few hundreds of dollars.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.A.

Due to the extent of the repairs to be made and to the fact that the School will have to be closed it is suggested that more than one carpenter be employed. Mr. Boileau states that it is not possible for a man to work alone on this repair job and it is suggested that one or two other carpenters be employed.\n\nAs this work will be made by the day I would appreciate being advised where the necessary materials such as lumber, nails, tar paper etc., will be purchased. Also to be given the name or names of other men who should be employed and also let me know if the Department will attend to all repairs mentioned in the estimates remitted to Mr. Phelan at his last visit here.\n\nMr. Boileau informs me that his price per hour is of $0.81 which he says is the regular price paid in the region and also on Defence projects.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupp., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI was also informed by the teacher that every winter the school and the residence are without water. This is stated to be due to the fact that the pipe connecting the building with the main pipe in the street is only 3\u00bd feet underground instead of being 5 feet.\n\nKindly send me your instructions at your earliest convenience. If deemed necessary or advisable the visit of Mr. Thibeault, Inspector, would be appreciated in order to complete arrangements for the above.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Frs.

Hoey Esq.\nSupt. of Welfare Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThree weeks ago tomorrow Mr. Brisebois showed me your wire to go ahead with repairs on our school building. I was to supervise with him to keep, as your message said, \"the costs low.\" Repairs started last Saturday week, November 29th, 1941.\n\nTile pipe has been laid and cemented. The cement job was done after my insisting the sand would block the whole system if the joints were not covered over. I did, however, suggest iron pipes, with couplings, but the contractor said it was more expensive and he could not lose money. It is a nice chap.\n\nThe 30 ft. of tile pipe laid was just down from 6' to 1 below the surface. As the length of pipes was still uncovered I suggested that Mr. Brisebois in question...\nwas in town they should leave the lower end (of a shallow depression) uncovered till he had inspected it. In my humble judgment backed up by others whom I sought information on such matters (I forget who) was only courting disaster; that since the great foes 3' into the ground such pipes ought to go down 4' anyway.\n\nFurthermore, I added, during the observance of Arbor Day in our schools throughout the Dominion a piece of wood very likely accomplish what the frost in your judgment apparently would not do. For good measure, in my admittedly poor French, I said to the workmen: The next farmer here may be a married man and want every foot of soil to cultivate for vegetables to raise his family. He brings in now a horse plow. What is the answer now but possibly splintered pipes because such a plow will likely go down more than a foot?\n\nThe pipes were covered up before Mr. Breton's had arrived. He assured me, on my word, that there...\nnecessary precautions, that the work was guaranteed, so if it did not work right they would have to do the job right later on. But now is the time I told him.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Brisbois has already told you of my repeated efforts to have the water pipe put down deeper. It freezes every year because it is only down 3 ft. The Contractor's argument was that the fact the knacker could thaw out the pipe showed that the pipe under the street, or rather the pipe from the street was not frozen. I rejoined, it would have frozen but the knacker had for bury at the other end and did not give it a chance to freeze up the entire length. He had no reply to that.\n\nMay I again repeat what Mr. Brisbois knows that in case of freezing up not only is the sewage system useless but at once a fire hazard is created. And that place would go up in smoke in a few minutes. It were criminal negligence to let this go and I know you will see it as I do.\nFor Morrison, the water pipe from the street should go down 5' anyway and should be fitted in a saw duct from the ground to the floor of the house. I would like your authorization regarding this when the present work contract is finished. I would suggest that the Indians should be given this work, as is the paint work on the school, which the present workers have discussed with Mr. Brossard for next spring.\n\nI hope I may be permitted to add one thing more regarding our fuel needs. Every wood shed in the Village Pass seems pretty well stocked up for the winter. Why has ours been kept so low in wood? The janitor asks for dry wood (6-12). Two weeks ago there was no heating for the morning. I gave my own personal cheque for a cord of dry wood ($2.50). That is not food enough. In my kitchen I have a 20-year-old brick-lined Quebec heater that simply will not warm a pot of tea unless filled up with combustibles, and is patched up like a boiler with adhesive tape. This is another pipe hazard because of a crack in it.\nI am glad to feel you are cooperating with us here. Mr. Brisebois and I get along fine. He has delegated to me his authority in the repairs when he is not here. I appreciated very much your confidence in me too to do some supervision and we hope for future built-in closets and a shower for our pupils.\n\nSchool is closed for 2 weeks until the repairs have been effected. Meanwhile some of the older girls are learning how to make Xmas decorations from an old Indian woman and the prospects for their sale in Montreal are pretty well assured by some friends of ours in Westmount. The proceeds are to go to the school or to meet some local needs.\n\nAgain thanking you for all that you are doing for the Oka Village School.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nGeorge Wilkinson\n\n* We had baskets for basketball plus a water tap in school. Mr. Brisebois is sympathetic to this. Also, at noon a wash basin and bath (as well as the toilet) in the teachers' room.\n\n\u2020 We gathered some hundreds of pine cones, with Mr. Brisebois' permission, a month ago, and are now very useful in our work.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a communication sent to Ottawa by Mr. Wilkinson, teacher, in which he complained against the work being presently done at the School where he is teaching.\n\nYou will note that the Contractor had submitted an estimate of eight different items for a total of $788.00. The work has been done satisfactorily and is now terminated with the exception of a bath and water basin in the teacher's residence also a water tap and basin in the classroom which are now being installed.\n\nRelative to the complaint about the tile pipe laid from the cesspool to the back of the school yard I may say that the teacher had insisted with the contractor that iron pipe be used instead of tile. As you know tile is always used for such purpose and the price of this work was based on tile not on iron pipe. As to its depth into the ground its runs from three feet to one and one half foot. It was not possible to put it deeper owing to the ground level of the yard and also of the surrounding properties. The contractor assures that this work is fully guaranteed and that if this cesspool does not function well it will be made anew free of charge to the Department.\n\nAs to the possibility of a teacher planting vegetables at the School, it is not to my knowledge that schoolyards are used as such, but as playgrounds.\n\nMr. Wilkinson apparently caused trouble to the contractor in asking him to do additional work than that contracted for. For instance he wanted the pipe (water) from the main pipe in the street,\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nto the building to be lowered from its present depth, which he claims is three and one half feet, to five feet. The distance from the main pipe to the school is of about 60 feet and this work was not contracted for. He also wanted the bath and wash basin as well as the water in the class room installed immediately, that is before it was authorized.\n\nThe contractor had been informed not to incur any additional expenses nor do other work in addition to his contract before getting the proper authorization.\n\nAs to showers for the pupils I may say that this might be quite well in a residential school for the teacher should realize that his is a day school and that mostly all his suggestions have been approved he ought to be satisfied. The present outside toilets have completely been repaired and are in good condition. At all events due to the present conditions this cannot be recommended.\n\nMay I say that the recent attitude of the teacher is not well understood. He left Oka on Saturday last, and left no key for the contractor and apparently none, or gave orders, to the janitor not to give the key to anyone with the result that the work could not be terminated on Saturday as the men could not get into the building. On my trip to Oka on Monday, last, the 15th, I called for the key and the janitor stated not to have any, that the teacher had left with same and was still away.\n\nI had to use one of my keys to gain entrance to the building and gave instructions for the work to be proceeded with. It is not well understood why the teacher went away and took such an attitude. The water might have frozen thus causing damages and at the same time it delayed the completion of the work for two days. When I left Oka on Tuesday evening the teacher had not yet returned.\n\nMr. Wilkinson's letter is herewith enclosed.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant in which you enclosed the original of a communication from Mr. Wilkinson, teacher, at the Oka Village School.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform that at my last trip to that Reserve, the teacher could not be interviewed as he was away from Oka.\n\nI am keeping the letter transmitted you until my next trip to this Reserve when it will be returned together with another report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey Esq.,\nSuperintendent Manual Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nTwo am today I wired you as follows:\n\n\"Regret inform you suspended Oka School repairs December 13 most serious reasons. Contractor with assistant trucked away Dec. 6, without permission, hard wood flooring in excellent condition. December 11 gave contractor strict orders to bring back wood taken away and take nothing in future. Same occasion, Dec. 11, I revealed to him work in cellar unsatisfactory because four rotten beams left in place thus proving sooner or later detrimental to stability of building. December 12 both individuals repeated same kind offence.\"\neven unlocking our wood shed for little\nremainder from repair job. Agent Brisbois\nhad promised us the wood from repairs.\nCommunity watching developments. Letter\nfollows. Suggest Federal Police and Engineer\nlook over ground. (Sgd.) George Williamson.\n\nAt 3 p.m. today I wired you again\nas follows:\n\nThe Oka School repairs message\nnumber two. Immediate recovery wood from\nContractor etc. absolutely essential name law\nand order as well as Manual Training needs\nfuel requirements as per Agent Brisbois\npromise re wood. Moreover, chronic wood\nshortages constitute threat this little school,\nmenace teacher pupils health, imperil good\nrelations between sufferers and responsible\nparties, besides inviting public enquiry\nto throw spotlight on nigger in wood-\npile. Collecting clothing Montreal for pupils\nsold $20 worth. Times demand. Seeking\ndevelop this initiative in spirit your policy.\n(Sgd.) George Williamson.\nNow to elaborate a little on the situation created by this event.\n\nThe Town is asking what shall be done to these men (the Contractor is the Policeman!)?\n\nIndians go to jail for theft, why not these Irishmen?\n\nThe Indians suffered all manner of persecution last century. They ask, is our school likewise to suffer in 1941?\n\nPersonally I think an attempt might be made by certain elements here to create an \"incident.\" I tell you and all who handling our affairs that if the necessary precautions are not taken, I will have no atom unturned to bring to justice the nigger in the woodpile, long in hiding. Only a firm hand can meet successfully this situation which at present is a white blacksmith, on Saturday playing the role of Justice, now turned Government Contractor.\n\nAs an individual he is not a bad egg and is easily frightened, as I did when I talked to him in my kitchen last Thursday about his rotten work and theft. I had\ngone on all fours the night before to inspect their work in the cellar. At first he had the nerve to contradict but when I mentioned two 3 beam from the hatch another from the wall to the mid-section of the building he gave up the ghost, and promised to do it for nothing extra. They were then laying the top flooring of hard wood.\n\nI persisted with him: \"Why are you not using the hard wood you men took up instead? All new hard wood?\" He was \"pleased\" he said. I denied it. \"There was a great deal that could have been used,\" I added.\n\n\"Where is this hard wood gone? Have you taken it?\" \"Yes,\" he admitted. \"And you men the other?\" \"Yes.\" Mr. Brink's promised me that wood to have it sawn up....\n\nHe offered several \"alibis\" at this time: The wood taken was his \"pride;\" that it was \"out in the rain;\" that the \"boys would have taken it;\" and when I replied to all this nonsense and ordered him\nto return it at once saying that if he dared to steal wood from his own Catholic school he would soon have to bring it back he replied he would put it up for \"public auction.\" \"Who owns this wood, you or the school?\" no reply.\n\nLater on he had the nerve to threaten me with being discharged \"if I believe all the Indians said.\" I am not anti-Catholic, mark you; but I know my rights and will stand up for them against any or all. That's that.\n\nWhen I cautioned him in my miserable French, his assistant boss to take nothing more he mumbled in French and turned away showing his deep resentment at being caught red-handed. That was on a Thursday, Dec. 11th.\n\nI instructed him our janitor to pick up all the old wood lying about the yard as our new wood was about out, and put it in the woodshed. The following day, Friday, Dec. 12th, on my return from the pines where some half-dozen young Indians were learning the\nart & wreath-making from an old Indian woman, our schoolmaster informed me that during my absence the contractor's assistant had taken away all the new wood (hardwood etc.) left over from the job and even unlocked our wood shed and stolen what he had piled there the day before. I had given him orders to stop anybody from away with any new wood. He confirmed he could not \"trust himself\" to go out and complete the job. He is an Iroquois, a returned man. I need add nothing more as to what might have happened.\n\nI thereupon ordered the doors to be kept locked; to inform them if they came back next day, Saturday, Dec. 13, I had gone out of town and was waiting for instructions from Ottawa before permitting them to continue with the job.\n\nYou will also recall, sir, that these men did not obey instructions from me not to cover up those sewage pipes until Mr. Brinbois could see them. The trouble is\nThey think they can get away with it.\n\nI may make a suggestion:\n\nA letter from you to the contractor pointing out our disappointment at not getting what Brisbois had promised. That opening up our shed, taking out our wood puts him under Criminal law (as a lawyer told me yesterday), and that the Dept., even if it permits him finishing the job, has it in its power to deduct for the value of the hard wood at least, which could have been used again; and that he is not sheltering from the tax collector but the public treasury and is guilty of contempt of law (since I represented the Ottawa York.) would undoubtedly have a salutary effect. Also, to see this man or men, bringing some of the stuff back would also have a most salutary effect on the nerves & the Community.\n\nOh H.C. in P. official for a good sound talking to would have an lasting beneficial effects on him and his kind about here.\n\nHe is a weakling. Make the most of it.\nGaughnawaga, Que.,\nJanuary 6, 1942.\n\nEncls.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mr. Wilkinson, teacher at the Oka Village School which contained serious accusations and complaints against the contractor doing the work at the above School.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform you that after having investigated it has been found that the statements made by the teacher were erroneous. The contract was conducted according to the price submitted and not one iota was neglected, on the contrary the contractor made several other minor repairs in order to please the teacher, without any charge.\n\nMr. Wilkinson was interviewed and could not substantiate any of his statements but merely stated that he wrote you because he was only going to the Reserve once a week and stated that his letters only contained informations which he thought in order (he did not know that his letters had been forwarded back to me). He also stated to be quite pleased with the improvements authorized and the work done.\n\nThe teacher was apparently under the influence of the janitor of that School, Adam Montour, who used to be a recognised drunkard and had once been arrested by the contractor, who is also the Village Constable. The letter is herewith returned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

It is stated that mostly all the water pipes in the cellar had to be replaced owing to the fact that it was badly rusted and that if this had not been done early trouble would have been encountered as the pipes were leaking at several places, which accounted for the fact that the water was freezing every winter for the past few years. The work in the cellar, it was stated, was difficult as it is very low.\n\nThe bathroom was installed in a closet adjoining the teacher's room upstairs. There was no window in it and one had to be opened as well as a ventilator and a new floor made. The electricity also had to be installed and a linoleum put on the floor.\n\nAll the above was supplied by the contractor who charged it in labor instead of having separate accounts sent. The accounts also cover the water tap in the class room.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Two estimates were received from Painting Contractors; one was for $200.00 the other for $163.40. This was thought too high and the prices declined.\n\nIn the middle of August, Mr. Paul Jacobs offered to take this job by the hour and to do it for approximately $86.00, material excluded. This price was accepted and the work completed for the beginning of September or in time for the opening of the School.\n\nThree coats of paint were put on, one coat of flat and two coats of gloss paint. The ceiling was painted white and the walls in a light green color. The floor was also washed, cleaned and oiled.\n\nThe above work was necessary as the classroom was too dark.

Every year this system freezes which causes considerable inconvenience to the teachers who have to get their water supply from neighbors for their own use and that of the pupils.\n\nMay I suggest that the pipe in question be lowered to a depth of 5\u00bd or 6 feet and covered with boards in order to remedy to the situation.\n\nAt my last visit at Oka, Mr. Henri Carriere, Plumber, submitted a price for the whole work. Said price to be between $50.00 and $60.00 at the most. This would comprise the digging, connecting of pipe and also its change of location in the cellar as it runs too near the foundation.\n\nI would recommend that this work be undertaken at present before the frost sets in.\n\n(Frs.

The four walls of the School are covering an area of 4600 square feet. The roof 2000 square feet.\n\nAs paint is practically non-existent two coats will be required on the sides and the roof of this building. The sides have to be scraped with steel brushes and the knots in the clapboard touched up with shellac.\n\nTwo Indians who are experienced painters would be available, Paul and Rodolphe Jacobs, and it is estimated that the labour for this work which will include the painting of the shed and the two outside toilets will amount approximately between $350.00 and $375.00. The above named painters would work by the hour and have requested to be paid regularly every week, if they are hired. In order to do so I would ask you to encumber an amount of $350.00 so that we can accede to their request, which is reasonable.\n\nIn view of the condition of the School the price quoted for labour is quite fair. The quantity of paint is also correct. May I ask you to do your best to have the paint shipped as soon as possible so that this work is started in the course of this month.\n\n(Frs.

A first class job was made by the two Indian painters. Photos of this School will be sent you in the near future.\n\nIn connection with the above work I have to advise that twelve gallons of paint have been left over, and in this regard I would suggest that this be exchanged with the merchant who supplied same for interior paint and that the painting of the four rooms and the toilet room of the residence be undertaken.\n\nThe interior is of B.C. Fir finish and has never been varnished nor painted since the construction of the School, about twenty-two years ago. It is very dark and almost impossible to keep clean. Electricity has to be used all day except for two or three hours of the day.\n\nThe painters are estimating that the twelve gallons of paint would be sufficient for the three coats of paint required on the walls and ceiling of this residence. The cost for the labour for the three coats to be of $200.00.\n\nIn addition the boys and the girls entrance to the School which are of 15 x 12, B.C. Fir finish, could be undertaken at a price of $40.00 for two coats. Four gallons of paint would be required. These entrances are 12 feet high.\nAs you are aware the classroom of this School, which was also of B.C. Fir finish, was painted a few years ago and is actually in fair condition.\n\nIf authorization for the painting of the residence and that of the entrances is given, we will have a building in first class condition and we will be a few years without having to spend any money on its upkeep.\n\nI would kindly ask you to take the foregoing into consideration as it is considered to be necessary improvements.\n\n(Prs. Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nSeptember 7, 1943.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department will allow an amount of $200.00 for labour for painting the interior of the teacher's residence at the Oka Village School. We also approve an expenditure of $40.00 for labour for painting the entrances to the school.\n\nYou may also purchase four gallons of paint that is required. It is noted that you have twelve gallons of paint on hand. You may exchange this for interior paint.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nGaughnawaghn, Que.,\nSeptember 10, 1948.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant authorizing the painting of the interior of the teacher's residence at the Oka Indian U.C. School together with the boy's and girl's entrance of that same School.\n\nAs the painters will start painting in Monday next, September 13th, I would kindly ask you to send me the amount of $240.00 so that these men be paid regularly at the end of each week as was done for the painting of the exterior of this School.

Savard,\nSchool Inspr.\n\nChicoutimi, 19th August, 1904.\nSir,\n\nJ'ai appris ces jours derniers que Melle Marie Cliz Girard qui avait remplac\u00e9 Mme O.P. Dufresne comme institutrice \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de la Pointe-Blanche, et qui m'avait promis de reprendre sa classe en septembre, s'\u00e9tait mari\u00e9e dans le courant des vacances, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne ferait plus l'\u00e9cole. Lorsqu'elle est partie le 1er juillet dernier, ses retours n'\u00e9tant pas complets, de sorte qu'avant de demander son salaire, j'en ai exig\u00e9 le compl\u00e9ment.\n\nJ'ai actuellement en main quatre applications d'institutrices pour la prochaine ann\u00e9e scolaire. Une venant de Madame Vienne Roy, de Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, une autre de sa fille Angelina Roy, une autre d'une demoiselle Laetitia Gagnon, de Roberval, et enfin, une quatri\u00e8me de la part de madame Joseph Cleary, de la rivi\u00e8re de la Pointe-Blanche. Sur les quatre candidates, il n'y en a que deux qui ont des dipl\u00f4mes, Madame Vienne Roy et madame Joseph Cleary. Madame Roy est certainement une institutrice d'exp\u00e9rience. Son intention, si elle obtient le poste, serait de venir s'habiter avec une de ses filles; ce \u00e0 quoi je crois devoir m'objecter pour les raisons suivantes: la maison de l'\u00e9cole est trop exigu\u00eb pour offrir l'hospitalit\u00e9 \u00e0 deux personnes et ensuite, je crois que cela n\u00e9cessiterait un surco\u00fbt dans le co\u00fbt du chauffage, sans compter un changement constant pour le feu. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9,\nSir,\n\nc\u00f4t\u00e9, madame Joseph Clary, par son mariage, fait partie de la bande. Elle demeure tout pr\u00e8s de la maison d'\u00e9cole. Elle est port\u00e9e \u00e0 un dipl\u00f4me et elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fini l'\u00e9cole pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es chez les blancs. Elle s'engageait \u00e0 aller \u00e0 la foire de l'\u00e9cole qu'une demi-heure avant la classe et \u00e0 ne quitter la b\u00e2tisse qu'apr\u00e8s que le feu fut absolument \u00e9teint. Dans les circonstances, je recommanderais son engagement de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux autres.\n\nJ'ai \u00e9crit \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 M. l'instituteur des \u00e9coles du comt\u00e9 et je crois qu'il n'y apportera aucune objection. Je crois aussi qu'il serait utile, sans d\u00e9plaire presque \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de la bande, de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'une des leurs, aussi capable qu'elle soit de faire le rapport de l'enseignement. Madame Roy voudrait absolument obtenir la classe, mais sous les circonstances, o\u00f9 qu'il y a application d'une femme indienne qualifi\u00e9e, je crois devoir recommander cette derni\u00e8re, et j'esp\u00e8re recevoir sous peu l'autorisation et l'engager madame Joseph Clary.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des Sauvages\n\n\u00c0 M. le Sec. du D\u00e9p\u00f4t des Aff. des Sauvages,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 325-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPointe Bleue, Aug. 23, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI learnt a few days ago that Miss Marie Eliz. Girard, who replaced Mrs. O.P. Dufresne as teacher at the Pointe Bleue school and who promised me to retake her class in Sept., was married during the holidays and that consequently she will not teach school any more. When she left on July 1, last, her returns were not complete, so that before asking for her salary I had to demand that they be completed.\n\nI have now in my hands four applications from teachers for the next school year; one from Mrs. (Widow) Roy, of Peribonka, another from her daughter, Angelina Roy; another from Miss Laetitia Gagnon, of Roberval, and lastly a fourth from Mrs. Joseph Cleary, of the Pointe Bleue reserve. Of the four applicants only two have diplomas, Mrs. Roy and Mrs. Joseph Cleary. Mrs. Roy is certainly an experienced teacher. Her intention, if she should get the school, would be to live in it with one of her daughters; to which I believe I ought to object for the following reasons: the school-house is too small to accommodate two persons, and then I believe that that would necessitate extra cost in heating, without taking into account the constant danger of fire. On the other hand Mrs. Joseph Cleary by her marriage became a member of the band. She resides very near the\nschool-house. She holds a diploma and she has already taught school several years among white people. She would undertake to light the fire in the school-house half an hour before school opens and not to leave the building until the fire would be quite out. Under the circumstances I should recommend her appointment in preference to the other. I have written on this subject to the school inspector for the county, and I believe that he will have no objection to her appointment. I believe, also, that it would be difficult, without displeasing almost the whole band, to set aside one of themselves, as capable as any person in the matter of teaching. Mrs. Roy would like very much to obtain the school, but under the circumstances, as there is an application from a qualified Indian woman, I believe it my duty to recommend the latter, and I hope to receive, shortly, authority to engage Mr. Joseph Cleary.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nAlphonse Marcoux,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 8th September, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo reporting that Miss Elizabeth Girard will not resume her duties as teacher of the Pointe Bleue Indian school, and that you have received four applications for the position.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that in view of your recommendation Mrs Joseph Cleary may be appointed at an annual salary of $300.00 commencing on the day she opens her school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Or, lorsque madame Clery a fait application pour faire cette classe, je lui ai dit que le salaire de l'institutrice \u00e9tait de cent cinquante francs ($150.00) par ann\u00e9e, tel que pay\u00e9 aux autres institutrices de la Pointe-Blanche ant\u00e9rieurement.

D'ailleurs, ce salaire est encore le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 accord\u00e9 aux institutrices dans le district de Chicoutimi.

It was agreed between her and myself that she should receive this salary of $150, and she was perfectly satisfied with it.

Teachers receive as a rule from $100 to $125 per annum; some get $150, but they are very few.\n\nMrs. Cleary begins the school tomorrow under the impression that she is to receive a salary of $150, with which she seems perfectly satisfied.

I think it a hardship for Mrs Cleary to be kept out of her money for so long, and as we know from Inspector Savard's report that the school was in operation in March last, I think the Department would be quite justified in paying her for two quarters now, the balance to be sent on the receipt of returns.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, I will proceed with the truth.\n\nSo I had made to Mr. A. Leslie acting Agent a verbal application for the position as teacher of this school in presence of my husband. Upon this he said I could depend upon his moral support. I understand at the time that the salary was $350 per year.\n\nAbout the beginning of October last, Mr. Leslie asked for me to call at his office having to announce some very interesting news.\n\nThat he at last had succeeded in getting from the Department 40 cords of wood and as the school teachers has been very likely was not over burdened with work without these 40 cords of wood but as to avoid superfluous accounts for the Department, the school teachers...\nEquivalent Value for the Claim\nIn $18.75 forming in all $3.25\n& $5 to the delay in getting you\npay.

He has paid no heed to this telegram and the returns have not yet reached the Department. They are needed to complete the year's transactions. Mr Marcoux has apparently delegated his work to a Mr Tessier, who is said to be his son-in-law, but neither of them is attending to the duties of the office. Mr Tessier's dealings with Mrs Cleary, the teacher, require explanation as he has apparently been trying to get the better of her in money matters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mrs. Cleary entered upon her duties as School teacher on the 13th of September, 1904. It was decided to pay her at the rate of $300.00 per annum, and the Agent was so informed on the 8th of September. On the 12th of September he wrote that she agreed to serve for $150.00. On the 21st of the same month he was instructed that she was to receive $300.00, but this information was not imparted to her by Mr. Tessier, who it is to be remembered was negotiating with Mrs. Cleary. She remained in ignorance of the fact as she says, until the following August when she received the Department's letters of the 31st in answer to her complaints. Mrs. Cleary says that she was engaged by Mr. Tessier at $250.00 per year, upon the understanding that her husband would supply 40 cords of wood to Mr. Tessier, at the rate of $1.25 per cord. She says that 32 cords were supplied, and value in driving Mr. Tessier, his wife and family was rendered up to the amount of $50.00. This was all undue profit made by Mr. Tessier. He admits having received 28 cords of wood, and\n\nDeputy Supt. General\n\nOf Indian Affairs.\na good deal of driving from Joseph Cleary, and upon being spoken to agrees that he was wrong in doing so, though he says he did not think so at the time. He is willing to pay the $50.00, and I think a demand should be made upon the agent for this sum, leaving him to settle with Mr. Tessier as best he may. When this sum is received it should be transmitted to Mrs. Cleary. The only excuse Mr. Tessier offers, is that he did not think that the Dept. would ever pay $300.00, and if it had not done so he would have paid for the wood and driving. He feels that his justification was \"that he took the risk\" of having to pay for the wood himself in case the Department did not pay Mrs. Cleary sufficient to cover the amount, he stipulated to pay her plus the price of the wood and driving. Mrs. Cleary (the less) states further that she paid on account of the school for:\n\nScrubbing by Mrs. Joseph Cleary, (the great)........$1.50\nOne clock, to Revillon Freres ...........1.00\n2 brooms to \" \" $.25 each ............. .50\nOne pail from Roberval ................. .60\n1 lock (second hand) ....................---\n\n$3.60\n\nShe has not receipts for these amounts, and I suppose they could not now be got. On asking Mr. Tessier why the school had not been supplied in the regular manner, he said, \"perhaps he tried to save.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. A. Macrae,\nI. I. A.& R.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not know what reasons and motives may influence Mr. Povesh to act in such a manner. It is to follow up the visit that Mr. Maclean paid here last month & I have good ground for thinking so.\n\nI was engaged by Mr. Povesh at the rate of $250.00 per annum plus $50.00 or something that my husband should cut his corns upwood for the Agent. Last May I wrote the signature to lose my husband. I am now myself alone to bring up four children, and after several times writing my claim to Mr. Povesh, who told me that he had written, that it would be better to wait until a reply would come etc., as I was in great need, I wrote to you direct\u2014that was in July. I received a favourable reply and the news that\nmy salary was $300.00 without any conditions. For the sake of the occasion of his visit here sent for me and asked me for particular about my engagement. Not understanding English, I spoke to him through interpreters among them Mr. Poirier, the whole truth of the matter\u2014that is to say, all that I have ever learned to my knowledge. Mr. Poirier offended with what I said. I fear so, and I am afraid he will not carry out his word.\n\nExcuse me very for taking this action, I do not believe a fall to make a defense, not being at fault; I am only thinking that therefore children and that will be serious for me to cover my position owing to an incident that could not be ignored. If Mr. Poirier has any ground for complaining by work or my conduct, I shall be obliged to you if you will give me information at Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix from the Rev.

Mr. Tessier evidently bears a spite against Mrs. Cleary on account of the investigation lately held by Mr. Inspector Macrae into his dealings with her. The poor woman seems to be much exercised over the report and is anxious to retain her position, as she has been left a widow with a family to support.\n\nI think the Department would be quite justified in easing her mind by telling her that it has no desire to dispense with her services at present. My reason for making this recommendation is based on Mr. Inspector Savard's report on this school, of January 9, last, from which I make the following quotations:\n\n\"This school, for the second year under the charge of Mrs. Cleary, nee Felixine Riversin, has made astonishing progress since my last visit; for many years discipline had never been so well maintained; the pupils continue to like their teacher, and out of 50 pupils 33 attend regularly.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Cleary gives a good careful education: I hope she may continue for several years as teacher of this school, which renders such great service to these poor Indians; besides, the present teacher has this year obtained the most satisfactory results, and the Govt. can never, I believe, entrust this school to a teacher more devoted, who has the esteem not only of the children but of the parents as well.\"\n\nMartin Brown.\nMarch 1st., 1906\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nI agree with the passage I have marked in Mr. Benson's report of Feb. 23rd., re Mrs. Cleary, but think that a much better teacher can be got for the money, and that weight should be given to the words at present.\n\nMrs. Cleary cannot speak any English.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These are without a doubt the best certificates that have been presented by any teacher at this school; moreover Miss Petvin has the necessary instruction in English to give an elementary course in that tongue; and this is something that we never had in this school before.\n\nIn face of the above certificates I will join my own recommendation and hope that your Dept. will decide to give the school to her charge definitively. Miss Petvin asks that you will be kind enough to return her diploma as soon as you are through with it.\n\nYours &c.,\n\nAlphonse Marcoux,\nSecretary, Dept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall be very grateful to you, Mr. Secretary, if I may be paid my salary for the month of Oct. and also for the forty cords of wood that my deceased husband, the late Joseph Cleary, supplied to the Agent. In the month of Jan. last, on the occasion of the visit of Mr. Macrae, I was given good hope: Mr. Macrae promised me that he would send me this money as soon as possible through the Agent and I have not learned anything since. Do not be astonished if I claim it for the first time, for I am absolutely in need of it: my late husband left me four children with nothing, and you will understand these little orphans are in need of this money to provide for their wants. All the same, I know that it is not your fault that my husband was deceived by your Agent, Mr. Tessier, for you did not give any order to cut this wood; but I ask you, Mr. Secretary, in whom ought the poor Indians to confide if not the Agent whom you have commissioned to administer to them. If the Agent selected by you is not a man to be trusted, is that the fault of the poor Indians? I think not. So, if you please, pay me this money, and I shall be very thankful to you.\n\nFelexine Riverin\nMrs. Cyrius Tremblay\n\nThe following is the address: Mrs. Cyrius Tremblay,\nSt. Gedeon,\nLake St. John County.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It appears that 33 cords of wood were supplied under this arrangement, and value in driving Mr. Tessier, his wife and family was rendered up to the amount of $41.25.\n\nAs pointed out to you in the letter above quoted Mr. Tessier admitted to the Inspector Macrae the truth of the facts as set forth in the claim which has been made by Mrs. Cleary, now Mrs. G\u00e9minas Tremblay.\n\nOwing to your position as Indian Agent the Department holds you responsible in this matter.

She has been appointed by the government, and I am told, without the missionary being consulted in the matter. Had he had a word to say, we might now have two or three for the same price. Now, we need two schools, the present one being too far away for some children, located close by. These children number about twelve, and their parents have always shown themselves anxious about education. The plan is, therefore, to have a teacher among them, in a school house which we could get very cheaply, and with a salary of $100.00 deducted from the exorbitant cost of our present teacher.\n\nThe other part of the plan is to have a third teacher who would get the remaining $50.00 taken from the first one's salary, and whose task would be teaching the children in Indian during the months of July and August, time of the Indians' stay here out of vacation for the children who are taught our language. In making these suggestions, I am afraid I may be disturbing the arrangement made at the last meeting when I spoke upon this subject. This is one reason why I wish to deal directly with your Dept., after having got the Indians' opinion on the matter. Please give me an opportunity to explain this.\nregard which I am making for the welfare of the\nIndian Band of Lake John. By sticking to the present\none school system you deprive of a rightful share of edu-\ncation two or three children of the French half breed, and a\ngood fifth Indian children who are away in the\nschool during the reduction year. There also\nseems me not the expression of my respect and friend-\nship. sincerely,\n\nGeo. Leinwe Missionary Priest\nOttawa, November 5, 1897.\n\nRev. Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., asking that two new schools be established at Pointe Bleue, and in reply I beg to say that the Department considers that the present school is sufficient for the needs of the Indians, as it understands that none of them lives at any great distance from the school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. George Lemoine,\nMissionary,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nPoveshell, N.S., Nov. 15th, 1907.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th ult. They to be allowed to visit on previous application for the two schools referred to, for the Indians to entertain an accurate idea of the needs of any Indians connected with the question. At least half of the population of the Reserve is away in the back for nine or ten months of the year, i.e., from September until June, so the particular year is not for their children. However, there are the families referred to in my previous letter, as being in need of another school in their vicinity: David Phillips, Henry Taylor, Joseph Coulter, Charles Taylor, Thomas Taylor, Joseph Paul, David Coulter, and William Taylor; their aggregate children may go to school at least twice, and the first mentioned of them, at least twice within the present school hours. I cannot make up my mind to cast a blame on the Indian Agent for keeping these facts out of the Department's notice, but at the same time I wonder why it is the Department has not been hitherto better informed of the state of this place. Now, they to be allowed to ask what reason you would have to refuse the school referred to.\nDo you require the Indians to sign a petition? They cannot write intelligibly enough. Do you want them to make a motion therein in their council meeting? This pretty hard for them to speak of that in presence of an official who secured a good job for his niece and who naturally would not agree such a move. So the only way for them here to apply for the additional schools is through the American women or some of their friends. If they be needed, I will have the Indians come in so as to help them stand by me in writing the present petition. Please believe me dear sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeo. Lemire Missionary Trust\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, November 19, 1907.\n\nMr. Macrae,\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionary at Pointe Bleue has again written to the department, complaining that a number of the Indian children receive no benefit from the Indian school there. Some of them are away constantly with their parents, hunting and trapping, while others live too far from the school to attend.\n\nAs you have visited this reserve frequently, I should like to have a report from you on the priest's letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6098, file 325-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, November 20, 1907.\n\nReport for Mr. Pedley:\n\nPointe Bleue and day schools -\n\nThere are 54 habitations on this reserve, at least three-fourths of which belong to Indians, who, as Father Lemoine says, are absent for 10 months in the year. The families with school children that are fairly regular residents on the reserve number ten or twelve and are those known as \"the halfbreeds\".\n\nThese are all sufficiently served by the existing school, which they are and have been attending. The distance travelled to reach it is no hardship for the twelve children for whom another school is asked reside at distances ranging from about three-quarters of a mile to two miles from the existing one and the road is a good one, well travelled.\n\nWere a school established at the N. E. corner of the reserve to serve the few children there, who are within the distance stated from the present school, and who have already much better facilities than many children in our back settlements, the only way to keep up an attendance that would justify its maintenance would be to permit the attendance of the children of French settlers along the St. Prime road. These could be got in considerable numbers within a distance of three-fourths to two miles from the N. E. corner and for them a school there would prove to be a great convenience.\n\nNo qualified teacher could be got, of course, for any such sum as the Reverend Father indicates.\n\nAs to educating the children of resident Indians, therefore, I am of the opinion that the pre-\npresent school furnishes means enough.\n\nAs to educating those of the non-resident or hunting Indians, who only come in to the reserve for six weeks or two months annually, I am of opinion that to attempt to do so would be useless unless by means of a boarding school, and, favourable as I am and have always been to the education of Indian children, it seems to me that for some generations hunting and trapping will afford the best means of support to these Indians and that the best training for their children is in those pursuits.\n\nInspector of I. A. & R.\nOttawa, November 23, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., in further reference to your previous application for the establishment of two schools on the Indian reserve at Lake St. John, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is still of opinion that the existing school meets the educational needs of the reserve. The distance that any of the children resident on the reserve would have to walk to school now in existence from the locality where you suggest another school should be established would be from about three-quarters of a mile to two miles and only a few would have the latter distance to go, and there is a well travelled road for their use.\n\nThis being the case, the Department cannot accede to your request.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Vous lui dites pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois que l'unique \u00e9cole du village est suffisante, et que tous les enfants sont \u00e0 deux milles de cette \u00e9cole. Nous ne pouvons pas accepter cela, mais nous devons \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, \u00e0 la justice, comme \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de notre cause, de rectifier les id\u00e9es du D\u00e9partement l\u00e0-dessus.\n\nNous, assign\u00e9s, demandons tous \u00e0 deux\nmille et plus de l'\u00e9cole, n'importe quel r\u00e9sident de la Pointe Bleue ou de Coburn, pourra sous le dire, et nous ne savons qui a pu vous renseigner si mal jusqu'ici. Ensuite nous faisons encore en disant que cette distance est parcourue sur un well traveled road for their use. Il est tout simplement cruel de condamner de jeunes enfants \u00e0 parcourir ce chemin deux fois par jour en automne et en hiver durant un nombre d'enfants qui auraient \u00e0 faire ce trajet et qui ne peuvent actuellement se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du village, il s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 une douzaine au moins r\u00e9partis dans les familles de David Philippe, Henry Cozy, Joseph et David Couture, \u00c9tienne et Albert Laviolette, \u00c9mile et Joseph Paul.\n\nNous voulons bien croire que, une fois ce fait connu, nous nous accorderons \u00e0 quoi nous avons droit, d'autant plus que nous ne demandons autre chose qu'une partie du salaire accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unique ma\u00eetre de l'\u00e9cole actuelle, et d'autant plus que les membres de notre tribu ne s'opposent aucunement \u00e0 notre demande. Mais soyons certains que nous regarderions un nouveau refus de votre part comme\nun acte d'injustice, surtout si il est motiver sur les raisons que vous alleguez dans votre derni\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse.\n\nIl est vrai que nous ne faisons pas passer cette petition par la voie ordinaire, mais cependant nous sommes pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter l'intermise de nos missionnaires ou autres personnes bien renseign\u00e9es de la Pointe Bleue et de Roberval, lesquelles pourront nous fournir les renseignements que vous d\u00e9sireriez sur l'objet de cette petition.\n\nVeuillez agr\u00e9er l'assurance de notre respect et d\u00e9vouement.\n\nPriez \u00e0 vous,\n\nSign\u00e9,\n\nDavid Philippe Con\n\nJoseph Paul\nEmile Paul\nJoseph Courtois\nDavid Courtois\nAlbert Lami\u00e8re\nEtienne Lami\u00e8re\nHenry Connolly\nPierre Lami\u00e8re\nCharles Lami\u00e8re Con\nPointe Bleue, Lake St. John,\nDec. 2, 1907.\n\nTo the Rupt. of the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nIt was with surprise and regret that we learned of the reply that you gave in a letter of Nov. 23 to the request of our missionary in regard to a new school among us. You tell him for the second time that the single school in the village is enough and that very few children are two miles away from this school. Please pardon us, but we owe it to truth and justice as well as the interest of our cause to correct the ideas of the Dept. stated above.\n\nWe, the undersigned, all reside two miles and more from the school; no matter what resident of Pointe Bleue or of Roberval may be able to say to you, and we do not know who has informed you so badly up to the present time. Then you make a mistake in saying that this distance is covered by \"a well travelled road for their use\". It is simply cruel to compel young children to walk this road twice a day in fall and winter. As for the number of children that have to make this journey and who cannot at present attend the village school, it amounts to a dozen at least, in the families of David Philippe, Henry Conly, Joseph and David Coutenoir, Etienne and Albert Launier, Emile and Joseph Paul.\n\nWe are quite ready to believe that, once these facts are known, you will grant us what we are entitled to, the more so as we are asking for nothing else than part of the salary granted to the single teacher.\nof the present school, and the more so as the members of our band are not at all opposed to our request. But be sure that we should consider a new refusal on your part as an act of injustice, especially if it is based on the reasons that you alleged in your last reply.\n\nIt is true that we are not sending this petition through the ordinary channel; but nevertheless we are ready to accept the intercession of our missionaries or other persons well informed about Pointe Blanche and Roberval, who will be able to give you the information that you desire on the subject of this petition.\n\nPlease accept the assurance of our respect and devotion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned David Philippe, Con.\n\" Joseph Paul\n\" Emile Paul\n\" Joseph Courtois\n\" Albert Launiere\n\" Etienne Launiere\n\" Henry Connally\n\" Pierre Launiere\n\" Charles Sireon, Con.\nOttawa, December 10, 1907.\n\nMr. Macrae,\n\nPlease see letter hereunder from Pointe Bleue Indians, who take exception to the Department's decision, which was made in accordance with your memorandum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je ne sais quelque peu autre des disgr\u00e2ces du P\u00e8re Lemoine, en refusant carr\u00e9ment et abruptement de m'en occuper, car je trouvais r\u00e9ellement le projet inutile, et je dois admettre que je ne pouvais pas encore consid\u00e9rer, recommander la chose. Depuis, j'ai appris non pas officiellement, mais d'une source assez authentique, qu'on avait pass\u00e9 outre et qu'on s'\u00e9tait adress\u00e9 directement au d\u00e9partement et \u00e0 M. le d\u00e9put\u00e9 Girard pour obtenir cette \u00e9cole. Si tel est vraiment le cas, je dois vous dire, pour ma part, je n'ai pas encore entendu la nouvelle. Il n'y a que sept familles \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 il y aurait place cette ann\u00e9e d'\u00e9cole, et encore il n'y a des enfants qui dans tous les cas, de plus, pour ces enfants, la distance n'est pas plus longue pour venir \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole que fr\u00e9quemment ailleurs chez les blancs. Dans les communaut\u00e9s r\u00e9sidant sur cet endroit ont cheval et voiture, de sorte que, soit ont seulement \u00e0 c\u0153ur l'instruction de leurs enfants, qui n'est pas facile pour eux, comme cela se pratique chez les blancs, de les conduire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole en voiture dans les mauvais temps. Dans mon rapport annuel, je disais entre autres choses, sous le titre \"\u00e9ducation\", ce qui suit: \"La mission d'\u00e9cole est situ\u00e9e au centre m\u00eame de la rivi\u00e8re, \u00e0 cinq ans...\"\nSir :\n\n\"Les enfants vivant de l'\u00e9glise, par sa situation et sa dimension,\ncette \u00e9cole est amplement suffisante pour satisfaire\naux besoins de la population scolaire de cette rivi\u00e8re,\nsans qu'il soit m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire de songer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement\nd'une autre \u00e9cole d'ici \u00e0 plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\" C'est\nce qui m'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 faire quelques r\u00e9flexions, afin de vous\ndonner l'avantage de rep\u00e9rer \u00e0 cette partie de mon\nrapport ceux qui auraient eu l'intention de vous d\u00e9-\nmander une seconde \u00e9cole.

Father Lemoine, O.M.I., of this reserve, came to my office to ask me to take steps with your Department with the object of obtaining a second school on the reserve for the children residing on the northwest part. I got myself somewhat into the bad graces of Father Lemoine by refusing squarely and absolutely to take up the matter, because I considered the subject really senseless, and I informed them that I could not for any consideration recommend the thing. Since then I have learned, not officially, but from a fairly authentic source, that they have gone beyond and have applied directly to the Department and to Mr. Girard, the Member, to obtain this school. If such is really the case, I beg to say that for my part I do not see any necessity at all. There are only seven families at the place where they wish this school to be established, and in addition to that, there are children in only three of those families. Moreover, for these children the distance to go to school is no greater than is the case almost everywhere else with white people. All the Indians residing at this place have a horse and carriage, so that if they really have the education of their children at heart, nothing is easier for them, as is done by the white people, than to take the children to school in the carriage in bad weather. In my annual report, which I sent you a few days ago, I say among other things, under the heading \"Education\" as follows:\n\n\"The school-house is situated in the centre of the reserve, about 5 arpents from the church. By its position and its dimensions this school is amply sufficient to satisfy the...\"\nneeds of the school population of this reserve, without its being necessary to think of establishing another school for several years.\" And I inserted those lines there on purpose in order to give you the advantage of referring to that part of my report that those who should ask you for a second school, I certainly should not think that they had gone so far already in this matter. In any event, I believe it to be my duty to tell you now what I think of this project. If the Department should consider that it has plausible reasons from him for acting otherwise, I shall comply in advance with its decision, which I shall respect.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA. Marcoux,\nI. A.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., with reference to the application lately made by the Rev. Father Lemoine and certain Indians of the reserve at Lake St. John for the establishment of an additional school on that reserve, and in reply I beg to say that Father Lemoine and Mr. Girard, M.P., who wrote the Department in behalf of the petitioners, were informed that the request could not be granted for reasons similar to those given in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nAlphonse Marceau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Blanche, Que.\net croire que vous voudrez bien m'accorder cette faveur,\nagr\u00e9er de votre gr\u00e2ce l'honneur\nde vous en \u00eatre devou\u00e9e\net de mon amiti\u00e9.\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre en\nattendant prochainement\nvotre r\u00e9ponse.\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s affectueuse\nservante\n\nMarie Louise Anna Robelet\nInstitutrice\nAdresse Pointe Bleue\nQu\u00e9bec St Jean\n\nMonsieur,\n\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat que\nvous m'avez caus\u00e9 de me faire\nlui, me fait honn\u00eater la\nrespectueuse libert\u00e9 de\nme adresser \u00e0 vous dans\nune circonstance aussi\ndifficile.

I therefore beg to ask you, confident of your kindness, to give me the class on the reserve for this year. There are many reasons that compel me to ask this favour of you. As you see, I am on the spot and one of the nation, and teaching the school is the only means I have of making a living. I am an orphan and I am in great need of earning a living. If you will be so good as to give me this class to teach, I shall be forever grateful to you.\n\nI have a good elementary diploma. I have made inquiries, and I have been told to apply to you, and I confidently hope to succeed.

Tessier,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue.\n\nSir,\n\nPlease inform the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa of my resignation as teacher of the school at Pointe Bleue. My resignation will take effect from Sept. 1, next.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBerthe Potvin,\nteacher\nPointe Bleue, July 9, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nHerewith you will find the quarterly report of the teacher of the Pointe Bleue school accompanied by her account. I inclose also the resignation of Miss Berthe Potvin as teacher, the discharge to take effect from Sept. 1, next. Miss Potvin is to be married in the fall and that is the reason for her resignation.\n\nThe Indians, having learned of the resignation of the teacher, came in large numbers and asked me on June 27, last, to write to the Department and ask for the engagement of a nun to fill the place. They have also spoken of the matter to the school inspector, who thought the idea excellent. For my part I really believe that this would be the best thing to be done. A nun, teaching here, would receive more respect from all the band, and I know that the attendance at the school would be greater, because if we have a nun as teacher, the hunters who spend the winter in the woods would take the opportunity of leaving their children here in order that they might follow the course at the school. A nun could teach the children many things that a young lay teacher could hardly do, such as sewing, singing, and music. She could even gather together from time to time the young girls of the reserve who no longer go to school, organize with them little dramatic evenings, &c. I consider that from all points of view a nun would assist considerably by her work in raising education in the band. For all these considerations, I would strongly recommend the engagement of a nun as teacher at Pointe Bleue, if the Department has no objection.\nNearly all the schools in the district, especially in the villages, are in charge of nuns belonging to the order of the Ladies of Good Counsel, or Chicoutimi, and all appear to give thorough satisfaction in all respects to those interested.\n\nIf the Department authorized me, I could see immediately to the engagement of one of these nuns, a certificated teacher, for the same remuneration as that at present paid to Miss Potvin.\n\nIt would be the unanimous desire of the band too see the teacher that has resigned succeeded by one of these nuns.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA. Tessier,\nI. A.\nOttawa, July 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing a copy of the resignation of Miss Potvin as teacher of the Pointe Bleue school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted and you will be good enough to advise Miss Potvin accordingly.\n\nYour recommendation that a nun be appointed as teacher of this school is approved by the Department upon one condition, that is that she be qualified as a teacher. The Department has, in several of its Roman Catholic Schools, teaching nuns who are giving excellent satisfaction and there is every reason to believe that such a person would be able to do satisfactory work at Pointe Bleue, however, the qualifications must be insisted upon.

I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of July 9th, No. 152684/1, I have the honour to inform you that Mother Marie du Sacre Coeur, of the order of the Sisters of Good Counsel, of Chicoutimi, is prepared to take charge of the Montagnais school on the Pointe Bleue reserve at the rate of $300.00 a year. This nun is qualified as a teacher and holds a diploma granted her by the examiners of the Province of Quebec. She is also much experienced, having given herself exclusively to the teaching of children for the last nine years. In the circumstances I would recommend the engagement of this nun as teacher at the Pointe Bleue school, which will open on September 1st next, if there is no objection on the part of the Department.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nA. Tessier,\nI.A.\nOttawa, 27th August, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Mother Marie du Sacre Coeur as teacher of the Pointe Bleue school, and it is hoped that she will be able to maintain the standard attained by the late teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Tessier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nOttawa, 29th August, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department has approved of your appointment through Mr. Tessier, as teacher of the Pointe Bleue School at a salary of $300.00 per annum. In connection with the work in this school I may say that a great many school teachers of Indian Schools are now taking up some branch of domestic science and the Department would like you to give instructions to the girls of your school in sewing, knitting etc. In order to do this the necessary material in the way of cloth, yarn etc. will be provided by the Department. Be good enough to state whether you are prepared to take up this work and if so, submit a list of the articles which you think would be required, at the same time stating whether you can purchase them at Pointe Bleue and if so at what prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMother Marie du Sacre Coeur,\nTeacher,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nPeribonka, Sept. 18, 1910.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI take the liberty of writing to you on the subject of a matter you may perhaps find strange. At the time of the last pedagogical congress, which was held at Chicoutimi a month ago, there appeared in certain newspapers articles saying that the teachers were asked to go, their expenses being entirely paid.\n\nI, therefore, attended this congress in the interest of the local school where I teach. The expenses incurred on this trip were as follows:\n\n- Carriage to Peribonka... $1.00\n- Boat.......................... 1.00\n- Carriage to Roberval....... 0.25\n- Fare (train)................. 8.30\n- Carriage to Chicoutimi..... 0.25\n\n$6.50\n\nI claim, therefore, this amount from the Department of Public Instruction and this is their reply. (I inclose their letter in reply.)\n\nI hope that this letter from the Superintendent you may adhere to my request and send me this small amount which for the Government is a small matter. As for me, I am in great need of it, my relatives being very poor. I know the favourable reception that you have always given me on several occasions; that is why I do not fear to write you. Thanking you sincerely in advance.\n\nBelieve me &c.,\nBerthe Potvin\nPeribonka\nLake St. John\nTranslation\n\nDepartment of Public Instruction\n\nQuebec, Aug.23,1910.\n\nMiss Berthe Potvin,\nPeribonka (Lake St. John)\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your request I beg to inform you that the Government pays only the expenses of board of the teachers who attend the pedagogical congress, not the expenses of travel. I regret, therefore to tell you that it is not in my power to grant you your request. To do this for you would be to open the door to a number of similar claims.\n\nYour school-board, at the example of others, would do a generous act in paying the travelling expenses of its teachers to the congress, and I advise you to make this request of them, as these meetings are held in the interest of the children of the municipality more than that of the teachers of the schools.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nBoucher de LaHuliere\nSuperintendent\nP\u00e9rissa, 15 ao\u00fbt 1910\n\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens\n\nOttawa\n\nMadame,\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que cette lettre de votre part est un signe d'une chose que vous avez peut-\u00eatre entendu ou lu quelque part.

I also inclose requisition for the balance of salary due Miss Berthe Potvin, the former teacher, whom you asked to resign, her resignation to date from Sept. 1, 1910, in order to give sufficient time to find a successor, being $50.00, salary for July and August.\n\nThe school is at present making excellent progress. There was not a pupil absent during the month of September, and the number of pupils is larger than ever. Mother M. du Sacre Coeur, the teacher, is pleased with the school, she likes the character of the children and hopes to give them a first class education. In November, next, she commences to give them lessons in sewing and knitting.\n\nMiss B.

Leclair,\nAgent des Affaires indig\u00e8nes.\nPointe Bleue, March 14, 1911.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nMeasles is raging at present as an epidemic on the reserve. The disease is very malignant. Many of the children attending the school are suffering from it, and Dr. Constantine foresees that all the other children will also suffer from this disease. He has advised me to close the Indian school for some days, and that is what I have done this afternoon. Moreover, there were not more than seven or eight children out of about fifty at the school this morning, and the teacher told me that out of those who were attending the school, two or three were already suffering from fever, they were laid up and there was no doubt that they were already affected by the disease. I thought it my duty to follow the advice given me by the physician to close the school for some days, and I hope that this course may be approved by the Department.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. Tessier,\nI. A.\nOttawa, March 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in closing the Pointe Bleue school until such time as the epidemic of measles is abated. The school should be re-opened as soon as the physician thinks it is safe to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Tessier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nPointe Plouc, Nov.7, 1911.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn view of the rather considerable increase in the number of children at present attending the Pointe Plouc school, I believe that the engagement of a nun as assistant to the present teacher would be opportune. Indeed a single teacher, in spite of all her good wishes, is not able to teach all the branches of the course that she ought to give to such a large number of children. The average number of pupils attending the school is about 48.\n\nAn assistant teacher would be able to take charge of the instruction of the young pupils from six to eight years of age, while the other would undertake the education of the more advanced pupils, and would be able to devote to them a larger part of her time. This certainly would be to the advantage of all the pupils, who, I am sure, would make much greater progress than they are doing at present, owing to their too great number under the control of a single teacher.\n\nNow, before writing this letter, I applied to the Superior of the nuns of Good Counsel, the community to which the present teacher belongs, in order to ascertain what they would charge for the services of such an assistant. She asks the same amount as is received by the present teacher, namely, $300 a year. She certainly would not have asked more than $150 a year if the Oblate Fathers had not intervened and asked her not to ask less than $300, giving as a reason that the Government is rich and has the means to pay good salaries to its teachers. I consider that the\namount that she demands\u2014$300\u2014is really too high. Besides,\nthis teacher would have much less to do than the principal\nshe would have much less knowledge to display, because her\nwork does not call for much brain work to teach the alphabet\nand mental arithmetic.\n\nI remarked to the Superior that one could obtain\nthe services of a young girl with a diploma to act as\nassistant teacher for much less than $300. She replied\nthat she would not consent to a lay woman acting as\nassistant to a teacher who is a nun, that that would be\nagainst the rules of her community. She insisted on $300\nbecause the Oblate Fathers of Pointe Bleue told her that\nshe would get it. For my part, if the Department should\ncome to the conclusion to engage an assistant teacher,\nI believe that a salary of more than $150 ought not to be\noffered, as I am persuaded that this remuneration would be\nabsolutely fair in consideration of the work to be accom-\nplished.\n\nOn having the services of an assistant teacher,\nit would be necessary to divide the school into two sepa-\nrate classes, one for the small children under the charge\nof the assistant, and the other for the more advanced\npupils under the control of the principal. In order to do\nthis it would be necessary to make a wooden partition\ndividing the school in two. This partition ought to be made\nin panels that could be put up and removed at will so that\nwhen entertainments are given by the pupils, or in other\ncircumstances, the interior of the school could be changed\ninto a single large hall. After obtaining information on\nthis subject, I believe that one could have made a movable\npartition with panels such as mentioned above for from\n$25.00 to $30.00.\n\nIn humbly submitting the whole for the consid-\neration of the Department,\n\nI have, so,\n\nA.

En effet, une institutrice seule, malgr\u00e9 toute sa bonne volont\u00e9, n'est pas capable d'exiger toutes les le\u00e7ons ou enseignements dont donner, \u00e0 un aussi grand nombre d'enfants. La moyenne des \u00e9l\u00e8ves fr\u00e9quentant la classe est d'environ quarante-huit.\n\nUne institutrice assistante pourrait se charger de l'instruction des jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 6 \u00e0 8 ans, tandis que l'autre se chargerait de l'\u00e9ducation des \u00e9l\u00e8ves plus avanc\u00e9s et pourrait \u00eatre encore une plus grande partie de temps. Ce serait certainement \u00e0 l'avantage de tous les enfants qui, j'en suis certain, feront beaucoup plus de progr\u00e8s si un fort accent est mis sur leur grand nombre sur le contr\u00f4le d'une seule matin\u00e9e.\n\nEnfin, avant d'\u00e9crire cette lettre, je vous ai adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la sup\u00e9rieure des religieuses du bon conseil, commissaire \u00e0 l'agence officielle de l'institution actuelle, afin de savoir quel prix elle exigeait pour les services d'une telle institutrice. Elle demanda le m\u00eame montant que re\u00e7oit l'institutrice actuelle, soit trois cents francs par ann\u00e9e. Elle n'avait certainement pas demand\u00e9 plus de 300$ par ann\u00e9e et les frais pour l'\u00e9ducation n'\u00e9taient pas interrompus pour lui. Elle ne peut donc pas demander moins de 300$. Si elle demande plus, je pense que le gouvernement devrait \u00eatre en mesure de payer le poste selon le tarif institu\u00e9.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In regard to the matter of salary the Department will be prepared to pay an assistant teaching nun at least $250.00 per annum and you may take the necessary steps to have the name of an efficient sister submitted to the Department for consideration. Should you be successful in securing the services of a teacher you may take the necessary steps at once to have a partition erected in the class-room.

She is ready to teach here at Pointe Bleue as\nassistant to the principal teacher for the sum of $250 a\nyear. I hope that the Department may authorize me to\nengage permanently this nun to act as assistant teacher\nat the Indian school. As this quarter of the school year\nis drawing to a close, I suppose that the assistant need\nnot enter upon her duties until next quarter, that is to\nsay, at the beginning of January, next.\n\nA workman is at present preparing all the lumber\nnecessary to divide the present school-room into two by\nmeans of a partition made of panels that can be taken down,\nand the whole will be finished, I suppose, by the end of\nnext week.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA.

It would appear well, therefore, for you to send to the Department duplicate returns and as soon as these are received payment will be made immediately for the amount due you for the three quarters and your assistant for the two quarters, provided she has been in charge of the junior class-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSister M. de Sacre Coeur,\nTeacher,\nPointe Bleue Indian School,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nConnaissant d'avance la bont\u00e9 avec laquelle vous daignez nous rendre aux demandes qui vous sont faites, et l'empressement avec lequel vous r\u00e9pondrez aux correspondances qui vous seront adress\u00e9es, me donnant l'espoir que je serais bien accueilli.\n\nJe viens donc tr\u00e8s respectueusement vous exposer le but de cette d\u00e9marche. Vous connaissez sans aucun doute que nous avons deux de nos Secours qui sont engag\u00e9s par le D\u00e9partement d'Ottawa pour enseigner les Sauvages de la Pointe-Blanc, ainsi, comme elles n'ont re\u00e7u aucun argent pour leurs classes de 1911-1912 (ann\u00e9e scolaire) je serais heureux de savoir ce qui en est; quelque explication sur ce sujet nous rendraient de grands services. Nous connaissons plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e de cette lacune que les Secours de Bersiamitl recevaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement leur salaire, mais le cas est diff\u00e9rent. Est-ce que les Sauvages institu\u00e9s de la Pointe-Blanc auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9s, ou encore, serait-ce une n\u00e9gligence de\nL'agent, nous n'en savons rien, ce que nous connaissons,\nc'est que sur $45000, que nous aurions du recevoir, nous\nn'avons absolument rien obtenu, et comme nous sommes tr\u00e8s\nfaibles, nous serions bien aise si des Secours \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s.\nJe suis r\u00e9ellement sous l'impression que Monsieur\nle Secr\u00e9taire, toujours si d\u00e9vou\u00e9 pour la cause de l'enseigne-\nment, n'est pas au courant de ce fait, c'est pourquoi, au\njour d'hui, je vous confie cette affaire, avec l'intime conviction\nque vous saurez bien r\u00e9gler cette question sous peu.\nJ'ose l'espoir que vous distinguerez une r\u00e9ception de\ncette lettre, et que vous voudrez bien prendre en consid\u00e9ration\nma juste r\u00e9clamation.\n\nJe demeure\n\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nVotre bien humble,\n\nSr. St. Emmanuel\nAssistante G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nPointe-Blanc, 26 juillet 1912.\n\nP.S.

You are indeed aware of the fact that we have two of our Sisters who are engaged by the department of Ottawa to teach the Indians of Pointe Bleue, and as they have not received any pay for their services of 1911-12 (school year) I would be glad to receive some information about this matter. Some explanations on this subject would render us great service. We are so much more astonished of this deficiency, that our Sisters of Bersiamits receive their salary regularly every three months. Were the poor teachers of Pointe Bleue forgotten or would it be negligence on the part of the Agent. We know nothing of it. What we do know is that our $450.00 that we should have received, we have nothing yet and as we are very poor, we would be at ease if our sisters were paid.\n\nI am really under the impression that Mr. the Secretary, who is always so zealous for the cause of education, that you are not aware of these facts. It is the reason why I am bringing this matter to your attention with\nwith the conviction that it will be settled at once.\n\nWith the hope that will acknowledge the receipt of this letter and that you will give it your earnest consideration, I remain,\n\nMr. the Secretary,\nYour very humble,\nSister, St. Emmanuel\nAsst. General.\n\nPointe Bleue, 26 July, 1912.\n\nP.S. Address your answer at Monastere de N.

These, however, came to hand a few days ago and the cheques have been issued and forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSister St. Emmanuel,\nAsst.

[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Indian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6068, file 325-1, part 1)]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMonsieur le S\u00e9r\u00e9nissime,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous pr\u00e9senter mon rapport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour l'ann\u00e9e 1912-13.\n\nIl n'y a eu, dans le cours de cette ann\u00e9e, aucun \u00e9v\u00e9nement saillant. Les progr\u00e8s se continuent. Au point de vue \u00e9ducatif comme au point de vue agricole, industriel ou commercial, le Lac-St-Jean se d\u00e9veloppe et se transforme sous la pouss\u00e9e vigoureuse et f\u00e9conde de ses habitants et... du gouvernement sans doute par les g\u00e9n\u00e9reux octrois qu'il accorde chaque ann\u00e9e.\n\nDans toutes les municipalit\u00e9s, les salaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9s de 15 \u00e0 20%. Pour les \u00e9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires, la moyenne des salaires est de $445.00 contre $128.12 en 1911-12 ; pour les \u00e9coles mod\u00e8les, cette moyenne n'est que de $165.00 contre $162.00 l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, parce que la plupart de ces \u00e9coles sont tenues par des religieuses ou d'anciennes institutrices, qui sont moins attach\u00e9es \u00e0 l'argent qu'\u00e0 leurs chers \u00e9l\u00e8ves ; probablement aussi parce que le gouvernement, pour ces \u00e9coles, n'a fix\u00e9 aucun minimum, ce qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait. Mais je suis heureux de vous dire qu'\u00e0 l'avenir ces salaires seront port\u00e9s \u00e0 deux cents piastres et plus.\n\nJ'inscris dans un tableau d'honneur la liste des municipalit\u00e9s qui ont accord\u00e9 un salaire minimum de $150.00 \u00e0 leurs institutrices, savoir : Saint-G\u00e9d\u00e9on, Saint-Andr\u00e9, Sainte-Edwidge, Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, village, Roberval, paroisse, Saint-Prime, Rivi\u00e8re-au-Dor\u00e9, Sainte-Lucie-d'Albanel, Saint-Edouard-de-Peribonka et la Pointe-de-la-Savanne. Cette liste aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus longue si au dernier moment quelques-unes des municipalit\u00e9s les mieux dispos\u00e9es n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9es d'engager quelques institutrices non-dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es et sans r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n\nIl est regrettable que notre comt\u00e9 soit aussi pauvre en institutrices. Cinquante-huit \u00e9coles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues par des jeunes filles sans dipl\u00f4me. Quelques-unes de ces personnes ont certes de bonnes dispositions, et celles-l\u00e0, je les engage \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter, mais c'est le petit nombre ; la masse ne donne point satisfaction. En certains cas, il vaudrait autant laisser les \u00e9coles ferm\u00e9es.\nLa solution de ce probl\u00e8me du personnel enseignant est tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e, tant que l'enseignement ne sera point devenu une carri\u00e8re enviee, par cons\u00e9quent, tant que les salaires n'auront pas atteint au moins le double de ceux d'aujourd'hui. D'autre part, cette augmentation est intimement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence des institutrices.\n\nUn beau mouvement cependant qui se manifeste depuis deux ou trois ans, et que je suis heureux de vous signaler, c'est l'\u00e9tablissement de six nouvelles \u00e9coles mod\u00e8les dans les paroisses de Saint-Michel-de-Mississimi, Saint-Andr\u00e9, Rivi\u00e8re-au-Dor\u00e9, Saint-Prime, Saint-Edouard-de-P\u00e9rignonka et Sainte-Lucie-d'Albanet, ce qui en porte le nombre \u00e0 treize.\n\nCes nouvelles classes, en effet, tout en relevant le niveau de l'instruction, contribueront \u00e0 nous pr\u00e9parer un plus grand nombre de jeunes filles \u00e0 l'enseignement. Une maille manquait \u00e0 la cha\u00eene. Dans un trop grand nombre de paroisses, il y avait un vide, entre la petite \u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et le couvent ou l'\u00e9cole normale, que bien peu songeaient \u00e0 franchir,\u2014les parents \u00e9tant ou trop pauvres ou pas assez convaincus des aptitudes de leurs enfants pour entreprendre de plus fortes d\u00e9penses.\n\nIl me fait plaisir de constater que ces classes sont bien suivies. Des enfants qui avaient abandonn\u00e9 la petite \u00e9cole pour toujours sont retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole mod\u00e8le ; que disje, des institutrices, non dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es sans doute, sont descendues de la tribune pour aller s'asseoir aux rangs des \u00e9l\u00e8ves afin de continuer des \u00e9tudes, qu'elles n'auraient jamais reprises sans l'acc\u00e8s facile de ces classes.\n\nCe cours qui \u00e9tait suivi par 177 \u00e9l\u00e8ves en 1916 l'est maintenant par 227, ce nombre ne devra qu'augmenter.\n\nAinsi donc, ces \u00e9coles, tout en r\u00e9pandant une instruction plus solide et plus avanc\u00e9e, permettront au Lac Saint-Jean d'avoir ses institutrices, de compter sur ses propres forces.\n\nSur les six \u00e9coles nouvelles construites en 1912, je n'en ai re\u00e7u que deux. Les autres ne sont pas termin\u00e9es ou devront subir d'importantes am\u00e9liorations avant de pouvoir l'\u00eatre.\n\n\u00c0 l'avenir je vais inviter les municipalit\u00e9s \u00e0 montrer plus de prudence dans l'octroi des contrats, et \u00e0 solder moins promptement la note des entrepreneurs.\nAucune \u00e9cole ne devrait \u00eatre re\u00e7ue que six mois apr\u00e8s la fin des travaux. Une retenue de dix \u00e0 quinze pour cent devrait \u00eatre aussi faite pour couvrir les risques des municipalit\u00e9s.\n\nJe vous recommande comme m\u00e9ritant une prime, les municipalit\u00e9s suivantes :\n\nSaint-Fran\u00e7ois-de-Sales, construction de deux \u00e9coles et am\u00e9nagement ........................................... $60.00\nSaint-Henri-de-Taillon, construction d'une \u00e9cole et am\u00e9nagement ........................................... 50.00\nSaint-Louis-de-M\u00e9tachewan, construction d'une \u00e9cole ......................................................... 40.00\nSaint-Prime, construction d'une \u00e9cole .......................................................... 35.00\nSaint-Andr\u00e9, r\u00e9parations \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole No2 .......................................................... 30.00\n\nLes primes de succ\u00e8s pour l'enseignement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9rit\u00e9es par Mmes Attala Simard, Hermance Boies, Mme L\u00e9ontine St-Pierre, Antonia Boulay, Marie Lavoie, Nellie Pelletier, Julie Remaud, Mme Robert Fortin, Eva Bouchard, Marie-Anne Fortin, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lindsay, L\u00e9ona Coulombe, Maria Maltais, Florestine Villeneuve et Jeanne Lebrun.\n\nSe sont \u00e9galement distingu\u00e9es dans l'enseignement : M.

Il est \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer qu'une \u00e9cole normale soit bient\u00f4t annex\u00e9e \u00e0 cette maison, car les vingt-cinq \u00e0 trente jeunes filles dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es qui sortent tous les ans de celle de Chicoutimi ne sont pas assez nombreuses pour combler les vides dans quatre comt\u00e9s comme ceux du Lac Saint-Jean, Chicoutimi, Saguenay et Charlevoix.\n\nL'\u00e9cole des Indiens de la Pointe-Bleue compte 113 \u00e9l\u00e8ves. C'est la plus forte inscription qui se soit jamais vue. Je constate que l'emploi de la m\u00e9thode appel\u00e9e \"maternel\" pour enseigner le fran\u00e7ais aux enfants indiens donne des r\u00e9sultats excellents.\n\nIndian Affairs.

L'\u0153uvre se d\u00e9veloppe et elle est de mieux en mieux appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e du public.\n\nL'inscription aux \u00e9coles est de 5,164 \u00e9l\u00e8ves sur un total de 6,529 enfants en \u00e2ge de fr\u00e9quenter les \u00e9coles, soit 79%. La pr\u00e9sence moyenne est de 75%.\n\nUn ami de France, qui a v\u00e9cu quelque temps au milieu de nous et qui a laiss\u00e9 un excellent souvenir, a eu la g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 de m'adresser cent cinquante volumes de \"La Douce France\" de Ren\u00e9 Bazin, pour en distribuer un exemplaire dans chaque \u00e9cole. C'est une pens\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse, car ce charmant petit livre, \u00e9crit pour les \u00e9coliers de France, n'en est pas moins tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant pour un petit Canadien fran\u00e7ais. Il lui apprendra \u00e0 mieux conna\u00eetre et \u00e0 mieux aimer la vraie France.\n\nEn nous faisant remettre des livres de r\u00e9compense canadiens, votre d\u00e9partement donne un exemple qui sera suivi, je l'esp\u00e8re, des municipalit\u00e9s.

Une augmentation de ce chef serait bien venue des municipalit\u00e9s int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Ces municipalit\u00e9s pauvres s'imposent de r\u00e9els sacrifices pour le soutien de leurs \u00e9coles et l'on ne saurait trop les aider.

transmettre mon rapport de la visite que j'ai faite \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole des sauvages de la Pointe-Blanche, mardi le 30\u00e8me jour de d\u00e9cembre dernier, en compagnie du R\u00e9v\u00e9rend P\u00e8re Boyer, cur\u00e9 de la mission et de M. Trumund Tessier, agent de cette r\u00e9serve.\n\nL'examen a port\u00e9 sur toutes les branches du cours jusqu'\u00e0 la 5\u00e8me ann\u00e9e inclusivement. Les progr\u00e8s depuis le commencement de l'ann\u00e9e sont excellents et il m'a fait plaisir de f\u00e9liciter les deux bonnes soeurs Marie-Antoinette et St-Hospitall de leurs succ\u00e8s. L'ordre le plus parfait et la plus grande propret\u00e9 r\u00e8gnent partout.\n\nLe d\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes a fait faire durant les vacances d'importantes am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 la maison d'\u00e9cole. Je note particuli\u00e8rement un syst\u00e8me de ventilation parfait et que je voudrais voir dans toutes les \u00e9coles. Je dois f\u00e9liciter ce d\u00e9partement de sa sollicitude envers ces sauvages.\n\nComme ce rapport lui sera transmis, permettez-moi d'attirer son attention sur le besoin de cl\u00f4turer l'emplacement de cette \u00e9cole afin de permettre aux bonnes institutrices d'y faire un jardin scolaire. Autour de cet emplacement on pourrait fort bien planter une belle rang\u00e9e d'arbres.\n\nJe ne puis terminer ce rapport sans dire un bon mot \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de monsieur l'Agent. Depuis que cette r\u00e9serve a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e sous sa surveillance, nous constatons que son activit\u00e9 s'exerce partout et pour le bien de pauvres Indiens.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

La Sr Marie-Antoinette poss\u00e8de un dipl\u00f4me de premi\u00e8re classe.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nCher monsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspecteur d'Ecoles.\nPointe-Blanche, 27 janvier 1913.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJe tiens \u00e0 rappeler l'importance de l'\u00e9cole des savages de Pointe-Blanche, ainsi qu'une r\u00e9quisition pour le salaire des institutrices, une r\u00e9quisition pour diverses \u00e9coles et un compte pour l'avancement des planches des deux classes de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nJe regrette d'avoir \u00e0 vous dire que la maladie a priv\u00e9 la Mme de Marie de St-Roch\u00e8re \u00e0 se retourner de l'enseignement. Elle est tomb\u00e9e malade aux premiers jours d'octobre dernier et s'\u00e9tait fait remplacer temporairement par la Mme de Marie-Antoinette. Comme la Mme de St-Roch\u00e8re ne pouvait retourner \u00e0 son classe cette ann\u00e9e, la Mme Antoinette lui a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 depuis d\u00e9cembre. C'est une excellente institutrice qui nous donne absolument satisfaction et qui remplace avantagereusement la Mme de St-Roch\u00e8re.\n\nVoil\u00e0 pourquoi j'ai eu besoin de faire des informations \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et je vous inclue la lettre de M. l'inspecteur des Indiens Body relatant \u00e0 ses exp\u00e9riences comme institutrice.\n\nJe joins aussi \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente lettre pour l'information du d\u00e9partement les rapports de M. l'inspecteur Body au sujet de l'instruction publique \u00e0 Ile-de-la-Baie, l'\u00c9ducation de la Brigue, en suite de l'\u00e9cole de ma femme, laquelle est tout \u00e0 fait portant \u00e0 emprunter une note \"excellente\", qui, j'ose l'espoir, r\u00e9jouira les officiers du d\u00e9partement qui se demandent un d\u00e9veloppement de l'\u00e9ducation et de l'instruction chez les savages.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nA. Lecours,\nOfficier des savages.\nBoheyval, Jan.16,1914.\n\nThe Hon. Boucher de Lanniere,\nMinister of Public Education,\nQuebec.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith my report of the visit that I made to the Indian school at Pointe Blanche on Tuesday, the 30th day of December, last, in company with the Rev. Father Royer, parish priest for the mission, and Mr. Armand Tessier, agent of that reserve.\n\nThe examination conducted in all the branches of the course up to the fifth year inclusively. The progress since the beginning of the year is excellent, and it gave me pleasure to congratulate the two good sisters, Marie Antoinette and St. Raphael, on their success. Order was perfect and the greatest quietness prevailed everywhere.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs during the holidays had important improvements made to the schoolhouse. I note particularly a perfect system of ventilation, which I should like to see in all the schools. I must to congratulate that Department on its solicitude in regard to the Indians.\n\nAs this report will be transmitted to that Department, permit me to call its attention to the need of fencing off the school site in order to allow the good teachers to make a school garden there. Around this lot a nice row of trees might be planted.\n\nI cannot finish this report without saying a good word in regard to the agent. Since this reserve has been placed under his care, we have observed that his activity is exercised everywhere for the good of these poor Indians.\n\nI annex hereto my general report.\n\nYours, etc.,\nJ. Edouard Billy\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sister Marie Antoinette holds a first-class diploma.\n\nI have, etc.,\nJ. Donald Reidy,\nSchool Inspector.\nPointe Bleue, Jan. 27, 1914.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose the quarterly report on the Indian school at Pointe Bleue as well as a requisition for the salary of the teacher, a requisition for school books, and an account for scrubbing the floors of the two classrooms.\n\nI regret to have to say that illness has compelled the Rev. Sister Mary of the Holy Rosary to retire from teaching. She became ill in the early part of October last, and was replaced temporarily by the Rev. Sister Marie Antoinette. As Sister Mary of the Holy Rosary will not be able to resume her class this year, Sister Marie Antoinette has taken her place permanently. She is an excellent teacher, giving us thorough satisfaction, and she will replace Sister Mary of the Holy Rosary to advantage.\n\nBesides, I thought it well to obtain information in regard to her, and I enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Jolly, school inspector, in respect to her ability as a teacher.\n\nI attach also to this letter, for the information of the Department, reports from Inspector Jolly to the Sect. of Public Education at Quebec, the Hon. Mr. Le Brunaye, on the subject of the school on my reserve, which bears the note \"excellent\" everywhere, which I hope will please the officers of the Department who devote themselves to the development and instruction among the Indians.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA.
