Mr. Terriff is a man of honour\u2014a friend of the movement; and as a friend of the movement has a perfect knowledge of all that is best in it, most people believe that were prohibition possible and in keeping with the first principles of Christian life, as they are taught in the best schools, then that it could be brought about in the shortest possible time, and that it would bring about the greatest good. But perhaps the most important thing is that it is not merely a question of right and wrong\u2014but it is also a question of the welfare of the people. \n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\n\nMiss Horne has at last found a safe resting-place in Prince Albert.
