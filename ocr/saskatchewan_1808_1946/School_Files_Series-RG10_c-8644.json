A.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Padley:\n\nMy estimate for the erection of the proposed Cross Lake Boarding school according to the latest plans is sixty two thousand dollars, $62,000.00, approximately.\n\nThe water supply and sewage disposal system are not included in this estimate as no definite information could be obtained regarding the source of water and other necessary data to prepare specifications for these works which will have to be done later as an extra.\n\nOttawa, 17th September, 1915.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit a report of my visit to Cross Lake day school on the 29th of November. This school is held in a building by Councillor Thomas Ross for which the Department pay a rent of five dollars per month.\n\nThe building is inadequate to the need; it is poorly lighted and badly ventilated, the floor is rough and difficult to clean. I wish to impress upon the Department the urgent need of a new school building.\n\nThe number of children on the register is 26. There are also ten white children attending the school. The teacher Mr Hargreaves reports that the pupils who attend regularly are making progress. The attendance is improving since the freeze up. Twelve new school desks are required for this school. Respectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 1, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st of December last, I beg to say that there is no immediate prospect of a new building for the Grass Lake Day School, as, owing to the war, the appropriation for Indian schools has been materially reduced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Jones, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I made a visit to Cross Lake. Leaving here on Friday the 17th and returning Wednesday the 22nd. While at Cross Lake I visited the Day School, The Boarding School and the Field Matron. My visit was made in accordance with a promise made to the Chief last February to take the interpreter down to supervise the erection of the school house. I found however that the Chief had not returned from his spring hunt and that no attempt had been made to secure the logs required for the building. There were quite a number of the band doing nothing for some time before leaving for the spring hunt and there would not have been any difficulty at that time in securing the logs if they had wished to do so. As it is now the Indians will not be back until about the 27th of the month and if they are going to accomplish anything in the way of gardening their time will be fully taken up during the early part of June and there is no prospect of getting out the logs before the middle of next month. As it is now the erection of the school depends on the initiative of the Indians and if they do nothing the prospect of securing a proper building for next winter is rather slim.\n\nAs mentioned above the majority of the Indians are absent from the reserve, the season is backward and there is no work being done on the reserve at the present time. Planting will be later than usual.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Aest.

McGill:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on my recent inspection of the Norway House reserve.\n\nIn closing this report I would like to refer to conditions at Cross Lake as reported by Dr. Turpel, who returned from there just after I arrived at Norway House. The Doctor reports that the Indians working on the erection of the R.C. Boarding school have some work and are getting by. On the other hand, those Indians who cannot get work are in need, especially some of the older people. The doctor arranged for temporary relief for the most distressing cases. There are almost 700 Indians in this band and, although the fur catch was better this year, it was not large so that at the end of trapping the Indians were perhaps still in debt. Relief is issued to half-breeds in this district and no doubt this adds to the treaty Indians' unrest. Mr. Lazenby will be at Cross Lake shortly paying treaty and authority should be granted for him to deal then with relief urgently needed. After then, on his return, report his findings and make some definite recommendations. Mr. Lazenby has foreseen this need and requested money for road work; however, I understand this has been refused.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nA. G. Hamilton:\nOttawa, Aug. 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your report on the Norway House Agency, dated the 11th ultimo, your file 207-9.\n\nYou probably have been advised that a school is to be built at Cross Lake this summer and most of the work is to be done by Indian labour, therefore, these Indians should be fairly well off for work when this building is started.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Supt. of Agencies.\nA. G. Hamilton:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 207-9, of the 8th instant, quoting extracts from Departmental letter to you of the 8th instant.\n\nWith regard to the first paragraph quoted, I may say that the population of the Cross Lake Reserve, at Treaty time was 715, and is divided practically evenly between the R.C. and U.G. religions. In connection with the construction of the new school at this reserve, which school is under the auspices of the R.C. church, I was informed both by the Indians and the lay Brothers at the R.C. Mission, that only those of the band who belong to the R.C. church are given work at the school, and consequently those Indians are not in need of any measure of relief, whereas the other half of the band have no work to do, at which they can earn much of a living at the present time. However, since treaty time, I have had no requests for relief from Cross Lake, excepting for one or two of the old people. A supply of groceries has been requisitioned for, as last year, for sale at cost to Indians of this band to enable them to start out to their trapping camps, the payment for these groceries to be protected by the Indians' treaty money. This scheme has been a great help to them as it enables them to reduce their indebtedness to the trader's stores for credit. Provision is being made in the estimates for next year, for some relief road work at this reserve, as per instructions received from Ottawa.\n\nP. G.

Day School - Cross Lake\n\nOn Dec 9 I visited the new R.C. Day School at Cross Lake. There were 35 pupils present and the school was full to the point of being overcrowded. The building is in good condition and the classroom neat and tidy. Sister St Luke the teacher has everything well organized. The children are all beginners and therefore in one grade. There were 3 non-treaty children there and I informed Father Trudeau that they would have to leave and attend the Public School which is only a mile distant. Sister St Luke requests that she be allowed $15.00 per month to supply a mid-day meal. They have a room in the same building where this meal could be served. I enclose requisitions for this Day School and request that the material required be sent as soon as possible addressed to the Rev Father G.E. Trudeau OMI, Cross Lake R.C. Indian Day School via Wabowden. Goods can reach Cross Lake via Wabowden as late as March 20th.\n\nSome articles which were needed for the school such as brooms, soap, towling, pails, I purchased locally while at Cross Lake, from the Hudson's Bay Company. These articles I have checked off in red on the list which is herewith submitted.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 16 January 1947.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., WINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nIt has been found necessary to re-open the R.C. Indian Day School on the Cross Lake Reserve and the following articles are required:\n\n1 Ash Shovel, 2 Mops, 2 Floor Pails with Wringers attached,\n2 light weight Snow Shovels, 1 \"Onliwon\" Towel Cabinet, 1 ordinary Alarm Clock.\n\nPlease purchase these and ship to Rev. G.E. Trudeau,\nC.M.I., Cross Lake R.C. Indian Day School, via Wabowden.\n\nI also attach another requisition received from Indian Agent Goodman and you may purchase as many of the articles mentioned as you can secure at the present time.\n\nIndian Agent Goodman states that the articles can be shipped by tractor freight if sent to Wabowden.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 16 January 1947.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo which has just been received, we enclose a copy of a letter forwarded to Inspector Hamilton.\n\nYou may authorize an expenditure of $15.00 a month for the months of January, February, March and April, 1946 in order to provide a midday meal.\n\nBernard F.

Day School - Cross Lake\n\nI have to hand a request from Sister M. St Luke requesting an allowance for her school during the winter months to provide Hot Lunches at noon.\n\nWould you please advise if this can be granted, and how much.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nNotes:\nEnrollment 40\nChildren mostly come by canoe in A.M. and stay until canoes return for the afternoon.\nAttendance is low when canoes are elsewhere or when wind or bad ice prevent crossing.\nResidential school (next door) cannot accommodate.\nSuggest allowance of $10 a month for six months.\n\n12 Nov 47\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F. Neary\n\nRe: Next Year's Building Program for Schools Particularly Inland\n\nWhile in Winnipeg recently I was informed by Mr Hamilton that he has recommended the building of 3 new day schools and teacherages in this Agency for next year allocated as follows:\n\n- R.C. Day School - Cross Lake\n- U.C. Day School - God's Lake Narrows\n- U.C. Day School - Garden Hill, Island Lake.\n\nIf these are approved now is the time that we should be purchasing the material and having it assembled at Ilford. The R.C. Day School at Cross Lake can be taken care of in the normal manner and we have no immediate worry about it.\n\n#2 U.C. Day School at God's Lake Narrows - every last item for this school will have to be shipped in from outside. This should be done soon.\n\nThe U.C. Day School - Garden Hill, Island Lake. The lumber & shingles can be supplied locally but the rest will have to be imported and this also should be attended to now.\n\nWill you please indicate what type of buildings you wish erected. There should be a 2 roomed school built at Garden Hill.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 10, 1947.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\n1948-49 Building Program - Norway House Agency\n\nReference - your 9-B of October 16 -\n\nPlease find attached a bill of materials for the standard one-room Indian day school and combined teacherage. I promised you that I would let you have such a bill of materials this winter so that you could submit requisitions for the materials needed at the three schools which we hope to build next year.\n\nWe have been negotiating for some time with the North American Builders, Limited, in Winnipeg, with regard to the prefabrication of this combined one-room school and teacherage. They have now produced a plan which is fairly satisfactory to us. Could you please advise me as to the feasibility of ordering one or more of these schools for your agency.\n\nIf you wish to have these schools constructed in the normal manner, I presume that the following action will be taken:\n\n(a) For the R. C. Day School at Cross Lake we will receive a requisition based on the attached bill of materials for those supplies which cannot be purchased locally.\n\n(b) For the U. C. Day School at God's Lake Narrows, that we will either receive a recommendation that we purchase the entire bill of materials outside or that we should erect a prefabricated school.\n\n(c) U. C. Day School - Garden Hill - Island Lake - as far (a) above.\n\nEncl.\n\nCopy sent to MR. A.G. HAMILTON\n\nBernard F.

Day School, a combined school and teacherage as per the blueprint you sent me. I submit herewith a requisition for materials, based on the bill of materials for school and teacherages which goes with the blueprint. I have omitted all materials, lumber, shingles, etc., which we can produce locally. I have substituted ten-test, one inch thick in place of \u00bd\" thick gypsum board for classroom walls and ceilings. I have done this as by experience I have found gypsum board too brittle and heavy to stand the rough handling involved in northern transportation. We sustained a 40% loss on a shipment of gypsum board for the U.C. School and Teacherage at Cross Lake this summer, and I advise against a repetition of its use in future in this inaccessible region. I am unable to make a more detailed requisition for windows as at the time of compiling the requisition, the blueprint was in the possession of Sub-agent Stevenson to whom I had sent it for perusal, and it was impossible to obtain its return on short notice. I trust that the requisition as submitted is sufficiently comprehensive.\n\n(b) For the U.C. Day School at God's Lake Narrows, I recommend that we should erect a prefabricated school and a prefabricated teacherage. The teacherage to be similar to the one erected at the C. of E. Day School at Jack River, which is simple to erect, compact and satisfactory as a dwelling.\n\n(c) For the U.C. Day School at Garden Hill, Island Lake, the same as for the Cross Lake R.C. Day School (a) above. I am submitting only the one requisition as requirements are an exact duplicate for this school also; lumber, shingles, etc., being supplied locally. I assumed that it would be unnecessary to submit two requisitions. It is necessary to get it in this week's mail and in order to do so, I had not sufficient time at my disposal to compile two separate requisitions. However if a second is required, I can submit a second from our copy.\n\nWith regard to shipping instructions:\n\n(a) Cross Lake R.C. Day School, as indicated at\nindicated at/\n\nhead of requisition, to reach Wabowden not later than 4th March 1948. I suggest that Tom Lamb be approached regarding the transportation of this building material from Wabowden to Cross Lake. He has several tractor trains operating out of Wabowden, and our own tractor will have all it can do to take care of our logging operations before the end of the season.\n\n(b) God's Lake Prefabricated School and Teacherage. These should be shipped to Ilford, in care of Rev: Howard Gibson, God's Lake Narrows, to arrive at Ilford not later than 12th February 1948. There are three transportation companies operating out of Ilford, i.e. - Johnson Transportation Co. with headquarters at Ilford; Northern Transportation Co. with headquarters at Favourable Lake, Ont; and B. & S. Transportation Co. headquarters unknown to the writer.\n\n(c) Island Lake U.C. Combined School and Teacherage. To be shipped c/o Assistant Agent R.L. Stevenson to Ilford, and to arrive at Ilford not later than 12th February 1948. To be transported by one of the above mentioned transportation companies.\n\nE. B.

However if a second is required, I can submit a second from our copy.\n\nWith regard to shipping instructions:\n\n(a) Cross Lake R.C. Day School, as indicated at\nindicated at/\n\nhead of requisition, to reach Wabowden not later than 4th March 1948. I suggest that Tom Lamb be approached regarding the transportation of this building material from Wabowden to Cross Lake. He has several tractor trains operating out of Wabowden, and our own tractor will have all it can do to take care of our logging operations before the end of the season.\n\n(b) God's Lake Prefabricated School and Teacherage. These should be shipped to Ilford, in care of Rev. Howard Gibson, God's Lake Narrows, to arrive at Ilford not later than 12th February 1948. There are three transportation companies operating out of Ilford, i.e. - Johnson Transportation Co. with headquarters at Ilford; Northern Transportation Co. with headquarters at Favourable Lake, Ont.; and B. & S. Transportation Co. headquarters unknown to the writer.\n\n(c) Island Lake U.C. Combined School and Teacherage. To be shipped c/o Assistant Agent R.L. Stevenson to Ilford, and to arrive at Ilford not later than 12th February 1948. To be transported by one of the above mentioned transportation companies.\n\nE. B.

Day School,\n(2) Island Lake U.C. Day School.\n\nThe above day schools are to be built in the Norway House Agency next summer. As the only means of transportation for heavy supplies is by tractor train, it is necessary to purchase these building materials now.\n\nYou will note the following closing dates of tractor train departures,-\n\n(a) For Cross Lake, to reach Wabowden not later than March, 1948.\n\n(b) For Island Lake, to reach Ilford not later than February, 1948.\n\nYou will note that these requisitions are for the standard bill of materials of our usual one room Indian day school with attached teachersage. The only deletions are for the dimension lumber which our own Indian sawmills are providing. The sole difference between the two requisitions is that we are ordering insul-bric siding and extra nails for Island Lake because the mill there will not turn out lumber siding.\n\nIn view of the short period of time left to you to arrange for purchase orders, it is suggested that you order these materials from the same firms who supplied identical materials and quantities.\nfor the Oak River Indian Day School in the Griswold Agency (Your Purchase Orders 24391, etc.).\n\nIt will be necessary for the firm supplying Millwork to be supplied with a complete set of blueprints and a copy of the specifications for the school building and outside toilets. All dimensions and descriptions of the items required are shown or noted and are to be followed closely. All lumber for Millwork to be of No. 1 factory cuts, B.C. fir or equal pine.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBPN/RCG\nOttawa, January 7, 1948.\n\nMr. R. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\n1948-49 Building Program - Norway House Agency\n\nReference your letters of December 19 and December 27 - on File 9-8\n\nWe have taken the following action with regard to the proposed building of three new day schools and teacherages in your Agency:\n\n(a) Cross Lake R.C. Indian Day School -\n\nWe have forwarded a requisition to our Departmental Purchasing Agent for the building materials listed on your requisition. We have asked that these building materials be ordered to reach Wabowden not later than 4 March, 1948. Inspector Hamilton is being forwarded a copy of this letter and is requested to approach Tom Lamb regarding the transportation of these supplies from Wabowden to Cross Lake.\n\n(b) Island Lake U.C. Day School -\n\nWe have forwarded a bill of materials for this school to our Departmental Purchasing Agent with the request that the supplies reach Ilford not later than 12 February, 1948. We have asked that these supplies be forwarded via Johnson Transportation Company. If Inspector Hamilton wishes to advise concerning the two other transportation companies at Ilford, we will be glad to hear from him.\n\nYour comments concerning the gypsum board have been noted and we have substituted Ten-test, as required.\n\n........... Sth\nWith regard to the siding for the Island Lake School, we have substituted Insul-brick for Asbestos-siding shingles. We have found that Asbestos-siding shingles sustain a great loss in shipping even on the railways. Therefore we have replaced this item with Insul-brick and hope that it will prove satisfactory. If you wish literature on the method of applying Insul-brick, I would suggest you contact the firm supplying it when you receive the purchase order.\n\nGod's Lake Narrows U.C. Day School -\n\nUnfortunately, North American Builders Limited have such a large quantity of orders from the Army and Department of Transport ahead of them, that they will not be able to build our prefabricated schools until the late spring. Therefore, we have no alternative other than to place the order for this school and request that it be delivered as early in the winter as the tractor train shipments are made. We regret this action, but so many other concerns are ordering prefabricated buildings, that we must wait our turn for delivery.\n\nI would draw your attention to the policy of the Department in naming these day schools so as to provide a minimum confusion in our filing system here. At the present time there is considerable confusion concerning the naming of the schools in your agency. For example, we are now dealing with three Cross Lake Schools, namely,\n\nCross Lake Residential School,\nCross Lake U. C. Day School,\nCross Lake R. C. Day School.\n\nA similar situation exists at God's Lake, at Oxford House and at Island Lake. The inevitable errors have occurred in filing accounts, letters, etc., and in the filling of requisitions and orders.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Major Clark and we would like to hear your views concerning other names\n\n...... for\nfor certain of your schools. Similar situations have arisen in other agencies when new schools were being built. For example, we have a school at Fisher River but a new one is under construction there now. Rather than have a Fisher River No. 2, we have accepted Mr. Indian Agent Lumsden's suggestion that it be named the \"Hurdock Indian Day School\", after the present Chief. Major Clark suggested the name Sagitouek for one of the Gross Lake schools. We will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard J.

Cross Lake Day School, to arrive March 4th is fine. I realize material of this kind is very hard to gather up. One year our tractor swings arrived from South Indian Lake on April 8th, with no mishaps; therefore you could stretch the date of building material to arrive say up to March 16th. The tractor rate to Cross Lake is $35.00 per ton.\"\n\nI might add if the Empire Sash and Door are able to supply the material for Island Lake Day School, by the end of next week, they certainly should be able to complete the other order by March 4th.\n\nI wrote and wired Mr. Duke Lindal, who is also doing custom freighting in the North, but to date I have had no reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

I have obtained the services of Mr Earl Adams who built the U.C. Sagittawuk School & Teacherage last year and another man for whom he vouches. I think he would also be agreeable to build the school at Island Lake employing in both places whatever labor is available. I have a further suggestion which I made to Mr Adams that he and his man commence work at Cross Lake soon as there is open water and I informed him we would pay his air transportation from Wabowden which would be about $20.00 for himself and his man. He requests the same rate of pay as last year. I know of no-one else whose services I can obtain to build these schools.\n\nPlease let me know if these arrangements are satisfactory, and if so I request an Accountable Advance of $4,000.00 with which to pay wages for the construction of the Cross Lake School.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 177\n\nDate: 11 February 1949\n\nAgent\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th on the Sagitowack Indian Day School.\n\nThis school is taught by Miss McDonald and is a new building, built, I believe, in 1947. It is a very good classroom and very airy. There are 38 children on the register, 34 of which were in the classroom at the time of my visit.\n\nMiss McDonald is a very good teacher and discipline was excellent. A new R.C. school is being built this year and is only a few hundred yards away. When this school is opened it will reduce Miss McDonald's classroom in half. It appears to me that when putting up this school, the Department was poorly advised, as the one school would have handled all the pupils - as it is doing now. If the new school had been on some other reserve it would have been more use and less cost, in the long run to the Department.\n\nThis is the above mentioned school, which has not been completed as yet. It is a combination two-room building. The workmanship is fair, however, the cement work is not of the best. This is caused by the material it was necessary to use. The rocks that were put into the cement are oversized, and did not make as smooth a job as would have been otherwise. However, the foundation is quite strong, and after having a coat of cement it will be quite alright. This school should be completed by the time of writing - with the exception of trimming on the cement outside.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI have been informed by Father G E Trudeau, O.M.I., of Cross Lake that the following equipment has not been supplied for the new teacherage of the Sagittawuk R.C. Indian Day School there:\n\nStove pipes for Kitchen Range\nChemical Toilet\nTable and chairs (Simpson's marked unable to supply)\n\nWould you please check and ascertain when delivery of this equipment may be expected as the school is nearing completion.\n\nF.M. Hughes,\nA/Superintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\n26th March, 1949.\n\nMr. F.M. Hughes,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to equipment for the Sagittawuk Indian Day School. You mention in your letter that the chemical toilet has not been supplied. In regard to this item, we received Voucher No. 259 dated 16th December, 1948, from Regional Supervisor Davis, covering the cost of a sanitary closet which he had apparently shipped to the Sagittawuk School.\n\nOn 2nd November, 1948, we forwarded Purchase Order No. 35494 to the Robert Simpson Western Limited, Regina, Saskatchewan, requesting them to supply the furnishings shown on our standard list of equipment to the Sagittawuk School. The items on the requisition were to be forwarded to Wabowden, Manitoba, for transportation by winter freight.\n\nPossibly this shipment has not yet reached the school, but as soon as it does we would appreciate your certifying the account and forwarding it to this office for payment, as we wish to pay the cost of the furnishings from the current year's appropriation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n26th March, 1949.\n\nThe Robt. Simpson Western Limited,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Purchase Order 35494\n\nThe above ordered furnishings for the teacher's residence at the Sagittawuk Indian Day School, and you were requested to ship them to Wabowden, Manitoba.\n\nPlease let me know on what date the shipment went forward. You are also requested to forward your Invoice to Mr. F.M. Hughes, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Norway House, Manitoba. Mailing connections to that point at the present time are uncertain, and we would appreciate it if you would forward a copy of your Invoice to this office.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The yard should be cleared of brush, some scaffolding is to be taken down. There is no chemical toilet, no desks at present. All trim around windows and doors (outside) is to painted. A poor job of varnishing, but this will go for a year or so. I estimate that the sum of $300.00 will be required to fully complete this building and would suggest that Stanley Campbell, who at present is working at Island Lake U.D. School, be sent up there as soon as the Island Lake School is complete.\n\nA telegram has been sent to Wabowden asking for information regarding the desks, which were requisitioned. As soon as definite information is obtained, I will report further.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsgd. J. Waite,\nField Agent.\n\nMr. R. S.

It was requested on the requisition that 10 desks No.1 and 15 each of desks No.2 and No.3 be forwarded for this school via Hudson's Bay Railway, c/o Father G.E. Trudeau, Wabowden, Manitoba, but it was stated in covering letter that if same could not be forwarded by winter freight they should be shipped to Winnipeg c/o Selkirk Navigation Co. via Whiskey Jack Portage to arrive at Cross Lake in June.\n\nI wired the Hudson's Bay Railway at Wabowden recently and was informed no school desks were on hand at that point.

In the May number of the \"Indian Missionary Record\" the president of the Roman Catholic Indian association extols the possibilities of farming on the north bank.\n\nThe question of whether children should cross the river to go to school will have to be settled by actual observation.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 548-5, part 1)\nRecord file in E3\n\nI am slowly understanding the situation at Fort Alexandra. I recommend that you come in your own school. See me on return.\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nProposed Day School at Fort Alexander for Roman Catholic Indians:\n\nFurther study of possible sites was made today in company with Mr. Supt. Olson. Various matters related to siting and attendance were discussed with the Reverend Principal and Sister Superior of Fort Alexander Residential School, Miss Turner (the Anglican Day School teacher) and Rev. Canon Walters, the resident Anglican priest and missionary.\n\nIt is generally agreed to regard the river as a barrier too formidable to be negotiated daily by children going between home and school.\n\nIt will be easier to get forty day pupils within a convenient radius to attend a school on the left bank, the side on which are located the majority of homes, the Church, the schools, the road and the electricity and telephone lines.\n\nThe Roman Catholic population clusters about a mile down-river from their school, stretching up-river past the school to an area about two and a half miles up-river from the residential school. In this area the denominations are mingled with Protestants in the majority near their own school.\nEmployment opportunities at Pine Falls and up-river are likely to hold the Indians from moving farther down-river. The residential school seems the farthest down-river point at which a day school might be sited. The day school might, indeed, be sited a half-mile or so up-river from the residential school (near the Oblate Fathers' Park) but the shortened walk for a minority of those attending would entail the loss of several advantages offered by close proximity to the residential school\u2014good water, easy power hook-up, play space and apparatus, ease of staffing and supervision, better grouping of pupils by grades and generally unification rather than disintegration of the educational, cultural and religious effort. An integrated recreational programme would also be easier to effect.\n\nRev. Fr. Brachet is agreeable to placing the day school building on the south side of the residential school on ground presently occupied by an old ice-house, and balancing the preventorium. In this position a teacherage would not be needed. Instead, it is desired that the classroom be elongated to at least fifty feet (Plan 888 calls for a building fifty-nine feet long). This room would be a beginners' classroom and could serve as a picture-theatre, etc. The Principal agrees to merge day-pupils and boarders in this and other classrooms.\n\nOn the right (north) bank two classrooms for day pupils will be needed. Research on statistics and siting of these schools (one for each denomination) is proceeding with a view to requesting funds for the simultaneous construction of two schools in the fiscal year 1950-51.\n\nCopy to Winnipeg Office\n\nC.A.T. Clark\nJuly 11, 1949.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nFort Alexander Indian Day School.\n\nI have had two long discussions with Major Clark concerning our plans for the erection of a new day school for the Roman Catholic children at Fort Alexander. I gather that the best plan this year will be to erect a Roman Catholic day school directly adjacent to the present residential school. This can handle all the R.C. children within walking distance, and will relieve the pressure on the residential school. Mr. Olson has submitted the survey form on potential school population. This would indicate that we may have to consider the erection of two day schools on the north side of the river at some future date. If you are agreed to erect a day school near the residential school now, please advise if a suitable site is available and if water can be obtained at once. We can then proceed to advertise for tenders for the erection of this building.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. OLSON\nMr. B. F.

The Father made a request that a full basement be installed in the new school, which is being erected at the Fort Alexander Reserve, the tenders for which close on the 19th of August.\n\nThe Father further stated that Mr. Davis had practically promised a basement for this school. In view of this statement I managed to contact Mr. Davis by telephone at The Pas and he requested me to advise you of the visit that the Father had made to this office. Mr. Davis' opinion on the matter is that certainly a basement would probably be a good feature but he stated that if a basement was included in the Fort Alexander School then, no doubt, we would be having a goodly number of requests from other schools for the same feature.\n\nI am advising Father Brachet tomorrow to the effect that I have written to you regarding his request and also advising him to the effect that I contacted Mr. Davis and it was at Mr. Davis' request that I forwarded to you the foregoing information.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 548-5, part 1)\nFurther, Mr. Davis advised me that he at no time promised that a basement would be included in the Fort Alexander Day School as he realizes this would be the forerunner of a large number of requests.\n\nForwarded for your information and any action which you may deem necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nJR/MO\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Wiring New Fort Alexander Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware the North American Buildings have been awarded the contract for the above mentioned school.

This would provide the type of \"hall-room\" which Rev. Fr. Brachet desired.\n\nI also noticed the considerable concrete and labour required to put in that central supporting wall in lieu of basement pillars. The men on the job at Louis Bull, where the building stands on a sandy mound, said that a basement would have entailed very little more work and materials. At Fort Alexander, however, the building is sited on a flat field.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Winnipeg\nSuperintendent, Selkirk.\nOctober 31, 1949.\n\nMajor C.A.F.

Present regulations require us to deduct from all salaries the 2% National Defence tax. This means a deduction in your case of $6.90 and leaves the net amount of the cheque $298.10. Provided your total income for the year 1940 does not exceed $500.00 you may, at the end of December of the current year, apply to the Dominion Income Tax Inspector in Winnipeg for a refund of the deduction mentioned above.\n\nI am writing to Indian Agent Lazenby today advising him that your address is Durban, Man., and requesting him to forward your cheque to you immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

No doubt this cheque has already reached you and if you are still holding it please forward it at once to C.J.

The return was made out on foolscap paper, and did not give all the required information. I received this on September 29th. On the same date I wrote to Mr Filion advising him that this was not acceptable, and forwarded a supply of the proper forms for his return. I received the return made on the proper forms on October 21st, which was the last mail into Norway House before freeze-up. I dated the return the following day, October 22nd and as there was no mail service until the first plane in over the ice, on November 26th, the return was consequently that much delayed.\n\nP.G.

Day School Teacher's salary for 1946.\n\nIn November of last year, I received from the Treasury Department a cheque amounting to Three Hundred Ten Dollars and Eighty-three ($310.83) in payment of teaching days just in at God's Lake R.C. Indian Day School. In vain do I succeed to figure out how you arrived at that amount, barring your calculations on the school reports which have been forwarded to you through your Department's Agency at Norway House.\n\nThese reports compiled directly in accordance with the Register kept at the School give in the Column \"Remarks,\" the following data:\n\nHolidays:\n- Treaty: 8 days\n- Windbound: 1 day\n- Canada Day: 1 day\n- School open: 50 days\n\nTotal number of school days: 55 days\n\nIf you consider that in the months of June, July and August, 1946, there were only thirteen (13) \"five day\" weeks, making sixty-five school days, holidays permitted as indicated in the Register included,\nMy total salary should be sixty-five cents (55\u00a2) of three times \"One Hundred Twenty\" monthly salary ($3 x $120.00) plus cost of living bonus, giving, if my calculations are correct, Three Hundred Four Dollars and sixty-one Cents ($304.61) plus Cost of living bonus, instead of Three Hundred Ten and Eighty-three Cents ($310.83) Cost of living bonus included.\n\nYou may have wondered with reason how I arrived at the total number of school days marked on the report. I am sorry not to have stated that school was kept opened on Saturdays, with an attendance sometimes even better than the normal. Your calculations probably considered only normal five day weeks as required, and not \"six day\" weeks which I just did.\n\nI am sure you will kindly excuse my delay in taking the matter up with you directly, and make good the difference due me.\n\nThanking you in advance for your trouble,\n\nLeon Levasseur\n\nYours truly,\n\nLeon Levasseur\n\n30 4-61\n\n30 4-61\n\n51 68\n\n30 6-29\nOttawa, February 21st, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th inst., in which you claim that you were not paid sufficiently for your services last summer at the God's Lake R.C. Day School.\n\nThe method you adopt for computing your salary is different from that used by our Treasury Branch. However, I have discussed the matter with the officials concerned and it has been decided to make a small additional payment to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Leon Levasseur,\nNoviciat Notre Dame,\nRichelieu, Quebec.\n| NAME OF TEACHER AND P.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 549-5, part 1)\nAt the God's Lake Reserve, there is no school building, properly speaking, at either the U.C. or R.C. missions. These are both \"Seasonal\" schools being operated for three months in the summer time. The United Church is used for the U.C. school, and this building itself is a very shoddy place. The R.C. school assembles in a small log building, which is in good shape, but has a very low ceiling, and only three windows.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nNorway House, Man:\n7th February 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to Mr. R.A. Hoey's letter No. 123-13-5, dated 5th February 1938, in which authority was granted for the construction of 12 double school desks at a cost of $7.50 each, including labour and material, for the God's Lake R.C. Indian Day School. Brother Cordeau was authorized to make these desks.\n\nOn receiving the necessary authority, Brother Cordeau prepared the materials for all the desks, and had assembled two of them. He was then called away from God's Lake, to work on the new R.C. Residential School at Cross Lake, and in consequence the desks were not completed until this summer, when the teacher, Mr. Honsinger did the work.\n\nThe Priest in charge of the R.C. Mission at God's Lake has now advised me that the desks have been completed, and asks if the payment can still be made. The matter was discussed when I was at God's Lake last summer for treaty payment, as at that time the desks were not finished.\n\nThe original authority of course automatically expired at the close of the fiscal year 1938-39.\n\nWill you please advise me if a new authority might be granted for payment for these desks, so that I may advise the Priest in charge, (Rev.: L. Poirier O.M.I.).\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

P - the school to be known as the Peguis West Indian Day School. Classroom accommodation for 35 children is required. A note has been made for the 1931-32 Estimates.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 550-5, part 1)\nIn the latter part of your No. 136-5-5, I note that you state you hope to provide funds next year for another residence and school to be known as the Peguis West Indian Day School. In connection with the site for this school, when Inspector Christianson last visited the school he held a meeting of the Indians on the south end of the reserve. The Chief and Councillors were there, as well as all Indians concerned in the erection of a new day school. The site picked out is in the extreme N.W. corner of the N.E. \u00bc of Section 6. If a school is built on this location, the children farthest from the school are those of Percy Cook and Edwin Cook. The former lives on the S.E. \u00bc of Sec. 3, and the latter lives on the S.W. \u00bc of Sec. 2. Most of the others live on Sections 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The South School is situated on the N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 16, right on the banks of the river. The Inspector informs me that, after going into the matter very thoroughly and talking it over with the resident Missionary, Mr. Morris, they agreed that the place above mentioned is the most central location. Inspector Christianson personally went over the ground and picked out the exact location.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nREGINA, Sask., His No. 203-11, dated Mar. 25/31.\n\nOriginal on 136-5-5\n\nOn page five, under the heading of 'General', the Inspector speaks of a proposed school that is to be erected on the south end of the Peguis Reserve. I do not know whether it is the intention of the Department to go ahead with this school or not. I should like to be advised.\nOttawa, April 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your 205-11 of the 25th ultimo which relates to the proposed new school at the south west part of the Peguis Reserve. The Department has decided to name this school the Peguis West Indian Day School. There is already one known as the South School. I regret that there does not appear any possibility of being funds this year to proceed with the erection of the proposed building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n| Item | Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n|      |             |          |            |       |\n|      |             |          |            |       |\n\n**Total:** $7184\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nProposed Peguis South Day School\n\nProposed Lake St. Martin Day School\n\nOak River Day School.\n\nDuring his recent visit to the Department Mr. Indian Agent Young advised that he was completely satisfied with the work of Mr. John Robertson of Kenton, Manitoba, in erecting the Oak River School. It is therefore suggested that Mr. Robertson be approached to ascertain if he is interested in building another school for us on the same basis.\n\nIncluded in our 1948-49 estimates are one-room schools and attached teachers' residences for Lake St. Martin in the Portage la Prairie Agency and Peguis South in the Fisher River Agency. It is recommended that Mr. Robertson be approached concerning these schools. They would be identical with the one he is now finishing at Oak River.\n\nIt would require two or three months to obtain the standard bill of materials for these schools. Therefore we are trying to line up our building programme now, before there is too much contracting activity.\n\nI might add that we have found that the day labour basis of building, as adopted at Oak River, has proven cheaper than the cost plus basis contract, as used at Murdoch in the Fisher River Agency. While we have not yet the final cost...\nfigures, it is evident that the Oak River School will cost less than the Murdoch School (these buildings are identical).\n\nFrom the map it would seem evident that Mr. Robertson would be more likely to be interested in the Lake St. Martin School rather than in the Peguis School. Therefore Mr. Lazenby should advise if there is any good carpenter interested in the Peguis School on a day labour basis.\n\nBlueprints, specifications and bills of materials for the standard one-room school with teacher's residence are being sent, along with this letter to the two Agents concerned.\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nProposed Peguis South Day School.\n\nI have for acknowledgement a copy of the Department's letter of the 15th March 1948, File 136-5-5 (E), addressed to Inspector A.G. Hamilton, regarding the above noted proposed new day school.\n\nOn making enquiries locally, I find that there is no competent carpenter who could undertake the construction of this school. There was a carpenter at Fisher Branch, but he is working in Winnipeg and not available.\n\nI wrote to Messrs Wylie & Compton, at Winnipeg, the contractors who constructed the Murdoch School last summer, and I saw Mr. Wylie when I was recently in Winnipeg. I asked Mr. Wylie if his firm would consider building the new school on a day labour basis, but he said (verbally) that they would not consider it, as they would not be able to get the labour to leave Winnipeg where they can get all the work they want.\n\nMr. Wylie did state that owing to the location of this new school, the cost of construction would be far less than that of Murdoch School, even if undertaken on a cost plus 10% basis.\n\nAt a meeting of the Peguis Chief and Council, held on April 6th, the matter of a site for this proposed new school was discussed, and after considerable debate, and taking into consideration the area where the most of the children live, who...\nwould be attending the school, the site chosen was the southwest corner of the N.W.\u00bc of Sec. 6, Twp. 26, R.1, W.M. on the Peguis Reserve. This particular quarter section is owned by Albert Thomas, an Indian of Peguis Band, and Councillor Andrew McPherson was delegated to see Albert Thomas, and ask him if he would have any objection to having the school built on this corner of his land. Mr. Thomas advised that he would be glad to surrender two acres of his land for school purposes at any time.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nSup't: Fisher River Agency.\n\nc.c.

When the tenders are submitted to the Minister's office for approval, it is naturally important that they be made out with the exact name of the school for which they are intended. I regret this inconvenience to you but you will understand the need for this.\n\nIf, when these have been changed, they can be sent to me by airmail, I can then have them submitted at once to the Minister's office for consideration.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Doucet advises us that Mr. McKenzie is prepared to accept the construction of the Peguis South Day School instead of the Lake St. Martin School. As soon as his tender is received here, it will be submitted to the Minister's office for consideration.\n\nIf and when it is accepted it will mean that he will be responsible for all the labour at the school while the Department will be responsible for the providing of the materials. Please find attached hereto a copy of the standard bill of materials for this one-room school and attached teacherage. I would ask that upon receipt of notification of the acceptance of this tender, you submit the attached bill of materials by Airmail to this office with an attached requisition form, on which you can state somewhat as follows:\n\n\"To materials required for standard one-room Indian day school and attached teacher's residence as per the attached bill\".\n\nYou can then state on the requisition forms the names of local firms who, you feel, are in a position to supply items such as\n(1) Gravel, sand, brick, tile, etc.\n(2) Lumber,\n(3) Hardware,\n(4) Plumbing supplies,\n(5) Paint.\n\nIt is not necessary to mention a firm for the supply of cement as we order this directly from the manufacturer.

ALLAN,\n\nPeguis South Indian Day School.\n\nIt is our intention to erect a new Indian Day School on the above Reserve in the Fisher River Agency.\n\nIn a recent letter to the Department, Mr. Indian Superintendent Lazenby commented as follows:\n\n\"At a meeting of the Peguis Chief and Council, held on April 6th, the matter of a site for this proposed new school was discussed, and after considerable debate, and taking into consideration the area where the most of the children live, who would be attending the school, the site chosen was the southwest corner of the N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 6, Twp. 26, Rl., WRM on the Peguis Reserve.

Mr. Thomas advised that he would be glad to surrender two acres of his land for school purposes at any time\".\n\nCould we please be advised as to the action which can be taken with regard to the surrender of the land and whether you wish it handled by your Division or by this Division.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPoveshell South Indian Day School.\n\nThe above noted Day School is one for which the sum of $14,000.00 was included in our Main 1948-49 Estimates this year. Indian Superintendent Lazenby of the Fisher River Agency made inquiries locally and found that there are no competent carpenters who could undertake the construction of this school. He reported that there was a carpenter at Fisher Branch, but he is working in Winnipeg and not available. He also wrote to Messrs Wylie & Compton who built the Murdoch School. He reported as follows:\n\n\"I wrote to Messrs Wylie & Compton, at Winnipeg, the contractors who constructed the Murdoch School last summer, and I saw Mr. Wylie when I was recently in Winnipeg. I asked Mr. Wylie if his firm would consider building the new school on a day labour basis, but he said (verbally) that they would not consider it, as they would not be able to get the labour to leave Winnipeg where they can get all the work they want\".\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet our Supervisor of Vocational Training was on an inspection trip of Manitoba, when he was able to contact Mr. Archibald F. McKenzie of Portage la Prairie who indicated that he would be interested in the construction of this school on a straight labour basis. We have just received Mr. McKenzie's tender by air mail and it is attached hereto. His labour tender is for $4,968.00. As you are already aware, the labour expenditure on a cost plus basis for the standard schools have been amounting to between $5,100. and $6,200. In view of the isolated locality of this school, it is felt that Mr. McKenzie's tender is fair and reasonable and is recommended for approval by the Minister.\n\nDirector.\nLABOUR CONDITIONS\n\nThe following labour conditions are applicable to the work of construction of a school at Hoggsan, Man., to be undertaken for the Department of Mines & Resources.\n\n(1) No workman employed upon the said work shall at any time be paid less than the minimum rates of wages, or shall work more than the number of hours, set forth in the following schedule:\n\n| TRADE OR CLASS OF LABOUR | RATE OF WAGES NOT LESS THAN | HOURS OF LABOUR NOT MORE THAN |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                          |                            | For Day                      |\n|                          |                            | Per Week                     |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers | $1.50                     | 8                            |\n| Brick and hollow tile layers helpers (mixing and tempering mortar) | .80                        |                              |\n| Carpenters and joiners    | 1.10                       |                              |\n| Cement finishers          | .85                        |                              |\n| Cement and concrete mixer operators | .75                        |                              |\n| Steam - Gas, or else      | .60                        |                              |\n| Compressor operators (gas, or else) | .45                        |                              |\n| Drivers                   | .65                        |                              |\n| Driver, team and wagon    | 1.05                       |                              |\n| Drill runners             | .60                        |                              |\n| Electricians (inside wires) | 1.20                       |                              |\n| Engineers, operating, steam | 1.00                      |                              |\n| Single or double drums    | 1.00                       |                              |\n| Three or more drums       | 1.00                       |                              |\n| Engineers, crane (stone, gas, else) | 1.00                      |                              |\n| Engineers, stationary     | .75                        |                              |\n| Hoist operators - tower (gas, or else) | .65                        |                              |\n| Labourers                 | .65                        |                              |\n| Laborers                  |                            |                              |\n| Metal - Wood              | 1.10                       |                              |\n| Motor truck drivers       | .75                        |                              |\n| Motor truck driver and truck | 1.75                      |                              |\n| Ornamental iron workers   | 1.10                       |                              |\n| Painters (spray)          | 1.05                       |                              |\n| Painters and glazers      | 1.05                       |                              |\n| Plasterers                | 1.50                       |                              |\n| Plasterers' helpers (mixing and tempering material) | .80                        |                              |\n| Plumbers and steamfitters | 1.85                       |                              |\n| Plumbers and steamfitters' helpers (all non assigned to help tradesmen) | .80                        |                              |\n| Riggers (general)         | .80                        |                              |\n| Rodmen (reinforced steel) | .80                        |                              |\n| Roofers                   |                            |                              |\n| Felt and gravel patented composition | .75                        |                              |\n| Sheet metal               | .80                        |                              |\n| Sheet metal workers       | .80                        |                              |\n| Steam shovel engineers   | 1.05                       |                              |\n| Steam shovel fitters      | .75                        |                              |\n| Steam shovel drivers      | .75                        |                              |\n| Shovel operators (gas)    | 1.05                       |                              |\n| Satchmen                  | .60                        |                              |\n| Welders and burners (acetylene or else) | .95                        |                              |\n\nN.B.\u2014The wage rates specified above are those deemed to be current at the time this schedule was prepared.

L. (See next page)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 550-5, part 1)\n(2) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for over-time work which is the proper classification of any work for the purpose of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail to do so, or shall fail to pay wages to any employee or employees for services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed thereby by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding over-time and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rate so fixed or at the rate fixed thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this clause, the decision of the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen. All the books or documents containing such records shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wage Officers of the Government at any time and may be inspected by the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour and vocational classes applicable to each trade included in the scope of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages under the said act.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your request of the 29th ultimo, we are enclosing labour conditions for insertion in the proposed contract for construction of a school - Peguis South Indian Day School at Hodgson, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector of Industrial Relations\n(M. M. Maclean)\nOttawa, May 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPeguis South Indian Day School.\n\nThe above noted Day School is one for which the sum of $14,000.00 was included in our Main 1948-49 Estimates this year. Indian Superintendent Lazenby of the Fisher River Agency made inquiries locally and found that there are no competent carpenters who could undertake the construction of this school. He reported that there was a carpenter at Fisher Branch, but he is working in Winnipeg and not available. He also wrote to Messrs Wylie & Compton who built the Murdoch School. He reported as follows:\n\n\"I wrote to Messrs Wylie & Compton, at Winnipeg, the contractors who constructed the Murdoch School last summer, and I saw Mr. Wylie when I was recently in Winnipeg. I asked Mr. Wylie if his firm would consider building the new school on a day labour basis, but he said (verbally) that they would not consider it, as they would not be able to get the labour to leave Winnipeg where they can get all the work they want.\"\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet our Supervisor of Vocational Training was on an inspection trip of Manitoba, when he was able to contact Mr. Archibald F. McKenzie of Portage la Prairie who indicated that he would be interested in the construction of this school on a straight labour basis. We have just received Mr. McKenzie's tender by air mail and it is attached hereto. His labour tender is for $4,968.00. As you are already aware, the labour expenditure on a cost plus basis for the standard schools have been amounting to between $5,100. and $6,200. In view of the isolated locality of this school, it is felt that Mr. McKenzie's tender is fair and reasonable and is recommended for approval by the Minister.\n\nEncl:\nMay 4th 1948\n\nB.J. Neary Esq.\nDept. of Education\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 3rd inst to hand. I enclose herewith tenders with the necessary changes made from Lake St Martin to Peguis South in Manitoba. Trusting this is satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J. McKenzie.\nI hereby agree to build and finish complete Indian Day School with Teachers quarters combined at Peguis South, Manitoba.\n\nAccording to plans and specifications No. 837 Sheet 1 to 5.\n\nAt the Indian reservation of Peguis in Manitoba.\n\nAll work done in a substantial and workmanlike manner for the erection and complete finishing of the combination Day School and Teachers residence also Boys' & Girls' toilets for the sum of $4,968.20 work only.\n\nAll material for the above school and residence to be paid for and delivered to the building site by the Dept of Indian Affairs.\n\nArchibald L. McKenzie\n105 7th Street S.W.\nPortage La Prairie,\nManitoba.\nTender for supervision of work in the erection of the Indian Day School and Teachers quarters combined at Peguis South, Manitoba.\n\nI hereby agree to supervise the erection and completion of the Indian Day School and Teachers quarters combined according to the plans & specifications No. 837.

Cedar Bevel Siding.\n\nA representative of the Provincial Department of Public Works called at the office today, and gave me permission to secure the necessary gravel and sand for this school from Provincial Crown Land, which is within four miles of the site chosen for the school.\n\nWinnipeg firms, from whom other required materials may be purchased, are set out in the requisition.\n\nMr. Doucet and Mr. J. Waite called at the agency yesterday, and together we visited the Peguis Centre and Peguis South schools, and then visited the site chosen for the new school, which was approved, and the location of the building settled.\n\nI also received instructions to immediately start the\n\n... work ...\nwork of digging a well at the site, the location of which was also decided, with relation to the location of the building itself. It will be necessary to purchase direct from this office, sufficient Fir dimension lumber and nails for the cribbing of the well, and I received authority to purchase these materials from Messrs Doucet and Waite. This work will be commenced as quickly as possible.\n\nIt will of course be necessary to hire trucks for the haulage of the gravel and other materials to the site. It would therefore be appreciated if the Department would forward an accountable advance of $500.00 to take care of these expenses, in due course. The hauling of the gravel can be commenced at any time in the near future.\n\nP.G.

The gravel is being hauled this week.\n\nI may add that Mr. Waite and Mr. Doucet visited the site, and instructed me to have the well dug and cribbed.\n\nAuthority to purchase the materials for the concrete forms was received direct from Ottawa.\n\nP.G.

There is a depth of 6 feet of good water. An effort was made to go deeper, but when the water was pumped out, it came back in too fast to allow further digging.\n\nThe cement, purchased by the Department has arrived, and as there was no storage room at the school site, this has been temporarily stored in a building in Hodgson, and will be hauled to the site as soon as the contractor arrives and can build a shed for it. Last night, the lumber and nails for the cement forms arrived, and is being hauled to the site today. The gravel hauling will be commenced on Monday next.\n\nIn view of the above, I today telephoned the office of the Regional Supervisor in Winnipeg, and advised that the contractor could come at any time now, and commence excavation of the basement and the construction of the forms.\n\nP.G.

In view of the difficulty in obtaining delivery of these items, which are in short supply, and the comparatively small amount involved, it will be in order for Mr. Davis to make the best possible arrangements for local purchase.\n\nTo complete our file on this building, please send covering invoice when delivery has been taken.\n\nW.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nWe wish to refer to our REQUISITION dated July 23rd last and to the above purchase orders. Apparently, errors have occurred in the quantities required.\n\nOn the requisition 3 dash 5 pounds Putty are specified but only 3 pounds are on the purchase order. 15 pounds are required. Also, 2 dash 25 lb bag Alatint white on requisition and only 2 pounds ordered on Purchase order. Item 1-1 gal Turpentine are on the requisition and \u00bd gallon ordered which leaves us short \u00bd gal on each job.\n\nAs the painters are here working, we ordered by telephone the above differences in order to complete the job in time for the opening of the schools. And too, the painters do not want to lay around waiting for material.\n\nWe have also had to order some plaster to fill cracks and patches of plastering which have fallen out. Mr. Wadellius did not include this with his list of material, but advised that this would have been done and included in the job, had he had to supply both labour and material.\n\nWe regret the urgency of ordering these extras and would be pleased to have confirmation of authority to purchase this material as required to complete the jobs.\n\nfor P G Lazenby\nSup't: Fisher River Agency\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Peguis South-West (RES)\n\nIndian Day School -\n\nVOTE. 516 ALLOTMENT. 12 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS 435\n\nSHIP TO.

The report we forwarded was a Labour return for $440.05 being wages Mr. McKenzie had paid out, and was not intended as a request for payment. The Progress Report we are now forwarding is for $2,000.00 which Mr. McKenzie requests. This is the first Progress Report and the first request for payment.\n\nIn view of the above, it may be advisable to return the $940.05 cheque for cancellation and ask that the $2,000. Progress Report be approved.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSEP 20 1948\n\nfor P G Lazenby\nSup't Fisher River Agency\n\nc.c. for Dept - Ottawa-\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is understood from your letter of the 21st ultimo that you gave Mr. McKenzie $940.00 from the accountable advance that was sent to you. As it appears from the Progress Payment Certificate that you forwarded that Mr. McKenzie is entitled to $2,000.00, having completed the framing and the sheathing of the walls and roof (as mentioned in article III, subsection ii, of the contract agreement), the amount of $2,000.00 is therefore due him. However, as you have already paid him $940.00, we are only forwarding him a cheque for the balance. You should forward a credit voucher for the $940.00 payment that you have made to Mr. McKenzie so that we can straighten up the advance with the Treasury Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/EM\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES AND RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: October 8, 1948\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | A.

All exterior work completed including painting. There is 1 toilet however not finished as we are short of siding for it.\n\nThe interior is being painted now, walls and ceilings. We are waiting for material to complete the basement stairway. Interior finishing has not yet started, that is, the casings, trim etc.,\n\nWe are today getting in touch with the Furnace Contractor re getting the Furnace in. (We are hoping to get him to repair the Fisher River School furnace while he is here.) We are also ordering a sink and indoor toilet, these do not appear on any of the purchase orders, although the sink is listed in the specifications.\n\nIn Mr. Neary's letter 550-5 (E 1) October 20th last, the $2968, accountable advance has not arrived. This is the balance of this contract. The next $1,000 will of course, not be advanced to Mr. McKenzie until he has completed the interior work.\n\nMr. McKenzie is making a good job of this building, it looks attractive and we are pleased to be able to report favourably on it.\n\ncc for Mr. Davis, Wpg.\nNovember 9, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Subsequently, we forwarded him a payment of $1060, making a total payment to him of $2000.05.\n\nWhile I agree that an item of five cents is rather insignificant, still in accounting it is as important as a much larger amount. Consequently, when you are forwarding the next request for a progress payment you should show a reduction of five cents.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/HM.\nNorth American Lumber & Supply Co.

Up to date the uncompleted work is as follows: (1) Painting toilets last coat; (2) painting outside landing and steps; (3) Painting concrete floor in basement.\n\nAs the weather for doing this work is too cold this finishing had to be left until next spring. Mr. McKenzie promised the undersigned that he would return for the required time to complete same in May or June when so requested. The remainder would require approximately 2 days to complete.\n\nMr. Waite, Field Agent from the Winnipeg Office inspected the building and found all work satisfactory and up to specifications.\n\nIt is requested, that authority be granted to this Office to pay Mr. McKenzie in full as his agreement calls for, and leave it to his honor to return for the two days required to fulfill his Agreement.

Therefore, I authorized that the ground be levelled and the backfill carried out - in order to prevent damage to the building foundation, and trust that you concur in my action.\n\nMr. Davis is presently away on an inspection trip of the North and has requested me to forward to you the above information.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEncl.\nJR/ES\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nWe have supplied Tenders for the Indian Day School and Teacherage at Peguis #2, #3 and #4, also for the Long Plain Indian Reserve. In our Tender we estimated that we could have these schools completed and ready for operation on the first of September. It was hoped at that time that the contracts would be awarded within ten days of the closing of the Tender.\n\nThis letter is to enquire if a decision has been made and if not, will it be made by July 1st? If it is made on July 1st or after, we shall have to ask for an extension of time necessary for the completion of the contract, if it is awarded to us.\n\nMr. Davis in a conversation advised us that a similar unit was proposed to be constructed this year at Rosburn Indian Reserve. I had an occasion to be in that area and have examined this site. Afterwards I called on Mr. Smith, your Agent at Birtle, to find out when the advertisement for Tender was to be posted. He was of the opinion that it should now be advertised, but had not seen it himself. On checking his correspondence, I observed that the school was proposed for September, 1950. However he reiterated that he understood from Major Clark and Mr. Davis that this school was to be completed in 1949. Could you kindly advise us in this respect?\n\nMr. Davis also mentioned another school for Fort Alexander Indian Reserve. We would be definitely interest in tendering on this project also. May we be advised of your wishes in this matter.\n\nIf these schools contracts are to be awarded to us, we are now in an immediate position to start operations, and can\nassure you of our very close co-operation and attention to the matter. We could easily handle all the sites mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, this summer, and have the schools finished for operation early in the school year, but we would like to get started on the operation as early in July as possible.\n\nI am enclosing Plan 66-1 and 46-1 thinking that you may have some idea of proposing Indian Homes. A re-arrangement of the partitions shown on the plan could be made on the site for the individual requirements. A sketch showing a cross-section of the construction detail of the unit is also attached. This is an economy-type of dwelling using a minimum amount of materials. We would be pleased to include any additional material that is deemed advisable by your Department, such as shiplap, sheathing on the exterior of the wall studs under the siding. The partitions are 7'6\" in height to allow free circulation of the air from the stove. With the basic unit we supply a 4' sink unit with a drain extending through the wall and the necessary amount of paint for each building. Our price on the present plan is $1179.35 for Plan 66-1 and $897.35 for Plan 46-1. These prices are quoted f.o.b. Winnipeg, and other erection extras are supplying the erector his travelling and living expenses. Freight charges could be made directly to your Department by the transportation companies or your own arrangements could be carried out.\n\nThanking you for your kindness and co-operation, and trusting that we may hear from you at your earliest convenience, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED\n\nC.J.C./J\nENCS.\n\nC.J. Connelly\nEngineer\nJuly 13, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Connelly:\n\nYour letter of June 22nd only reached the Department on July 13th. In fact, we made a check to ensure that it had not been delayed in coming to my desk and are assured that it only arrived in Ottawa today.\n\nBy now you will have received information regarding the Peguis schools, and probably will have heard from Mr. Davy concerning the contract. We will probably be advertising for tenders for the other schools mentioned in your letter.\n\nI was very pleased to read the details of the two proposed Indian homes, and would suggest that you write to our new Superintendent of Welfare with similar details. Colonel Jones has been recently appointed to this position, and will, no doubt, be pleased to have the plans available.\n\nI am, of course, interested in plan 66-1 as a possible small teacherage. I expect to write you further about one of these buildings as we have spots in mind where they will be required.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. C.J.

Mr. Davis has previously sent us a memorandum on this subject.\n\nAs you are probably aware, cement is in difficult supply at the present moment and it would facilitate us greatly if we could be advised, if there are other schools likely to be advertised for contracts in the near future. The purpose of this information is to advise the manufacturer of the amount of cement we may require this summer, if we are fortunate to obtain other school contracts.\n\nYou already have our tender to build on contract the Long Plains Indian School, near Portage La Prairie. In discussing the matter of schools with Mr. Davis and other officials in this province of your department, there was some indication that it was likely that day schools for Indians may be built at Rosburn, Fort Alexander and Roseau River. We would be pleased to have information on this matter in order to pass it along to the manufacturer so that he may be alerted to the probable needs of cement for your projects. Each building requires 285 to 300 bags of cement and upwards to 60 yds. of gravel plus reinforcing iron for the foundation walls.\n\nWe will appreciate receiving this information at your earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED\n\nJ.J. Connolly\nEngineer\nJuly 19, 1941\n\nDear Mr. Connelly:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 15th.\n\nWe are aware of the shortage in the supply of cement, but unfortunately due to the election we have had many delays in the passing of the necessary Orders-in-Council.\n\nWe expect the contract for the Long Plain School to be awarded in the near future and will shortly be advertising for Roseau River.\n\nYou can rest assured that we will contact you immediately these matters have been settled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E.

I'm quite very old man & since the treaty commenced I have been the chief and up today we took you to help us for we want the school here.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nClear Water Lake\nApril 1st 1909\n\nAt' Honorable\nDavid Leard\nCommissioner\nIndian Department\nOttawa\n\nI am very glad to write to you\nto tell that this Reserve where I am;\nI am going to say a few things\nabout it as you have asked me to\nchoose where to stay so I had choose\nthis place where I am just now\nand I never want any body to dis-\nturb it for I have seen other Reserves\nmoving so I don't want this Reserve\nto be moved and as you have sent\nthe reading shut I am very glad to\nget them and still I am wishing\nyou to help me by your kindness.\nTo try and keep up this Reserve I say that I had choose the place where I'll be during my old age and after that where my grandchildren should be kept. All the houses here looks so fine and we have a lake where we get fish and the school was opened on March 29th teaching them how read and spell for we haven't got things for the school the teacher is from our own Reserve her father died when she was five years old and was brought to the school at Red Creek and we provide her to pay her wages on the last day of June at three dollars one child and they are ten children going to that school.\n\nThe house is build up with boards 5.00 feet and 5 rolls paper and 5 dollar.\nfor nails and 18 bunches of shingles at one dollar per bunch so I want that house never to be shut up.\n\nSo I'll tell you another thing that is I told the Indians agent to come and give us our treaty money when treaty comes for we don't want to go to another reserve for the money.\n\nThese three men that went over to see you are always doing right and it's them that are working for the school for they have children and their traveling for wanting the school is worth one of them is thirty dollars and the other two is twenty dollars each so that is all so good by\n\nYour friend,\n\nOld Baptist Bone\nMEMO FOR SCHOOL BRANCH.\n\nThe accompanying letter from Baptiste Bone, one of the leading Indians settled at Clear Water Lake, the fishing station of Keesekooowenin's Band of Birtle Agency, asking for the opening of a Day School on said fishing reserve, on reconsidering my reply to Mr. Bone on 23rd February last, as shown on file 126/G of the Indian Commissioner's Office, appears to me now worthy of support, or at least of a fair trial. It is true Mr. Agent Wheatley in his report of 18th February, in reply to my enquiry, said the Department should not open a school at this point. But on 16th March a deputation of the principal Indians of the reserve waited on me at Winnipeg, with a letter from Baptiste Bone, and a paper dated 13th March, signed by the heads of families on the reserve, promising to send their children regularly to school if they were allowed a Teacher. Further, according to Mr. Bone's letter of the 1st April, the Indians there have erected a school house at their own expense, and engaged a teacher.\n\nSuch zeal, I think, should be encouraged, and I therefore now recommend that the usual $75.00 per quarter be paid the Teacher they have employed, beginning on the 1st of April last; and that the grant be continued to the school if the attendance and teacher are satisfactory. If the teacher prove incompetent, no doubt another can be found.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 27, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Laird has transferred a letter received by him from Baptiste Bone, one of the Indians of the Keesekocowin band settled at Clear Water Lake, with reference to the payment of the teacher's salary at the school which has been established at Clear Water Lake.\n\nTo encourage the Indians in their efforts to procure an education for their children, the Department has decided that it will provide a salary of $300.00 per annum from April 1, last, payment to be made upon receipt of the usual returns.\n\nThis grant is conditional on the attendance being sufficient to justify the continuance of the school, and the present teacher's engagement is only to be temporary. Her remaining on will depend upon the results obtained as shown by the reports of yourself and the Inspector.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise Mr. Bone to the above effect.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nM.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 22nd, 1909,\n\nwith reference to the Day school recently opened at the Fishing Station Clear Water Lake, Keesekocowenin's Band I have the honor to inform you that on the 9th Instant this school was inspected; the Inspector Mr. S.J. Jackson, being present. There were 8 pupils present, 4 boys and 4 girls, ages ranged from 5 years to 12. All the pupils present were neatly and comfortably clad and very clean and seemed under control of the teacher Miss Mary Neshotah, an ex-pupil of the Pine Creek Boarding school. She had been 8 years at school and graduated about four years ago. There are 11 on the Roll and the average attendance from the 1st of April last to June 9th was 9.3 a splendid attendance compared to the Oknase Day school. The older girls and boys were able to read the simple Lesson cards fairly well and the younger ones knew their letters perfectly. None of the pupils had attended any school before April 1st last. The teacher deserves credit for the advancement made and no doubt she will do for the present, but it will be necessary if the school is to be carried on permanently, that a more qualified teacher be employed.\n\nThe building used for the school is owned by George McKay, No. 15 same Band who lives at Clear\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nClear Water Lake. It is a one story frame building, sheeted outside with shingled roof 16' X 16' with an annex 12 x 16'. Will need to be sheeted and made warm for the winter. Geo. McKay has promised to do this.\n\nSchool desks are needed also a table for the teacher. I have made Requisition for the above giving the cost at Birtle.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have entered on the 16th of March in your place when you were at Armstrong and the things you gave me was very glad to come home with them in my own hands by your kindness and now I take the pleasure in asking you how to do to keep our school all the time.\n\nOne of the Inspector and Mrs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nWhen the Indian Agent came here to see the school house, he told me to make another house opposite to the school I have made it already and we have already got some things for the school for the children's progress. I am always very glad to see the children going to school, and the school teacher is my step daughter she leaves with us. I have been always supporting my children to go to the school and will continue to do so please write and tell me what to do to keep up our school as good as with any other. Compliments Yours Truly\n\nGeo. McKay\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st of June. The Department is pleased to know that after an inspection by yourself and Inspector Jackson you were able to report so favorably upon the day school at Clear Water Lake. The Department desires to encourage this school, which was established on the initiative of the Indians. The Department will pay for the material necessary to make the building warm for the winter. When your requisition for school desks, etc., is received it will be favorably dealt with. It is hoped that there is a full enrolment of all the Indian children who should attend this School, and that the average will be maintained. Would it be possible to encourage the school in any other way. The Department desires to encourage day schools wherever there is hope of fair success. The provision of a simple mid-day meal has been found to stimulate the interest of the Indian children and their parents. Would you recommend that this feature of management be extended to this school? Has the school a supply of biscuits?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 28th., 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 19th., addressed to the Indian Commissioner. The Department was glad to hear that the School has been so far successful, and it is in the intention to give you every assistance. The Department will continue to pay the salary of the teacher, and Mr. Wheatley, the Indian Agent at Hirtle, has been told that the lumber necessary to make the building warm for the winter will be paid for by the Department. So long as the attendance is good the Department will be able to assist in the maintenance of this day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. George McKay,\nClear Water Lake,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 29th, 1909.\n\nNo. 343039 re Clear Water Lake Day school, I have the honor to inform you, that a requisition for desks, teacher's desk and chair and blackboard has been forwarded to the Department. All the children of school age are enrolled and their parents will see that they attend regularly, as they know if this is not done, the school will be closed.\n\nThe giving of a mid-day meal to the pupils, would be appreciated, but it would entail extra work for the teacher, and I would advise not to give it a trial until the winter months. Biscuits are now issued at the noon hour.\n\nThis school is 25 miles from Elphinstone, and the nearest point to post office and stores. The road to it is very bad, partly through bush, and supplies or mail sent there, have to lie at Elphinstone until called for by Indians from Clear Lake. So far I have not received the Quarterly school return from the teacher. I arranged with the Postmaster to have all mail for the teacher, forwarded by reliable Indians who visit Clear Lake, at the earliest opportunity, also any supplies for that point Mr. Muir has kindly promised to have forwarded.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 25, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Clear Water Lake day school for the month of August.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that a register will be sent to the teacher, as requested.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the house being used for school purposes I beg to say that when the Department was first asked to pay a teacher's salary at this point it was given to understand that the Indians had erected a suitable building, and even the amount of material used was mentioned. It now appears that the building is the property of George McKay and, before the Department will make expenditure on it to any extent, it will require an assurance of the privilege of using the building for school purposes for such a time as will recoup it for the money paid out in improving it, and I have to request that you will be good enough to procure from Mr. McKay a written document agreeing to allow the use of his house for school purposes for such time at least as you consider necessary to reimburse the Department for any outlay it has already made or may require to make to fit up the building.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nWinnipeg, 18th Feb., 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nGeorge McKay and Baptiste Mekis, accompanied by Rev. Father Comeau as interpreter, waited upon me the other day.\n\nThey handed me to read a paper signed by George McKay on the 1st April, 1909, in the presence of the Indian Agent, in which he agreed to give for three years free the use of a building owned by him on the Clear Water Lake Reserve for a day school for the Catholic children of the Reserve, the Department to bear the expense of putting the building in good repair.\n\nThey also handed me to read a letter from you to George McKay, dated the 29th June, 1909, file 343,039, expressing pleasure at the success of the school and promising to assist in its maintenance.\n\nThey complained that notwithstanding that the school was established as a Catholic school, and is so recognized by the Department, George Bone, Chief of the Riding Mountain Reserve, visits the school nearly every Sunday, when the Catholic Indians are gathered for religious devotions, and insists on conducting what they described as a Protestant service consisting of preaching by the said George Bone, bible reading, praying, and the singing of hymns.\n\nThey represented that there are about forty Indians in residence on the Clear Water Lake Reserve, and that all but four old people are Catholics.\n\nThey asked that George Bone be officially prohibited from interfering with the Sunday meetings of the Catholic Indians.\nIndians in their school house for religious devotions.\n\nThey expressed deep interest in the education of the children of the Reserve, and an anxiety that the Catholic school, which was established on their initiative should be maintained as a Catholic school and officially secure from any interference on the part of George Bone.\n\nThey would be grateful if the Department would furnish the school with a bell that could be heard by children residing two miles distant from the school, and thus ensure their prompter attendance.\n\nThey represented that the school was quite short of biscuits, only nine boxes being supplied. They calculate that at least sixteen boxes a year are required. The attendance, they stated, averages between nine and eleven.\n\nI promised to bring their representations to the attention of the Department.\n\nDuring the course of the interview they referred to other matters not appertaining to the school, and these I am bringing to the attention of Mr. Inspector Jackson.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.R.C.I.S.\n\nP.S.\n\nThe delegation handed me a communication from \"Councillor Old Baptiste Bone\" of the Clear Water Reserve. It sets forth, inter alia, \"that we do not want any Presbyterians or any other to come in the school or in our own reserve, for we like our own religion.\"\n\nAs the communication touches upon other matters, I have thought it well to send it to Mr. Inspector Jackson.\n\n[Signature]\nMajor Whitley asked for a copy of this band.\n\nFeb 25\n\n117334\nOttawa, February 25th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the complaints made to you by some of the Indians of the Clear Water Lake Reserve in regard to interference in their religious services by George Bens, a Protestant member of the Band.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this complaint will receive the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. J. McKenna, Esq.,\nInspector of Roman Catholic Indian Schools,\nP. O. Box 1287,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nExtract from letter from Agent Wheatley dated February 28th, 1910, for File 343039/1. Original on File 117334/1.\n\nThe number of families living on the Clear Water Lake Fishing Station is as follows:\n\nNo. 1 Baptiste Bone 3 in family.\nNo. 15 George Bone 5 *\nNo. 63 Baptiste Mecas 7 *\nNo. 72 Gaywis 5 *\nNo. 73 Mrs. Neshotah 3 *\nNo. 76 Andrew McKay 1 *\nOld Gambler 2 *\n\nOld Gambler is a member of the Pine Creek Band, but has permission from the Department to remain with this Band, has been a rover and as he is an old man, no regular transfer was made. The above seven families are all Roman Catholics. The number of school children Clear Water Lake is as follows:\n\nGeorge McKay 2\nBaptiste Mecas 3\nGaywis 2\nMrs. Neshotah 2 All Roman Catholics.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) G. H. Wheatley,\nIndian Agent.\nnot possible for him to secure an audience of Protestant Indians.\n\nThe Department hopes there will be no further cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 28th ultimo in which you state the number of families on the Clear Water Lake Fishing Station Reserve I beg to say that among the number you name George Bone, No. 15, on the Pay List. An examination of the Pay List shows that George McKay is paid under this number, and further on in your communication you state that George McKay has two children of school age. The use of the surname Bone is, therefore, presumably a clerical error.\n\nI may add that the Department's object in getting this information was to ascertain definitely whether all the Indians residing on the Clear Water Lake Reserve are Roman Catholics, and your letter shows that they are.\n\nSometime ago a complaint was received from George McKay and Baptiste Melis that the religious services which the Roman Catholics held in the school-house every Sunday were being disturbed by visits from Chief George Bone, who insisted on holding there a Protestant service.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nIndian Dept.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA complaint has been sent in to you in reference to certain alleged misconduct on my part while attending the Roman Catholic services at Clear Lake, B.C. McKay Baptist Mission claim that I disturbed their meetings which were held in the school house.\n\nThe first occasion upon which I attended their service I was very late, and asked permission to enter, which was granted. Later these very men who have complained asked me to read the Bible in their own tongue which I did. They also invited me to return to read in their language at service the following week. This I did twice more accompanied by Davis Burns & we sang one of our hymns for them. Now if these people have any claim of misconduct against me it is their duty to make known in what way it was so done. As their Chief, representing them I have a right, I think, to know the nature of their grievance.\n\nIt has not been the custom of previous Chiefs to write direct to Ottawa, in fact I am...\nperhaps the first or this seems to do so, but\nthe nature of the case makes it necessary at\nthis time to close. I am very sorry such a thing\nas this should have to be done but now the\ncomplaint has been made it is my duty to\ndefend myself. I must say that what I saw of\nthe school at Clear Lake pleased me very\nmuch as far as education goes & I would be\nsorry to see anything occur that might be de-\ntermined to the interest of the young; yet\nsuch things do occur to these same people as\nthe cause of them. They hold their service\nto the children attend & receive some benefit, at\n3 P.M. they are free again for the day, the re-\nmainder of which is spent in card playing\nwhich last long into the night & the youn-\ngster is not supposed to occur within the\nhouse. This can be proved by many witness-\nes. It is not my wish to be harsh on these\npeople because of their religion, in fact we\nexpect their belief to live with them\nas Christians ought to, but unless their con-\nduct alters it will be necessary to take\nsteps to have them removed before they\nwill influence corrupt all the young who\ncome to know them. Already their influence\nis felt even here & some of the young are being led\nastray by those who so strongly defend their re-\nligion that they make false charges to do so.\nThe character of Geo McKay is such that it\nAt times the Department stepped in to save the Indians from disgrace from such as him. Why is he allowed to live with a woman who is not his wife while his first wife is not properly cared for by him? This is the kind of a man who asked me to attend their services then sent in a false complaint to you. Baptiste Mee also is just as low morally, a girl up there having a child by him while he has a wife at home. Is the Dept going to allow this state of things to continue, to corrupt the morals of our young people? Can I look to you to remove such a blot from our community. Some thing should be done for these two men will do immense harm if they are allowed to continue living this way. This statement give you some idea of the character of the two men who have sent in a complaint to you, & I think they should state clearly the nature of the way that they say I have done.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChief Geo Bone\n\n(Chief Geo Bone)\nOttawa, March 30th, 1910.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the complaints of the Indians of the Clear Water Lake Reserve that you had disturbed their religious services.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as these Indians are all Roman Catholics, the Department considers it unwise for you to take any part, even by invitation by some of the members, in their services on Sunday afternoons. The Department has no doubt that you were actuated by good motives, but is of opinion that any such action by a Protestant Indian is almost sure to lead to trouble.\n\nTrusting, therefore, that there will be no further cause for complaint,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief George Bone,\nElphinstone, Man.\nOttawa, September 13, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report for the month of August on the Clear Water Lake day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn of the satisfactory work being performed by Miss Mary Meshotah, the teacher, and you will be good enough to convey to her its appreciation of her efforts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nG.

Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, No.343039/1 re engaging another teacher for the Clearwater Lake Day school, I beg to state, that owing to the distance, 25 miles, from the nearest P.O. Elphinstone, the reserve is practically isolated, and no teacher could be engaged to teach there, unless under the same conditions, as the previous one. If a suitable ex-pupil could be recommended by the Church authorities, she could board with the Councillor, Baptiste Bone, No.1. If this could not be arranged, I would advise closing it up, and children of school age, could be sent to the Boarding schools, at Pine Creek or Sandy Bay.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to the Clearwater Lake day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the interest that these Indians have shown in the education of their children and the very good attendance at the school during the past year and nine months the Department is prepared to continue a salary of $300.00 per annum, provided a suitable teacher can be had. I would ask you, therefore, to make inquiries with a view to recommending someone for the position. Miss Heshotah did very satisfactory work and it may be that the services of another competent Indian girl can be had. The Department will await the result of your inquiries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nE. S. Thomson\nMan.\nFeb 13th\n11\n\nA. W. Hanna, Esq.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs our school at Clearwater Lake has been closed through the resignation of Miss Neahkotah, Mr. Wheatley thinks it is advisable to keep it closed unless an experienced teacher from some of the schools can be found to take charge. I am writing to you to see if you cannot get the Principal of either Pine Creek or Quappelle to recommend one for the position. Unless one can be obtained Mr. Wheatley thinks it will be impossible to reopen the school. It seems unfair to have it closed now after so much trouble has been gone to to put it in shape, even though it has its debts to supply, it will be cheaper to keep it going. The Indians do not feel prepared to send their children to the Pine Creek School as Mr. Wheatley suggests should be done.\n\nI would very much appreciate\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 553-1, part 1)\nas soon as convenient, I hope you will find it possible to meet the wishes of the people.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChief Joe Bone\nWinnipeg, 23rd Feb., 1914.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to correspondence (343039/5) respecting the day school at Clear Water Lake, I place herewith a letter addressed to me by Chief Bone. I have tried to make it plain to the interested parties that I have no jurisdiction. There is no sense in their communicating direct with me. I should, therefore, be obliged if you would make it plain to the Chief to whom communications in the matter are to be addressed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nI.R.C.I.S.\nOttawa, February 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed to keep the Clearwater Lake school open provided the services of a suitable teacher can be had for $300.00 per annum. The attendance is very small, but Miss Neshotah did exceedingly good work during the time that she was in charge. As you are aware the building has been fitted up, but the total school population on the reserve is only about ten. If on the occasion of your visits to the industrial and boarding schools in the near future you could find a bright Indian girl with sufficient attainments to enable her to conduct this school intelligently the Department would be pleased to hear from you and would keep the school in operation for at least sometime longer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. J. McKenna, Esq.,\nInspector of Roman Catholic Indian Schools,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you, that I have received a letter from the Rev. Jos. Chamsunt, Winnipagosis, Man., advising me that he had a teacher for the Clearwater Lake Day school, and that he would be in Elphinstone, Man., on the 23rd. instant with her, and I have written the Rev. Father informing him, that I would be in Elphinstone on that date, and make the necessary arrangements, for her to open the school. He also informed me that she had a sister who was teaching in the Waterhen school.\n\nWill report after the 23rd. if the teacher will suit.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. F/14\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nNovember 9th, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of August 8th, last No. F/14, re teacher for the Clearwater Lake Day school, which has been closed since December 1910. I beg to report for your information, that the teacher referred to in my letter, and who was recommended by Rev. Jos. Chaumont, of Winnipegososis, Man., did not come as expected.\n\nI now wish to state, in reference to this school, that Baptiste Mecas, No. 63, Clearwater Lake, Keesekooowenin's Band, is now residing on the Waywayseecappo's reserve, and refuses to return to Clearwater Lake, wishing to be transferred to that reserve. As he had three children attending the school, and as Marie Tanner, No. 50 Waywayseecappo's Band another pupil, is now attending the Birtle Boarding school, it would only leave three children, of school age on the reserve to attend, as follows:\n\n1 Daughter of Geo. McKay, No. 15 age 14\n2 Sons of Mrs. Neshotah, No. 73, ages 15, 11.\n\nTotal 3 children.\n\nUnder the circumstances I wrote to the Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding school, also Rev. Jos. Chaumont Winnipegososis, Man., and informed them how matters stood, as to the number that could attend, if the services of a teacher could be obtained, and the school reopened. I also advised, that the three children remaining on the reserve, could easily go to Pine Creek Boarding school.\n\nPine Creek\nPine Creek Boarding school, if their parents wished them to be educated; if the Department closed the school. The Rev. Father Chaumont, Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding school, replied to my letter, and agreed with me, that it would be best to close the school, and have Geo. McKay send his children to the Boarding school, Pine Creek, as in any event, if the school was opened, there would be always great difficulty, in securing the services of a competent teacher owing to the isolation of the reserve, it being 25 miles from Elphinstone, Man. and the roads being very rough, and for a greater part of the way, it cannot be travelled faster than a walk.\n\nI have had a telegram from the Rev. Father Jos. Chaumont, Winnpegosis, Man., advising me, that he had a teacher, a half-breed named Bapt. Chartrand, that would teach the school this winter. I replied that it would not be advisable to open the school, for three pupils, unless I was authorized by the Department to do so. I will be glad therefore to know if under these conditions, the school will be reopened, and the services of Bapt. Chartrand engaged as teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you report that there are now only three children of school age to attend the school on the Clearwater Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this number would not justify the Department in engaging the services of a teacher and the school may remain closed. You will be good enough to see that these children are sent to one of available residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nIndian Department,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been requested to communicate with you in reference to the establishment and maintenance of a school for the benefit of the Indians residing north of here at the west side of Clear Lake, numbering approximately 30 at the present time.\n\nIt would appear that these Indians particularly anxious to become educated and enlightened have sent delegations on several occasions to Rev Geo. A. Sather of Clanwilliam, Man pastor of the Lutheran Church who has taken considerable interest in them and who will undertake to see that a missionary is provided to work with them. He feels he is in a position to do this better than anyone else on account of being located here.\n\nThe cost of providing an instructor under Rev. Sather's supervision will be comparatively small, and I feel reasonably certain that you will give some financial assistance in a matter of this kind which is quite important.\n\nRev Sather in outlining his plans asks but one thing and that is that the mission when established be recognized as Lutheran which I believe you will agree with me is not too large a reward for the interest he is showing.\n\nThanking you for an early and favorable reply,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nM.S. Lee\n\nIndian Affairs.

This matter is being taken up with Mr. Agent Wheatley, Birtle, with a view to having these children placed in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMartin S. Lee, Esq.,\nNotary Public,\nErickson, Man.\nOttawa, April 4, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Martin S. Lee, Notary Public, Erickson, Man., in which he requests that a day school be established for the benefit of the Indians residing on the west side of Clear Lake and, that, if such a school be opened, it be conducted under the auspices of the Lutheran Church.\n\nIt is considered that there are not sufficient children at this point to warrant the Department in making the expenditure required for the purpose. It might be possible to make arrangements to have the children of school age placed in a residential school of the denomination to which they belong. I shall be pleased if you will make inquiries in this matter and state the number of children of school age, the religion to which they belong and if arrangements could be made to have them placed in a residential school. You should furnish a full report regarding this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. H. Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nI am writing you again on the subject of establishing a school for the benefit of the Indians at the west end of Clear Lake.\n\nThinking you may have misinterpreted my last letter, I wish to state that Rev. Sather is willing and prepared to furnish a teacher for some weeks in the summer, at least, and will undertake to raise the money himself if your Department would not be unwilling to assist. As stated before, all he asks is that the school be recognized as Lutheran. He does not feel that it would be fair that another denomination should be allowed to take over the work which he would start and continue.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. S. Lee\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th Instant No. 106-7-1 regarding the communication of Martin S. Lee, Notary Public, Erickson, Man., requesting that a Day School be established at Clear Water Lake Reserve, No. 61A, for the benefit of the Indian Children located at this reserve, I beg to report as follows:\n\nAt Clear Water Lake reserve, there was only one family located there, Councillor Baptiste Bone, No. Keeneekowenin's Band, No.61, permanently, until last summer, when Chief Geo. Bone, No.5 decided to give up farming, and moved to Clear Water Lake. His son John Lauder Bone, spent the winter there, and so far he has not reported, that he intends to reside there permanently. Gaywiz, No.75, Rolling River Band, No.67, is a permanent fixture, as he has refused to reside on the Rolling River reserve.\n\nThe chief reason for the above families living at Clear Water Lake, is for the hunting and fishing; and another reason is, to escape sending their children to Boarding or Industrial schools. I have repeatedly urged the Chief and his son to send their children to the Birtle Boarding School, as they are strong Presbyterians, but always put me off, that he was going to have a Day school on the reserve, and would let me know, if he had made up his mind to send his grandson to school, his son of course.\n\nTo\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncourse agreed with his father. I had explained the reasons to him, for the closing up of the Okanase Day School, on the Keeseekoowenin's reserve, No.61, and I was quite sure, that no Day School would be opened at Clear Water Lake reserve, but if any Public school opened near the reserve, the Department would have no objection to their children attending the school, if the school Trustees made an objection.\n\nThe following is the census of the families located there:\n\n| Name          | Men | Women | Boys | Girls |\n|---------------|-----|-------|------|-------|\n| No.5, Chief Geo. Bone | 1   | 1     | 1    | Gradson |\n| Age 11 years. |     |       |      |       |\n| \"66 John Lauder Bone | 1   | 1     | 3    | 2     |\n| Boys ages. 16.12.4.

Ages? 30. 11. | | | | |\n\nYou will note that there are only 4 of school age, three Presbyterians and one Roman Catholic. Gaywis is the Roman Catholic family. The Bones Children should go to the Birtle Boarding or Portage la Prairie Schools.\n\nI regret to say, that Chief Bone's usefulness as Chief of the Band is past, as he has returned to the old hunting life, and is not favourable to the Boarding schools, and the fact of his living at Clear Water Lake reserve, he is not in touch with the majority of the Band.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is considered that these children should be placed in residential schools of the denomination to which they belong, and I have to request that you will take the necessary steps to have them sent there. It is hoped that the parents will consent to their desiring so, and if not, you may, under the Indian Act, as amended at the last session of Parliament, take the required proceedings to have these children placed in residential schools.\n\nYou may inform the Indians that it is not the intention of the Department to establish a day school on this reserve and their children should receive an education in residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

However, before giving departmental sanction to any activities at this point, the Department wishes to communicate with Mr. Agent Wheatley of Birtle, Man., concerning efforts that have been made in the past to hold religious services among the Clearwater Lake band. In the interim, I will be pleased to learn more definitely concerning your plans for a parochial school.

Three in the family, man, woman and grandson, who is a pupil in the Birtle Bdg. school.\n\nJohn Lauder Bone, No.66, son of the Chief, has 8 in family, man, woman, 3 boys and 3 girls, one boy and one girl pupils Birtle Bdg. school.\n\nDavid Burns, No.27, has 6 in family, one boy and two girls, pupils Birtle Bdg. school.\n\nDavid Grant Burns, No.86, one man, son of David Burns.\n\nThis makes a total of 18. 6 pupils of the Birtle Bdg. school leaves 12 on the Clearwater Lake reserve, who are all strong adherents of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nBaptiste Bone, No.1, 3 in family, Roman Catholics. This makes a total of 15 on the reserve.\n\nRegarding the religious activities I wish to state, that occasionally the Presbyterian Missionary, Rev. F.B. Wilson, visits the reserve at Clearwater Lake, but no regular services are held. Since the last 20 years, no regular religious services have been held.\n\nThe Asst.

He is a son-in-law of the Councillor Baptiste Bone, and as the old Councillor is blind now, he assists his father-in-law and provides food and other necessaries for him. They are Roman Catholics.\n\nThe old Councillor is also assisted by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 21, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 15th instant, referring to the religious activities of the Indians resident on the Clearwater Lake reserve. I have noted that there are eighteen adherents of the Presbyterian church and three of the Roman Catholic faith who make this reserve their home, and that six of the Presbyterian children are in residence at the Birtle Boarding School.\n\nYou have raised no objection to the Lutherans of Erickson, Man., holding religious services on the reserve. I might say that I have asked Mr. Theodore Lee to intimate to the Department the nature of his plans, and upon receipt of this information, the Department will direct another communication to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for acknowledged receipt your favor of the 7th inst., regarding my request for parochial school on Clearwater Lake Reserve.\n\nI might say that a similar request was made a year ago. The matter was referred to the Commissioner at Regina who in turn communicated with Indian Agent Wheatley at Berilo. Correspondence shows that he did not view this favorably and the reason for this I believe is that he considered the school asked for, through some misunderstanding, would conflict with the Berilo Indian School. This is not the intention at all. We wish it thoroughly understood that we have no desire to interfere with your Government School or any other Christian Organization. These Indians reside on the Reserve the whole year and religious services of any kind...\nare known to be held except the few times our Pastor visited them last year.\n\nRegarding our plans for the parochial school, I would request that one month in the summer, during school holidays, be the time to hold this. In this way there would be no interference with any of your work. As outlined in my former letter, the Indians have earnestly requested this, and we are prepared to bear all expense in connection therewith.\n\nIf I have failed to furnish all the information desired, I will be very pleased to answer any further questions you may wish to ask on the subject.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTheodore Lee\nOttawa, February 27, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 18th instant, concerning your request for a parochial school on the Clearwater Lake reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that, while your letter has explained somewhat to the Department the nature of your request, yet, you have not answered the important question in my letter of the 7th instant.\n\nYou will remember that I wished to learn more definitely concerning your plans and I repeat that the Department will be grateful for detailed information as to the nature of the activity known to you as a parochial school.\n\nI have noted that your wish was to hold the school during the school holidays and that it would not interfere with the Birtle Boarding School attendance. I believe there will be no hesitation on the part of the Department in authorizing you to proceed with this activity; but, before giving definite permission, we want your assurance as to the language and exact nature of the instruction, the place of meeting, hours of the session, and duration, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nTheodore Lee, Esq.,\nErickson,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of February 27th asking for more detailed information before giving definite permission to hold a school on Clearwater Lake D.R., as to language, the only language used will be English. A vacant house on the Reserve can be arranged for as a place of meeting.\n\nAs to hours of session and instruction I will here give what I know is usual for such a school, but if not in accordance with the Department could be changed some:\n\nOpening of School, Nine O'clock\nSinging of Hymns 10 minutes\nScripture reading and explanation 15 minutes\nRecess 15 minutes, Teaching them to spell and write their names, and the names of the Books of the Bible 30 minutes\nStudy of the Commandments 45 minutes\nMoon 1 hr 30 minutes\nSinging 15 min reciting each a scripture\nverse and teaching them short\nmorning and opening prayers 1 hr\nRecess 15 minutes\nSpeaking to them on cleanliness\nand how to be healthy,\n30 minutes for Bible stories and\nclosing 15 min saying the Lord's Prayer\nin unison. Closes at 4 o'clock\nas stated before if you think\nit better some sight studies as\na little arithmetic more writing\nand etc., could easily be fitted in.\nAnd that one month about\nJuly would be best time to hold same.\nRemain Yours Etc.\n\nTheodore Lee\nOttawa, April 4, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 25th ultimo, referring to your request for a parochial school on the Clearwater Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this Department sanctions the activities that you have outlined in your communication. You will please communicate with Mr. G. H. Wheatley, Indian Agent at Birtle, Man., and inform him of the date of your opening. He is being instructed that permission has been granted for a parochial school, but that it is not to interfere with any of the Department institutions for Indian children.\n\nAfter the session has been held this summer, you will be good enough to forward a report on the activities to Mr. Agent Wheatley, who will send the same to this Department. In the future, all communications in this connection should be addressed to Mr. Wheatley for his comments, before being forwarded here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nTheodore Lee, Esq.,\nErickson,\nMan.\nOttawa, April 4, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer again to the request of the Lutherans of Erickson, Man., for a parochial school on the Clearwater Lake reserve this coming summer. The Department has given its sanction to this activity, and any further communications in this connection will be addressed to you. Enclosed you will find copy of my last letter to Mr. Theodore Lee, of Erickson, Man.\n\nYou will note that English is the language to be used in connection with this parochial school and that no interference with the regular departmental educational institutions will be tolerated. The Department understands that the activities are in the nature of Scripture reading, hymns, addresses on cleanliness, etc. Mr. Lee suggests the month of July for the school, and is willing to give some instruction in elementary academic studies, as well as in religious teaching.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Wheatley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nErickson, Man.\n\nAug 7th 1922\n\nRe: Clear Lake & Bear Creek\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the Indians of the above mentioned Reserve have built a school house 18' x 24' ft and have had our month of parochial school now and we see that the children have done so well that we would like to make this public school and keep open all year round therefore we ask the Department to help us. The reason why we don't want to send our children to the Birth Boarding School, that there is only 2 children of this Reserve that has agreed to send their children there. Children sent to the Birth Boarding some of them for 3 or 10 years and cannot yet write their names, that they attend only one day a week, the other time loafing supposed to be on the farm, but the former Instructor himself is loafing and not...\ntending to the work instructing the boys\nand I that there is a lot of sickness at the\nschool such as tuberculosis, consumption etc.\nand that our children here are all well and\nwe don't want them to mix with those with\nthe sick ones. According to the Act\nI think we are entitled to a school here\non the Reserve as promised us. If we can\nkeep this school open we will have about\n20 children in attendance some of these\nnever attended any school before.\nThe Indians here on this Reserve do not\ntravel around like some of the others\ntherefore we think the school attendance\nwould be good and regular. We have\n10 acres in crop this year and will be\nadding more every year. One thing I\nwould like mention is the unsanitary\ncondition at the Births Boarding place the\nwater used is taken out of the river below\nwhere the drainage from closets etc. comes\nfrom the school.\n\nYours very truly\n\nChief Geo. Bone\nOTTAWA, August 16th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, in which you request that the parochial school which is being conducted on the Clearwater Lake Reserve during the present summer be continued in operation throughout the entire school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are making enquiry regarding this request and will inform you at a later date as to our decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Geo.

Any information you can give that will enable the Department to come to a decision regarding the continuing of this school will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Wheatley\nIndian Agent Birtle Man\nDear sir,\n\nThis is to report that the parochial school on the Clearwater Lake Indian Reserve is now held. English was the only language used. Bible stories from the Old and New Testament they were taught all the books of Chotse, Commandments, Morning and Evening prayers, singing, etc. A little writing, spelling, reading, and figuring was part in no make it interesting for them and the children come considerably well for the time the school has been open, on account of bad weather and bad roads the school could be opened till the 13th July and was then opened for a month.\n\nServices are being held on Sunday Aug 26th also closing exercises with the children same day. I think I have given you all information if not will gladly give you any asked for.\n\nYours Truly,\nTheodore Lee\nSir,\u2014 I beg to enclose, herewith, Mr. Theodore Lee report on the parochial school, which opened July, 12th last, on the Clearwater Lake Fishing Station, No.61A.\n\nThe delay in forwarding is on account of Mr. Lee, not sending the list of names and the number attending the school. Will forward list when received.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo The Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, August 29th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a report on the work that was carried on in the parochial school conducted by Mr. Theodore Lee on the Clearwater Lake Indian Reserve from the 12th of July, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has noted the course of studies taught by Mr. Lee during the period this school was open.\n\nIt is noted that you will forward a list of the names of the pupils who attended, and the daily attendance.\n\nI may say that it is not the intention of the Department to authorize the continuing of this school, as all the children of school age on this Reserve could be placed in residential schools.\n\nWe are informing Chief George Bone accordingly. A copy of our letter to him is enclosed herewith.\n\nWe are taking up with the authorities of the Presbyterian church the need of more dormitory accommodation, the providing of a residence for the Principal and the necessity of a system of filtration for the water supply at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOTTAWA, August 29th, 1922.\n\nSir -\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the continuing of the parochial school which was in operation on the Clearwater Lake Reserve this summer, I beg to say that it is not the intention of the Department to continue this school during the coming year. A number of the children who attended while the school was in operation were pupils of the Birtle Boarding School who were on their summer vacation. These children will all be returned to that school. All children of school age on the Clearwater Reserve can very well attend a residential school conducted under the auspices of the religious denomination to which they belong.\n\nWith reference to your remarks regarding conditions at the Birtle Boarding School, I beg to say that no reliance is placed in your complaint that the pupils, after eight years' tuition, are unable to write their names.\n\nRegarding the farm instructor, it is considered that any information which you have as to the work he is performing was obtained from the pupils. He is a faithful worker, and doing his best to give the boys a good training along the lines of farming and the caring of stock.\n\nWe understand that you do not reside on the Clearwater Lake Reserve, but live at the Fishing Station, and that you have neglected your work as Chief and do not attend important meetings of the Band. We also understand that you hold land on both Reserves and that last year you neglected to summer fallow your land, and some of the other Indians had to cut down the woods, and, as a consequence, the Agent gave permission to Gilbert Bone to have the land which you had neglected put in crop.\n\nIt is expected that, as Chief, you will show a better example to the other Indians and perform the duties of your office satisfactorily. You should also encourage the Indian parents to send their children to residential schools, where they will receive a good education, as there is no likelihood of the day school on the Clearwater Lake Reserve being reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

And I personally believe that if the government would send a man instructor to instruct them, live with them, and work with on their own reserve all the proceeds of their work they own they some months in the summer that a lot more could be accomplished with the Indians in a short time. Would like to hear from you further in regard to this. I can assure that the very best\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have received a recent communication with your Agent at Birtle with reference to getting a permit to hold Parochial school on the Clear Water Indian Reserve 61A wherein he states that the Department will not grant this on account of the trouble last summer. In regard to this I would like to\nsay that I know all that was going on there last summer at least while the school was in operation. The Indians were so contented and pleased with the progress their children made in the short time the school was open, that they begged to have us continue for they said they would even pay themselves as long as they were able, but the answer we gave them was that without the permission from the Department it was impossible and the school was closed. I think that was all the trouble referred to in Mr. Wheatley letter. They wanted it continued for they have had Public school this a number of years ago. The Indians claim that their children are forcibly taken away by the police to the boarding school and in this way separated very often for long periods they are human and naturally fond of each other and this accounts for their desire to have the school near by.

The attendance and discipline at the Birtle Boarding School suffered as a result of your activities a year ago; and, while it is true that those in charge of the parochial school may not have been responsible, yet some of the children of the Clear Water Lake Reserve returned unwillingly to Birtle, causing the Department considerable trouble and some expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dorey, Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada. He visited this office on May 3 and discussed the situation at Long Plain. He is quite willing to have the Department rent the mission building as a temporary day school. He has further requested that you consult the missionary concerned and come to an agreement as to the rent per month which would be suitable for such classroom accommodation.\n\nWhen we get this information, the necessary arrangements can be made to ship desks, blackboards and other school supplies as needed to this location. We can also consider the employment of a teacher for 1947-48.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCopy sent to Dr. Dorey\nAttention of Colonel B.F.

I am asking Dr. Best to confer with Mr. Indian Agent Waite and to determine what rental they would set on the house.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\n\nMAY 9 1947\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nIn reply to the above noted letter, I wish to advise that I interviewed the Missionary on the Long Plain Reserve on the 19th instant, relative to renting the Mission House for a Day School. On the 20th, a telephone call was received from Mr. Best, D.D., Winnipeg, saying that he was proceeding to Long Plain Reserve on the 22nd, and made an appointment to call at the Agency Office on his return with the intention of discussing the matter.\n\nDoctor Best intimated that the rental should be $35.00 per month, but claimed he had no idea what the rental charge should be, and I proposed $20.00 per month. He claimed that he would have to write Doctor Dory concerning the matter and would suggest a rental somewhere between the two figures. The matter will have to lay over until such time as the matter is referred to Doctor Dory.\n\nSome work will have to be done on the building. I beg to suggest that the ceiling be insulated with two ply of heavy building paper and shavings. A four inch partition should be erected between the mission and the house portion, to deaden noise from the school. A larger heater will have to be purchased, and two toilets erected for the children. If it is possible, would suggest that the walls of the building be also insulated.\n\nDoctor Best suggested a two year term and then the matter to be reviewed again.\nFurther particulars will be forwarded the Department as soon as the rent question is satisfactorily settled.\n\nI hesitate to estimate on the cost of the work on the building. Carpenters are not available in the district, although I believe there are Indians on the reserve who are quite capable of effecting repairs of the nature outlined.\n\nJ.

We would like to suggest that a rental of $20. a month would be satisfactory for this building. We would be prepared to insulate the ceiling and to erect a partition between the Mission and the house portion.

At that time the arrangement was that she would live at the Mission on the reserve and adjoining the school. Since school was first opened, she has lived at the Farm Instructor's residence on the reserve. First, because the room at the mission was not ready for her; later because the missionary's wife was pregnant and would in the near future have to go to hospital. It now appears that the teacher's room is not likely to be made available this year and the teacher claims she is somewhat afraid of the missionary.\n\nThe object in writing is to be advised if the $12.00 allowed monthly would be payable to the Farm Instructor. The house is Government property and I hesitate forwarding vouchers in favour of the Farm Instructor until advised by the Department.\n\nJ.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, June 15th, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian education has referred to us a requisition from Miss Victoria Gerega, the teacher of Long Plain Indian Day School, Edwin, Manitoba, for 168 pounds of cod liver oil, 3000 vitamin pills and two boxes of tongue depressors. Before any action is taken on this order, would you please advise how many pupils are to be served. The quantity, approximately 17 gallons of cod liver oil substitute, seems considerable especially at this time of year when the use of it usually diminishes during the summer period. Does this school not close about the end of June and, if so, could not the oil be sent when it re-opens. Any other information that will enable us to deal intelligently with this request will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. L. Falconer, M.D.\nAssistant Director,\nIndian Health Services.\n\nG. H.

The Hutterite Lease Proposal\n\nDecided to go ahead and take the surrender from the Band as soon as possible, covering approximately (960 acres & 640 & 500) - 1300 acres. Then negotiate release with Hutterites.\n\n2. Re Forsley lease - application to buy -\n(a) Decided not to sell at all\n(b) Decided to let the leases (Forsley-Sylvester) run out and then return the balance of the surrendered land to the Long Plain Res. #6.\n\n3. Re Section 8 - Long Plain Sioux\n\nDecided to lease a half section either the North or East halves under 95-3 of the Act and compensate any Indian occupant at the rate of $1.00 per acre per year for any cultivated land out of the existing Band funds until rents begin to come in and thereafter out of rents. No surrender considered necessary.\n\n4. Band Farm\n\nDecided to try to develop either Section 17 or 20 as a Band Farm. Equipment - power and machinery to be purchased out of Band funds. To be repaid out of profits over a term of years (say 5).\n\n5. Day School\n\nTo be located on the South-west corner of the south-east quarter of Section 20 - 2 acres. The Band will have to be asked to surrender 2 acres for administrative purposes.\n\nAdvantages of suggested location -\n(a) Most central point in relation to population\n(b) One mile from Reserve No. 6\n(c) Three miles from Martin P.O. and village\n(d) One mile from church (present school)\n(e) Within easy reach of Long Plain Sioux children\n\nD.

If so, it is customary to arrange for the individual Indian in question to agree to sell his improvements on the desired area to his Band at whatever price is agreed on, the monies for the purchase being provided by the Department.\n\nD.

The land in this area is fairly flat and I would request that Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau have one of the engineers take the levels and locate the most desirable site.

I presume that we will receive the information report in the near future.\n\nAuthority is given to hire a well-digger, and to expend an amount not to exceed $400. for the location of water at the proposed school site.\n\nIf an amount in excess of this is required, it will be necessary to wire here for approval from the Minister's office indicating at the same time the name and address of the well-digger, rates, etc., and possible expenditure.\n\nHowever, if the well is only to be fifteen to twenty feet deep, you should be able to have it done within the amount of $400. As soon as this information is received from you with regard to the water, we will take further action concerning the building of this school.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nReference is made to Superintendent A. G. Hamilton's letter of April 25th re the location of the new school at Long Plain Reserve.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Hamilton reports the Indians have approved a two acre location in the S. E. corner of the S. E. \u00bc of Section 20, and while this description is not quite satisfactory for our records, nevertheless it does identify the approximate position of the school site. We are writing to Mr. Hamilton to ask for the exact measurements of the parcel, but for your purposes you may proceed on the assumption that the site will be in the S. E. corner of the said \u00bc Section.\n\nIt is regretted that we overlooked dealing with this matter before this date, for Mr. Hamilton's letter mentions the question of drilling for water, and requests that the services of the Dominion Water Power Bureau be made available for the location of the most desirable well site. Presumably this feature of his letter is a matter for your service.\n\nWe will be pleased to advise you further as to the measurements of the school property when we have secured a sketch from Superintendent Hamilton.\n\nD.

Please let us know if this can be arranged and at what price.\n\nWith reference to your second letter of the 8th instant, we approve the erection of a coal shed. It should not be necessary to erect an elaborate one. A shed approximately 15 ft. sq. should be sufficient, and it is presumed that the cost of erecting it will be under $75.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nWINNIPEG, NOVEMBER 23/49\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nPURCHASE ORDER 49590 DATED OCT. 23RD HAS BEEN\nRECEIVED AT PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE COVERING HEATING\nEQUIPMENT FROM ENTERPRISE FOUNDRY CO., SACKVILLE,\nN.B.

Simms,\nSchool Inspector,\n225 Dufferin Avenue,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Simms:\n\nI have read your memorandum on the new Long Plain School and can certainly appreciate your feelings.\n\nLast year and the year before, we built schools with full basements and furnaces and with provision, where hydro was available, for flush toilets. You have probably seen one such school at Oak River.\n\nOur building costs kept mounting to such an extent that we were forced to curtail our building program, so we had our architects plan a much cheaper building which could be built easily and which could at a later date have a small unit added on to provide for forced hot air heating and for flush toilets.\n\nIn other words, we were thinking exactly on lines such as yours and have built accordingly. At the time the Long Plain school was planned, hydro was not available and Mr. Hamilton reported that he expected it possibly this year to within one mile of the proposed school site. I have heard nothing further from him concerning the hydro and your memorandum was the first intimation that it had arrived on the reserve.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that we are now having designed the new one-room school with a sub-basement, and with indoor plumbing.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. 30 | To Rent of room for teacher at the Long Plain Indian Day School for the month of November. | $12.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I beg to ask if your Department will co-operate with us in the operation of a school at this point on a basis of one to two. We will be responsible for two-thirds of the children and therefore should bear two-thirds of the cost.\n\nI believe His Grace Archbishop Matheson had some discussion with you concerning this settlement recently.

The Archbishop was requested to state what arrangements could be made with the Advisory Board for the carrying out of this proposition.\n\nMr. Agent Ogletree, who reported in July, 1916, that the Crane River Indians asked to be supplied with a teacher, stated that there were eleven Indian children who would attend the school. This is the number mentioned in the letter of the 29th ultimo from Mr. Fletcher, the Deputy Minister of Education for the Province of Manitoba, in which he asks if the Department will co-operate in the operation of a school at this point on a basis of one to two. His Department would be responsible for two-thirds of\nof the children and would bear two-thirds of the cost.\n\nIf the Department were assured of an average attendance of six or seven Indian children, I think this would be a very favourable arrangement, as its share of the cost should be under $400.00 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is by no means a satisfactory attendance, and I should be pleased if you would state what action, if any, you have taken to improve the same. As you are no doubt aware, the Department contributes a considerable amount towards the maintenance of this school, and it is considered that every effort should be made to have the children attend regularly.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you in this matter, at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

After the water gets away no doubt the children will attend better.\n\nI informed the Indians that if the attendance does not improve, I would recommend the school to be closed, but the Indians promised me that they would see that the children could attend when conditions improved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

The writer was under the impression that this also applied to Crane River school district but can find nothing on file to confirm same.\n\nWill you kindly advise us at your earliest convenience if this Province is still entitled to receive one-third of the amount expended towards the operation of Crane River school, as in former years.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Owing to the small attendance of the Indian children, this department has discontinued the payment of its share of the expenses. As no other arrangement has been made for the education of the Indian children at this point, it is considered that it would be in their best interests to have them placed in the Elkhorn Residential School. I have, therefore, to request that you will endeavour to recruit any of these children who are of school age and in good health as it is possible for you to do, and arrange to have them placed in the Elkhorn School. Applications and certificates of health forms should be forwarded for all children who may be placed in the Elkhorn School. The question of recruiting these children should receive your early attention, and an effort made to have a number of them sent to the above school at an early date.

I request the Department to erect a School building on this Reserve and have the children brought back. I have been requested by the Band to write to you and if you do not take steps at once, I will have to either go or write to Ottawa Office about the matter. The Indians were promised a school on the Reserve at the time of the transfer - your letter was produced to me by the Indian Agent for signature asking the Band to let the children be taken from this school to Elkhorn School, which I refused to sign - the arrangement that the queen had made with the Indians should be still observed.

This is the letter I showed the Indians of the Crane River Band.\n\nI have been at Crane River several times when I found no Indian children attending school. I warned these Indian several times that if they did not send their children to school, I would ask the Department to close the school.\n\nOn receipt of Department letter, copy enclosed, I wrote the Councillor at Crane River, that I would be out to take the children to Elkhorn, after he received this letter all the children attended school, and when I got out there in December all the children were in school, as the Teacher told me he had no notice to close the School, I immediately ordered the school closed and took out 20 children and put 12 in Elkhorn and sent 8 to Qu'Appelle Residential Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) A.

This latter Mr. Ogletree sent me a copy of, and it is dated October 25th, 1924, and the number of it is 126-2-1.\n\nI do not know that it was the intention of the Department to deal with the matter as Mr. Ogletree has done.

This activity was a combined white and Indian school and we paid one-third of the current costs. The attendance of the Indian children fell off so badly, that we discontinued the arrangement and withdrew our support from the school.

Such as Army Clothing.\n\nLet me know at once if we can have the school at Crane River.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nRobert James More.\nOttawa, October 24, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you request that the Crane River Indian Day School be re-opened. In reply I have to inform you that the poor attendance of Indian children in the past was the sole reason that the Department closed the school and it is not our intention to re-open it at the present time. Those children that were recruited for the Qu'Appelle and Elkhorn Indian Residential Schools are receiving a far better training and care than would be the case if they were attending the day school on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRobert James More, Esq.,\nCrane River P. O.,\nMan.\nThere is no school on the Crane River reserve. We operated a Day School there for years, and it was closed up three years ago. I believe there are about 20 children of school age on the reserve. Some of the children, as you will remember, were sent to Elkhorn three years ago, and when they went home did not return to the school. I was there two years ago, in company with Mr. Eley, and it was our intention to take them back to the school, but my impression at that time was that they were not physically fit to go to Elkhorn. It must be taken into consideration that the principal food of these people is fish. I am not a medical man, but I am under the impression that getting away from the lake and being fed entirely different food does not agree with them. A few children from there are attending the Pine Creek School.\n\nM. Christian\n\nIndian Affairs.

I can find no such sub-head in the estimates submitted to Parliament and passed by Parliament. The Vote in question, according to the estimates submitted to Parliament, and according to the supply bill, is only for \"Agricultural Implements.\" If this Vote is intended to cover payments of the nature of the one in question, it will be necessary to alter the wording of your estimates.

The teacher has secured the loan of a house from an Indian who may return at any time, and if he should return and ask for his house we will have no place for the school.\n\nI have just had an independent report on the whole situation and believe that a proper school building should be provided without delay in the interests of the work there.

Mr. Ogletree replied that the building where the school is now held is large enough for the number of children attending, and the Indians have consented to do with this building; and that he did not consider a new building necessary at present.\n\nThe teacher, in his report for the year ended the 31st of December, last, states as follows:- \"I have been teaching on the Reserve here; in a temporary school building since Feb. 17, 1918, and find myself hampered for want of room. We have made application for the building of a new school, but so far in vain. So it is absolutely that we have a new building in the near future, for the present accommodation will not be good enough in two or three years time\".\n\nSince the school was opened in February, 1918, they have had an average attendance of Indian children of seven and about the same number of whites. The present teacher\nteacher, judging by his report, is efficient, and the Department's share of maintaining the school for ten months came to $302.00, and $350.00 should cover the yearly cost. This is a satisfactory arrangement as far as the Department is concerned and, if funds could be spared, I would suggest that Mr. Ogletree be asked to give an estimate of what it would cost to supply the necessary lumber, etc., to put up a building. Sometime ago he stated that it would take about $250.00 to finish the building, the Indians supplying the logs and doing the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the building used as a combined white and Indian day school.\n\nUnder the arrangement with your Department for the education of the white and Indian children residing in that locality, your Department pays two-thirds of the cost and this Department one-third. This Department's share of the cost of salary and maintenance has been paid upon receipt of vouchers each quarter. It is considered that the rent of the building should be paid by your Department and this Department will pay its proportion of the cost upon receipt of the usual accounts.\n\nR.

I would be much obliged to you if you would kindly push this matter ahead as I am afraid, unless something is done soon, we may have no building in which to hold school.\"\n\nI am also in receipt of a letter from Mr. Archie Ogletree, under date November 5th, from which I quote the following paragraph: \"I might say that this building will not be available any longer if this account is not paid at once, and therefore the school will be closed.\"\n\nThe owner of the building is Mr. R. Kakewash and his account amounts to $115.00. This is computed at the rate of $5.00 per month for each month that the building has been used as a school, beginning with April 1st, 1918, and terminating on June 30th, 1920. I am of the opinion that he is entitled to the amount of the rental which he is asking, and I believe that your Department should be responsible for providing the building in this case. At Moose Lake where we also co-operate in a school, our Department provided the building.\n\nTrusting that you may be able to arrange this satisfactorily, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister\nOttawa, November 24, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to official letter of the 13th instant regarding the payment of the rent of the house owned by R. Kakewash and used for school purposes on the Crane River Reserve I beg to say that it has been decided by this Department to pay the account for the rent of this building and the Department of Education for the Province of Manitoba is being informed accordingly.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, for the rent due R. Kakewash from April 1st, 1918, to date at the rate of $5.00 per month. Upon receipt of this voucher the amount of rent due will be paid. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Kakewash of the Department's decision to assume responsibility for the payment of the rent and you should forward vouchers from time to time covering the amount due at the above rate. It is hoped that he will consent to the further use of the building for school purposes. Kindly give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

It is hoped that, in view of the payment of the rent being assured the owner, he will consent to the further use of the building for school purposes.\n\nIt is hoped that your Department will still continue to pay the other expenses involved in conducting this school and render an account at the end of each quarter for the share of the expenses due by this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The school was very tidy and well managed, and the children seemed to be making very good progress.\n\nA new school should be built at this point next year. However, I do not feel it would warrant putting up one of our new schools, and would recommend that, if possible, logs be taken out this winter for building a school and teacher's residence. The Indians could do most of the work; and state that they would work reasonably and do their share in constructing the school and buildings - as they are very anxious to have them. I consider that a school built this way - by getting logs out during the winter; having lumber sawn for the floors and roof; and hiring a carpenter, who would be assisted by the Indians - should not cost us more than $6,500.00.\n\nI would very much like to hear from you regarding the above and if money could be made available for part of the building - in order that the logs could be taken out this winter, it would provide the Indians with work and also get the school started.\n\nR.S. Davis\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nDictated by Mr. Davis & forwarded in his absence.\n| Month | Enrollment | Percentage |\n|-------|------------|------------|\n| April | 11         | 92.09      |\n| May   | 11         | 95.45      |\n| June  | 11         | 91.36      |\n| Sept  | 9          | 100        |\n| Oct   | 13         | 100        |\n| Nov   | 14         | 90.37      |\n| Dec   | 14         | 82.36      |\n| Jan   | 13         | 59.30      |\n| Feb   | 13         | 88.67      |\n| Mar   | 13         | 48.46      |\n| Apr   | 13         | 59.77      |\n| May   | 13         | 87.88      |\n| Jun   |            | 94.70      |\n\nLatest monthly report shows No pupils in Grade One!

The work is not entirely completed as yet but we estimate the labor cost for the two buildings and the out-buildings will be approximately $2500.00.\n\nWe were fortunate in securing very fine spruce building logs and also in securing the services of an exceptionally good Scandinavian framer and the buildings have quite an attractive appearance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

He can also let you have the bill of materials for the doors, windows and finishing lumber required.\n\nWe do not have funds at the present for this project but could include an amount of $5,000. in our supplementary estimates for this project. If you will write again in October, we can advise whether this school has been included in the supplementaries.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Wylie & Compton report specifications for Clerk's House calls for maple flooring - same not available. Oak Flooring available at approximately $45.00 per thousand more. Authority for substitute of oak required immediately so purchase may be made while oak flooring is available.\n\n2. Mr. Wylie states specifications for school floor calls for edge grain fir floor or birch - neither available. Flat grain fir available but not recommended because it slivers, therefore, dangerous to children with bare feet or wild moccasins. Authority is requested for Mr. Wylie to substitute some other type of flooring less objectionable - suggest oak as birch and oak is approximately the same price.\n\n3. Gravel for Fisher River School must be hauled 21 miles and will cost $4.80 per yard, which is $1.50 more than the cost of the gravel for the clerk's house. There is no other source of supply - approval requested by wire for extra expenditure.\n\n4. Asbestos shingles and cedar siding not available for clerk's house.

If your department has built this school in this province before you will know if they had any trouble with the heating.

With reference to the specific questions asked in the letter, the following answers have been supplied by the Surveys & Engineering Branch:\n\n(a) There is neither hot nor cold air piping into the vestibules. Not considered necessary.\n\n(b) The stair structure presents difficulties in installation.\n\n(c) There is a stove in the lower living quarters which will carry off air.

The excavation however, is well on to completion.\n\nWith regard to the gravel required for the cement work I have to report that it has been found impossible to procure this from the location originally chosen, owing to the fact that no truck could reach the place as the ground is now very soft and boggy. It is very doubtful if even teams could get there with wagons, and even if they did, they could not haul half a load. In consequence of this, the only place left to procure the gravel (100 yards approx:) is the Provincial Government's stockpile, from where we got the gravel for the power house, and the new Clerk's House, 4\u00bd miles south of Hodgson. However, this is 28 miles from the new school site, and the total cost of the gravel hauled from here, would be $4.50 per yard; 80\u00a2 per yard payable to the Provincial Government, and $4.00 per yard for trucking. I trust that this will have the approval of the Department. I already have the Provincial Government's permission to remove the above gravel from their stockpile.\n\nP.G.

I was at a loss for a time to know just what to do about this condition, but finally decided to use clean new brooms and sweep off the frost from the walls and ceilings, then sweep up what had fallen, and light the furnace and keep a low fire on until the building had thawed out. This has now been done, but I have considered it necessary to hire an Indian who lives close to the school, to keep the building fairly warm, by making up the furnace fire in the mornings and nights every day, to prevent the frost accumulating again in the building, which I trust will be approved.\n\nI should be glad to be advised if the desks and other furnishings for this school, which have been requisitioned for have been purchased, and whether any progress has been made regarding the appointment of a teacher.\n\nP.G.

I will again write to him today and ask if he feels that we should advertise for a teacher in the Winnipeg papers.\n\nThe Department approves of your action in having a low fire kept in the building until such time as a teacher is appointed. The desks and blackboards have been ordered and should arrive in the near future. We are having great difficulty in procuring supplies of these two items and are experiencing long delays.

Wylie & Compton, 241 Munroe Ave., East Kildonan, Manitoba.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nSupt., Fisher River Agency.\n\nEncls.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Murdoch Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr. B.F. Neary's letter of the 29th ultimo, File 136-11-1 (W.T.) advising that Miss Dorothy Cornish has been appointed as teacher for the above noted school. As soon as the school is ready for occupancy I will notify both Dr. Best and Miss Cornish.\n\nAbout half of the residence furnishings ordered under Purchase Order No: 25458 from The T.Eaton Co: L'td of Winnipeg have been received. However, the school desks as per Purchase Order No: 24687, have not arrived, and no word has been received regarding them, apart from receipt of copy of the purchase order.\n\nIt would be appreciated if delivery of these desks could be facilitated as much as possible, as all the residence furnishings will be delivered within a week or so, after which the school will be ready to begin work.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nSup't: Fisher River Agency.\nFebruary 9, 1948.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of January 28th and the attached letter which you stated was addressed to you by Mr. John W. Thomson in connection with the Fisher River contract with Wylie and Compton.\n\nWith reference to fire insurance as we insisted that the contractor insure the buildings during construction I presume that it is in order to allow 10% fee to be claimed by the contractor.\n\nWith reference to the cement as this material was Government issue and it was secured at the contractor's request, he being unable to purchase cement, we will not pay the 10% on the expenditure involved in the purchase of the cement. The contractor had no trouble whatever in connection with the acquiring of the cement and we see no reason why he should claim 10% on this item.\n\nWith reference to paragraph 4 of Mr. Thomson's letter we are not quite clear as to what he means by board and room of workmen and agency employees paid by the Agency. We presume that he means the meals supplied by the hospital during the time the residence and lighting plant building were constructed for which we have not yet settled the account. What does he mean by Agency employees paid by the Agency. As the contractor was not put to any trouble or expense in connection with furnishing these meals, I see no reason why he should be allowed 10% on any of the expenses other than those for which he was responsible. We saved him a lot of trouble by furnishing the meals and in any event I do not see how he can collect 10% on something for which no definite charge has yet been set. This question has yet to be settled.\nWe understand from a letter received from Mr. Leesby, dated November 12th, that the contractor provided meals for the men engaged on the construction of the school. On this item, we will, of course, pay the 10%.\n\nI feel quite sure that Nylie and Compton have made more than a fair profit on these buildings.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 10, 1948.\n\nMr. F.G. Lazenby, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Hodgson, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, the Department finds it necessary to return the progress payment you forwarded in connection with the erection of the Murdoch School.\n\nIt is not possible to have the progress made visible as the mere mention of the total amount expended is not sufficient. The various amounts should be entered opposite the items shown on the form.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nFebruary 10, 1948.\n\nGentlemen:-\n\nRe: Purchase Order 24637\n\nThe above purchase order was issued on November 28, 1947 and covered thirty-two children's desks and one teacher's desk to be shipped to Mr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Hodgson, Manitoba. In a letter dated February 3rd the Agent states that these desks have not yet arrived.\n\nWe have been constructing a new school at that point and the building will be ready for occupation within the next week. Please let me know when you can deliver the desks.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMessrs. Vilas Furniture Co.,\nCowansville, P.Q.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM: THE DIRECTOR,\n\nAttention - Miss Walton\n\nClerk's House at Fisher River,\nEylie & Compton, Contractors.\n\nWith reference to your memo. of the 6th instant, we supplied the Cost Inspection and Audit Division with a copy of the Order in Council and the contract entered into with Eylie & Compton, Winnipeg. Following receipt of same, they got in touch with their Winnipeg representative and he called upon the contractor and told him what would be required in the way of vouchers supporting both labour and materials prior to his being in a position to certify the account for final payment. You will perhaps recall that, following a conversation with me, you wrote to the contractor on September 23, 1947, at which time you indicated our requirements in this regard.\n\nIn view of the thoughts expressed in your letter to Mr. Lasenby, the Indian Agent, dated February 6, I think that, prior to making Progress Payment #2, which is returned herewith, it would be wise to have the contractor state the separate amounts spent for labour and materials in the appropriate places provided on the form.\n\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that Treasury Board approved your Estimates in the form of sub-allotments for the same amounts as mentioned in Order in Council No.3021 and such; therefore, cannot be increased without going back to Treasury Board. Colonel Henry has already obtained Treasury Board authority to increase from $8,000 to $15,000 the amount required for the construction of the Day School and teacher's residence; corresponding authority is required for the expected increase in the cost of the Clerk's residence.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, no\nschool desks have come to hand as yet, and until these arrive\nwe will be unable to commence operating the school. I wrote\nthe Department regarding the desks on February 3rd last, with\na view of having the delivery made as soon as possible.\n\nReplying to the final paragraph of the Director's\nletter, I would say that at first glance the cost of the new\nschool, and the new residence appears to be rather high. However,\nuntil we have the final detailed statement of the costs of the\nvarious materials used, and the cost of labour, it is difficult\nto judge as to whether or not there has been any overcharge on\nany of the items. I may say that the basement construction\nat both the school and the residence covers a large portion of\nthe cost, as both these basements are large. As to the labour,\nthe men employed on these buildings were very good workers, and\ndid not waste any time. I watched this pretty constantly,\nespecially in connection with the residence.\n\nI will endeavour to make a fuller report after the\nInspector and Cost Auditor have been here. I may say that\nthere is still the jacket heater to be installed in the residence,\nbut I was advised last week, when in Winnipeg, that the plumber\nhad secured this heater, and would be installing it shortly.\n\n(signed) P.G.

You will note that I have dealt with holding back $250.00 until this work adjusted, but I have not dealt with the school complaints. Attached is copy of Storeater's report, but the engineer's report is only a single copy.\n\nChief\n\nApril 22, 1948.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Supt., Hodgson, Man.\n\nWe wrote to you on April 1 and asked you to see that the jacket heater specified and shown on the drawings was installed, as you had complained that the heater was not of the correct type, and we forwarded to you a copy of our letter to the contractors in this connection.\n\nWe have just received from the contractors a letter dated April 17th together with one from the Plumber, Mr. Jones, and I enclose herewith this letter as there is not time to have a copy made. Please see that the proper Jacket heater, as specified and as instructed is installed. Apparently the delay in installation in the first place and the change to a heater that was not specified is due to instructions issued by you that you wished a flat top heater. Attend to this matter immediately by getting in touch with the contractors and the plumber.\n\nIn your letter of March 31st you stated that Mr. Thomson, the auditor, was engaged in auditing the accounts but that some of the suppliers' invoices had not been received. We will have to pay the final payment on this work from the 1947-48 funds, as no funds have been provided in the 1948-49 Estimates. Please contact Mr. Thomson and see what is holding up the issuing of the final certificate.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nWe understand that eight pairs of window shutters complete as specified and shown on the working drawings have not been supplied by the Architect. However, as the building has cost a great deal more than was ever expected, I think we should not at this time consider this additional work and I would ask you to bring to the Auditor's attention the fact that these shutters were not supplied and accounts for them should not be passed.\n\nIn commenting on the building (staff residence) Mr. Storeater states: \"If exterior stucco was approved as a substitute for asbestos siding shingles, it should be of cement mixture applied on ribbed metal lath\".\nIn this connection please refer to our letter of Sep. 2 in which explicit instructions were given that a first-class stucco job was to be done. Has it been done in accordance with the best practice, namely - as suggested by Mr. Storeater on ribbed metal lath.\n\nIn this letter we are writing only about the staff residence, and we are passing on the file to the Superintendent of Education, Col. Henry, in order that he may note and take the necessary action in regard to the matters pertaining to the school and toilets on which Mr. Storeater has reported.\n\nThe Chief Engineer recommends that a sum of $250.00 be held back from the amount payable to the Contractor until the work has been satisfactorily completed. A copy of this letter is being given to the Chief Treasury Officer so that the holdback will be retained. I would suggest that you show this letter to the Auditor, Mr. Thomson.\n\nM. W. Director.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. D. B. Gow\n\nRe:- Buildings at Fisher River Indian Reserve, Manitoba.\n\nOn March 16 and 17 last, a visit was made to the Peguis Indian Reserve near Hodgson, Manitoba, to inspect the newly constructed Day School, Staff Residence and addition to the Light and Power Plant Building. Mr. P. G. Lazenby, the Indian Agent, was contacted and he provided a set of plans and specifications of the Day School and plans of the Staff Residence.\n\nAll the buildings were completed and in the opinion of the writer, the material used is of good quality and the workmanship, with the following one exception, of high order. The basement floor of the Day School was found to be very rough and irregular, also without the finish called for. It should be added that this floor is cracked and slightly heaved in places. In this respect, Mr. Lazenby stated that the building was left unheated for a period after its completion, at which time this occurred. Subsequently, however, the floor has settled back near its original shape.\n\nIt would appear very advisable that this floor be repaired at some early date, possibly during the summer school holidays. By preparing a proper bond, it is believed that a finish similar to that specified could be applied to the existing floor.\n\nFollowing are construction changes noted:\n\n(a) Day School and Teacher's Residence:\n\n1. Interior basement walls plastered,\n2. 1/4\" Oak Flooring on first and second floor instead of birch or fir,\n3. In some instances slab doors provided in place of panelled doors,\n4. Exterior of foundation wall above grade plastered and blocked off,\n5. Floors of outdoor toilets 1\" shiplap instead of 2\" planking,\n6. Exterior walls of toilets finished with siding similar to that of school, instead of asbestos shingles as indicated on plan.\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n(b) Staff Residence:\n\n1. Addition in basement of a concrete cistern. Cistern is 5' x 8' x 5\u00bd' high; plastered interior and exterior.\n\n2. Exterior finish stucco instead of shingles.\n\n3. Foundation wall above grade plastered and blocked off to a stone effect.\n\n4. Galvanized Iron eavestrough with three down pipes leading to above mentioned cistern.\n\n5. No shutters on house.\n\n6. Concrete walk from front to back of house.\n\n(c) Light and Power Plant Building:\n\nThe Light and Power Plant building was enlarged and made to match the existing old building. This addition is 12' x 12' in size and of light frame construction, resting on a concrete slab floor. The interior is sheathed with wallboard directly onto the studding. The exterior walls are sheathed with 1\" material and covered with 5/8\" drop siding. The roof is covered with cedar shingles laid 4\u00bd\" to the weather.\n\n(Sgd) O.J. Storsater\n\nO. J. Storsater.\nOttawa, April 27, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nMurdoch Indian Day School -\n\nThe construction changes noted in Mr. Gow's report of March 23 upon his inspection trip to the buildings at the Fisher River Indian Reserve have been noted.\n\nWith regard to the changes made from the standard day school specifications, it is felt that none of these are such as to require any further action on the part of the contractor. In most instances elaborations have been made upon the specification rather than deletions therefrom. Therefore we are prepared to accept this building as reported upon by Mr. Gow.\n\nDirector.\n\nMiss Walton:\n\nIf you are making any memorandum to the Lands and Development Services Branch about the Fisher River buildings, you can include our comments as above concerning school and teacher's quarters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Owing to the extreme drought of last fall the well was pumped dry. Miss Fairservice also complained of the strong alkaline taste in the water when it was available.\n\nJudging from appearances the only solution would be to install a drilled well at the most opportune time, as Miss Fairservice and the school children are drinking water derived from melted snow. As this source of supply will disappear with break-up, early action on this matter is strongly recommended.\n\nYours very truly\n\nR.L. Howell\nSuperintendent\n4th April, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the water situation at the Murdoch School. In official letter of 17th October, 1947, we authorized an expenditure of $175.00 to provide a well at this school, and we were later informed by the former agent, Mr. Lazenby, that the well had been dug. It is presumed that this is the well which is now dry.\n\nWe approve an expenditure of $350.00 in order to provide a new well, on the understanding that you are sure that the price will not exceed this amount. If there is any likelihood of this amount being exceeded, you should write to us again so that we can obtain the Minister's authority.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

I refer to the Department's letter of December the 24th, 1910 No. 198,700/1.\n\nI wrote the Department on January the 18th, 1911 stating that Miss Godon was willing to undertake the work.

To carry out the desire of the Indians the erection of a building would be necessary and provision for a matron and staff of some proportions would have to be made. It would not be expected that the day school teacher could perform the necessary services. However, it might be well for you to look into the matter and report more fully at some future time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 106.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\n6th April/1913\n\nI beg to herewith inclose, report of Miss, Godon, School Teacher, Roseau Rapids, for March quarter 1912, in reference to her School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nGreenridge P.O.\nApr 2nd 1912.\n\nMr. R. Logan\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending in my School Report for March gr. You will see when you examine same that I did not have a good attendance at home. There was only six children of school age all Winter, five of them attended school regular, while the sixth one did not attend at all. His excuse being he had no time.\n\nNearly all of them came home about the fifteenth of March, and I have a good attendance since then, I hope it will last till the end of June.\n\nWe have done very little sewing this Winter compared with last Winter, as there was only one little girl that attended school all Winter. We have finished one waist and one pinafore, and have another pinafore and a boy's shirt almost finished. The girls likes the work as well as ever. The flannelette and print that you sent a year ago is all used up.\n\nI have received payment for the potatoes that I sold last fall. There was nine bags, and got thirty cents per bushel, so I got four dollars and thirty cents. I bought ten slats, and fifty cents worth of candy for the children, and bought ten yards of print and intend to buy print or flannelette for the balance.\n\nYours Respectfully,\nRose Godon\nTeacher\nRoseau Rapids School.\nOttawa, April 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a communication addressed to you by Miss Godon, teacher of the Roseau Rapids School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that the attendance has been poor during the winter, owing to the absence of the Indians from the Reserve. This, however, is a condition over which the teacher can have no control.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher spent some of the money realized from the sale of the produce of her garden for the purchase of prizes for the children. This is approved of by the Department, but it is not considered advisable to purchase stationery and sewing material from this fund. This should be used to purchase rewards for the children. You will be good enough to advise the teacher that the Department is quite prepared to bear the cost of all stationery and sewing material. It is to be hoped that the teacher will continue the gardening operations again this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nI beg to herewith enclose letter received from Miss Godon, School Teacher at Roseau Rapids Reserve, which letter will explain itself.\n\nIn reference to this matter, would suggest that if an advance in salary would keep this teacher I would recommend it be offered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nGreenvillage\nMay 15th 1912.\n\nMr. Logan\nPostage la Prairie man\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a bill of four dollars and ten cents for seeds etc. Trusting it will be alright.\n\nIf you get a teacher to take charge of this school in August I am willing to sign my position at the end of this quarter. If you think you cannot get one, I will quite willingly come back and teach till Xmas. as it would be too bad for the garden to be left overgrown with weeds.\n\nI am very hopeful of having a good garden this year.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRose Godon\nTeacher\nRoseau Rapids School.\nOttawa, May 22, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant enclosing a communication from Miss Godon, teacher of the Roseau River Rapids School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to increase Miss Godon's salary as teacher of this school, as the attendance and her qualifications would not warrant it. If Miss Godon makes up her mind to resign steps should be taken to secure a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise of having received a letter from Miss Godon Teacher at Roseau Rapids Reserve, stating that her father is sick and is leaving the district. She has in the past been living with her father, and when he leaves, she will have to pay $13.00 a month for her board, and inquired if I thought the Department would allow her $12.50 per quarter more, to date from 1st January next. I might state Miss Godon has mentioned to me that she thought of resigning at Christmas, and I wrote her some little time ago to not think of resigning.\n\nI consider Miss Godon, one of the best teachers, and if by allowing her the $50.00 per year, she would remain after the new year, I would suggest that the Department consider the matter.

This will necessitate her paying her board. While Miss Godon has no professional qualifications, she has been doing fair work at this school and it might be difficult to replace her under the circumstances. I would, therefore, recommend that she be granted an increase of $50.00 in salary from the first of the current quarter. This will make her salary $400.00 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sorry to say that we don't get along as good with our sewing as the first year, as all the big girls has left school, and there are only four little ones left, two of these are too small to sew at all.\n\nSince January we have made three plain pieces of underwear, a little dress and a boy's shirt. Some of the children were so badly in need of clothes that I let them have these garments. Hoping I was right in doing so.\n\nOur garden this year looks very good so far. We have a large bed of garden peas (on blossom), one bed of beets about six inches high, carrots about three inches high. The set onions looks very nice, have 5 hills of cabbages and 5 of cucumbers (not doing very good). Potatoes are looking very well.

Ginn, Farm Instructor on the Roseau Reserve in which he refers to a request made by the Indians of the Lower Roseau reserve asking that the Department give them a Day school at this point.\n\nIn my report on the schools of Portage la Prairie Agency which was sent to the Department on the 11th of May 1911, I made mention of the request made by the Indians to have a day school on this reserve. The reserve is only four miles from Dominion City and would not be isolated for a teacher. There are eighteen children between the ages of five and fifteen and as most of the parents were themselves educated in Industrial schools they are really anxious to have their children educated but do not like the idea of sending them away to Boarding or Industrial schools. I am also of the opinion that these people would be loyal to a school and that it would serve good purpose at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are twelve children of school age on the reserve, and the time has arrived when they would like to have this school started. There is a small Roman Catholic Church here, which I have no doubt could be rented if the Department decide to open a school at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

We have children enough for to have a school we send our children to some Industrial school and\nthey don't know any more than children that go to day school. So we are not going to send them away no more. We want the school to be opened right away. We have a house that could be used while the school is being built. There is seats in the house. We also have a woman here that can start to teach till the regular school starts. All we want is books and school supplies and school biscuits. If you can send the supplies and the wages of the teacher.\nIt will be started right.\nAway the teacher is the same one that was teaching when the Kenora Boarding School opened.\nWe do not want the money for the school to be taken out of our land money it should come from the old treaty.\nThere are 13 children ready to go to day school if it should open here.\nHoping to hear from the department soon we are yours Chief and Counsellors\nChief Antoine Bgaouie\nCounsellors Adam Morin and Thomas and Pierre\nJanuary 17th 1912\n\nWe the Chief and Councilors at a meeting held today found out no reason why Mr. J.

This was mentioned in report on Schools for 1911.\n\nNearly all the Indians on this Reserve are Catholics and there is a Catholic Church on this Reserve.\n\nMr. Sinn the farm Instructor, believes that the members of this Band would appreciate and support the School much more loyally than the people at Roseau Rapids who are nearly all Pagans.\n\nThere are 18 Children between the ages of five and fifteen.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nR.

You should also report upon the qualifications of the woman to whom reference is made, who, it is stated, is available as a teacher. I may say that if the building and a suitable teacher are available the Department is prepared to give the day school a trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

In the meantime you will be good enough to submit a requisition for the supplies required and also state what other articles it will be necessary for the Department to furnish. The Farming Instructor should impress upon the Indians that the continuance of the school will be dependent upon the regularity with which they keep their children in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6250, file 560-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 5th Instant No. 389267/1 regarding a Day School on the Roseau River Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to make the following report.\n\nOn the 15th Inst., I left Portage and arrived at Dominion City 8 o'clock P.M. On the 16th, drove to the Reserve and had a meeting with the Indians. I placed the matter before them very strongly that if the School was opened it would be temporarily, and if the children attended the School regularly there was hopes of having a School built later on. Chief Antoine stated that he would see himself that the Children attended the School regularly.\n\nThe building referred to is the Catholic Church and Chief Antoine stated that Rev. Father Conneau who visits the Reserve at different times, told him that they could have the Church for School purposes. The Church is in good repair, and in my opinion, would answer the purpose nicely, with little or no cost to the Department.\n\nIn reference to the qualifications of the Woman who is available as a Teacher, would state that she has no Certificate. I had a talk with her. She is about 30 years of age and taught for some time at Kenora Bdg. School, she was at St Boniface School for ten years. She is married to a treaty named Ed Kipling, of St Peter Reserve, and has been living at Roseau Reserve for some time and wishes to be transferred to Roseau. She talks English well, and I consider she will make good as far as she knows, and the children will all have to start from the beginning. Mr. Ginn, the Farm instructor thinks that she will make a success of it, if the Children attend the School.\nOn my return from Dominion City, I stopped over in Winnipeg and had a talk with Rev. Father Comeau, and he informed me that Church could be used for the School, and was pleased to know that there was chance of getting a School; he also stated that Mrs Kipling would be alright as a Teacher.\n\nIf my report is satisfactory and a School should be granted, kindly advise, and I will forward requisition for School Material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. Logan\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nRosian River  \nDecember 24th 1912\n\nR Logan Indian Agent\n\nSir,\n\nI shall not wait another moment to write you these few lines. Christmas has been nice and bright except any wishes for a Happy New Year.\n\nMy brother Alex Hayden is willing to keep up the School for three months if you will allow him. I am hard at work with the reports just now. I will forward them to you as soon as done.\n\nI expect to be confined in January. I shall be alright in March. I got the advice of a friend to depend on the Foundling home in St. Robert so that I would be able to take the School work again but you may be sure I shall look after my own child myself when it is a year old.\n\nI will close with my best wishes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs E. Kippings\nSir,\n\nI beg to herewith enclose letter received from Mrs. E. Kipling, School Teacher at Roseau River Indian Day School, which will explain itself.\n\nIn reference to this matter would state, I had a letter from J.C. Scott, Farm Instructor, stating that Mrs. Kipling would have to give up the school about the 1st of January; he also stated that it would be too bad to have the school closed.\n\nI wrote Mrs. Kipling in reference to the matter, and received a pitiful letter, she stated that she was in a pregnant state, and was very sorry that she would have to give up the school. I wrote her again and herewith enclose the answer, I have taken it on myself to authorize her to have her brother Alex Hayden carry on the School until such time as she can resume teaching, which I trust may be satisfactory.\n\nI might also state that her husband is a bad actor, his wife does want to see him anymore, he is a member of Fisher River band, and Mr. Inspector Bunn has a Constable after him at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR.

Hayden, takes charge during the time that it will be necessary for her to be absent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

Kipling.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department must have information respecting the qualifications, scholastic or otherwise, of Mrs. Martin before it can decide as to her appointment.\n\nWith regard to the payment of rent for the church the Department cannot pay for the time the school has been in operation in the past but if it is to be continued in charge of a competent teacher a rental of $6.00 a month for the ten school months or $60.00 per annum, will be allowed on the date the school is reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It is to be distinctly understood that Mrs. Martin's continuance in the position will depend upon the result of her work.\n\nAs you were previously informed the Department will allow a rental of $5.00 per month for the time that the church is in actual use as a school-room; this is not to include the summer holidays of two months.\n\nYou will be good enough to report regularly at intervals on this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I wrote to Mr. Scott telling him about it. He was pleased to know that I have decided to give it a trial, and he told me to write to you to let you know that I will take the school. Mr. Scott thinks.\nperhaps I will have to take the \"west school\" as you have had an application for the one at the \"Rapids.\" I would like the school at the Rapids best. But if you already have an application I will take a trial of the school at \"West Reserve.\" I am sorry to say that I am unable to let you know about when I could start to teach on account of mother being sick. I should\nhave written to you before. But waited for mother to get better. She has been sick for over two weeks now, with rheumatism. She is some better and, if she continues to improve I think I would be able to go about the first of June or sooner. I wrote to my sister and asked her what she thinks of me teaching one of the schools. She told me I could try if I like, and that she would...\nhelp me. She is home\nfor two weeks now. We\nasked her to come home\nwhen mother took sick.\nI think this is all for now.\nhoping to hear from you\nat an early date and\nlet me know which\none of the schools I\nwill get.

She has no normal training and has taught for about 4 years.\n\nMiss Goodall was very pessimistic about this school. She says that she has done everything possible on her part to get the children to come to school but without success.\n\nThere are about 20 children of school age on this reserve and with a new teacher and a truant officer, it could be made as successful as any of our day schools.\n\nThe school is of little or no benefit to the reserve as at present conducted and should be closed at the end of the present quarter.\n\nS.

He states that on the register for the September quarter he found an enrolment of fifteen pupils, while the average for that quarter was only 2.9. He states that there are about twenty children of school age on this reserve and recommends that, if a better attendance is not secured, the school be closed at the end of the present quarter.\n\nUnless the Indian parents take advantage of the educational facilities provided the Department would not be warranted in continuing the expense involved by keeping this school open. You should inform the Indians that it is expected that they will see that their children attend regularly, as, if a better attendance is not secured, this school will have to be closed.

It is considered that if the Indians are not taking advantage of the facilities offered, the Department would not be warranted in continuing the expense of keeping this school open. You may, therefore, inform the teacher that this school will be closed at the end of May, next; it being necessary to give her one month's notice. Her services will not be required after that date.\n\nThe teacher should prepare a return before leaving, showing the attendance and days taught by her during the months of April and May, and forward same to you for transmission to the Department, in order that the amount of her salary and bonus due can be paid.\n\nAfter May 31st, next, the school is to remain closed until such time as the Indians take more interest in the education of their children, and will see that there is a sufficient attendance to warrant the school being re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Please answer by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\nEmma Gordon\nEmerson, Man.\nOTTAWA, July 16th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, and in reply beg to inform you that it is not the intention of the Department at the present time to reopen the Lower Roseau Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding your request to be appointed as teacher in an Indian Day School in Manitoba, I beg to say that as far as the Department is at present aware there is no vacancy for a teacher at the present time.\n\nYour application has been placed on file and should a vacancy occur will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I heard there would be at least sixteen children to attend school. I hope the Dept will consent as I need employment. I would accept another school somewhere in Manitoba. Maybe there are some vacancies by this time. I wrote to the Dept about a month ago and had no answer. I hope I will get an answer this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Emma Godon.\n\nEmerson Han. Box 208\nOTTAWA, October 14th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the reopening of the Roseau River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that it is not the intention of the Department to reopen this school at the new year. Until such time as the Indian people on this Reserve are prepared to take advantage of educational facilities the cause will not be attended to.\n\nRegarding any other Indian day schools in Manitoba, we are not aware of any vacancies for teachers at this time, and we must also state that it is our desire to obtain, in the future, qualified teachers for our schools.\n\nI noted that you wrote to the Department about a month ago and that you have received no answer. I beg to state that this communication never reached our office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.T.F.\n\nRussell T.

C. Jutras, Pr\u00eatre-Cur\u00e9\nLetellier, April 29th, 1923.\n\nSir:-\n\nI hear that the Indians of Roseau River School wish to have their school re-opened.\n\nI have found, with pleasure, that their Agent, Mr. Ogletree, wishes to have the teacher recommended by the Priest in charge of the Reserve.\n\nMiss E. Godon of Emerson, Manitoba is a very recommendable person on account of her good conduct, her honesty and her extended knowledge. I wish also to say that she speaks English, French and understands the Indian Language.\n\nMiss Godon has acquired experience by teaching in the same locality for the last three or four years.\n\nI, therefore, with my colleague Rev. Fr. Chaumont, wish to recommend her very strongly for this school.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nN. C. Jutras, P. P.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you request that the Indian day school on the Roseau River reserve be re-opened, and nominating Miss E. Godon, Emerson, Man., as teacher.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that it is not the intention of the Department to re-open this school at the present time. This school was closed on account of the poor attendance, due to the fact that the Indians were away from the reserve from time to time either hunting or working.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. N. C. Jutras, P.P.,\nLetellier,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nI would now recommend that the Roseau River school be opened on the 1st September next.\n\nThere are now about 20 children who are not getting an education. We could still use the Church with very little repairs for this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 17, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, in which you recommend that the Rosseau River Indian Day School be re-opened on the first of September next. I am sure you remember the unsatisfactory experience that we have had with this school, and the Department hesitates to give favourable consideration to your recommendation. There have always been a sufficient number of children to make this school a success; yet the average attendance for the last quarter it was open was only 5 children.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a full report in this connection, giving the reasons for your opinion that it might be well to re-open the school. I have to inform you that in no case would the Department consider the services of Miss E. Godon, of Emerson, Man., as teacher. Mr. Inspector Jackson, on the occasion of his last visit to the Rosseau Indian Day School in October, 1920, stated that a new teacher would have to be appointed, before there would be any hope of success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nSir,\u2014\nIn reference to your letter of the 17th instant,\nNo. I27-5-1.\n\nI beg to say that Mr. Ogletree is away from\nthe office at the present time, on leave of absence\nthrough sickness.\n\nI might say when was at the Roseau River\nReserve with the Indian Agent on the Annuity Payments\nlast April, the Chief, and Councillors with a number\nof the Indians asked Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree, to use\nhis influence with the Department to have this school\nre-opened. The Agent informed them that he did not\nthink the Department would open up this school on\naccount of the very unsatisfactory attendance, during\nthe time they had the school. The Chief and Councill-\nors promised if the school was re-opened that they\nwould see that the children attended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst.

There are many pressing claims against parliamentary appropriation, and only those day schools, the success of which we are assured, are being operated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to know if the Dept. would consent & open Roland River Indian Day School this spring.

A deep well might be obtained but the water would possibly be useless for anything but stock. The farmers throughout this area have dugouts and may store ice for summer household use. We have never had a well at the Home Farm. Mr. Brad puts up ice and this is used for drinking and cooking purposes. Most of the Indians use River water.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) A. G.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nProposed Roseau River Indian Day School.\n\nI have had a long discussion with Major Clark concerning the establishment of this school, and he has recommended the following:\n\n(a) That we advertise for tenders for the construction of plan 886;\n\n(b) That this school be sited just south of the house of Sam Hayden, which is on the left bank of the river about three quarters of a mile north on the trail leading from the farm instructor's house to the Chief's house;\n\n(c) That a well cannot be dug, due to the presence of salt water. This will mean an ice house will have to be provided and the school will have to be fairly close to the river to make the carrying of water convenient.\n\n(d) That due to the possibility of spring floods, the foundations should be at least a foot higher than usual.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that we can now proceed with the advertising of tenders for the construction of this school, based on plan 886 but with the foundation to be at least one foot higher than that provided normally in the blueprints and specifications.\n\nPlease find attached a sample advertisement.\nupon which I would like to have your comments. This school will be primarily for children now attending the Fort Alexander and Portage La Prairie Residential Schools.\n\nBernard P. Mooney,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnds.\nMr. B. F.
