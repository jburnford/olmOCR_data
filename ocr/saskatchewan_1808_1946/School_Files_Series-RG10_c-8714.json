We were under the impression that both these boys had been in the Crowfoot School during the September Quarter. As a matter of fact, we are not allowing the Crowfoot School for their maintenance during the September quarter, but at the same time, it is felt that the Old Sun's School is not entitled to receive grant for them when they were not in the school.\n\nThe necessary changes should be made and the Return sent back to us.\n\nBernard F.

As the work should be proceeded with and completed before freeze-up, I have authorized the Agent to proceed with it, but have stated that the services of many of the elder boys could well be made use of and the school should provide all the assistance it can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

General.\n\nOriginal on\n\nOLD SUN:\n\nYou promised the principal to include a new house in the 1928-29 Estimates. On your authority, the old school house has been torn down and some of the material is being used on the root cellar and granary - these buildings are now nearing completion.\n\nYou were also going into the matter of making this school more weather-proof and promised to consider the advisability of putting stucco on it.\n\"OLD SUN SCHOOL\nGLEICHEN ALTA.\n\nMay 28th, 1926.\n\nThe Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nIndian & Eskimo Commission,\nThe Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI am enclosing you the account which was under discussion when you were on your last visit to us. After going into the matter carefully with the contractor, Mr. W.T. Scott, it was found that in order to turn the present study into a suitable kitchen would have cost him around $125.00, whereas this arrangement would have been a source of danger from fire. A new chimney for the kitchen fire would have had to be constructed, and entrance made with porchway into the study, etc. Furthermore as has already been pointed out no suitable entrance into the basement could be located other than an outside one, which would have been useless or at least a great hardship especially during the winter months.\n\nThe present kitchen as you know is a mere kitchenette as it covers the stairway into the basement, as well as serving as a kitchen. The present arrangement on the whole cost the Department about the same as any other suggested arrangement, if any had been forthcoming at the time, and furthermore serves the purpose with greater convenience and safety.\n\nConsidering everything, I feel that the Indian Department will not be out of pocket in meeting the enclosed account as a somewhat similar amount would have had to be spent in any case.\n\nRegretting that this unnecessary trouble is being given you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure.\n\nF.M.G./- Principal.\nOffice of Indian Agent\n\nOklahoma, Alta.\n\nSeptember 15th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a voucher for $133.70 in favour of Mr. T.T. Scott, Contractor, for work and material supplied by him in the erection of a kitchen at the residence of the Principal of Old Gun School. This is sent at your request upon the matter was drawn to your attention on your visit to this Agency in August last.\n\nBriefly, in 1925 authority to rebuild this house was confined to a definite figure by Commissioner Graham. The kitchen was an extra and the Principal assumed responsibility for its erection. Unfortunately, neither the Church authorities nor Mr. Otten have paid Mr. T.T. Scott. The kitchen was needed and has been in constant use.\n\nSupporting vouchers and Time Sheets as rendered by Mr. Scott are attached. They were checked at the time the work was done and are in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOTTAWA - Ont.\nOttawa, September 30th, 1927.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your B-7 of the 19th instant and to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that the voucher for $193.70, in favour of W.

These are needed particularly in the JUNIOR room. When the Furniture system was installed lastly, considerable shelving was taken down and part of it is still unused and could, I believe, be sufficient to make cabinets. The cost would therefore be confined to labour.

You may arrange for the labour in having the cabinets required by the Principal installed. If any further supply of material is required, you may also purchase same. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in having this work completed, and any material on hand should be utilized for the purpose as far as possible.\n\nWhen the work is completed, please forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the labour and for any extra material supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nOne of our Pressure Tanks sprung a leak on Wednesday night last. I had Mr. Michael out to examine it, and we find that it is the old tank which has gone under water. It is eaten right through and it is impossible, I believe, to fix it in its present narrow confines. We had it disconnected from the new tank which was placed here five years ago, but this will only meet an emergency condition as we shall have to pump very constantly. It will be necessary to look into this matter as soon as possible. Mr. Michael and I have gone into the matter very closely and can give you a report as to what would be best to do under the circumstances.\n\nAlso our pump has been inspected and as the head has not been out since it was placed here about five years ago, it will be absolutely necessary to have this seen to, as well as a new belt is required. This will cost roughly about $50.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\n[Stamp]\nBlackfoot Agency\nNov. 26th 1927\nGleichen, Alta.\n\n[Handwritten note]\nReserve - Inspections were made by Mr. Brown.\nIf tank cannot be repaired it would be very costly to install another at same point. I think, whereas a new tank could be sunk at the west end off the pump room where it is now of the kitchen. Reserve cost of such tank is $1100.00 (cost of one new tank). May be better to decrease both and erect one good sized one at above mentioned place.\nGleichen, Alta., Dec. 2, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of November 1927.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nAt Crowfoot school threshing was completed on the 5th. An inspection of fire equipment was made by Mr. Duncan Clark, Assistant Agent, for the writer and Pyrene extinguishers have been refilled and placed in convenient places in the school. The Principal reports that the hose is in order and that drill carried out. All the pupils were well and three of the older girls were married this month.\n\nAt Old Suns two inspections were made. Considerable improvement was noted in interior economy. One of the pressure tanks is pitted and leaking badly. It cannot be repaired, I understand and replacement will be matter for consideration by the Department. One tank is now serving all purposes and should do for the winter months if the pressure is kept up continually.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nAgent.\n\nUnder the heading of Schools, Mr. Gooderham makes a comment about one of the pressure tanks at the Crowfoot Institution being out of order and beyond repair. He has not made a special report on this and I have no particulars regarding it but am writing to the agency today for further information.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nIn his report for the month of November Mr. G. H. Goderham referred to the poor condition of one of the pressure tanks in the Old Sams school and, while stating that this matter would need to be brought to the attention of the Department, thought that the other remaining pressure tank would be sufficient to meet requirements until the spring.\n\nI asked him for further information and I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Lewis, who is in charge during Mr. Goderham's absence, stating that these tanks are in the ground with a solid concrete floor above, with access to them through a man-hole in the floor. He adds, presumably upon information given him by a local plumber, that the cost of taking up this floor and replacing the tank would be considerable and suggests that a cheaper method would be to install a new 2100 gal. tank in the basement of the school at a cost in the neighborhood of $1,000.00. I have not verified these figures, but as a new 2100 gal. tank would cost in Winnipeg approximately $100.00, the remaining $900.00 seems a more than sufficient sum to transport it to Gleichen and install it. It is suggested that in case of fire the present water supply would be inadequate with the use of only one pressure tank and he also states that those now in use are of a capacity of 1100 gal. each. However, I think the Department will agree with me that the existing tank\n\nThe secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwould provide sufficient service until the spring and that the school would not be seriously jeopardized if this matter were gone into more fully and a remedy provided in the spring. I shall be glad to have the Department's views in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 30, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A GE of the 20th instant, with further reference to the pressure tanks at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.

The matter of fire escapes leading from the front dormitories has been dealt with by supplying main ladders.\n\nYou will note the Inspector states that the situation at Old Sun's was about as usual. We have had some correspondence with you regarding the replacing of one of the pressure tanks at this institution. The only thing that can be done is to put in a new tank in the Spring. I understand the cost of this will be about $1000.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAt the Old Sun's School I found things in general about as usual. The children appeared well but the school was not a bit tidier than it usually is. I also checked up the fire fighting apparatus here and found everything in good order. Fire drill is carried on and everything in the way of equipment has been supplied and every precaution is taken to guard against fire. The only thing that is lacking is an adequate supply of water. This, of course, would have nothing to do with getting the children safely out of the building in case of fire, and while the building might burn down owing to a shortage of water it would not prevent the children being saved. You have had some correspondence with Mr. Lewis regarding the water supply and I beg to say that the water is pumped from a well into two pressure tanks. These tanks are in a cement basement under the basement proper and are covered all around with cement, the only access to them being through a manhole. One of the tanks was new when the school was remodeled, and the other one was old. The old tank has become worn out through rust and corrosion and it does not appear practicable to me to tear up the basement and break up the cement in order to hoist this tank up. The more satisfactory solution would be to get a 2500-gallon tank and there is a room in the basement only a few feet from the well where it could be placed. Some wall would have to be taken down in order to get it in but this would entail a much smaller cost than the other plan. This matter, however, can wait until Spring comes, as I see no urgent need for it.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indians\n| Date | Description                                      | Quantity | Rate | Amount |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------|--------|\n| Feb 3 | 6 pres. 1 4/12 x 8' 8 1/2' 1/8\"                 |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x8 pine                                        |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x6                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x6                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x6                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x6                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 15' lum h\" Hard Cop.                             |          |      |        |\n|      | 4 pa. 3 2x42 veneer                               |          |      |        |\n|      | 13 2x48                                          |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x7                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x7                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x7                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x7                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 4x7                                           |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 per. 6x10 stalk                                |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 6x8                                            |          |      |        |\n|      | 1 6x8                                            |          |      |        |\n\n**Total:** $189.50\n\n*Thanks David W.

Michael, who is \"the only local plumber and his prices invariably compare favourably with those from plumbers in Calgary.\" The cost of the work complete, which is recommended by both Mr. Orr and Mr. Chene, is $1174.\n\nAs funds can be found in the General Appropriation for Indian Education, I wish to recommend that the improvement be effected.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 24th ultimo, with reference to a new pressure tank that is required at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. You may make arrangements for this activity, as outlined in your letter, at a total cost of $1174. When the work has been satisfactorily completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, enclosing the offers made by the firms that are given the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOn the 24th ultimo I wrote referring to Department letter 104-1-5 of the 30th December last, in regard to the question of providing a pressure tank for the Old Sun's School. I shall be glad to know if authority will be granted to expend the sum of $1,174.00, which has been estimated will be the cost of the necessary work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOld Sun School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nMay 22nd, 1928.\n\nG.H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to the enclosed letter re desks and beds, I beg to give the following details:\n\n**Desks:**\n- Type: Globe Automatic, Firm: F.M. Osborne, Calgary.\n- Size: Number 2, for pupils 13 to 15 years, height 16 in.\n  Two (2) of this size required.\n- Same type, Size: No. 3, for pupils 10 to 12 years, height 14\u00bd in.\n  One (1) of this size required.\n\nThese desks are complete single desks. Carriage prepaid on all orders of 3 or more desks.\n\n**Beds:**\n- Number of beds on hands: 82.\n- New beds on hands and in good condition: 16.\n- The actual number of old beds on hands of the high hospital type is 82 - 16 = 66. The new beds are of the juvenile size, size 6 ft. by 2 1/2 ft. These are the type required for the junior pupils. The size required for the seniors would be 7 ft. by 2 1/2.\n- I have noticed that these two sizes have been provided in some of the new schools which I have visited from time to time.\n\nOur requirements, therefore, would be as follows:\n\n- 24 Juvenile beds complete, with springs and mattresses.\n- 40 Children's beds.\n\nThe condition of beds (old) on hands is as follows:\n\n- All bedsteads in fair to good condition.\n- 46 springs beyond repair.\n- 32 mattresses in bad condition.\n\nThe old beds on hands were either here when the school was reopened in the spring of 1923, and were furnished by the school staff, and a number were provided out of a supply on hands at the local agency. There was also a mangle.\n\nI beg to submit that the smaller beds as provided in some of the other schools would be more easily washed by the children, the mattresses would consequently last longer, and the dormitories would be less congested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 14th ult., re beds at the Old Sun School, I attach hereto a report from the Principal which answers most questions asked.\n\nRe disposition of old beds, I may say that Hospital beds were supplied from the carload of C.O.R. equipment which was allocated to this Agency some years ago when C.O.R. hospitals were disbanded. Such beds in reasonably good condition can be returned to the Agency for use at the hospital and for issue to Indians requiring beds. This type bed is not suitable for the school and takes up considerable space.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - Ont.\nOttawa, May 29th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School relative to the extra school desks and beds required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may place an order with F. E. Osborne, Calgary, to supply the following desks:\n\n2 No. 2 Globe Automatic Single Desks,\n1 No. 3 \" \" \"\n\nPlease obtain an account, in duplicate, which you should certify after the desks have been received, if in good condition, and forward to the department for payment.\n\nRelative to the beds required, the department is not clear from the Principal's letter as to the exact size required. I might add that the type of bed we usually supply is the institution bed, 6' x 2\u00bd' wide for the senior pupils and 5' x 2\u00bd' for the younger pupils, complete with springs. We do not supply a made up mattress, but furnish mattress casings instead, and these can be filled at the school. When we have definite particulars as to the size of the beds required, consideration will then be given to placing an order here for the supplying of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, May 31, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to authorise you to arrange for the erection of a principal's residence at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. I understand the Deputy Superintendent General, when at the school last summer, believed that it would be advisable to have the residence attached to the main building. $4,000 is available for the purpose. Please be guided by general instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's l-l-5 of the 28th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst.

It is believed that the fire was started by spontaneous combustion and spread rapidly.\n\nThe building, being owned by the Indian Department of the Federal Government, no insurance was carried.\n\nAll the heavy clothing for the children from the old school, which was donated by the ladies of the Toronto diocese of the Anglican Church, was destroyed.\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHS\n\nHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONT.\n\nW.

June 27th, 1928\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou have been advised by Agent Gooderham that the Old Sun School was burned to the ground last night. It is stated that the fire started in a cellar room, and no doubt it was caused by spontaneous combustion.\n\nIn a phone message a few minutes ago, Agent Gooderham stated that the children were all safe and have been sent to their homes.\n\nI would ask you not to take any definite steps in connection with the re-building of this school until I have had an opportunity of discussing the whole school situation with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGleichen, Alta.\nJune 27, 1928\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn confirmation of my wire of even date, Old Sun School is burned to charred ruins from a fire which seemed to originate in a combination dairy and storage cellar last evening. I am of the opinion that the fire was spontaneous combustion of raffia and other stuff which was stored in this room. Fire fighters with chemical engines were rushed from Gleichen but it was nearly impossible to get at this room as it was originally a root-cellar with only one entrance from the inside of the building. The smoke was intense and the water supply very limited and the fire got into the wood-work of the main structure and was soon out of control. An attempt was made to save the front of the building by setting off dynamite in the middle area. This was not successful.\n\nAll children and staff were out of the building and are safe & sound. The children were sent home with their parents during the night and will remain there for the present as holidays are practically at hand.\n\nThe Principal's house is intact but Mr. Gibney suffered loss by damage to furnishings which were moved out. The water supply & electric energy for the house and barn was cut off but the Power Company will no doubt remedy this shortly.\n\nI have turned over the vacant house half a mile North of the school for the use of the Farm Instructor and others of the staff and their effects are being moved today.\n\nPractically nothing of value was salvaged and machinery in the basement is junk now. Everything in our power was done to stop the fire the origin of which is conjecture. Fortunately, good fire drill prevented panic and no pupils or members of the staff suffered except myself from sleep and excitement. I have reported the fire as required under Provincial regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum: June 27, 1928.\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nThe following is a telegram received this morning from Mr. G.

The Department has given favourable consideration to your proposal in connection with the pupils at the Old Sun's Residential School, and I have to authorize you to arrange for two temporary day schools - one in the church at Gleichen and the other in a church building at the west end of the reserve. Rev. Mr. Gibney and Miss Hauver may be engaged to do the teaching. I note that the cost of preparation and equipping will not be great. If desks and blackboards are required, please make immediate requisition. Would it be possible to get along without regular school desks for the time being?\n\nYou may also ascertain what arrangement you could make for transporting the children to and from school each day. When your report in this connection is to hand, the Department will give it consideration. The funds necessary for these temporary day schools will not be taken from Band Funds, as it is the Department's practice to pay all educational costs from Parliamentary Appropriation. A copy of this letter is being directed to Dr. Westgate, of Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H.

September 5, 1928.\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Old Sun School has just directed my attention to the urgent need of a residence for the Farm Instructor at this School, and I am wondering if it would be possible for your Department to take steps to have this building provided immediately.\n\nThe Farm Instructor is occupying at present a house loaned by the Blackfoot Agency, and situated about half a mile away from the site of the old School. The Farm Instructor is finding this, at the busy season of the year, very inconvenient, and the Principal feels that it will not only be inconvenient to him during the winter months, but a hardship as well, if he is obliged to carry on his work at this distance. The building he is occupying has no kitchen range, and he and his wife are using an oil stove of their own. If they must live there during the coming winter it will take, I understand, a good deal of coal to keep the building heated.\n\nI am under the impression that there was an appropriation for a Principal's residence at this School this year, and although the destruction of the main school building by fire has created unexpected problems in this connection, I am of the opinion that the Farm Instructor's residence should be provided forthwith if at all possible. I have not seen the plan of the one being constructed at St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, but it seems to me that the building that will suit in one place would do equally well in the other.\nI commend this matter to your prompt and sympathetic consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, September 10, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the provision of a residence for the farm instructor at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. I am making enquiries in this connection and will have a further communication for you in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, September 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Dr. Westgate has written, urging the Department to provide, this year, a residence for the farm instructor at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. It appears that this member of the staff is living, at present, in a house loaned by the Blackfoot agency. This temporary residence is one-half mile from the school and is, apparently, not entirely satisfactory. Would you please make enquiries, without delay, and let me have a recommendation concerning Dr. Westgate's request. If you believe a residence for the farm instructor should be erected this year, you had better telegraph your report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

There were 43 boys enrolled and the gross number of years to fairly account. It is reasonable to assume that there will be about 60 pupils on with the improved infant mortality and better living conditions, the number of children of school age should increase over a period of years.\n\nI would recommend accommodation for at least 60 pupils to which must be added the Staff accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 6, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nDr. Westgate has recommended accommodation for 100 in the proposed new Old Sun Indian Residential School.

The Mission building at the west end had never been made fit for use since the Church authorities moved it from the North Camp. It was necessary to board it up outside, remove a partition inside, repair walls, roof, interior and make seats for the pupils. The Church had some lumber on hand at the Canada Lumber yard and this was supplied to Mr. Scott. Small lots of lumber were also purchased by Mr. Scott as you will note on his account.\n\nThe accounts represent all charges in putting these buildings into condition to operate the two Day-Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nPrincipal's Residence \u2014 Plans\n\nFrontage \u2014 26' 6\" x 30' Depth.\n\nTo be enlarged at least 30 feet long x 35 feet depth.\n\nIt would also be a residence of similar dimensions to that of the middle school at St. Paul.\n\nThis will allow for kitchen, dining room, living room on the first floor and also a necessary room or study in place of space indicated as Tool.\n\nThis room is very necessary in connection with work of the Principal as missionary on the Reserve.\n\nThis would also allow, furthermore, for four bedrooms and bathroom on upper floor. As the Principal's family comprises six (6) at the present time (including self and wife), the accommodation is absolutely essential.\n\nThe Principal would also like to have a place in which to keep his living-room a seat for porch, with a French door leading thereto. This would also be extended upwards as a sleeping porch, opening off from N.E. bedroom.\nJanuary 3, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is the rough sketch of Old Sun School and a list of suggestions for minor changes. Practically all the suggestions come from the Principal and on going over the plans with him, I have concurred with his suggestions.\n\nAs the building will face East, the space to the North of the Principal's residence and chapel should be kept in good condition - a flag pole, shrubs and flower beds will make this attractive and present a better appearance from the road running South from Gleichen past the Agency to the school than it would if there were entrances to the building here. It is therefore hoped that all alterations can be made from the South side. This necessitates the suggested changes in the basement plan.\n\nYou will note the suggestion that two bathrooms be removed from the first floor and that a bathroom be provided in the basement for the employees and outside workers. The women are reluctant about going to main floor bathrooms and I like the suggestion. In the dormitories, toilets are sufficient.\n\nThe Principal's residence is too small for the present incumbent. His requests do not seem extravagant and I hope you can meet all the suggested changes or improve on them. The lay-out, the accommodation and general plan is good, I think.\n\nWith best season's greetings,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

Guernsey Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Proposed New School to replace Old Sun's School\non Blackfoot Reserve at Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nIn further reply to your letter of the 6th instant with\nreference to the proposed school to take the place of the building\ndestroyed by fire, I am now able to submit the following Report.\n\nI proceeded to Gleichen by the early train on the 14th\ninstant, and spent all of that day, and till noon of the following\nday, in gathering data and forming impressions, along the lines\nmentioned in your letter of instructions.\n\nI was joined by the Indian Agent, Mr. Geo. H. Gooderham,\nwho rendered me every possible assistance, and together we proceeded\nto the ruins of the old building where the present school, the Rev. F.M.\nRoss Gibney came to us from the Indian church nearby where he was\nholding day classes. Your letter to me was read by both gentlemen, so\nthat it would be clearly understood on what lines our co-operation\nwas being invited.\n\nThe fire certainly made a clean sweep of the former\nbuilding, every scrap of combustible material having been licked up,\nand the ruined wreckage are complete. The scarred and cracked\nconcrete walls enclose a mass of tangled and twisted iron and steel,\nwarped I beams, ruined plumbing fixtures, laundry equipment, etc., in\na seemingly inextricable mass. It is doubtful if anything remains\nthat could safely be used again in the new building, but even these will\nhave lost their original temper, and it would be undesirable to use\nany of them again except perhaps in unimportant outbuildings. The\nlaundry boiler seemed to be the only solitary exception, having been\nplaced in a concrete chamber of its own it seemed to have been more\nor less protected from the general fire, and an examination by a\nboiler inspector might result in this article being pronounced fit\nfor further service.\n\nWith regard to the best means of filling in the old excavation,\nI should advise that this work be made part of the general contract\nfor the new building, and that the contractor tendering be allowed\npossession of the existing wreckage. He will then carefully examine\nand appraise the ruins, and if he find anything there of value to\nhim for use elsewhere, he will reduce his tender accordingly,\nand in this way the Department also receive credit for whatever may\nbe salvaged from the ruin before being filled in. The contractor\nwould scarcely omit this opportunity of reducing his tender (if any\nsalvage be possible), nor do I will know that his competitor might\notherwise undertake him and thus capture the contract. I think therefore,\nthe Specifications should call for the filling in of the existing\nexcavation as part of the general contract; and that the old concrete\nwalls be broken off to a line at least two feet below the present grade;\nand that the contractor be allowed possession of the debris. The portions\nof the concrete walls broken off would, of course, be well buried in\nthe filling of the old excavation. I fully agree with you that it would\nbe unwise to rebuild on the site of the former building.\n\nThere is also an old foundation, and small excavation, from an old\nschoolhouse adjacent to the proposed site of the new building, which\nwill be in the line of future driveway, and this should also be broken\nup and levelled. This is comparatively a very small matter, but might\nbe included too in the general contract.\nRegarding the site of the proposed new building, we gave very careful consideration to this important matter. For obvious reasons we could not place the building on its former site; nor could we go in front of the old site without encroaching on the roadway, and also such a position would be in a bad dust area. We could not place the school at the rear of the old site because of the barn and buildings, root-house, etc., now located there. After examining various alternative sites, we then gave attention to a site which had previously been favourably regarded and tentatively agreed upon by Mr. Gooderham and Mr. Honey. This favoured site has an east exposure, and will face the main cross-country highway about half a mile distant, and will be clearly visible from farms approaching from the east. I could find no objection to this site, and my own opinion confirmed the judgment of the local officials that this is the best site available in that vicinity. We felt there was no use going too far afield in quest of sites because of increasing distance from valuable outbuildings and farm operations.\n\nThis proposed site is quite close to the position of the former school, and equally convenient to the barn and other farm buildings. I took levels on the site itself, and found only 26 feet difference between the high and low extremes. The surrounding land is practically level, but with a slight slope away to the east, which increases until a declivity is reached about 100 yards away from the proposed front of the building. Across the road to the north the land also falls away, and it is in this direction that the sewage disposal from the former building would find an outlet. I enclose a rough sketch which may enable you better to understand the relative position of the proposed new site. Of course, in plotting the proposed new building, I could only do so with approximate correctness, as I have not exact knowledge of the size of the new building.\n\nWith regard to sewage disposal, I did not have time to run levels, but I am convinced from superficial observations that there will be sufficient fall for our purpose. The former building with its deep basement and deeper drains, had none too much fall, and the sewer was sluggish, but with the much shallower basement proposed for the new building, the conditions in the matter of fall will be much more favourable, and there is no doubt in my mind but that we can get by. The sewage disposal from the new school will be diverted into the existing sewage disposal system, provided that on examination the septic tank and disposal field are found to be suitable and in good condition. In all events the sewage will have to be taken in the same direction.\n\nAnother point to which we gave consideration was that of the school well. The drilled well in the old building was most satisfactory, giving excellent water which had never been pumped. The situation now is in the midst of the general ruin, and it would be rather difficult to build a new well-house there and operate it separately. It was thought advisable to drill a new well to come within what is shown on the Lytton plan as the \"Lighting Room,\" so that the pumping plant might be placed in a corresponding place in the proposed new building. The purpose of redesigning this \"Lighting Room\" is to use it as Dairy Room, as I shall explain presently. In the unlikely event of the drilling failing to get a good water supply, then we would be compelled to utilize the well used before, in which event a \"Pump House\" would be necessary directly over the original well. The location of a well to serve the new building would be adjacent to the present well, perhaps about 50 feet distant, so it is altogether likely we would tap the same water reservoir below.\n\nWith regard to the best method of storing water for use throughout the building, and to obtain sufficient pressure and volume, I believe a tower and elevated tank would be the most satisfactory. In anticipation of this requirement I shall obtain data on this subject, and write again at an early date. In this connection I might say that there is now on hand at Gleichen a new pressure tank that\nwas procured by the Department for Old Sun's School, but Mr. Gooderham informs me that this tank is needed to augment the storage capacity of the water system which supplies their Indian Hospital and the Agency residences, and therefore this new tank need not be a factor in planning a water system for the new school building.\n\nNow, with regard to the building itself, I had with me the floor plans of the Lytton School, and they were carefully examined by Mr. Gooderham, Rev. and Mrs. Gibney, and myself, with a view to determining in what respects the Lytton building seemed suitable and what alterations seemed desirable, and the suggestions which follow are respectfully offered for your kind consideration.\n\n1. Principal's Residence exactly as shown, except to be changed to the other end of the school. It will then be next to the driveway, and will give observation of the approach to the school.\n\n2. Boys and girls' quarters to be reversed so that the girls will occupy the side of the building next to the Principal's residence.\n\n3. It is proposed to omit the \"Second Floor\" shown in the Lytton plan. The wings and centre building to remain the same size as shown. The lavatory, baths, toilets, etc., could be reduced to the needs of 90 children.\n\n4. The rear extension from main building could be reduced in size to serve 90 children and Staff.\n\n5. One toilet opposite laundry entrance will suffice.\n\n6. Laundry can share in reduction of rear extension.\n\n7. Lighting Room to be retained, but to be used as Dairy and Pump Room. An outside entrance is desired. In the proposed position of the new building this room will be the nearest point to the Barn. It might be reduced one third in size.\n\n8. Coal Cellar to be retained, but to have reinforced concrete roof at grade level, with manhole opening and cover.\n\n9. Pantry to be equipped with Frigidaire.\n\n10. Room shown as \"Stores\" adjoining Boiler Room to be changed to Engineer's Room, and to have wash-basin with H & C water.\n\n11. Room shown as \"Janitor's Room\" in Basement to be used for \"Stores\".\n\n12. Domestic Coal Chute and Bin serving Kitchen to be retained.\n\n13. Boys' and Girls' quarters on the Ground and First Floors will be reversed as well as in the Basement.\n\n14. It is requested that the Sewing Room and Class Room on Girls' Side be converted into one room instead of two as shown, the blackboard to be placed on the wall adjoining Stairway.\n\n15. The Principal requests that the Corridor to the Residence be enclosed by accordion doors similar to St. Paul's School, so that the two class-rooms may be thrown into one large auditorium for concerts and other entertainments.\n\n16. The arrangement of Boys' Class Rooms and Study to be retained.\n\n17. The Class Room shown in centre main building to be converted into a Guests' Bed Room, although this might be reduced in size. The space thus saved might be utilized to form an inner Principal's Office next to the main office, some space being also taken from the main office for this purpose.\n\n18. The Assembly Hall to share in reduction in size or elimination from main building. The Principal desires that the School be similar to the arrangement at St. P...\n19. It is desired that a \"clothing room\" be built in the centre of the Dormitories,\u2014that is, one clothing room in each wing to serve both the Dormitories adjoining. These Clothing Rooms might be about 8' x 24' in size, with a doorway from each Dormitory to be kept under lock and key. Open lockers, with drawer below and hat-shelf above, might be built around the walls of this room. The Principal reports much trouble from lockers accessible to the children, whereas under the proposed arrangement the children will not have access to the lockers except when under direct supervision.\n\n20. The Principal desires an observation window to be placed in the walls of the Staff Rooms adjoining large Dormitories, if feasible.\n\n21. Night Lights are desired in Dormitories.\n\n22. The room shown as \"Drugs and Stores\" to be included with the Staff Room to the right, and both rooms thrown into one large room to receive the bales of clothing, etc., which come annually in large quantities. Having an Indian Hospital near at hand it was not considered necessary to retain a room for Drugs.\n\n23. In view of the suggestion that the \"Second Floor\" shown in the Lytton plans be omitted, it is considered advisable to retain the Infirmarys as extra Dormitories should they be shown in the final plans. Inadequate, the Principal thinks these rooms may not be needed as infirmaries because of the availability of the Indian Hospital, but he thinks they may be needed in case of the space in the Dormitories on the one floor being overcrowded, in which event he would assign the older pupils to these rooms.\n\n24. If equally economical, and otherwise suitable, it is desired that the new building have a gable roof instead of a flat roof. If a gable roof be provided, it is desired that a Spire be omitted. Owing to excessive winds and driving storms, spires have given trouble, and are difficult to keep weather-proof. Instead of a Spire, the Principal requests that a small finial with Cross be placed over the central gable above the school entrance.\n\n25. The Principal requests that a Farm Instructor's Residence be provided apart from the school building, and that this be erected in the near future. The present Farm Instructor is proving an invaluable employee, and is bringing the school farm into excellent productivity and efficiency.\n\n26. The Residence now being occupied by the Reverend Principal and his family might well be demolished when the living quarters in the new building are ready. This building has already been moved twice, and is scarcely worth moving again. It is \"ramshackle\" in appearance, difficult to heat, extremely inconvenient in its interior arrangements, and would be altogether undesirable alongside a new, modern building. Its present situation is just off the proposed site of the new building. It is needed as a residence for the Principal and family until the new building is ready for occupation, and then I consider it will have served the past and present generations sufficiently, and might then be carefully taken down, and any materials of value could be used again in unimportant outbuildings, or otherwise disposed of.\n\n27. The Principal requests that a stone name-plate, with inset lettering (or other suitable name-plate) be placed over the main entrance of the school.\n\nI think the foregoing items include about all the suggestions that were thought of at our joint conference, and in respectfully submitting them for your kind consideration we recognize that there may be difficulties in the way of granting all the requests mentioned; or, for reasons for modifying them further, there has been a constant effort to avoid extravagance, and to ask only for those things which seem important for the efficient administration of the school, and for the health and comfort of the occupants.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nField Secretary\nRev.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my visit to the Blackfoot Reserve last week, my attention was directed to the need of a Farmer's cottage in connection with the new building which it is expected your Department will provide during the coming summer to replace the Old Sun School. I undertook to bring this matter to your attention and I shall be obliged if you will give it your sympathetic consideration. Mr. Bates, the Farm Instructor is a very competent staff agent, and may be relied upon to place the farming activities in connection with this institution on a satisfactory basis. He should, however, have a cottage of his own detached from the main school building, and I beg to suggest that steps be taken at the earliest date possible to have this building erected.\n\nWhen I visited the St. Paul's School a few days before proceeding to the Blackfoot Reserve, I went carefully over the Farmer's cottage which you have provided for this institution, and am of the opinion that a cottage built on the same plan and of the same dimensions and material would do very well for the Farm Instructor's residence at the Old Sun School.\n\nI commend this request to your favourable consideration, and have the honour to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. Westgate has written, urging the provision, this year, of a farmer's cottage at the Old Sun School. He represents that Mr. Bate, the present farm instructor, is very competent and that a cottage should be provided for him without delay. Dr. Westgate states that one similar to that erected at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School would be suitable. Please let me have your recommendation in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 12, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the advisability of erecting, this year, a farmer's residence at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. There are no funds specifically provided for this purpose, but I am making enquiries, and, at a later date, you will be advised if the Department is able to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 9th ultimo and your reply to the same on Jan. 14th, enclosing plans for the new School to replace the Old Sun School on the Blackfoot Reserve, I beg to state that during my recent visit to this Reserve I had an opportunity of discussing the whole situation with Mr. Gibney, the Principal of the old School, up until the time it was destroyed. Mr. Gibney showed me a copy of the memorandum which had been prepared by Mr. Gardner-Smith in consultation with himself, and also a copy of the suggestions which he himself was forwarding to you in connection with the proposed plans for the new School which he had examined. Beyond the suggestions made by Mr. Gibney, all of which I approve, I have only a few remarks to offer, and these are as follows:\n\n1. A suitable garage is a necessity and should be built as part of the main School building in order that it may be heated from the central heating plant. A motor car is required summer and winter in connection with the School work all over the prairie provinces, and my recent visit to Southern Alberta when the weather was at times 50 below zero, convinced me that a heated garage is a necessity. The suggested location of this garage, as given by Mr. Gibney, appears to me to be suitable.\n\n2. The Principal's residence should be large enough to include 4 bedrooms and a den or study. Owing to the dust-laden winds which prevail at times in Alberta, the glazed verandah off the living room of the Principal's\nresidence is very necessary, and I trust it may be provided, and have the sun porch above it as requested by the Principal, as well.\n\n3. The plans do not make provision for an Indian room, and this is a very essential part of a residential school building.\n\n4. A partition should be installed on the first floor so as to keep the two sides of the building separate.\n\n5. I should like to suggest that this School be provided with spiral fire escapes instead of the ordinary ladder type which the younger children find it very difficult to use. So far as I know the spiral type has not been supplied to any Indian Residential School, and even though the cost might be greater than the ladder type, I am of the opinion that they are the safest and should be provided.\n\n6. I have already addressed a separate communication to the Secretary with regard to the provision of a Farm Instructor's cottage. I have suggested that one built on the same plan and of the same material as the one provided at the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, would meet the needs of this institution. I see no reason why the erection of this building should not be taken in hand at once. The Farm Instructor who is a very efficient man, and who is at present living with his wife at a very considerable distance from the School site, should be comfortably and conveniently settled when the time comes to begin the Spring work, and I trust that prompt action may be taken in this matter.\n\n7. It is understood by our Society that the new School will be built of brick.\n\nI am holding the plans until our Commission have had an opportunity of examining them at their next meeting after which they will be returned to you.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nFeb. 13, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate,\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant with further reference to the plans for the new Old Sun's School. I will deal with your suggestions in the order in which they appear in your letter.\n\n1. In the plans returned by the Agent no mention was made in the notes by either the Agent or Mr. Gilmore for the need of a garage.\n\n2. Four rooms and den are being provided in the residence also a glazed verandah off the living room together with sun porch.\n\n3. An Indian room is being provided.\n\n4. It is the intention to provide a partition in the corridor on the first floor.\n\n5. Consideration will be given to the spiral type fire escape.\n\n6. The question of a Farm Instructor's cottage will be dealt with in a separate communication.\n\n7. It is the intention to construct the building with outside walls of hollow tile veneered with brick.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\n39-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\n\nR. GURNEY ORR,\nArchitect for the Department.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant No. 104-15, informing me that Dr. Westgate had written to the Department urging that provision be made this year for a Farmer's cottage at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. If it is the intention of the Department to rebuild this school there is no doubt a residence should be built for the Farmer, provided he is a married man. At some of our schools they are not particular whether the Farming Instructor is married or not, and in the past we have had a single man at the Old Sun's School so far as I know, but if Mr. Bate is a married man he should have a home. At the present time the Farmer is living in an Indian cottage about half a mile from the school, and this arrangement is not very satisfactory. A request for a cottage was made in September last by Dr. Westgate, and I informed the Department that there was no urgent need for it at the time. The cottage at the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve cost in the neighborhood of $4000.00, and it would perhaps cost $4500.00 to build a similar cottage at Old Sun's, that is by putting in the plumbing, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFebruary 28, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 16th instant, with reference to a farmer's cottage at the Clq Sun Indian Residential School. In view of your recommendation, the Department has decided to provide this building at the earliest possible date, and I have now to authorize you to make the necessary arrangements. Your estimate of $4,500 should not be exceeded and a saving should be effected if possible. In the engagement of labour and the purchase of materials, please adopt the usual procedure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of Feb. 7th, and your reply to the same on Feb. 12th, 104-1-5, relative to the provision of a Farmer's residence at the Old Sun Indian Residential School, I beg to state that in a letter just received from the Rev. F. M. R. Gibney, Acting Principal of this School, and dated Feb. 19th, he informs me that the immediate need of this residence has been accentuated through the decision of your Department to have the house which is at present occupied by the Farm Instructor, fitted up as a residence for Dr. Windsor, the Medical Health Officer. Mr. Gibney's letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The Department may not be aware of the fact that we have the loan of one of their buildings, adjacent to No. 1 Government Farm Instructor's house, as a temporary home for our Farm Instr. Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham has just received communication from the Indian Department at Ottawa, requesting him to have this house renovated and wired for electric light for a residence for our Medical Health Officer, Dr. Windsor. This means that we shall be without a house for Mr. and Mrs. Bates. This leaves us in a quandary. Perhaps they could find a temporary above in town, but this would mean extra expense for somebody. I can see only one way out of our difficulty and that is the immediate erection of a suitable residence near the site of our proposed new school building. It would be well to point out this new development.\n\nFrom the above information it is quite clear that some immediate action will have to be taken to provide accommodation for the Farm Instructor, and as a residence at the School will be\nindispensable if we are to retain the services of the splendid man who now fills this position, I beg to request that a special effort be made to have this residence provided in the immediate future.\n\nI commend this request to your careful and sympathetic consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, March 7, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the advisability of providing, without delay, a farmer's residence at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that, on the 26th ultimo, Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina, was authorized to make the necessary arrangements at the earliest possible date, at an estimated cost of $4,500.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gibney, Principal of the Old Sun School, has directed the attention of our Commission to the need of a suitable shelter for the stock, in addition to the existing stock barn. He states that he has talked the matter over with Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham, who promised to take the matter up with your Department, and urge that a shelter about 75' long x 30' wide, with two 12' partitions under the same roof, be provided before next winter. He estimates the cost at approximately $385.00, this amount not including the cost of the partitions which should be made of planks, nor the cost of fencing.\n\nIn connection with this need, he also directs attention to the urgent need of more pasture land being attached to the school for the use of the school in the summer. Suitable pasture land is available, by extending the land already set apart for the use of the school, and I beg to recommend that you authorize Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham to arrange with the Principal for this extension.\n\nThe farming activities at this school are gradually developing into first class condition, and it will be an encouragement to the school management if the above needs, neither of which involve a very heavy expenditure, are provided.

He requests that a shelter about 75' long by 14' wide, with two 12' partitions under the same roof, be provided before next winter and estimates the cost at approximately, $385.00, this amount not including the cost of the partitions or the cost of any fencing required.\n\nDr. Westgate also directs attention to the need of more pasture land. He states that suitable pasture land is available by extending the land already set apart for the use of the school. I shall be pleased to have your views regarding the necessity for the erection of the shelter for the stock and the providing of more pasture land. If you approve of the above improvements being carried out, you should state the approximate cost of erecting the shelter with the necessary partitions and fencing and, also, furnish particulars in connection with the land required for pasture purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 104-1-5, dated the 5th June, in connection with a request made by the Principal of the Old Sun's School, at Gleichen, to be provided with a shelter for cattle and more pasture accommodation.\n\nI wish to inform you that I have had this matter investigated and I find that the School has about 35 head of cattle, and there is only room for 17 cows and some calves in the stable. As this institution is evidently depending considerably on their live stock, an outside shelter for the young stock is needed, and the cost of same would be somewhere in the neighborhood of what they estimate, namely $365.00, as this cost was figured out by the local carpenter. It might, of course, be built a little cheaper.\n\nExtra pasturage is also required, and there is an abundance of land available adjoining the school land on the south. There is a fractional part of a section there which would meet the requirements for the present time. This would take between 2\u00bd and 3 miles of fencing, which would cost in the neighborhood of $300.00 per material, and the work of erecting the fence might be done by the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 2nd instant, relative to the providing of a shelter for the cattle and more pasture accommodation at the Old Sun's School.\n\nRelative to the erection of a shelter, I have to say that you may arrange to have this accommodation for the cattle erected, and the cost should, if possible, not exceed the estimate furnished by the Principal, viz., $365, the work to be completed before the cold weather next Fall.\n\nRegarding the extra pasturage, would it be necessary to get the Indian Band to set aside the fractional part of a section for school purposes? If so, you should endeavour to secure the consent of the Band, and, when this is obtained, you may incur an expenditure of approximately $300 in providing the fencing material required to fence same. It is thought that the work of erecting the fence might be done by the school authorities.\n\nCertified accounts, in duplicate, covering any expenditure incurred for the above purposes should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This makes a flush front boiler giving most freedom for firing.\n\nAll firing and flue door frames have flanges within the openings to protect welded seams from cold air blasts.\n\nSUPREME BOILERS\u2014Are designed for 30 pounds steam pressure and are approved in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Saskatchewan for this pressure, other provinces approve the boiler for 15 pounds which is the maximum they allow on welded boilers.\n\nSpecial boilers are designed to suit conditions where standard boiler dimensions will not work in, provided that these conditions do not call for unbalanced design or sacrifice to boiler efficiency. Our engineering dept. will be pleased to give you information on proper settings for stokers or oil firing and any other advice on boilers or engineering in general.\nINGLIS SUPREME\nSteel Heating Boilers\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nTYPE \u2014 INGLIS SUPREME Steel Heating Boilers are made in three types: Class S for low-pressure steam heating with a maximum of 30 pounds working pressure, Class W for hot-water heating installations for any head up to 100 ft. and Class L for water, low type for any head up to 100 ft.\n\nUnless specially mentioned, these boilers will be equipped with shaking grates for hand firing and boiler mounted on cast-iron base. These boilers can be readily adapted for stokers or oil firing, in which case the grates are not supplied and a special base can be furnished to suit the application.\n\nBOILER \u2014 The boiler is of flange steel construction, electrically welded and thoroughly tested before shipment.\n\nThe fire box and combustion chamber are completely surrounded by water. Front end smoke box is set within the boiler shell, which eliminates the objectionable projection on front above firing doors.\n\nBASE \u2014 The base is of cast-iron in four sections and is fitted with shaking grates, bridge wall support, front ash and regulator doors, and rear cleanout door.\n\nDOORS \u2014 The firing and front cleanout doors with baffles are of cast-iron mounted on cast-iron frames studded to boiler front head.\n\nACCESSIBILITY \u2014 All tubes are cleaned from front end and no openings are placed on side of boiler, unless specially required so that boiler can be set against side wall if space is restricted.\n\nSee Dimension Tables on pages 6 to 11.\n\nFITTINGS \u2014 Each Class S Boiler is equipped with shaking grates, bridge wall fire brick, water column, water gauge, try cocks, steam gauge, safety valve, damper regulator, poker, rake, hoe and flue cleaner.\n\nClass W and L Boilers are equipped with shaking grates, bridge wall fire brick, poker, rake, hoe and flue cleaner.\n\nGUARANTEE \u2014 All INGLIS SUPREME Boilers are built to comply with interprovincial regulations and workmanship and performance guaranteed.\n### CLASS S STEAM HEATING\n\n| BOILER SIZE | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 |\n|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Length A    | 41| 47| 53| 52| 58| 58| 70 | 72 | 84 | 84 | 96 | 84 | 90 | 96 |\n| Width B     | 30| 39| 30| 36| 36| 39| 39 | 42 | 42 | 48 | 48 | 54 | 54 | 54 |\n| Height C    | 60| 60| 60| 66| 66| 75| 75 | 78 | 78 | 79 | 79 | 89 | 89 | 89 |\n| W.

This boiler\nis designed on the three pass principle of gas travel, and on\naccount of this long gas travel is more efficient than the\nusual type of heating boiler. The boiler is a self contained\nunit, and, after being set in place, requires only to be\ncovered with magnesia blocks or asbestos cement to a thickness\nof 1\u00bd to 2\". No brickwork is required for setting, except a\nfew firebrick for the bridge wall - which bricks are furnished\nwith the boiler.\n\nThe boiler is equipped with shaking grates, and\nthe regular steam trimmings. It is designed to conform to all\nProvincial boiler regulations, and is accepted by the Boiler\nInspection Branches throughout Canada for 15 pounds working\npressure.\n\nDuring the past year we have built and installed\nover two hundred \"SUPREME\" Boilers.\nTORONTO: Ont. 14th September, 1929.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\n--- 2 ---\n\nWe would like to have your permission to use \"SUPREME\" Boilers in the above mentioned Schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nTHE JOHN INGLIS CO. LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\nPresident.\n\nM/T.\nEnc.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and have duly noted your instructions regarding the old ruin, and your invitation to submit a recommendation regarding the water supply system for the new building.\n\nOn the 5th inst. I wired you McQueen's tender of $1200.00 for the removal of the debris, the breaking off of the concrete walls below grade, and the filling in and levelling of the old basement. I received no reply to said wire. Since sending that quotation\u2014which was the best I had received at that time\u2014I have been able to get a much better figure from the contractors, through their local sup't, Mr. Ducharme. At first these people would not undertake this work at all, stating they had enough on their hands without it, but yesterday they agreed to tackle it on the understanding that they might do it at once, using surplus earth from the new excavation for filling in the old basement, and at a price of $500.00. After consultation with Mr. Gooderham, I decided to anticipate the Department's acceptance of this figure, and notified the contractors accordingly. This is much cheaper than we could possibly get this work done afterwards. I had previously accepted the only offer I could get for the twisted and tangled mass of ironwork, viz $50.00, from the Calgary Scrap Iron Co., and they now have their men at work removing the debris, and shipping it away. This reduces the prime cost of disposing of the old ruin to $450.00.\n\nI enclose photos of the old ruin, from which you will see that there is an enormous amount of difficult work in removing the wreckage, breaking off the concrete walls, and filling in. The contractors now have a gang of hardy Frenchmen at work breaking off the walls, using Roman battering-rams, screw-jacks, sledges and levers. Earth from the new excavation is being dumped into the old basement as fast as the walls can be broken off and the debris removed.\n\nRegarding the water supply system, I may say that in the\nOriginal recommendations which were sent you last December, it was suggested that a tower and tank be installed similar in principle to those provided on the Blood Reserve, but as we are getting a building of fire-proof construction, it does not seem necessary to have so large a reservoir of water on hand. A 2500 gal tank previously authorized for Old Suns School is lying in the town here, and this tank should meet the ordinary requirements of the school. Unless otherwise instructed, I shall have it set up in the chamber marked \"Pump Room\" in the basement plan, and connected to the existing well. As this tank is of 6' diameter, and 15' in length, it is too long for the room in which it should be placed, so I propose extending the length of the pump room 4 or 5 ft., which will then leave the usual walking room in front, and accessibility all around it for inspection or repair. The extended wall will jut out from the main wall of that area, thus requiring 2 or 3 extra steel joists. The window will be moved out also, and will have a reinforced concrete beam over, and brickwork on either side and below, so that if ever the tank should require to be replaced, a suitable outside opening could be readily made by removing a small amount of brickwork instead of having to cut through a concrete wall.\n\nWith reference to the source of water supply, I should have preferred having the well come right in the pump room so that the entire service could have been under the one roof, but there is not time to have a new well drilled now without tying up the job, even if a well-drilling outfit were immediately available. I am therefore arranging to utilize the existing well in the old basement, and am having the contractor carry up a suitable concrete foundation from the former basement level to the level of the surrounding grade, on which we shall afterwards build a small well-house to house the pumping plant yet to be provided. You will readily understand that it is necessary to carry up this concrete foundation previous to the filling in of the old basement in order to avoid building on newly filled ground. The water will be conveyed from the pumping plant through an underground pipe to the pressure tank in the pump room of the new building.\n\nI am gathering data on the most suitable type of motor-driven, deep-well pumping outfit, and shall make this service the subject of another letter. The contractors are installing a temporary pump for their own requirements.\n\nThe new excavation is well under way, temporary buildings are nearly completed, and excellent gravel is being hauled for the concrete. The weather is fine, but windy, and this morning we had a dust-blizzard of glorious proportions!\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: Dept. of Construction]\nMR WYNDELS PRESIDENT AND MANAGER OF CONSTRUCTION COMPANY DIED SATURDAY NIGHT WINNIPEG HOSPITAL, AM ADVISED WILL NOT INTERRUPT BUILDING UNDERTAKING.

Ducharme,\n\nThe contractors' superintendent, at present in charge of his firm's interests here, informs me that they have had very unsatisfactory results with gypsum partitions in a previous job. He states that their Mr. Wyndels intended writing you on the subject, but owing to his illness in the hospital at present, the letter may not have been written. His objections to gypsum partitions are that it is flimsy, plaster adheres poorly and cracks develop badly, and door frames soon become insecure unless framing is carried up to the ceilings. He suggests ordinary hollow tile partitions in place of gypsum. I promised to pass his views on to you, but told him that unless you authorize a change we must adhere to the specifications in this regard.\n\nMr. Ducharme also asks if the stucco walls leading to the Chapel are to be of frame construction, or if you intend these walls to be of fire-proof construction too; and in the latter case, what material do you wish used?\n\nThe excavating is nearly completed, and a start will soon be made on the concrete. The adjoining old ruin is being demolished and surplus earth is being used for filling and levelling. We are carrying up concrete walls, 10' x 10', enclosing the former well, on which to erect the future pump house, as indicated in my letter of the 11th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S.

BONIFACE\nMANITOBA\n\nSeptember the 16th 1929.\n\nMr R.J.Orr\nChief Architect\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA?Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI feel deeply sorry to inform you that Mr F.Wyndels, President and Manager of the Wyndels Construction Co., Ltd., passed away Saturday night at 6.10 p.m. at the St.Boniface Hospital.\n\nMr Wyndels had been confined to the Hospital for the last two weeks and was operated on during the past week; it was then found out that he could not recover from his illness.\n\nIn connection with the construction of the Old Sun School, at Gleichen, we must say that it is the intention of our Superintendent, Mr J.Ducharme, and also of the writer, to do our very best for the satisfactory construction and completion of the above school, just as we have promised Mr Wyndels a few days before his passing away.\n\nYours very truly,\nWYNDELS CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. DeBuick\nOld Sun School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSept., 5th, 1929.\n\nStatement of Salary allowance for assistance for Mrs. Gibney at the North Camp Day School in the preparation of mid-day meals. Present assistant is Norah Monroe (half breed).\n\nSept 5th Salary allowance for the month of September, .................. $10.00\n\nN.B. If this allowance could be increased to $20.00 per month, it would be appreciated. Mrs. Gibney is at present augmenting the above allowance out of her own pocket.\n\nPrincipal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\n[Signature]\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr Ferrier.\n\nAn allowance of $10.00 per month is made to pay the service of the cook who prepares the mid-day meal at the Gleichen temporary day school.\n\nThe meal is needed for the pupils as the parents do not understand the lunch idea\u2014and in many cases they are nearly destitute and the mixed diet at the school keeps the children well and strong.\n\nWe supply a cook car and certain supplies while Mrs Gibney with a maid have done the work. Mrs Gibney has a large family and cannot continue this work since there are 20 to 40 pupils to feed.\n\nI recommend that $20.00 be allowed to pay the wages of the cook. It is little enough and it is not fair to ask the Gibneys to meet part of this from private sources.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the monthly allowance for the services of the cook who prepares the midday meal at the Gleichen (temporary) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your recommendation as to the number of pupils for whom it is necessary to prepare the midday meal, and the work entailed, the Department will approve of an allowance for this service at the rate of $20 per month from the 1st of October, next. You should prepare and forward, at the end of each month, a voucher at this rate in favour of the Indian woman who does the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns Indian School.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYesterday I issued Certificate No.1 to Wyndels Construction Co., Ltd. for $6862.50, in payment of 90% of the value of labour and materials supplied by them to date on the above-mentioned work. I have asked for the usual segregated Estimate totalling the amount of their tender, and when this is received I shall send you a copy. The excavation is completed, the footings run, and today the concrete foundation walls are being poured. Also, they have erected an unusually fine winter camp, and have several carloads of materials on hand.\n\nOn the 16th inst. I wired the Department conveying the Reverend Principal's request for a private garage under the new residence, and asking for a decision. No reply came. We are making the necessary provision in the concrete wall so that in the event of the Principal's request being granted there will be no cutting of concrete for the doorway.\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 13th instant, will you please instruct me concerning the matters brought up in that letter.\n\nIs it your intention that the walls of Principal's basement be plastered, or just left with the tile walls exposed? The contractors state that they figured on plastering the stairway to basement only.\n\nWill you kindly send me a set of Plans and Specifications, and the usual assortment of stationery.\n\nOur weather is very cool, and snow seems imminent.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nR.

The instructions contained therein have been duly noted.\n\nWe shall change the stucco walls leading to Chapel from stucco to brick veneer and 4\" tile. I have wired the Truscon Steel Co., of Winnipeg, notifying them of this change, so that the I Beams will be of sufficient strength to carry the slightly added load; also I asked them to send an extra I.Beam to span over the Servery where there is no carrying wall.\n\nBoth the Indian Agent and the Reverend Principal have requested that full size screens be placed over all windows, instead of the half-screens specified for most windows. The special reason for this request is that the locality is subject to bad hail storms, and that the windows would have been smashed several times in recent years, and particularly on one occasion, had it not been for the full-size screens used on the former building. The contractors quote an extra price of $250.00 for full size screens throughout. Will you please instruct me in this regard.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is very desirous that \"accordeon\" doors be installed instead of a solid partition separating the Boys' Class Rooms, the reason being that at times the entire space will be needed for concert and other purposes. The accordeon doors would slide back in two sections, from the central column, thus leaving the two class rooms as one large auditorium. The contractors' quotation for making the change is $527.00, and I should like your early decision with reference to this request.\n\nEnclosed please find a list of \"NOTES\" pertaining to the new building, and which embody suggestions and requests emanating from the Principal after a careful scrutiny of the plans. Many of the items on the list are more or less trivial; and the cost of some of the things asked for can be met by savings in other items, as in Item 3. It would take too long to go over this list in detail, but you will understand them at a glance, and if there are any items unacceptable to you, will you kindly notify me to that effect.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nP.O. Box 31.\nGleichen, Alta. Oct. 1st, 1929.\n\nThe Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns School, Gleichen Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nThere seems to be some difficulty in understanding just what finish the various floors are to receive. Would it be asking too much for you to amplify the Specifications in this regard?\n\nThe Reverend Principal asked me today if it would not be possible to provide a soft water cistern to receive the rain water from the roofs of the laundry and chapel. He states it is not only desirable to have some soft water for the laundry but that it is essential that water other than the well water be available for the heating boilers on account of the soda content in the well water causing the heating boilers to foam and blow off through the safety valves. In the past it has been necessary to haul river water for the heating boilers and laundry boiler, which was found a great inconvenience. It is considered that a 2000 gal. concrete tank placed underground outside the laundry, with pumping connection in the laundry and overflow to drain, would meet the requirements. The cost of a soft water supply as indicated would be about $300.00. If authorized, I could have it installed while other concrete work is being performed. Will you please instruct me in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nR GUERNY ORR\n\nDOMINION GOVERNMENT ARCHITECT OTTAWA ONT\n\nRE LAUNDRY MACHINERY FOR GLEICHEN AND PUNNICHY WILL YOU KINDLY WRITE US AT ONCE GIVING US SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS EQUIPMENT AS THERE IS SOME MISUNDERSTANDING AS TO WHETHER WASH TUMBLER AND EXTRACTOR SHOULD BE BELT DRIVEN OR MOTOR DRIVEN\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LTD\nGLEICHEN, Alberta.

With reference to item number 13 v-joint may be used in place of balustrades.\n\nWith reference to your inquiry regarding the finishing of floors on page 93 it states that all basement floors shall be finished as before specified, which refers to page 19 of the specifications where it states that all rooms in basement, except where concrete floors are indicated terrazzo flooring shall be laid. Referring again to page 93 all remaining floors in the building shall be finished with terrazzo with the exception of the following rooms; staff bedrooms, office, store rooms, and closets. These rooms shall be finished in cement.\n\nI have had a telegram from Stanley Brock with reference to the laundry machinery. There seems to be some misunderstanding. It was my intention that the laundry machinery at the school be operated by electric motors as there is power available.\n\nAs requested I am sending you, under separate cover, a supply of stationary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

The swinging extension of the carrier pulled out of its fastening on the barn. This was not well secured.\n\nI have asked Mr. Gardner-Smith look at it and he suggests the erection of a trestle at the extreme end of the carrier and that the trestle be strong and imbedded in concrete. This would relieve the barn of the strain which it bears at the present time.\n\nMr. Gardner Smith estimates the cost of labour and material to put the carrier in repair at $40.00 and recommends that the work be done now as there is available labour on the job under construction. I agree with Mr. Gardner-Smith and beg to recommend the repairs.

Their Superintendent, Mr. MacKinnon, seems to be under the impression that the fire escape shown and specified in the plans and specifications had reference to the original type of building intended, and not to the present fire-proof construction, and that they may now be omitted. I told Mr. MacKinnon that I had no authority for deviating from the original specifications in this regard, but would refer the matter to you. Please advise me in the matter promptly. Should the fire escape be omitted, we should place windows where the door exits are shown.\n\nThe contractors' St. Boniface office has written to me that telegrams and letters to Ottawa on the matter of authorizing the design of the heating boilers have not been answered, and as these boilers are yet to be manufactured, it is important to have an early decision, hence my letter on the subject to you this morning.\n\nThe work is making good progress, the concrete walls are completed, and yesterday a start was made on the brickwork. I enclose 3 or 5 snapshots taken about a week ago, and shall send others as the work progresses.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nOct. 11, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the new Old Sun's School, the plans and specifications call for installation of fire escapes, and the Department will expect the contractor to install these.\n\nI expect to leave around the twentieth for the West and will, in all probability, see you at the Old Sun's School around the last of the month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

The gypsum is mixed with a special mineralized fiber board, forming a tough, flexible blackboard surface. This thickness possesses all of the inherent properties of the natural slate.\n\nSlaterock Blackboards are true and straight and will not warp, crack, or buckle. Changes in temperature or excessive moisture cannot affect them. They maintain their original shape and appearance. Because it is made from natural materials, Slaterock is impervious to moisture, and in the event of fire, it will not produce any smoke or fumes.\n\nThe Writing Surface\n\nThe writing surface of Slaterock is protected by a tough, flexible coating of a series of heavy layers of a unique composition which is applied to a uniform, hard, velvety writing surface. This makes Slaterock a dull blue-black chalkboard which is extremely smooth, wonderfully long-lasting and easy to write on. The writing surface is maintained by frequent tests of the writing quality and the overall appearance of the boards. Although Slaterock is treated with a protective coating, two coats of waterproofing are applied to the back of each board to prevent water from penetrating the board.\n\nLengths & Feet\n\nSlaterock Blackboards are made in standard widths of 3', 5', 6', 8', 10', 12', 14', 16', 18', 20' (from 1' to 2'). Any desired length will be cut to order. Each board is cut to fit exactly as a full length. Always state width and lengths when ordering. For example, \"Cut 10' long, no easy to cut, we recommend ordering in long lengths to avoid cutting waste. Weight, crated, about $1 per sq. ft., depending on size. Available in 1\" thickness in black, green or brown.\n\nSlaterock can be used on any kind of wall stone, brick, plaster, boards, etc. It has been successfully installed by anyone. As there is no contraction or expansion necessary in applying each board, no special tools are necessary in applying moulding to Slaterock surfaces. If necessary, Slaterock can be nailed all around. Simple directions for installing Slaterock are sent with each order.\n\nGUARANTEE\n\nWe guarantee every sheet of SLATEROCK Blackboard to be equal in quality to any sample (since samples are cut from odds and ends of regular stock). If properly installed and cared for, it will give entire satisfaction for a period of many years, and in most instances will last the life of the building.\n\nBECKLEY-CARDY COMPANY\nManufacturers School Equipment and Supplies\n17-21 East 23rd Street\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS\nSlatoplate Blackboard\n\nManufactured and Guaranteed by Beckley-Cardy Company\n\nA Dependable Blackboard\n\nForty years of use in schools is conclusive proof of the usefulness of wood-pulp blackboards. In that time they have been used successfully in every type of school building. Made in plates or slabs up to 12 feet in one piece. Sample mailed free upon request.\n\nHow It Is Made\n\nThe base foundation of Slatoplate Blackboard is made from pure pine and other pure wood fibers. These long, tough, very strong fibers are treated with a special process which hardens and strengthens them. The result is scientifically kiln-dried, waterproofed, and extremely tough. The result is a board which is stiffer, harder, stronger and more dependable than any other blackboards. A strong statement, but a true one.\n\nMore Durable\n\nMost common blackboards are four-ply. Slatoplate Blackboard is five-ply and will therefore last longer under normal use. Some boards are so soft that you can easily dent them with a pencil. When pressure will open up their corners. Slatoplate is made from long, tough wood fibers and the greater pressure with which they are treated makes them extremely hard. They do not split even, and the board has a smooth, clean writing surface. The board contains no irresponsible (old news) or dirty material. It is clean, smooth, and white. Take a knife and cut a sample of Slatoplate. You will find that it cuts like a knife through butter. Most boards are cut with a ragged edge.\n\nVery Strong\n\nNo other board has so many distinctive qualities. No other manufacturer urges you to test our product. We produce by an old trick that you can make. Throw a piece of Slatoplate down on the floor and hear its sound. Then try to break it. If it does not break, it is strong. If it does break, it is weak.\n\nSlatoplate is the best Wood-Pulp Blackboard manufactured. Made at Chicago and carried in stock for prompt shipment.\n\nThe Writing Surface\n\nSlatoplate writing surface is hard, close-grained, and of an even, uniform color. It is the closest thing to a polished blackboard which is prepared in our own plant and applied by experts. The last coat is a fine, smooth, writing surface which makes for rapid, legible writing. The surface is hard enough to take a distinct mark. It erases easily and will not pit, peel, check, nor wear shiny. It will not show dirt or smudges. It is protected by its splendid writing surface under the most adverse conditions. The writing surface is applied to the back. Slatoplate is guaranteed for ten years, but frequently outlasts the building.\n\nBECKLEY-CARDY COMPANY\nManufacturers School Equipment and Supplies\n17-21 East 23rd Street\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS\n\nGUARANTEE\n\nWe guarantee every sheet of Slatoplate Blackboard to be equal in quality to any sample (since samples are cut from width ends of regular stock), and to give entire satisfaction for a period of ten years of ordinary schoolroom usage.\n\nColors\n\nSlatoplate is made in three colors: Black, Green, and Brown. Blue is shipped unless otherwise specified.\n\nLengths to 12 Feet\n\nSlatoplate Blackboard is made in standard widths of 2 ft., 3 ft., and 4 feet, and in lengths of from 6 ft. to 12 ft. Each length will fit, but a fraction of a foot in length is charged for each additional length wanted.\n\nSince Slatoplate Blackboard is so easily cut, we recommend ordering in long pieces to assure proper fit and prevent waste.\n\nSlatoplate will stick to any kind of a wall\u2014brick, plaster, rough boards, or directly over old blackboards. You can put it on any wall. Simply put it on the wall and nail the moulding strips. It is easily and quickly installed. Simple directions for installing Slatoplate are sent with each order.\n\nPrices\n\nSlatoplate costs no more than ordinary blackboards. We make sure that every piece is thoroughly tested before shipment.

You will find SIMPLEX and DUPLEX Bulletin Boards quality products of proven reliability, making appropriate companions for our Slatchestos, Slatrock and Slatoplate blackboards.\n\nBulletin Boards are as essential as blackboards and should meet certain definite requirements to give the utmost in satisfaction. The peculiar structure of the special cork composition used in the construction of SIMPLEX and DUPLEX bulletin and tack boards makes them always satisfactory. Thumbtacks can be easily pushed into the cork, held securely and can be removed readily. The special cork surface does not show holes when tacks are removed.\n\nBulletin boards are usually installed as shown in illustration on page 1\u2014above the blackboard in strips and at the ends of the blackboard in panels. They protect your blackboard from being used as a background for pinning and pasting pictures, which practically ruins the blackboard and makes unsightly schoolrooms as well.\n\nSIMPLEX and DUPLEX Bulletin Boards do not warp, curl, check or buckle and when soiled can be cleaned easily with soap and water.\n\n**Simplex Bulletin and Tack Boards**\n\nMade from best quality cork board one-quarter inch thick, cemented to heavy burlap backing. Installed in hundreds of schoolrooms. Furnished in 6 in., 9 in., 12 in. and 18 in. widths. Cut to fit spaces any length. Easy to install and will last forever.

In fact, it actually becomes tougher and harder the longer it is used.\n\nSlatebestos is as hard as rock, possesses extreme density with almost no expansion. It is built solid throughout its full 3/16 inch thickness.\n\nPerfect Writing Surface\n\nThe writing surface of Slatebestos is produced through a series of sound blackboard surfacing coats, which penetrate the body of the board. The method is to apply each coat and then rub it down, thus having the result of a velvety, velvet-like, non-reflecting, dark slate color writing surface.\n\nThe result is ideal for rapid, legible writing. The chalk marking surface contains just enough \"bite\" to cut crayons, without noise and\u7559\u4e0b a clean, white sharp mark, which can be plainly seen from all parts of the schoolroom without eyestrain. Erasures can be made easily and rapidly.\n\nJust a few of the many good reasons why Slatebestos has the advantage over other types of Blackboards\n\nMORE ENDURING: Slatebestos actually improves with age. It will render years of satisfactory service. Due to the fact that Slatebestos and cement materials is the greatest fire-resisting and enduring blackboard on the market today.\n\nNO BREAKAGE: Because Slatebestos possesses elasticity, it is subject to practically no breakage. Users of natural slate know from experience a shipment seldom arrives in perfect condition, with consequent delays, expense and annoyance.\n\nLONGER LENGTHS: Slatebestos is manufactured in long lengths up to 8 feet. Hence it requires fewer joints and is assured of a more continuous and better writing surface.\n\nLOW UPKEEP: Slatebestos surface is perfect and uniform, and remains so indefinitely. Refinishing is infrequent and far less costly than slate. When necessary it can be done at a very small expense. Cost of maintenance is reduced to a minimum.\n\nPRICES\n\n| Price Per Square Foot | F.

Your cost of installation is much less. But you get nearly a part of the actual saving. You pay freight on two-thirds less weight. There is little or no breakage, no inconvenience, no delays. And above all you have a better blackboard.\n\nSlatebestos is made in standard widths of 3\u00bd and 4 feet, and in any length up to and including 8 feet. Any desired length will be cut, but a fraction of a foot is charged as a full foot. Slatebestos is 3/16 inch thick and weighs 2\u00bd lbs. to the square foot.\n\nSlatebestos can be installed over any kind of even wall of plaster, stone, brick or tile. Joints can be made secure with Special Joining Strips, so that writing over them is always possible, thus forming a continuous writing surface.\n\nWe furnish complete directions for the installation of Slatebestos\u2014directions so simple that it is possible for any one to install it.\n\nSlatebestos is carried in stock in Chicago and immediate shipments are assured.\n\nWe have a thoroughly efficient Service Department competent to advise in all questions pertaining to blackboards.

However, with the advent of December came snow and cold weather, and we are now in the grip of the worst storm yet experienced since the job started. For a full week the temperatures have been sub-zero, reaching 18 degrees below zero last night. To-day at 3:30 P.M., the thermometer is at 8 below, with a cutting north wind, and light snow falling.\n\nThe outside brickwork is temporarily halted by the cold weather. Most of the outside brick walls are completed, including the walls of chapel, laundry, both wings, and residence, but the last storey of the main building is not much more than started, and the chimneys are yet to be built. The bricklayers are now erecting the tile partitions in the basement, and to-morrow will start erecting the gypsum partitions in the residence. Storm sash have been placed in most of the window openings, and several coke-burning heaters have been set up, and a working temperature is thus obtainable for some of the inside mason work.\n\nThe heating boilers arrived a few days ago, and were got into place yesterday. The openings which had been left to admit the expected Spencer boilers proved inadequate for the boilers supplied, and considerable cutting of brickwork was inevitable to get them in. This was carefully done, and will be restored without detriment to the building. The heating boilers seem fully satisfactory, being much like the Birchfield boilers in use at the Lytton school, and are the product of the Vulcan Iron Works, of Winnipeg. The hot water storage tank and 10 H.P. high pressure boiler have also arrived, and it is proposed to utilize the latter boiler for temporary heat until the large heating boilers can be made ready.\n\nThe roofing contractor is also here, and to-day is laying the roofing paper over the residence, but I am advising him to await more moderate weather before starting on any\nI am afraid of subsequent buckling of the roofing if laid in extremely cold weather.\n\nThe electrical sub-contractor is carrying along his work well, and keeping ahead of the trades which will follow.\n\nThe plumber is also well along with his roughing-in, and doing good work. I made a water test of his work as far as it was ready, and there was not a single leak.\n\nThe heating contractor's men were here some time in advance of the arrival of the boilers, and have the steam mains in place all through the basement, and are now making the connections to the boilers. The Trane heating specialties will be used on this job. I should have preferred the Dunham, but had no ground for refusing the Trane.\n\nThe concrete slabs have been run on all floors, and at present look satisfactory, but I shall examine them more closely when heat is available, and the frost driven out of the building. Should there be any faulty spots, I shall have them relaid in respect of same.\n\nThe roofs are all sheeted in, and ready for the tar and gravel, with the exception of the main building, as already mentioned.\n\nThe gypsum tile has been delivered in the building. I am in communication with the gypsum manufacturers, and have their detailed specifications for erection of same, which we shall endeavour to follow to the letter.\n\nThe rate of progress has inevitably slowed down in consequence of the extreme weather we are now experiencing, but we're hoping for the early arrival of a Chinook, and then we should be able to get back into high gear again.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nWYNDELS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD.\n\nIndian Education Vote\n\nST.

NICHOLSON, ESQ.\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN. December 19, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my visit to the Old Sun School on November 1st last, my attention was directed to the need of a new switch for the electric motor in the sun-house of the stock barn, and also for the need of a heater to warm the motor in cold weather. I was informed that much difficulty was experienced in getting the motor heated effectively in the colder weather which had then set in, and also when on my way to the Carcross school in the bush and could not take the matter up with you myself, I suggested that this need be made known to the Indian Agent with a request that he should take any further action necessary.\n\nAs the motor has been installed on the wall of the sun-house at about 7' from the floor, it was suggested to me that it should be lowered to the floor, and also that a pump jack should be installed to take the place of the 12' pull rod which causes sufficient strain to put the motor out of commission prematurely. If you have not yet received any communication from Mr. Indian Agent Godberham in connection with these matters, I shall be deeply obliged if you will take them up with him at your earliest convenience and authorize him to effect any changes or improvements which he may consider necessary.\n\nWhile visiting this school, I went carefully over the farm instructor's cottage, which your Department so kindly provided, and was very much pleased with the same. There were a few improvements such as storm windows for the basement, the placing of some of the windows in the sun-room on hinges, etc., which had not been provided, and I referred these to the Inspector of Construction on the new school for reference to you for further consideration.\n\nThe Farm Instructor, Mr. Bates, who is one of our most competent appointees for the position he holds, presented a strong request that the cottage be linked up with the water system of the main school building, and I undertook to refer the\nrequest to you and ask for your favourable consideration of the same. Speaking for myself personally, I beg to state that I consider the request altogether reasonable. I do not know of any staff agent at our Society's Schools who is better entitled to the comfort which a bath would furnish than the farm instructor. In the cultivating and harvesting periods, he must frequently return from his work in a very labour-sodden condition and one can easily understand what a bath would mean to him at such a time. As matters stand at present, he is left without either a bath, or water for bathing purposes, or for the numerous household requirements unless it is carried in pails by himself or the bigger boy pupils from the main School building. I shall be very grateful, therefore, if you will reconsider this matter and grant the farm instructor's request to have a bath installed and the water laid on from the main school supply system.\n\nI should like to make the same request with regard to the Farm Instructor's cottage at our Blood School. At the Blood School there is a room with a bath in it, but the building has never been linked up with the main School's water system. The expense involved at either school would be a very little, and I am of the opinion that if your Department supplied the materials, the school management would undertake the work of installation.\n\nWith the compliments of the season,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.\nCERTIFICATE\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCertificate No. 5\n\nGleichen, Alta.

Box 31,\nGleichen, Alta. Dec. 23, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns School, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you I have issued a 5th Certificate, for $19,440.00, to Wyndels Construction Co., general contractors for the above building, in payment of 90% of the value of labour and materials supplied by them on their contract to date.\n\nI enclose a copy of the contractors' 5th Progress Estimate, which shows how the amount of the Certificate was arrived at.\n\nAs advised in my Report of the 11th instant, the work of construction had slowed down in consequence of severe wintry weather, and this condition has been continuous since. No outside brickwork worth mentioning has been done during the past fortnight, and there still remains to be done the carrying up of the top storey of the central portion of the main building, and the completion of the chimneys. A week or ten days of suitable weather should enable the outside brickwork to be completed.\n\nThe erection of the interior tile and gypsum partitions is completed, except for the unfinished portion of the main building. We followed the manufacturers' specifications closely, and it looks as if we have a satisfactory job. This work was done by the bricklayers when the inclement weather stopped outside work, and a limited amount of temporary heat was supplied by a number of coke-burning heaters.\n\nThe roofing sub-contractor made a start, and laid the roof over the Principal's residence, but I then stopped him as I was afraid of the roofing buckling afterwards when laid in very cold, stormy weather. He was a real Spartan for tackling it when he did. All the roofs are sheeted in readiness for the tar-and-gravel roofing, with the exception of the before-mentioned central portion.\n\nThe weather has recently moderated, and Chinook breezes have\n2.\n\nCommenced to blow, so I trust better conditions for outside work will soon prevail. Deep snow covers the prairies.\n\nWith the exception of 10 labourers and a foreman, the rest of the crew have migrated to their various homes for Christmas and New Year, so there will not be very much advancement made until after the New Year. I shall spend Christmas Day at my home in Calgary.\n\nThe heating and laundry boilers are now in position, but the first steam heat will come from the high pressure laundry boiler, which will be temporarily connected to the steam mains.\n\nAfter the New Year, weather permitting, the work will again be speeded up.\n\nWishing everybody at the Department's headquarters the compliments of the Season,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, December 3, 1929.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nKindly have arrangements made for the purchase of the electric refrigeration plant for the Old Sun's school, at Gleichen, from the Bruce Robinson Electric Company, Limited, of Calgary, Alta.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nDEC. 6, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWhen the time comes to arrange for the installation of the refrigerating plant at the new Old Sun's School, I would ask you to please obtain from the Bruce Robinson Electric Company, Ltd. of Calgary, a price for the complete installation of a suitable plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Gardner Smith, Esq.,\nGlenichen, Alta.\nDecember 18th, 1929\n\nMr. Smith,\nInspector Old Sun School\nGlenchen, Alta.\n\nOLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding our conversation re float traps on the end of the mains in the above named school, we have talked this over with the Dunham Co. and also the Trane Company representatives in this City and they are under the impression that it would be advisable to use traps on the end of each separate circuit.\n\nOn using traps on the end of each circuit we are going to keep the steam in the mains for a longer period than if we leave the ends open as shown on the plans.\n\nWe are under the impression that No. 22 traps would be of ample capacity to take care of each circuit. These traps have an inlet and an outlet of one inch and the cost per No. 22 trap and strainer would be $37.50 each.\n\nTrusting this is the information that you require and that you can arrange to have these traps installed on the end of the circuits, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nJEAN J.

Daoust, Limited, of St. Boniface, Man., in which he refers to the advisability of installing float traps on the ends of the steam mains.\n\nMr. Couture called my attention to this feature when he visited the job two or three weeks ago, and I then asked him to go into the matter with the Dunham Co.'s engineer in Winnipeg, and with the Trane Co.'s representative, and to ascertain if in their opinion these additional specialties were needed, and then to write me. The enclosed letter is the result of the conference.\n\nMr. Couture claims that too much steam will be lost from the mains, and pass down into the returns, if the said float traps are not used. This is a highly technical point which heating engineers can best advise upon, in the light of their experience elsewhere.\n\nWill you please wire me on receipt of this letter, advising me whether you approve the heating contractors recommendation, and I will give orders in accordance with your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\n| DATE       | ARTICLE          | FOLIO | CREDIT | DEBIT | TOTAL |\n|------------|------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Nov 2      | 38 loaves        |       |        |       | 88v   |\n| 12         | 6 loaves         |       |        |       | 62v   |\n|            |                  |       |        |       | 150v  |\n|            |                  |       |        |       | 220v  |\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT\n\nBy Signature\n\nEXAMINED BY\n\nSignature\nIndian Education Vote\n\nOffice of the Blackfoot Indian Agency.\n\nJanuary 8, 1930\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 432 & 433, amounting to $25.35 in favour of R.

Jan. 20, 1930.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nDuring a recent visit to the building, Mr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, urged the desirability of installing the necessary wiring so that an electric range might be used in the Principal's residence. He mentioned that the Reserve is being brought under a much lower cost of electric current than before, and that, in his opinion, advantage should be taken of the lower rate in the instance mentioned, especially as the residence kitchen is rather small.\n\nUnder the new contract with the Calgary Power Co., the school will get a \"commercial rate\" of current, which will run from 5\u00a2 to 10\u00a2 per KWH, according to amount used, and Mr. Gooderham thinks the school will earn the minimum 5\u00a2 rate during at least part of the year. For power purposes (laundry, pumping, etc) a power rate lower in cost than the commercial rate will obtain.\n\nThe contractors quote a price of $120.23 for running a feed from the distribution panel in the tank room connecting up with the power service, including all labor and materials, and making connection to the electric range in the Principal's kitchen. This would give the lower power rate, and would probably average out about 2\u00a2 per KWH less than the commercial rate.\n\nAs an alternative, the contractors quote a price of $75.51 for running a feed from the main lighting panel in the Principal's office to the Principal's kitchen, making necessary connections, etc. This would come under the commercial rate.\n\nThe Rev. Principal asked me to mention that in the event of the Department sanctioning the proposal of the electric range, he will be willing to omit the usual range boiler in his kitchen, which he estimates will make a saving of about $40.00, the saving to be applied against the suggested extra wiring. Also, he states he would engage to pay the difference between the cost of the ordinary kitchen range and an electric range.\n\nI promised the Indian Agent and the Rev. Principal that I would refer the matter to you for decision, and I would ask that you please wire a reply. In the event of this request being granted I want to have the wiring done ahead of the lathing and plastering.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC R'Y.

MacKenzie.\nConstruction Office, Old Suns School,\nGleichen, Alta. Jan. 23, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nREPORT ON OLD SUNS SCHOOL, GLEICHEN.\n\nSince my last Report the progress of construction has been greatly retarded by the extremely cold weather. Sub-zero temperatures, with snow and wind, have been almost continuous, reaching 45 degrees below zero. The result was we could not complete the brickwork of the central portion of the main building, or do any other outside work. The bricklayers have been idle for weeks. About three days ago the temperature commenced to moderate, and today at 2 P.M. the thermometer is at 26 degrees above zero, and our full crew of bricklayers are again at work. By the end of this week the top storey of the central part should be finished. The brickwork then to be completed will be the setting of all the coping stones, the completion of the front verandah and sun-parlour, the completion of the main chimney (about half up now), the kitchen chimney, the topping off of the ventilating flues, the cleaning off of the face brickwork, the building of the stair walls, and the laying of the enamel brick in the kitchen and scullery.\n\nThe heating contractor made an attempt to supply temporary heat in a good part of the building. He first tried the high pressure laundry boiler, but found he could not hold the water in the boiler, and lost a couple of days experimenting. He then had a temporary breeching made locally, and hooked up one of the large boilers, but again he could not hold the water, so had to have water hauled six miles from the river in 30 below zero weather, and fill the boiler with the river water instead of that from the well. Since then he has been able to deliver a fair amount of heat into the greater part of the building, and the various workmen were thus enabled to carry on. At present a number of radiators are connected on all but the top floor of the main building, and comfortable working temperatures prevail.\n\nThe gypsum partitions have been erected throughout except the top floor, and we appear to have a good job done. I received from the manufacturers detailed specifications and\nexplicit directions, which we followed to the letter. Of course it is too soon to tell how this material holds up, especially with regard to plaster cracks as complained of elsewhere. In the basement, as previously authorized, we built the partition walls of clay tile; and on the other floors we used clay tile for the bottom course because of its less porous surface for taking the concrete base.\n\nThe plumbing contractor has his roughing-in well advanced and in so far as I have yet been able to test his work it is well done, with tight joints, and neat workmanship. We are putting in the stand-pipe system just the same as called for in the specifications except I have asked for an extension of the feedline so that the protection will be available in both the top dormitories. We have connected the temporary pumping plant to the permanent pressure tank in the building, and find there is a small leak at one of the rivetted seams. If this leak does not take up I shall have a welder come and stop the leak by brazing the seam at the leaky spot.\n\nThree painters are now at work glazing and painting the sash. They seem competent workmen, and are using good materials.\n\nThe plastering contractor has not yet arrived, and we saw in the paper an account of his being held up in Winnipeg just after he had drawn about $700.00 for the pay-roll of the plastering labour at the Brandon Indian school, and robbed of this large sum at the point of the gun. The plaster material has been delivered, and much of the building is now ready for lathing.\n\nThe roofer came at the commencement of the very cold weather, and made a start at laying the tar-and-gravel roofing, but after he had finished the roof of the Principal's residence I stopped him as I deemed it impossible to get good work done in such cold stormy weather. Word was wired to Winnipeg last night reporting milder weather, and asking that the roofing work be now proceeded with. This work must be done before it will be safe to start plastering.\n\nWeather permitting, good progress should be made from now on. It is rather early to hazard an opinion as to when the job will be completed, but it looks at present that it will run into April.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

The long-continued cold weather of December and January is now being followed by mild Chinook days, and all work is being speeded up in consequence. The outside brickwork is almost completed, and the tar-and-gravel roofing is now being laid under favourable weather conditions. The entire building is almost ready for plastering, the lathing being practically finished, and I expect the plastering will start within the next few days. The terraza work has not yet been commenced, although the materials are here.\n\nI expect to send some recent photos of the building in a couple of days, which will give you an idea of the present stage of construction.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nConstruction Office, Old Suns School,\nGleichen, Alta. Feb. 14, 1930.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nRegarding the small open porch shown on the plans at the rear of the Principal's residence, the Rev. Mr. Gibney requests that this be closed in, and provided with a door and window. The reason he gives is that he fears his rear entry will receive the full force of the prevailing west wind, which often blows with great violence. Also it will receive the wind deflected from the adjoining blank wall of the school.\n\nI recall that in the former building we had to build protection porches to keep the wind from striking the exposed entry doors\u2014and this after two doors had been torn off their hinges and door checks, and their stiles split.\n\nThe contractors agree to make the desired change at a cost not exceeding $100.00, and as much under this figure as possible. Will you please instruct me whether or not this requested change may be made.\n\nThe Provincial Boiler Inspector, Mr. Dick, gave us a call two days ago while passing through the locality. I shall have him come again and make a more thorough inspection before accepting the heating plant. While here Mr. Dick stated that in his opinion it would be advantageous to place a flange in the line of steam main in the basement corridor, which he said would greatly facilitate making repairs in the event of future trouble, and might save having to send a 6\" main to Calgary to be threaded if a Tee or elbow had to be replaced. The heating contractor's representative does not take kindly to the idea, and will expect to be paid for the additional time and material involved, which may amount to $20.00. I should like you to instruct me whether to carry out the Boiler Inspector's recommendation, or whether to omit the flange in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

Also note that my board and room at the above hotel has not been paid for the period from November 25th, 1929 to January 31st 1930, the account has been sent to them, $91.50.\n\nI have a yearly contract with the Wyndells Construction Co Ltd which is enclosed, or rather copy is enclosed.\n\nI also have a balance of $116.10 due from the Cecilia Jeffrey school at Kinora Ont. This is not from the General Contract but for the Waterworks which was a separate contract with the Wyndells Construction Co Ltd.\n\nMy last years contract with them was on a salary basis plus ten percent of net profits.\nI am sorry to have to draw your attention to this matter, but do not see of any other way to settle same.\n\nJust as far as the work is concerned Mr. Smith, the inspector seems to be very satisfied. The outside work is practically completed and the plasterers are off on a good start. The terrazzo man are suppose to start tomorrow.\n\nKindly let me know when Hospital plans are coming out, and would greatly appreciate if you could send me a set as I would like to submit a tender.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kind and prompt attention to this letter.\n\nI am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.

Ducharme, Esq.,\nQueen's Hotel,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOld Sams Indian School,\nGlenichen, Alta., March 1st, 1930.\n\nP.E. Harrison Esq.,\nWestern Representative,\nDepartment of Labour,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs mentioned in my telegram of yesterday, I called on the plastering contractors in Calgary mentioned by you with the exception of Mr. Alex. Cumberland, who was ill in bed at the time. I also had an interview with Mr. J.M. Wilson, Secretary of the Builders' Exchange, whose name and address you had also given me.\n\nThere was no question at any time regarding the wages being paid the plasterers, but the Calgary union demands that the plasterers employed be 50-50 Calgary men\u2014that is to say for each outside plasterer there must be one Calgary plasterer too. Mr. Bowx, the plastering sub-contractor conceded this, and dismissed good plasterers who had paid their own fare to work here, and put on Calgary men in their place.\n\nRegarding the rate of pay for labourers employed by the plastering contractors, I was advised by the persons to whom you referred me that in Calgary it is now the practice to pay all such men on the basis of \"plasterers' helpers,\" viz. at $7\u00bd per hour. I have therefore given a ruling to this effect, and the higher rate of pay will be made retroactive, in the case of all men who attend on plasterers, including wheelbarrow men, mixers, and hod carriers.\n\nWith reference to the complaints of Louis Ducharme, and the two brothers Laune, these men are making claims for carpenters, steel workers and hoisting engineers' wages for the time they were assisting artisans, or running a small gasoline engine hoist. The youth Ducharme is the son of the foreman, nineteen years of age, and worked in the offices as time-keeper, book-keeper, etc., pending the arrival of the contractors' accountant, Mr. Denick. He was then taken into the building at the same rate of pay as his own father had set on his services, and has since been working under the supervision of an experienced carpenter. This youth can not fairly claim carpenter's wages, as at the best valuation he is only an apprentice, and to concede such a claim would, in my opinion, be a gross injustice to the carpenter trade. He has a good knowledge of telegraphy, and I have seen his transit messages in the Gleichen station, but I am sorry that his talent in this respect did not hold him to that profession.\n\nNow in Calgary I enquired as to the qualifications of a \"hoisting engineer,\" and was told by several builders, and also by a hoisting engineer himself when at work at his hoist, that the term has reference to men qualified to operate a steam hoist, and will hold at least 3rd class papers. Any intelligent labourer, with but a few minutes' instruction, can operate such a hoist as has been in\noperation at our job here, and every person among the builders I\nconsulted in Calgary agreed that only qualified engineers can fairly\nclaim a rating as \"hoisting engineers\".\n\nLabourers are necessarily a movable quantity, and are frequently\ncalled from place to place to assist where assistance is needed. On\ncountry jobs particularly, labourers have no help to carry I beams,\ncolumns, and other heavy materials, and assist in lifting them to\nplace, but such work does not, in my judgment, warrant a claim for\nstructural steel workers' rates, which is a trade in itself. Nor if\ncarpenters have two or three labourers calling for them to get a\nroof closed in (as was the case here) during bad weather, this does\nnot, in my opinion, entitle a labourer to the wages of a qualified\ncarpenter because of this casual rough help. On this job the amount\nof such work done by labourers is practically negligible, and in no\ncase has any but competent carpenters been employed at strictly\ncarpentry work, and they have been paid the fair wage rate of $1.00\nper hour.\n\nThe claims of the plasterers' labourers, - or rather, claims\nput forward on their behalf by the delegate from the Calgary Union\u2014\nhave been satisfactorily adjusted, and everything is harmonious in this\ntrade. The claims of Louis Ducharme, Albert Louie and Gus Louie for\nartizan's wages for part of their time, I have not endorsed. These\nthree men were hired as labourers at the start, they have done several\nmonths' steady work, they were paid regularly as building labourers\nat $3.00 per day, and rightly until pay-shoes demanded. Only when\nthey were laid off, when there was no longer any work for them, were\nthese claims brought forward.\n\nI am sorry to say there has been growing friction between\nthe officers of the Syndicate Co. and Mr. Ducharme, the foreman. I\nshall not go into the merits of the\u7ea0\u7eb7\uff0cbut I am of the opinion\nthese fantastic claims for higher pay have their genesis in the bad\nfeeling which unhappily is all too evident. It looks to me as\ninevitable that Mr. Ducharme be relieved of his position, and another\ncompetent foreman put in his place. I am expecting a climax at any\ntime. Beyond seeing that good work is being done, I am trying to\nmaintain a neutral attitude.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nInspector of Construction.\nQueens Hotel,\nGlenchen Alta.\nMarch 4, 1930.\n\nMr. R.

In the night letter are embodied complaints from several men purporting to say their wages are still owing them.\n\nEach man whose name appears in said night letter has been paid up to his last hour of service, and in no case is there a single instance of any employee of the contractors being compelled to wait a single day for his pay when due. I inspected the pay-sheets this morning, and found therein the signatures of the complainants themselves, thus acknowledging the receipt of their wages.\n\nThe real crux of the situation is simply this: a number of the workmen who were hired and paid as labourers were laid off when there was no more work for them, and now they are coming forward with claims for the higher wages of skilled artisans in the various crafts. It is for back-pay, on this higher scale, that they are seeking. In the main, I consider these claims invalid, and not in keeping with recognized building practice.\n\nWhen I have a chance to talk with you personally I shall be able to throw more light on the subject than I can do by letter. However, I may now say that it appears to me that these complaints and claims all have their genesis in the ill-will of a deposed foreman, and that he has implanted this germ of discontent in the minds of others, and I believe these claims for higher classification of work owe their inspiration to him.\n\nI shall be glad to see you on your western trip.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Sgd) E.Gardner-Smith.\nInspector of Construction.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC R'Y.

Harrison.\nNo. 850 Pumping Head With Belt Drive\n\nNo. 1050 Pumping Head, Silent Chain Drive\n\nThe Crane No. 850 and 1050 Deep Well Systems effectively meet the need for reasonably priced, well-made systems which will pump water from any depth. With such systems on the market, no one is justified in doing without the health-giving, comfort-giving, labor-saving qualities of running water.\n\nThese new systems are made in capacities to pump 125 to 990 gallons an hour from depths down to 500 feet. Built of the finest materials, machined to a precision not found in ordinary pumps, these systems are constructed in every detail for enduring untroubled operation.\n\nThey share with other Crane systems the advantages of accessibility, simplicity, and easy repair which are so valuable in assuring buyer-satisfaction.\n\nThey are self-oiling. Most heads of this type depend on the dip of the crosshead and crank pin for oiling of these parts. In the Crane No. 850 and 1050, this practice has been improved by providing a positive overhead oiling system. The oil is collected in a reservoir between the pinions at the high point and carried by gravity to every bearing and pin, including the cross-head and guide rod. This construction means longer life for every part.\n\nAn important feature is the ease with which the sucker rods and plunger can be removed when connected to an open type working barrel or cylinder. The head need never be removed from the foundation to accomplish this occasional servicing. Since the water chamber and head proper remain intact in this operation there is no possibility of the vital parts ever getting out of alignment when removing the rods and plungers.\n\nIt is entirely enclosed as a protection against dirt and foreign substances.\n\nIt will not rust. The pump, of the walking beam type, has a sliding crosshead which moves the rod down at greater speed than up, cushioning the reciprocating motion.\n\nThe system can be operated with either electric or gas engine power. The chain drive, supplied at slight extra cost on the No. 850, is recommended for its long, trouble-free service and greater efficiency. For those who have their own gas engine power and belt drive, the pumps are available with tight pulley only; while for line shaft drive they can be furnished with tight and loose pulley at a small extra charge.\n\nPower Required to Operate Working Heads Against Maximum Tank Pressure 40 lbs., at Various Capacities and Well Depths and Prices of Deep Well Pumping Outfits Complete with Working Head, Air Pump, Motor, Relief Valve, Automatic Pressure Tank Control, and Deep Well Cylinder\n\nDROP PIPE and Sucker Rods are NOT Included\n\n| Symbol | Cap in.

Michael\nGleichen, Alta. March 19th, 1930.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWith reference to a permanent water system for the above-mentioned school, you will recall that we are at present using the contractors' temporary engine and plant, and are pumping water from the old well on the site of the original building about 50' distant from the new school.\n\nAt the time of demolishing the old ruins, and filling in and grading, we carried up a foundation wall around the well, bringing same up to grade height, and thus having a secure foundation for a future well-house. The contractors placed a temporary wooden building on said foundation wall to give protection from the weather to the temporary pumping plant on the level of the former basement floor.\n\nWe shall soon require a permanent well-house, and I would respectfully suggest that a brick house be built, 10'x 10', for which the concrete foundation is in readiness. I could arrange with the contractors to erect this little building at proven cost, plus 10%, or get from them a straight tender. Will you kindly advise me as to the Department's wish. A suitable galvanized iron water line has already been carried underground from the well to the new school, and connected to the pressure tank there.\n\nWith regard to a permanent pumping plant for the new school, I have received three tenders from three different firms, each firm being given full data bearing on the requirements. The tenders received from two of the firms quote on equipment so manifestly unequal to the work that I am not considering them. The third tender is from L. Michael, of Gleichen, a copy of which I enclose. Mr. Michael has done a great deal of work for the Department, and his work stands up well. I enclose Cut and Specifications of the pumping plant Mr. Michael proposes to install, which I believe would prove very satisfactory over a long period of years. Mr. Michael has installed several pumping plants of this type, all of which are giving untroubled service.\nThe Crane pump quoted on has many excellent features among which may be mentioned the enclosed frame, self lubricating, silent chain drive, accessibility of parts, ease of withdrawing rods and cylinder, etc. It has a 5 HP Motor attached rigidly to top of frame. The 105OF model has slightly more lifting capacity than our well calls for, but on the other hand we shall pump against a maximum pressure of 70 lbs instead of the tank pressure of 40 lbs shown on the Table of capacities, which difference will thus be taken care of. (Our well is about 175' deep and Table shows the proposed plant equal to a well of 275')\n\nMr. Michael's quotation of $785.00 covers the entire work, including preparing suitable reinforced concrete base, removal of existing well equipment, installing the new equipment, extending the existing well casing, and leaving the new plant in perfect working order, and with 12 months' guarantee of satisfactory performance.\n\nThe proposed pumping plant will, of course, be provided with an automatic electric starter and cut-out, which will maintain a pressure ranging from say 35 to 70 lbs in the water supply.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending the acceptance of Mr. Michael's tender.\n\nAwaiting your kind instructions regarding the well-house and permanent pumping plant,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nAT SMALL ADDITIONAL COST SHOULD WE PLACE GLASS PANELS IN DOORS OPENING FROM CORRIDORS TO GIVE BORROWED LIGHT OR MUST CORRIDORS DEPEND ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHT\n\nE GARDNER SMITH.\nE.

In any case this is a matter for the Department to decide.\n\nI submitted said list to three competitive millwork firms in Calgary, and their quotations are as follows:\n\nD.V.Cope & Company, Millwork & Hardware, . . . . . . . $3600.00\nW.H.Cushing, Limited, Millwork Only, . . . . . . . . . . 3971.00\nA.B.Cushing Mills, Ltd., Millwork Only, . . . . . . . . . . 6420.00\n\nIt is difficult to understand why there should be such a wide difference in these tenders, as each firm had the same identical list and detail sheets.\n\nWith the exception of Cope Co.'s tender, the cost of hardware should be added, also painting, and erection, in order to get at the finished cost of the entire installation of this additional millwork.\n\nIf the list be approved, I should like your instructions as to how to place this order, and whether the work be done by the general contractor at cost plus, or on a straight tender; or whether the Department prefers some other arrangement.\n\nAwaiting your valued instructions, I have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indians Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMarch 24th, 1930\n\n5255-17-10\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to the account rendered of one dollar and thirty-five cents ($1.35). In October the account amounted to eighteen dollars and forty-five cents ($18.45). The cheque (No. 5255) amounted to only seventeen dollars and ten cents ($17.10). This left a balance due of one dollar and thirty-five cents ($1.35) which has been carried forward on each monthly account sheet. Therefore when cheques are sent and amount taken from total there is always the balance due of one dollar and thirty-five cents.\n\nHoping this explanation will help you to adjust matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.W. Brown\n\nP.S. I believe the above explanation correct.\nOttawa, March 27th., 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 21st instant, claiming a balance of $1.35 to be due you on your October account for bread supplied to the Old Sun's Residential School, I beg to state that the account for that month was not rendered at $18.45 as stated in your letter, but at $17.10, which amount has been paid. The account represents the supplying of 205 loaves of bread at 12 for $1.00 = $17.10. In your November account for 220 loaves of bread, you include in addition to the amount of the bread supplied during that month an item marked \"account rendered $18.45\" which it is assumed represents the account for October. The error appears to be made in your books in that account, as the account rendered for October reads $17.10. The Department therefore does not owe the balance of $1.35 claimed by you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nR.W.

In addition to the above, which I strongly commend to your early and careful consideration, I beg to request that the farmer's cottage be supplied with screens for the doors and windows, and that the water tank in the basement be placed on a platform instead of on a cement floor, with a tap installed for drainage purposes.\n\nDuring my visit to this School last autumn I directed the attention of the Indian Agent and the Inspector of Construction on the new building to the need of the improvements mentioned above, and they agreed with me that they were very necessary and should be supplied.\n\nI shall be pleased to know that the above matters are receiving your careful and sympathetic consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nApril 16, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nA request has been received for a new switch for the electric motor in the pump house of the stock barn at the old Sun's School; a heater to warm the motor in cold weather; the linking up of the farmer's cottage with the water system at the school buildings; improvements to the farmer's cottage in the placing of windows in the sun porch, also supplying of screens for the doors and windows.\n\nWill you kindly report on the improvements asked for together with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

May 1st, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant with reference to various requirements for the outbuildings at Old Suns School, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe electric motor at the stock barn should be wired from the power distribution panel in the new school instead of on a lighting service. This would give more power, and take a cheaper rate. To make this change would entail running two No. 8 conductors, change cross arms on existing poles, and extra guying, also necessary connections. The motor as at present installed in the pump house of the barn would not pass inspection, and should be wired in conduit, and provided with an externally operated switch. This service should also be grounded. To do this work, and make the changes indicated, would cost $105.00. To provide and install a suitable electric heater to keep the motor at a proper working temperature in cold weather would cost about $20.00, making a total cost of $125.00. I would not recommend a stove and chimney adjoining the barn because of fire hazard.\n\nRegarding the installing of a water service in the farmer's cottage as follows: Digging and backfilling approximately 300 ft. of trench, connection to the pressure tank of school, laying a 4\" gal. iron pipe line, stop and waste in basement, connection to a 30 gal. range boiler, stove connection, a hot and cold water tap at sink, with trap and roof vent, and waste outlet to a sump hole outside, would cost $267.00 complete.\n\nIf the water service were to include a properly equipped bath room with wash basin, toilet and 5 ft bath in addition to the equipment mentioned in the last paragraph, and to include a suitable septic tank and field-tile distribution, with fixtures vented in accordance with Alberta plumbing by-laws, the total cost would be $649.00 complete.\n\nTo provide needed windows in the sun porch and screens for the windows would cost $50.00, including painting.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nMay 12, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the various requirements to the outbuildings at the Old Sun's School, and would ask you to please arrange to have the electric motor in the stock barn wired from the power distribution panel in the new school, also the providing of a suitable electric heater. It is noted that the cost of this will be approximately $125.00.\n\nYou may also arrange for the installation of a water service to the farmer's cottage at a cost of approximately $267.00.\n\nIt is not considered necessary at the present time to install complete plumbing fixtures as funds are limited.\n\nYou may arrange for the windows in the sun porch and screens for the windows at a cost of $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We are therefore writing to ask you to protect us for the balance of $4791.70 and a few small extras which might amount to $200.00.\n\nWe understand that the Wyndels Const.

March 26th, 1930.\n\nR. Guernsey Orr Esq.\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Old Siksika School.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nQuite apart from the information contained in my regular reports on the progress of the work here, I feel that I should like to tell you something of what has been going on beneath the surface.\n\nOwing to the death of Mr. Wyndels shortly after the contract was let, this job was started under inauspicious circumstances. Mr. Ducharme, the foreman, promised a dying man that he would do all possible to make the undertaking a success, and to protect the interests of the Company employing him. He arrived on the scene in due course, and brought with him, or there followed soon after him, about a dozen French Canadian friends of his to work on the job. Things went quite well on the start, but it was not very long before friction developed. It seems a Mr. Tallieu, a Belgian compatriot of the late Mr. Wyndels\u2014had come to the Company's assistance financially, and it was his money that kept the concern going. He arrived later on the ground, and noticing what he considered extravagance in the carrying out of the work, he asked Mr. Ducharme to curtail the seeming excessive pay-roll. Then the sparks commenced to fly. Mr. Ducharme flaunted a written agreement executed by the late Mr. Wyndels appointing him (Ducharme) foreman with full authority in all matters pertaining to the work, at a salary of $500.00 per month plus board and transportation, and to run one full year, and with no restraining conditions. He openly defied Mr. Tallieu, and encouraged his men to do the same. It so happened that the sub-contractors were mostly Belgian, and there seemed to be an undercurrent of hostility between the two races. During the past two months it has been my daily concern to avoid an open rupture, and to try to keep the peace between the rival crews until the job could be finished. The friction spread until I don't think there was a single man on the works but was more or less affected by the undercurrent of jealousy and ill-will, and the atmosphere was electric. In the meantime Mr. Tallieu had received from the Company's directors a legally executed document giving him full authority over the entire job, with authority to hire or discharge workmen. We then had two captains...\non the same ship, each at enmity with the other, and both with documentary authority. It was an impossible situation, and the climax had to come. Mr. Debuck, the accountant, became almost ill over the friction, and left on half a day's notice for Winnipeg. Mr. Tallieu, acting on his duly executed credentials, dismissed several of Mr. Ducharme's men despite the latter's denial of such right.\n\nThere was ample cause for these dismissals. In the first place the brickwork was just finished, which meant less labourers were needed; and in the second place a number of Ducharme's men, following his example, had left the camp and were boarding in town. As the Company had been to the expense of building and equipping the camp, and engaging a first class cook, an order had been given that only men boarding at the camp were to be employed. This order Ducharme defied. These discharged men, aided and abetted by Ducharme himself, then brought forward all sorts of claims for higher pay than they had been getting. It would take too long to explain this feature of the trouble in all its ramifications. I passed on them as fairly as I could, but my decisions were refused by the disgruntled ones, and led by Ducharme's 19 year-old-son, numerous telegrams (sent collect) were despatched to the Department of Labour, Ottawa, purporting to say that wages were being withheld. As time went on these discharged workmen plotted and schemed to extort more money from the Company, and the fantastic claims which evolved from their brains had by this time extended into higher mathematics. Then we had the unique spectacle of the foreman for the contractors, still drawing their money, and still under promise to do his best for the widow and orphans, taking a half-day off and going to Calgary with his dismissed followers, to start legal action against the Wyndels Company. Ducharme told me himself on his return that he had placed his own claims in a lawyer's hands, and that a suit would follow. I shall not take time to explain his strange grounds for suit.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. F.E.Harrison, Dominion Fair Wage Officer, was on his way West, and the day before his arrival Mrs. Wyndels, with a 6 mos. old nursing baby, arrived from Winnipeg to see if she could help in the crisis which had arisen. I met her at the station, and owing to the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Hutchison, I was able to bring her to their home. The next day Mr. Harrison interviewed each claimant for higher wages in turn. He threw out about 75% of the men's claims, but made some allowances in their favour amounting to over $300.00 altogether. A day or two later, after consultation with the local lawyer, Mr. Tallieu and Mrs. Wyndels jointly signed a letter of dismissal, which was served on Mr. Ducharme, and they also dismissed Ducharme's two sons, and two others of that persuasion.\nA law-suit was then inevitable between Ducharme and the Wyndels Company. This would mean the whole gang of mutineers would remain in the locality as principal or witnesses, and the publicity of it, and the consequent effect on our job, was something I was very desirous of avoiding. It was out of the question to try to bring Tallieu and Ducharme together; the enmity was too great. Acting as a disinterested intermediary, I finally succeeded in bringing Ducharme and Mrs. Wyndels together in friendly conference at Hutchison's home last Saturday night, and got them to agree on the sum of $358.00 in settlement of Ducharme's claims, and while they were both still in the mood, I slipped upstairs to my typewriter, and typed out a document covering all outstanding points, and they both signed it, and I witnessed it, at 11 P.M.\n\nNext day Ducharme, his two sons, and three of the mutineers left by car for Winnipeg. Two mutineers, Maranda and Lauze, remain, and the former man, even after Mr. Harrison had allowed his claim in full, is still nursing some imaginary grievance, and told me he would continue sending night-letters to the Hon. Peter Henen ad infinitum, or until he gets his chimerical claims granted.\n\nMrs. Wyndels has appointed a local builder, Mr. Scott, to take over Ducharme's duties, and already the atmosphere at the job almost suggests the millennium after the previous conditions, and the utmost harmony now prevails.\n\nThe foregoing is merely a very brief outline of what has been going on; to tell it in full would fill a good sized volume. Never before was I ever involved in anything like so unpleasant a situation. Fortunately I was able to consult Mr. Gooderham, and his wise counsel and moral support were like the shadow of a rock in a weary land.\n\nNeedless to say, all the friction and disagreements have not helped to make the job profitable to the contractors. There has been no bad effects on the job itself, but the lack of harmonious cooperation, and active friction within the organization itself, certainly must have its reflex action on the balance sheet. I'm much afraid the job will not more than break even, and may do even worse than that. Probably the contract was taken at rather a close price. However, there has been no attempt to depart from the high quality of workmanship and materials called for, and the last job of the Wyndels Construction Company will, I feel sure, redound to their credit. For this reason, and also because all that Mrs. Wyndels possesses, including her late husband's life insurance, is invested in this undertaking, I would respectfully recommend that as far as possible any remaining work apart from the contract be awarded to the Wyndels Company. Now I must have pity on you and close this lengthy epistle. I am not often so verbose.\n\nSincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nGleichen, Alta. March 29th, 1930.\n\nR.

March 25th, 1930.\n\nF. Z. Harrison Esq.,\nDepartment of Labour,\nPalliser Hotel,\nCALGARY, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Harrison:\n\nI am enclosing herewith the signed receipts of the various workmen at Old Suns Indian School acknowledging the respective adjustments in wages authorized by you.\n\nMost of the mutineers left by car this morning for their homes in Manitoba. By request, I saw them at the hotel last night, and listened to more of their whining. It seems that each time I see them they have thought up something more, until at last my poor tired brain refuses longer to function in such a maze of endless grievances. I think it is the frequent potations, strong in alcoholic content, which stimulates their imaginations.\n\nThat Maranda fellow is still hanging around, and as I told you over the phone, he said he was about to send a long, personal night-letter (collect, of course) to his friend The Hon. Peter Henn telling of the great injustice he (Maranda) is having to suffer, and demanding that the grievances be immediately redressed. Further, he states he is prepared to stay around all summer to fight for what he deems his rights. For the life of me I cannot imagine what grievance he pretends to have. However, that quarrelsome, disgruntled, mutinous gang are now off the job, and today Mr. Scott, a local builder, has taken over the foreman's duties on behalf of Mrs. Lyndels, and already a very different atmosphere prevails. Mr. Joderham has offered to instruct the Mounted Police to keep the trouble-makers off the Reserve if any of them come around the building.\n\nI will sift Emil Dechambault's story of wrongly kept Time Sheets, etc., but I don't expect to find any discrepancy. I have received the paid cheques, earlier Time Sheets, and other data from St. Boniface. I regard the charge as absurdly fantastic, but will check up carefully just the same.\n\nAgain thanking you for your kind cooperation,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Sgd) E. Gardner-Smith.\nInspector of Construction.\nConstruction Office,\nOld Suns School, Gleichen, Alta., March 27, 1930.\n\nR. Guernsey Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nOn the school job here there are 1800 sq. ft of 4\" gypsum tile left over, and Mrs. Wyndels is anxious to get out of it what she can.\n\nIt occurred to me that possibly you might like to use gypsum for some of the partitions in the proposed extension to the Indian Hospital, although apart from their advantage as sound-resisting, there may not be much object in placing this material in a building that is not of fire-proof construction.

April 11th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTIA.\n\nSir:\n\nReport on Old Suns School Construction.\n\nSteady progress has been maintained in the erection of Old Suns Indian School here, and we are now within measurable distance of the completion of the contract.\n\nThe terrazza floors were completed this morning, and a very good job has been done by this contractor, Mr. Fabro, and his experienced assistants. The same crew were engaged to lay the cement floors in the various rooms where specified, and again I found their work very satisfactory.\n\nThe plastering of the building is well advanced, and should be fully completed next week. On the whole the plaster work is quite satisfactory, and so far remarkably free from cracks. My chief concern in connection with this branch of the construction was caused by the frequent high winds and dust blizzards which have been our almost everyday experience for weeks back. It seems that west of the school is a large area of bone-dry summer fallow, and clouds of this light powdery soil have been frequently blown by the prevailing west winds, thus enveloping the new building in a haze of dust, and which it seemed impossible entirely to keep out. Such a condition has not been conducive to the very best results in either painting or plastering, and occasionally gave rise to language scarcely in keeping with a missionary enterprise. However, not very much of the newly plastered walls suffered noticeably, and the plasterer has undertaken to remedy any smudged places before leaving the job.\n\nThe painting is proceeding at a fair rate of speed, and I have yet to meet a more worthy or more efficient exponent of this branch of art. And he has had his full share of tribulation too. The dust storms referred to have given him much extra work, and several times his paint has had to be scraped off and done again, and again. Through it all he remains unperturbed, indifferent to the buffettings of sand storms, and resolute in his determination to turn out first class workmanship. Truly this man is captain of his soul! He has four assistants who follow in his footsteps, and strive to emulate his high example of painstaking efficiency.\n\nThe plumber and steamfitter returned today to set up plumbing fixtures and radiators. This work will occupy at least another fortnight. These mechanics had left until the building was sufficiently advanced so that they could finish up all their work. In both these trades we are getting full satisfaction.\nThe sheetmetal and roofing is completed with the exception of the providing and setting up of the steel partitions for the small bathrooms off recreation rooms. These had been entirely overlooked by this contractor in figuring the job, and nothing sent. However, measurements have been sent him in Winnipeg, and these partitions will be installed as shown on the Plan.\n\nCarpenters are hanging windows and doors, and setting up trim in the 2nd and 1st floors, these being now reasonably dry. We have received exceptionally good millwork from St. Boniface, and I'm very pleased with it.\n\nThe electricians are now drawing their wires through the conduits, and will soon be ready for hanging lighting fixtures.\n\nFrom the foregoing brief resume you will see that the job is well advanced. I am still awaiting your valued instructions with reference to a well-house and permanent pumping plant, as dealt with fully in my letter of March 19th.\n\nAnother matter in which I am still awaiting the Department's decision is with regard to the cupboards, lockers, tables, pews, etc. Underdate of March 26th I wrote you, enclosing tenders I had received for this line of equipment, and asking for your kind instructions concerning these requirements. It will take some time at the mills, even after the order is placed, before this material can be delivered.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOld Suns School Construction Office,\nGleichen, Alta. April 15th, 1930.\n\nR. Querney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nThe Rev. Principal, Mr. Gibney, is somewhat concerned as to where he can store the large number of storm windows and screens when not in use. He says the store rooms provided in the school will be required for other purposes. This morning he brought this matter up again, and it was suggested that if the space under the entrance verandah, and under the class-room verandah, were enclosed the problem would be pretty well solved;\n\nThese spaces would give about 240 square feet of floor room. The walls should be in brick to match the existing brickwork, and should finish flush with the outside of the existing brick piers. A door and small window should be provided for each suggested enclosure, and a concrete floor laid.\n\nThe cost of this proposed work should not come high, and the contractors could use gravel, sand, etc., left over from the main work. I would suggest that if the idea commands itself to you that authority be given to have this small additional work done at proven cost plus 10%.\n\nWill you kindly give an early decision regarding the proposal to enclose and utilize the verandah spaces as outlined.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 19, 1930.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nThe following firms should be asked to tender in connection with the cupboards, shelving, tables, etc., required for the new Old Sun's school:\n\nCrown Lumber Co.,.............

Wyndels\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns School, Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of March 19th regarding a well-house and permanent water service for the above mentioned job, I am not yet in receipt of the Department's instructions. As mentioned in previous correspondence, we carried up concrete foundations around the old well, the former building to carry a well-house 10'x 10'. The contractors installed a temporary pumping plant at the old well for their own use, and put a rough building over it as a protection against the weather.\n\nWe have already carried a gal. iron pipe line from the well to the new building, and connected it to the pressure tank in the room designated for that purpose. It now remains for the Department to erect the well-house and install a permanent pumping plant. In my letter of March 19th I gave my reasons for recommending the installation of a particularly sturdy and efficient Crane motor-driven (5 HP) pumping service.\n\nI received the Department's authority to enclose the space under the two verandahs of the school for storage purposes. I am delaying this work pending the decision regarding the suggested brick well-house, for the reason that one small car of bricks will do both jobs.\n\nIn our new school building we have 86 casement windows. No adjusters are specified, and I'm certain if some means be not adopted for controlling these windows they will suffer serious damage, and will damage the plaster by swinging back against it. I have explored the market trying to find a suitable adjuster for windows swinging in, and adapted to our type of construction. The ordinary adjusters will not do. We might use a barrel bolt attached to the lower bar of the sash, but this would just allow the window to open a little; also there would be scratching of the stool. Ashdowns procured for me a sample \"Rixson\" adjuster which I have tried out and found fully satisfactory. It is attached to the top of the window frame and to the top rail of the casement,\nand it works by tension, regulated by an easily operated set screw. In other words, a degree of stiffness is attained which prevents the sash from being blown about in the wind, and yet the sash can be readily pushed shut or drawn open as required. The adjuster when installed is up out of the way. Ashdowns quote a price of $1.25 each, and the adjusters would have to be imported, as I appear to have procured the only one in Alberta. If the Department considers the outlay too great to equip all the casements with adjusters, it occurred to me that perhaps it would answer well enough if we placed adjusters on the alternate casements where they come in pairs, and fasten the adjoining window shut. This would reduce the number to about 4 dozen. Or must we fall back on bolts? Will you please instruct me as soon as possible in this regard, so that these windows may be equipped against damage to themselves and to the plaster.\n\nI duly received the Department's letter of the 24th ultimo giving additional names of firms from whom prices are desired for the cupboards, lockers, etc. Within a few days I hope to send the additional quotations for consideration.\n\nThe general work of construction is now well advanced, and the contract should be completed by the end of this month. I enclose a couple of snap-shots, but hope to have better photos of the building to send you soon.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo E.

Scott,\nD.Ackland & Son, Calgary,\nRiley & McCormick Ltd.,\nPrairie Lumber Co.,\nA.B.Cushing Mills,\n\nD.Ackland & Son stated they were not in a position to tender as their trade is in hard wood and blacksmiths' supplies.\n\nRiley & McCormick reported that their trade is in harness and leather goods.\n\nPrairie Lumber Co. stated that they have gone out of the retail lumber trade, and deal in car lots, and could not tender.\n\nRegarding the other firms mentioned by you, I procured from them tenders on the list of additional millwork, etc., as submitted with my letter to the Department of March 26th, and I enclose herewith a summary of these tenders;\n\n| Firm                        | Tender Amount |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| A.B.Cushing Mills, Ltd.     | $6420.00      |\n| Crown Lumber Co.            | $4385.00      |\n| W.T. Scott                  | $4350.00      |\n\nThe Dowse Sash & Door Co., Ltd. of St.Boniface, Man., who have supplied the rest of the lumber and millwork, asked to be allowed to tender on this list too, and their figure is $4442.00. Although this figure is slightly higher than two of the other quotations, they explain it by saying that most of the items will be put together in their factory if they get the business, instead of\nshipping it all in the K.D., and as this would greatly lessen the labour of erecting, the Dowse Co's figure is very probably the most attractive. This firm's millwork in the general contract was much above the average in quality.\n\nThe Wyndels Construction Co. are very desirous of installing this additional millwork, and as they have undoubtedly gone behind on the main contract, they are anxious to pick up a few dollars' profit from this source. They hope to be awarded this work at cost plus 10%. I told them I have no discretion in the matter, but must pass on to the Department the quotations asked for, and await your decision.\n\nAwaiting your valued instructions in the matter,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S. Mr. Scott wishes me to append to his quotation the sum of $950.00 additional to his tender for the erection of the various items complete, including hardware and painting.\nMr. J. Gardner Smith,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAnswering your inquiry for 12 only wire window guards 3'6\" wide by 4'4\" high, hinged to open we take much pleasure in quoting you the sum of $114.00 for the above screens f.o.b.

Calgary.\n\nRungs will be made from 5/8\" square iron, side bars 5/8\" x 1-1/2\" and with movable brackets to enable you to strike the mortar joints. We have not allowed for bolts or screws for fixing ladders in position, as we assume you will provide these.\n\nHoping to be favoured with your valued order, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRIVERSIDE IRON WORKS, LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nRFC:H\nR.T.795\nOld Guns School,\nGlacier, Alta., May 16th,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nIn order to provide safe and easy access from the lower to the higher roof levels, and vice versa, three ladders are required. Should these not be of iron, to be attached permanently? I enclose rough sketches of what I considered most suitable, and the Riverside Iron Works, Ltd., of Calgary quotes a price of $75.00 for making these ladders as shown. Will you please instruct me promptly whether or not these iron ladders should be installed. Access to the different roofs is essential for the inspection of roof hoppers in particular.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is desirous that woven guards be placed over the windows of the Recreation Rooms. I enclose quotation of $111.00 for the 12 Guards required. Please instruct me in this regard also.\n\nKindly return the sketches of the ladders.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMay 21, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the providing of pump etc., required for the new Old Sun's School you may make the necessary arrangements for his work with Mr. Michael of Gleichen, Alta. I note in your letter that the pump suggested has a capacity of 525 gal. per hour. It is considered that it would be better to install a pump with a capacity of at least 1000 gal. per hour. This will be required in order to give a certain amount of fire protection. The pump should be installed and connected up to work automatically as mentioned in your letter.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th instant, you may arrange to have the windows fitted with adjustors of the type recommended in your letter.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant it is noted that the price quoted by W. T. Scott of Gleichen is the lowest for the cupboards, etc. You may therefore arrange with him to provide this equipment and also install same complete at his price quoted.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant you may arrange to have the ladders installed, also woven guards on the windows of the recreation rooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

May 21st, 1930.\n\nR.Guerney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWith regard to Certificate No. 9, for $4185.00, issued on May 1st, I received a letter yesterday from Mrs. Wymels from which I quote as follows:\n\n\"As to the payment of the last Certificate, same has not yet been received, which of course I am anxiously waiting for... I would very much like to have this Certificate filed as it would leave some money on hand.\"\n\nI may say that with the exception of about three weeks' painting, and a little finishing in the plumbing and some patching of plaster and brickwork, this contract is about completed. There remains $2750.01 coming to the contractors on the general contract, besides additional work authorized.\n\nAs instructed by you, I shall make it my business to see that all sub-contractors' accounts, and bills for materials, are fully paid before I issue the final Certificate; and in the event of the contractors being unable to meet these accounts (and I doubt their being able to do so) I shall submit to the Department certified statements of these various outstanding accounts so that they may be paid by the Department direct. I have already notified the contractors of the procedure I propose following in this regard, to which no objections have been raised.\n\nI hope to be your representative again at the proposed new school at St. Paul de Metis, the plans of which I saw when in Calgary recently. The experience I have gained here in fireproof construction would stand me in good stead there. However, I'm equally willing to serve the Department wherever my services may be most needed, and will do my very best under all circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDear Sir,\n\nApplication is herewith made for Progress Estimate No. 10, in connection with the Old Sams School Job.

It had been my intention to await the completion of the contract before issuing any further Certificate, but Mrs. Wyndels has written me stating she is rather pressed for money, and was desirous of receiving this comparatively small payment while awaiting the final clean-up.\n\nWith the exception of about a week's or ten days' more painting, and the hanging of some more electrical fixtures, and the window shades, the contract is completed except for some extra work recently authorized.\n\nWith regard to balances still due to sub-contractors and material dealers, I shall be careful to have certified statements of these outstanding accounts before issuing the final Certificate, and if the Wyndels Co. are not in a position to meet these bills I shall ask the Department to pay them direct, as already instructed by you.

Their affairs are considerably muddled, and if we are to avoid an aftermath of unpaid bills it devolves on me to be very circumspect at this juncture. This is the more necessary because of the unsound financial condition of this moribund concern.\n\nShould you wish to reach me at Winnipeg by wire you can do so up to say the 6th instant, in care of the Royal Alexandra Hotel; and, of course, I shall write or wire you from there. I expect to get to Winnipeg by the evening of the 6th, and to complete my work over the week-end.\n\nIt is only fair to add that the Wyndels Co. have given us a first class job despite the unusual difficulties under which the contract was performed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n### Department of Indian Affairs\n\nTo E.

The reason for splitting the final Certificate into two parts is because any Certificate of \u00a320,000.00 or more must pass through the Finance Dep't, which occasions delay.\n\nYou will note that Certificate No. 11 credits your account with the extras of \u00a39923.33, full particulars of which are being sent you under separate cover; also that these Certificates includes the 10% holdback on the Progress Estimates. Please sign both Certificates in duplicate, and forward same to The Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, for payment.\n\nI am also enclosing a letter written as from you, and addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, with reference to the Department making direct payment to the firms mentioned, and of the amounts specified, on your behalf. Please sign this letter before a witness, and forward same with the Certificates.\n\nUnder separate cover I am writing you with regard to two or three accounts not included in the list being submitted to Ottawa; also with reference to slight adjustments in the amounts shown as due to certain two or three firms in the list being forwarded. I am awaiting confirmation of the balances claimed by the firms whose accounts I have thus far omitted to send forward for payment.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nGleichen, Alta. July 13th, 1930.\n\nWyndels Construction Co., Ltd.\nWinnipeg Trustee Co. of Canada.\n322 Main St.\nWINNIPEG, Man.\n\nRe- Old Suns School Contract, Gleichen.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith regard to the list of firms, and the amounts the Department is being asked to pay, in connection with the above contract, I wish to make the following explanations in those instances in which the balances shown in the letter to the Department differ from figures previously confirmed by you.\n\nThe amount of Mr. Fabro has been reduced by $101.70 as a result of a charge against him of $101.70 for electric current supplied by Old Suns School. A charge of $50.00 is levied against you also. I enclose the details of these charges, as submitted by the Rev. Principal. I understand Mr. Tailleau advised the Principal as to the apportionment of the electric bill as between you and Mr. Fabro.\n\nR.J. McQueen notified me of a further charge of $5.50 for hauling bricks for the pump house, and as I have personal knowledge of this transaction I have added this small sum to his bill, thus making a total of $15.05.\n\nRegarding the account of the Crown Lumber Co., I called at their Gleichen office the day before I left for Winnipeg, and the Manager being absent, his assistant gave me a memo purporting to show their balance to be $551.20. A few days ago the Manager, Mr. Watson, advised me that their account now stands at $753.00. I wired you for confirmation of this figure being correct, but in your letter of the 11th inst. you state you have no knowledge of any other figure than that of $551.20. Mr. Watson states that he wired me the day after I left for Winnipeg, in care of the Wyndels Co., stating his assistant had made a mistake, and that the then correct figure was about $100.00 higher. This telegram never reached me. I am adopting your suggestion of including this account at $551.20, and any additional sum due this Company will have to be dealt with later. Perhaps Mrs. Wyndels has not forwarded to you all the bills that have been sent to her.\n\nThe Beaver Soap & Chemicals, Ltd. state their balance at\n$50.00, but in your list of June 17th this is shown at $780.13, the difference being accounted for by your deduction of freight $69.87, to which deduction I presume you are entitled.\n\nThe Macdonald Bros. Sheet Metal & Roofing Co., Ltd., sent me a Statement under date of June 20th, showing their balance as $2363.00. In going over this account with you in Winnipeg, a charge of $24.00 was added to this balance for a Tar Kettle; then a Contra Account of $534.35 was deducted, thus leaving the balance at $2852.65. This firm was not represented at our meeting in the Trustee Co.'s office, so on my return I wrote them asking for confirmation of the balance arrived at of $2852.65, and it was in answer to this letter that I was advised of the higher figure of $2363.00. I wrote again to this firm drawing attention to the divergence in figures, and asking them to confer with the Winnipeg Trustee Co. and get the difference straightened out. Under date of July 2nd I received the following message:- \"Adjusting Wyndels Account with Winnipeg Trustee Co. (Stop) writing later.\" (Signed) The Macdonald Bros. Sheet Metal & Roofing Co., Ltd. I have heard nothing further from this firm, so in the meantime I am passing their balance at the figure agreed on when I was in Winnipeg viz at $2852.65, and any balance beyond that will have to be dealt with afterwards.\n\nYou mention that there is still some difference between you and the Manitoba Bridge Co. regarding the balance due them. I recall you were trying to obtain a small reduction in their account in consequence of losses sustained through waiting for steel. I am, therefore, passing this figure you gave me in Winnipeg viz, $1014.15, and any sum beyond this amount must remain unpaid for the present. If by any chance I am overstating this balance, you may have this figure amended by writing at once to The Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nThe balance in favour of Brotherston Electric Co. Ltd., has been increased by $82.10, being the charge for the electrical connections to the motors of the laundry machines, thus bringing this firm's balance up to $1659.23. I wired Ottawa for a ruling as to whether this was a charge against the general contractor or against the Department, and was instructed to charge it to you. I enclose details of this charge of $82.10.\n\nThe Canada Seating Company have written me stating they have a claim against you for $225.04 for Blackboards supplied on your contract here. No mention was made to me of this account when I was conferring with you in Winnipeg. I wired asking if this balance is correct, and in your reply you referred to other matters, but passed this firm's claim in silence. Does silence give consent? I am having to defer taking any action to procure payment of this\naccount until confirmed by you.\n\nThe Sherwin-Williams Paint Co. regarding their unpaid account of $329.00, and although this balance was also included in my telegraphed inquiry, you made no reference to it in your reply. I enclose their letter to me, in which they appear uncertain as to whether their bill should be charged to your painting sub-contractors or to you.\n\nMay I urge that you give careful and immediate attention to all accounts not yet included, or fully disposed of, in the list forwarded to Ottawa? I felt that I should not take the responsibility of delaying the payments any longer, for some of these people appear to be pressed for money, and they have already waited a long time for settlement of their accounts.\n\nI am sending you the various invoices, correspondence and other data which have come to me from your various creditors. The Department will obviously be unable to release the final balance that will be coming to you until all the outstanding accounts are disposed of, so please lose no time in sending me confirmation of any remaining balances, and I will do all I can to expedite the settlement.\n\nYou may now apply for cancellation of your Fire Insurance Policy on Old Suns School, and thus procure credit for the unexpired insurance. Perhaps you will have to send it to me for assignment.\n\nYou will note I am not differentiating between letters from the Wyndels Co., and from the Trustee Co.; but am treating them as from the same source.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nGleichen, Alta. July 13th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns School Contract, Gleichen.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I am today forwarding to the Wyndels Construction Co., Ltd., Certificates No. 11 and 12 (final) in payment of their remaining balance in connection with the above mentioned contract. Bearing in mind your previous injunction against issuing Certificates in excess of $20,000.00, I have divided the sum due them of $24,528.63 into two Certificates of $14,528.63 and $10,000.00 respectively, which I trust was the right procedure.\n\nI enclose a copy of the contractors' Progress Estimate No. 11, which shows how the amounts of the Certificates was arrived at.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, and to be signed by the Wyndels Construction Co., in which the Department is being requested and authorized to disburse the monies at the credit of the contractors, including the deposit sent with the tender, in settlement of the various listed claims set forth in said letter. I regret that this list is not quite complete, but a very few supplementary items are all that remain, and I'm hopeful that these will soon be ready for submission, and then this ill-fated contract can be completely disposed of. In the meantime I think those creditors whose accounts are being forwarded to the Department should not be expected to wait much longer for their money.\n\nI enclose, also, a copy of my letter of today to the Wyndels Co. regarding outstanding accounts and amended balances, which you may find informative.\n\nUnder separate cover I am sending you complete details of the additions, extras, and auxiliary work in connection with the Old Suns building. All the larger items, and most of the lesser ones, were authorized by the Department either by letter or telegram, and the list was gone over and explained when I had the pleasure of conferring personally with the officers of the Department when in the East a few weeks ago. If there should be any item in the list on which the Department desires further information, I shall be glad to make full explanation on being told of it.\n\nThe building is now completed, and the last of the contractors' workmen are leaving today. The Rev. Principal, Mr. Gibney, and family are already in residence in the new quarters provided, and I have asked Mr. Gibney to be responsible for the care of the building after tomorrow. The local contractor, Mr. W.T. Scott has also finished installing the new millwork, etc., but a few days' painting in connection with this work remains to be done.\nDespite the handicaps under which this contract has been carried out, --the death of the president and manager of the contracting firm, the labour troubles, the disloyalty of the foreman and his satellites-- the Department is receiving a high class building in every respect, and although a certain loss was inevitable almost from the start, there was no attempt to evade the high requirements of the Specifications at any time. Unfortunately a heavy loss has resulted, and Mrs. Wyndels will be left almost, if not quite, destitute, even her late husband's life insurance, which had been pledged as collateral, being wiped out. This is doubly regrettable as she is left with 6 or 7 young children. The job was taken at too low a price, and it proved impossible to keep their costs down to their estimates. The Department is getting this fine building at about $10,000.00 below cost, and as this firm were not strong financially, the result is bankruptcy for them, I'm afraid. However, such are the fortunes of contracting, and stern fate is no respecter of widows and orphans.\n\nThe additional pressure tank salvaged from the former Old Sung School has just been joined to the existing one at the pump house of the Hospital, which doubles the water reservoir, and is already much appreciated. A Voucher for this work will be issued soon. This work was authorized by Mr. Orr, and is being performed by Mr. Michael of Gleichen.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner-Smith\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S. In addition to the loss sustained by the general contractor, the sub-contractors lost money in most cases too. The plasterer went broke, and left many unpaid bills which Wyndels Co. had to shoulder,\u2014but we got an excellent plastering job. The plumbing & heating contractor (Daoust) reports a loss of over $1200.00. Other sub-contractors about broke even, or made bare wages.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nYesterday I had a call from Mr. French, of the Water Branch of the Department of the Interior, who had just come down from St. Paul. He reports the new well as yielding over 600 gals. per hour on a baling test. The water seemed of good quality except that a good deal of fine sand came with it, which may lessen as more water is used.\n\nIn discussing the matter of pumping plant, water storage, etc., we thought it would be best to wait until the contractors have drawn a lot of water from this well for their construction work before deciding on the most suitable equipment. We shall then have a better idea whether we shall have sand to contend with or not. The contractors will install their own temporary pumping service.\n\nMr. French said the excavating had commenced the day before he left, and should be completed within the next few days. I propose leaving for St. Paul by to-morrow evening's train from Gleichen so as to be present when the actual construction work starts. The contractors have shipped in a rock crusher, and propose crushing their own stone. A large pile of rocks and small boulders have been hauled to the site by local people, and these stones are clean and hard, and of good texture, and if broken up to correct sizes, excellent concrete should result. I approved a sample of sand, which I had subjected to a careful test.\n\nWhile here Mr. French inspected the pumping plant at both Old Suns School and the Indian Hospital, and thought something somewhat similar would be about right for the Blue Quills School. I expect to return to Gleichen for a day or two within a couple of weeks' time in connection with a little work not yet quite finished.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\n\nAddress P.O.Box 157. St. Paul, Alberta.\nOttawa, July 18th., 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a voucher amounting to $5364.00 in favor of Mr. W.T. Scott, of Gleichen, for installing the additional millwork in Old Sam's School, etc., I beg to request that you will forward the contract entered into with Mr. Scott covering the item $4750.00. In your letter of the 12th May last you give a summary of the tenders received, including Mr. Scott's, but the Auditor General will require either the original tender, or the contract itself. The voucher will be paid and the cheque sent to Mr. Gooderham as requested, but you should send the contract referred to with the least possible delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

We wish Ottawa would send them their cheques, as really it is a hardship on some of those parties.\n\n\"We will have another small sum to pay to the Crown Lumber Co as we have final explanation of their account.\n\n\"We will as soon as we can, send you the list of two or three other small accounts to be paid in order to entirely settle this matter.\n\n\"We believe that likely the best thing will be that when everything is settled, Ottawa sends in our care a cheque to the Wyndels Construction Company, and we will see they all agree together before the cheque is used.\n\n\"As far as we can figure, there should be about $8000.00 left of the original deposit.\"\n\nI realize it is very probable that by this time cheques will have been sent by the Department to the various creditors whose accounts have been accepted by the Wyndels Co. and sent to you for direct payment. As there are still two or three other small accounts in process of adjustment, I make the suggestion to send whatever portion is left of the original deposit in care of the Winnipeg Trustee Co. This seems a very reliable concern, and I have every confidence that they will see that all accounts are paid.\n\nWith regard to the claim of the Workmen's Compensation Board of Alberta, I called at the Board's office when last in\nEdmonton, and the Board agreed to accept the estimated pay-roll of $5000.00 for 1930, and were to advise you of the amount due from the Lyndel's Co. on that basis, with the request that you make payment to the Board direct of the prescribed assessment.\n\nI think this item of Workmen's Compensation is the only account in addition to the list sent you by the Winnipeg Trustee Co. that calls for direct payment from Ottawa. Anything then remaining will be very small, and can be dealt with by Winnipeg Trustee Co., as suggested in their letter.\n\nI'm sorry that the Department is being troubled in this way, but as the contractors are apparently bankrupt in consequence of losing heavily on the Old Suns contract, the procedure being followed seemed the only way of protecting the various creditors.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe Adjustment of Medical Aid Account\n\nWe have received an audit of your payroll for the year 1930 which shows the amount of $35.76 should have been deducted from the wages of your employees for Medical Aid, during the period reported.\n\nOur records show that we have received only $Nil from you on this account, and we must, therefore, ask you to make remittance for the balance of $35.76 to this Board by return, so that your account may be placed in good standing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWyndels Construction Co., Ltd.\n654 - Aulneau St.,\nST.

Sheet Metal & Roofing Co., Ltd.\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Old Suns School, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nWith reference to the repairs on the tar and gravel roof of the above school, you will recall my advising you of wind damage to a portion of the roof of the south wing of the main building. You readily authorized me to engage Mr. Michael of Gleichen to make the necessary repairs. This he has done, using the 2 bbls. of tar, and your kettle, which your men had left on the premises. I enclose Mr. Michael's bill for the work as authorized by you, viz $31.28, and I would ask you please to send Mr. Michael your cheque in payment of his charge, and instruct him as to what you wish done with your tar kettle.\n\nIn order to safeguard the school roof against further wind damage, the Department has since added a great deal more gravel and tar than was called for under the specifications, at a cost of $292.76 additional to that being charged to you.\n\nApparently you have never rendered your bill for extending the vents from the basement wash-rooms to the toilets, nor for supplying the two heavy ash cans for the boiler room. If you will let me have your amount for this extra labour and materials I will send it forward for payment to you direct.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Sept 9th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Old Suns School, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith the account of Mr. Michael, of Gleichen, for $292.76, being the cost of labour and materials for applying additional tar and gravel to the roofs of the above mentioned school.\n\nThis bill may come somewhat as a surprise to the Department, and calls for a special explanation.\n\nOwing to winds of almost cyclonic violence, and which blew many crops of the district right out of the ground, some damage was caused to part of the tar & gravel roofing over the south wing of the main building. The suction of the wind \"drew\" the roofing into slight corrugations, and which would ultimately cause leaks if not remedied. Donald Bros. of Winnipeg, the roofing subcontractors, assumed responsibility for the repairing of the damaged portion, and this expense is being charged to them, as you will note from the enclosed letter to that firm. While Mr. Michael and his men were on the job with the necessary equipment, I took it on myself to authorize the applying of additional screened gravel, and to give the entire roof of the main building and residence a further dressing of tar. This has developed into a more extensive job than expected, but in my absence Mr. Michael conferred with Mr. Gooderham, and they deemed it best to make a thorough job of it while in the business, and altogether 18 bbls of pitch, and much more screened gravel, has been applied. When I tell you that in a neighboring municipality a new school had its tar & gravel roof blown entirely off the building, you will have some idea of what these roofs have to stand in the windy belt of Alberta.\n\nThis additional work on the school roofs is no reflection on the roofing contractor, for their work was done in full conformity with the specifications.\n\nWhen in Gleichen last week I made a careful inspection of the extra work done on the roofs, and I can assure the Department that the expense incurred will prove an excellent insurance against the extreme vagaries of the weather for many years to come. These roofs are now models of solidity and weather resistance.\n2.\n\nNo additional work was done on the Chapel and Laundry roofs, as these are at a lower level, and did not appear in need of further treatment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Wynnels Construction Co. & Old Sun School.\n\nFurther to our letter of the 5th inst., we wish to advise you we have received a cheque from The Winnipeg Trustee Company of Canada for $201.20 covering balance of account due us from Wynnels Construction Company re Old Sun School, Gleichen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCrown Lumber Company, Ltd.,\nPer W.D.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe--Wyndels Construction Co., Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nYour file No. 104-1-105.\n\nI have for attention your letter of the 17th instant wherein you advise us to apply to the Winnipeg Trustee Co., of Canada, 322 Main St., Winnipeg, Man., as all monies due The Wyndels Construction Company have been forwarded to them and they have agreed to settle everything satisfactorily.\n\nMay I kindly advise you that some weeks ago when endeavoring to establish contact and get some satisfaction out of these people we finally had to request The Workmen's Compensation Board of Manitoba whose office is at Winnipeg to interview the Winnipeg Trustee Co., of Canada and the information given by such Company to the Manitoba Workmen's Compensation Board was that they had absolutely no funds on hand to meet our assessment. The report in question dated July 24th, 1930, states that monies were still in the hands of the Government of Canada and suggesting that we write to your Department in order to obtain satisfaction of the debt which has been referred to in our former correspondence with your office. It is possible, of course, that you may have paid over to the Winnipeg Trustee Co., of Canada, the amount due by your Department to the Wyndels Construction Co., Ltd., in satisfaction of the contract at a date subsequent to July 24th, in which case, of course, the statement already quoted herein, that they had absolutely no funds on hand, may not actually be the case. I am, therefore, writing again today to The Workmen's Compensation Board at Winnipeg sending them a copy of your own letter to us of September 17th and also a copy of this our acknowledgement and reply to you in order that they will understand the situation.\n\nIn our letter to The Workmen's Compensation Board of Manitoba, we are asking them to interview the Winnipeg Trustee Co., of Canada to ask for a definite de-\ncision as to whether such Trustee Company is now in a position to make payment of our assessment or whether we shall be required to collect from your Department under the terms and provisions of Section 36-2 of The Workmen's Compensation Act of this Province, such having been quoted to you in the last paragraph of our letter of the 3rd instant. As soon as any communication is received in reply from the Manitoba Board I will again get into touch with you on the subject in question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGWW/JL\n\nAsst.

The reason for the omission was because the painter talks but little English, and I evidently did not make him understand that only on receipt of the invoices for the extra glass could credit be given for it.\n\nThe Winnipeg Trustee Co. of Canada, who are looking after the Wyndels Estate, has recently forwarded to me the Pilkington invoices for the additional glass, and I am now able to voucher forward for payment this outlay of $72.53. In this list of glass are one or two windows which the Rev. Principal wished to be of obscure glass because of the fire escape giving vision through them.\n\nIn the specifications for the lights of front entrance, mention was made of the glass being 1/8\" plate, but Pilkingtons advise there is no plate glass on the market less than 1/4\", so we incurred the expense of the 1/4\", as shown on accompanying voucher.\n\nAs the final certificate has been given to the contractors, I thought the best way of dealing with this remnant was by Voucher, which I am accordingly enclosing.

I would therefore ask that I be authorized to spend $85.00 in making this change, as I do not see how we can get along without it.\n\nKindly let me know at the earliest possible moment so that I may give the necessary directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 6th instant, requesting authority to expend $85 in preparing accommodation for the bull in a shed at the rear of the barn at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the work required in making a secure place in the shed for the accommodation of this animal. The cost should be kept within your estimate. It is thought that the school staff themselves could carry out a certain amount of the work. The member of the staff responsible for the care of this animal should use every care to see that there is no danger of the bull incurring injury to any of the boys or other members of the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Orr,\n\nAt the time of your visit to Old Sun School, you asked me about our heating system, but as I had not had opportunity to test it out under proper conditions I said that I could not tell you anything about it. You then asked me to let you know how things were later on. I have now had opportunity to give it a good test and report as follows:\n\nThe main part of the building is in good working order, and now the equalizer is in, the boilers are O.K.. The only part of the building that causes difficulty is the residence (Principal's) and here it is almost impossible to get heat. When the boilers are running full blast, so that it is unbearably hot in the main building, we barely get the tops of our radiators hot in the residence. We freeze in the top bedrooms in mild weather.\n\nDuring our testing time I thought that I would try to get a fair idea of what temperatures we could obtain, so I used a maximum and minimum thermometer in my bedrooms. I found that the temperature never rose beyond 50 degrees, and usually stood at about 40. This was with both boilers going full and a calm day. That end is the North end, although I have not bothered to test it, I am certain that when slight breeze is blowing, the temperature would not be far off freezing point.\n\nWhen Mr Walker was down, I spoke to him about it, and he tested the radiators, finding them alright. He said that the only way to get heat to the residence was to carry a separate line direct from the boiler to that end of the building. In case you thought of doing that, he left a plug in the main line just above the equalizer.\n\nWith kindest regards, and many thanks for the interest you have taken in fitting the school out.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn W. House, Principal.\nOTTAWA.\nDec. 2, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. House,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the heating system at your school and am glad to have the information submitted.\n\nI am today directing a letter to the Indian Agent authorizing the installation of a separate steam main from the boiler to the residence. This, I think, will solve the difficulty.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. GUBBY ORR,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. John W. House,\nPrincipal, Old Sun's School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDec. 2, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been reported that it is difficult to heat the residence in the new Old Sun's School. To overcome this difficulty it will be necessary to run a separate main from the boiler to the residence and I would ask you to kindly arrange to have this done as soon as possible. Please consult with Mr. Walker and be guided by his instructions in this installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

Without any pressure showing on the gauge, every Rad in this part of the building was hot, and the temperature was 72\u00b0.\n\nThe House seems to be very pleased indeed, and I asked him to write you and explain just how he felt about the heating of his residence.\n\nIf you will remember, the dairy part of the building and the room where the storage tank was situated, the Rads in this part of the building would not heat up, and I was afraid that if we got a cold snap, that much damage would be caused to this tank, so I had the steam-fitter make some changes, with the result that the Rads now heat up very quickly, and there is absolutely no danger from freezing now.\n\nSince we made the changes to the heater in the Residence part of the building, the whole school seems to heat better, and on testing out, I found that every Rad in the building, with the exception of the basement Rads which are on the wall, would heat up with no pressure showing on the gauge. The boiler and Rads of course would heat up when slight pressure was put on the boiler.\nI also paid a visit to the Hospital Job. The new boiler is hooked up and everything appears to be heating nicely, but I will give it a thorough check over when the installation is finished.\n\nBy installing the steel boiler on this job, the heat was never cut off, as they had steam on the new boiler before they cut off the old one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Walker\n\nC. A. Dunham Company Ltd.,\nCalgary, British Columbia.\nJanuary 13, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Walker,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th and am very glad indeed to hear that the heating system at the Old Sun's School is giving such excellent satisfaction, the credit for which is due, I think, to your efforts.\n\nI am also pleased to learn that the Hospital job is getting along well and will be glad if you will make a thorough test when same is completed.\n\nWith best wishes for the new year, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

H. Lepper & Company, Calgary, Alta., for running separate heating main to the residence of the Old Sun School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated December 2, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Sir:\n\nRe attached Voucher #483 in favour of F.J. Lepper & Company, I have to report that the heating system at the Old Sun School is now working splendidly with uniform heat throughout the building and with a considerable saving in fuel.\n\nOn completion of the line to the residence it was noted that the subsidiary system for the laundry, dairy and pressure tank room was giving practically no heat. If it had been severely cold weather this would have been disastrous. Before working on this system, I had Mr. Lepper come from Calgary and explain, as best he could, what would be necessary to get heat into these rooms. As the electric pump was then installed for the long distance work to the residence, the work in putting the subsidiary system into good order was not great and was done before Mr. Lepper took his mechanics off the job.\n\nMr. Walker inspected the finished job and was satisfied all would work well now. The account is submitted for your disposal, please.\n\nPayable\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION       | WEIGHT | PRICE | EXTENSION | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------------|--------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| 1        | Only Peel Blade   | 9\"     | 1     | 90        |       |\n| 1        | \" Handle          | 12\"    | 1     | 1.00      |       |\n| 1        | Pallette Knife    | 8\"     | 1     | 65        |       |\n| 1        | Flour Sieve       | 18\"    | 1     | 1.50      |       |\n| 1        | Wood Scraper      | 7\"     | 1     | 45        |       |\n\nShipped to Old Sun School, Gleichen\nIndian Education Vote.\n\nOffice of the Blackfoot Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 27, 1931\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 428, amounting to $4.50 in favour of Watson & Campbell Limited, Calgary, Alta., for Bakery equipment for Old Sun School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. M.R.E.G.C. dated November 5/30 on his visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\n| ARTICLES          | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| List of households |                      |         |\n| Utensils          |                      |         |\n| Small tools       |                      |         |\n| Forth Sum         |                      |         |\n| School            |                      |         |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDept. of: [Department]\n\nCity or town: [City/Town]\n\nProvince: [Province]\n**Local Purchase\u2014Abstract of Tenders**\n\n| ARTICLES          | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTES | REMARKS |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|---------|\n|                   | McKayhow              |         |\n|                   | Peck                 |         |\n|                   | Redman               |         |\n|                   |                      |         |\n|                   |                      |         |\n|                   |                      |         |\n\n**Tenders called:** Nov 14, 1920 by letter phone  \n**Due:** Nov 21, 1920  \n**Opened:** Nov 21, 1920 by  \n\n**Firms Asked to Quote**\n\n- List of horsewhips\n- Umbrellas\n- Small tents\n\n**Total Value:**\n\n- Horsewhips: $305.40\n- Umbrellas: $339.63\n\n**Signed:** [Signature]\n\n**Date:** Jan 7, 1931\n\n**City or town:** [Blank]  \n**Province:** Alta.\n\n---\n\n**I recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.**\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION                                      | Folio | Charges | Credit | Balance |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Dec  | Palling Pan #2                                  |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Mixing bowl aluminum #4                         |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Bread & Cake Box 33 (0.25)                      |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Set tea coffee cups white                        |       |         |        |         |\n|      | 3 layer cake pans (Jelly Molds)                 |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Fish slice #71                                  |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Set 3 brocking milk jugos 3/4 yellow            |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Jar lase box #2                                 |       |         |        |         |\n|      | White enamel chamber rail #4                    |       |         |        |         |\n|      | CataloPat #10                                   |       |         |        |         |\n|      | Glo.

Boux, plastering contractor for the Wyndels Construction Co.\n\nIn reply I can only express my amazement that this firm has waited until this late day before notifying either the Department, or the Inspector on the job, of the existence of this unpaid balance. Had they given notice of it at the proper time their account would have been protected in common with the other unpaid accounts of creditors. I received no word of any kind from any source that there was any money due to this firm, and therefore no consideration was given by me to an account that I did not know existed, in the preparation of the final certificate.\n\nMuch as I regret the circumstance, it seems to me that this firm have themselves to blame for their surprising tardiness in giving due notice of their outstanding balance.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nJanuary 29, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 20th of December I have today received a letter from the party who acted as Inspector of Construction during the erection of the Old Sam's Indian Residential School, and I am advised by him that he had not been notified by you before the final certificate was issued of the balance due it was not considered when he was making out his final certificate. For payment of this account you will, therefore, have to communicate with the Winnipeg Trust Co., to whom the balance of this contract was paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. H. L.

The plastering contractor is, in turn, an irresponsible party against whom there would be no object in taking legal action.\n\nWe are investigating this matter further and will communicate with you later in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.E.A.\nWESTERN MANAGER.\n284 Stradbrook Ave.,\nWinnipeg Man.

H. J. Dennis Mgr.\nCOPY OF LETTER\n\nWinnipeg Man.\n\nFebruary 24th 1931.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Gooderham\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGlenichen, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nSince returning to Winnipeg I have gone carefully into the matter of the best kind of weatherstrip to make the new Old Sun School dust-proof, and strongly recommend the \"Peace\" weatherstrip, samples of which I am forwarding to you by rapid mail today. Enclosed herewith you will find the original of a letter from the Manager of the Peace Weatherstrip Company and a copy of the same, giving the price per foot of the different kinds of weatherstrip for windows, French windows and doors. The \"Peace\" weatherstrip double brass grooves is dearer than the other kinds but it is undoubtedly the best for the windows. You will note that there is a weatherstrip meeting rail to close up the space where the upper and lower sashes meet. This seems to me to be very important. I may state for your information that I have consulted Mr. Clayton of the Clayton Co Ltd., who built our Blood School, also Mr. James O'Keefe built our Sioux Lookout school, and Mr. James T. H. Matteson, chief architect of the Dominion Govt. in this city, and all three men spoke in the highest terms of the \"Peace\" weatherstrip and of Mr. H.J. Dennis the manager of this company. I have therefore the fullest confidence in recommending that the \"Peace\" weatherstrip be utilized in making the Old Sun School dust-proof. There are other kinds of weather-strip but they will not be so practical. I shall be glad to be guided in the course of the decision which you and your Department may reach in this important matter.\n\nI have not forgotten the question of the terrazzo floors but so far have been unable to locate the firm that installed them. I asked Mr. Inspector Bunn to help me in this matter but he had no information on record.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned: T.B. Westgate.\nMarch 3, 1931.\n\nAttention Mr. R.C. Orr,\n\nRe: Old Sun School windows & doors\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach hereto copies of letters from Dr. Westgate and the Manager of the Peace Weatherstrip Company of Winnipeg. Considerable time and thought has been given to find a remedy for the loose and shrunk condition of the windows and doors. Various schemes were suggested by local contractors but nothing appeared to be entirely satisfactory.\n\nAfter the school opening Dr. Westgate kindly offered to get data in Winnipeg and his letter is the result. Where some windows have shrunk, a strip of wood will be necessary as well as the weather strip, I believe. This is mentioned because the \"Peace\" factor may not apply to this. It was ascertained in February that it is almost impossible to get windows or wooden construction which will not shrink and become loose in this dry climate. This is certainly evident at Old Sun school as most particle rail windows are loose in every direction and basement windows have shrunk and even warped to the extent that they are far from weather proof.\n\nThere is a heavy dust storm today and I believe the standard grommet \"Peace\" strip is the only thing that will keep most of the dust out of the building. On such a day the school is a terrible mess. Something must be done and it is presumed that you are familiar with this weather strip. The Principal advises me that the Company has offered measurements of all windows and doors and have been given the information. Awaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| DATE       | ARTICLE                                                                 | FOLIO | CREDIT | DEBIT | TOTAL |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Oct. 16    | 9 Hours Time, Basement 4                                                 |       |        |       |       |\n|            | Closet - Ventilation                                                    |       |        |       |       |\n|            | Bath, Basin                                                            |       |        |       |       |\n|            | 8 Blue Putty                                                           |       |        |       |       |\n|            | 10 lbs.

The writer took this up with Mr. Gardner Smith who recommended that Mr. Michael do the necessary work and submit the account through the Department to the Wyndell Construction Co. of St. Boniface. I believe I brought this to the attention of Mr. Orr and he instructed me to submit the account direct to the Department.\n\nMr. Michael also had to fix basins and bath tubs. The basins had fallen away from the wall and it was necessary to drill through the concrete wall to hold them firm. With regard to the bath tubs, the floor connections were leaking. In the basement the overhead closet tanks did not have proper trip. It was found that twisted wire had been used to make a connection and the wire had straightened out. He also had to solder rings to chains. The ash hoist also had to be bolted through the concrete wall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn Account With\n\nL.

This was necessary in laundry to hold steam in dryer. The new stove had to be installed and bricked as no water front was put on it.\n\nPlease note also the sum of $114.80 for safety guards on laundry machines. The necessity for these was apparent from the first and a diagram showing what was necessary was sent to Western Steel Products Co. at Calgary and this Company made the guards. The cost was greater than expected but investigation showed it to be unusual work and also that it was made to comply with regulations of the Factories Act of the province of Alberta.\n\nAlso please note the repair to motor which I pump water in the barn. The total cost is $31.60. This item is included though it is not known whether or not the account should be met by the M.S.I.O., neither the writer or the Principal knew at the time.

In his reply, just received this morning, he mentions the following items:\n\nBUILDINGS:\n(1) Poultry house with a capacity of 200 birds. Estimated cost $400.00. The Principal states that the present building has been condemned as useless by a Government Inspector.\n\n(2) Piggery. Estimated cost $400.00. The building now used for this purpose is less suitable than the one used for the poultry.\n\nEQUIPMENT:\n(1) One waggon complete with high boxes and broad tires. The Principal states that with one waggon it is impossible to haul the school's supply of coal and the Railway Co. charges demurrage after the car has been on the siding for two days.\n\n(2) Electric ironer, 54\". The Principal stated that this method of ironing would be cheaper to operate than the coal stove which is in use at present. Cost?\n(3) An electric scrubber and polisher for the terrazzo floor. Estimated cost about $600.00.\n\nFor some reason or other which the school management have not been able to ascertain, very fine sand-like dust keeps coming out of the terrazzo, and the Matron finds it impossible to keep the building clean. I have been unable to find out the name of the firm who installed the terrazzo, and beg to suggest that you direct their attention to this defect in their workmanship.\n\n(4) All the doors and windows should be supplied with weatherstrip on account of the dust storms which are frequent in that part of the country. In a letter dated March 5, the Principal wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"We have just had two solid days of dust and everything looks like it. On Tuesday it was like a London fog and we had to burn lights all day. The inside of the school is like a ploughed field. Russian thistles were piled up around the girls' entrance, but to such a height that the Head Matron could not see out of her window, and they are hanging on everything outside.\"\n\nI took this matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham when I visited this school at the time of the official opening Feb. 17th., and have since written to him very fully recommending strongly that the \"Lease patent metal weatherstrip\" be supplied, before taking this recommendation I consulted contractors who have already built schools for your Department, also Mr. Inspector Bunn, and Resident Architect H. E. Macdonald, Chief Architect's Branch, Public Works of the Dominion Government in this city, and all were of the opinion that no better weatherstrip is on the market. The Manager, Mr. H. J. Dennis, 285 Stradbrookes Avenue, Winnipeg, submitted samples and estimates, and these were forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham. As the health of the staff and pupils and the efficient management of the school will be influenced by this improvement, I beg to request that it receive your prompt and favourable consideration.\"\n(5) Provision for watering stock on the pasture land.\n\nThere are about 800 acres of pasture land without any water supply whatever except in the well which was put down in the basement of the old mission house about half a mile away from the school. The Principal suggests that a windmill and trough might be installed at this well for watering purposes, and I commend this suggestion on your sympathetic consideration. I would also commend to your sympathetic consideration the question of having the land attached to the school connected up with the irrigation system which I was informed is to be brought to the town of Clecheren. The Principal was of the opinion that this connection could be made without an exorbitant expenditure, and I beg to recommend that you ask Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham to take up the matter and furnish you with further detailed information.\n\nThe question of meeting the cost of light and power at this school is giving our Commission a great deal of anxiety at present. At the time of my visit to the school last February I was informed that an expert from the Calgary Power Company was about to visit the school and I awaited a report on his finding before taking the matter up with you. In a letter, dated March 16th, the Principal states that this expert visited the school but could not see much possibility of a reduction in the cost of the power consumed, as the equipment installed required the full capacity of power to operate it. He states that the cost of power alone will be between $50.00 and $60.00 per month the year around.\n\nWith regard to the cost of light, he states that the only possible way of effecting a reduction would be by substituting bulbs of smaller wattage for those already in use. In a number of the rooms this could not be done without injury to the eyesight of the staff and pupils, but that smaller bulbs might be used in the dormitories. The chief consumption of light, the Principal states, is in the basement and in the corridors which are so dark that some of the lights must be kept going all day. The bills for December (only half the month full operation) amounted to $100.80; for January $116.30; for February $102.70 (figures quoted from the Principal's letter). He estimates that the cost of light and power for the year will not be less than $1,750.00 with an additional sum of $50.00 for new bulbs, fuses, etc.\nIn the light of these figures you will understand the anxiety of our Commission as to how so heavy an expenditure is to be met with the present pupilage, and at the present rate of the per capita grant of only $165.00 a year.\n\nI took this matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham at the time of my visit, and informed him that our Commission would be obliged to ask for some help in meeting this heavy expenditure.\n\nI shall be obliged, therefore, if you will give this matter careful consideration and arrange to provide the additional financial help required in any way within your power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nGleichen, Alta.\nMarch 31, 1931.\n\nAttention Mr. F.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the list of buildings, equipment, etc., furnished you by the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nRelative to the erection of a poultry house and piggery, I have to say that the Department has no funds at present to provide the cost of these buildings. We are not prepared to supply an electric ironer, and an electric scrubber and floor polisher are not supplied.\n\nRegarding the question of meeting the cost of light and power, I have to regret that the Department will be unable to provide for this expense. It is the practice to ask the school management to pay for electricity from per capita earnings or other receipts. Our funds for the next fiscal year will be extremely limited, and I regret that only the more urgent buildings, equipment, etc., can be favourably considered.\n\nYou will be written in separate communications regarding the farm wagon; the supplying of weatherstrip; the installing of a windmill and trough for watering purposes and the question of having the school land connected up with the irrigation system in the town of Gleichen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Orr,\n\nRE: Old Sun School windows and doors.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach hereto copies of letters from Dr. Westgate and the Manager of the Pease Weatherstrip Company of Timmins. Considerable time and thought has been given to find a remedy for the loose and shrunk condition of the windows and doors. Various schemes were suggested by local contractors but nothing appeared to be entirely satisfactory.\n\nAfter the school opening, Dr. Westgate kindly offered to get data in Canada and his letter is the result. Where windows have shrunk, a strip of wood will be necessary as well as the leather strip, I believe. This is mentioned because the \"Pease\" people have not realized this. It was ascertained in Calgary that it is almost impossible to get windows of wooden construction which will not shrink and become loose in this dry climate. This is certainly evident at Old Sun School as most existing rail windows are loose in every direction and adjacent windows have shrunked and even warped to the extent that they are far from weather proof.\n\nThere is a heavy dust storm today and I believe the standard groove \"Pease\" strip is the only thing that will keep most of the dust out of the building. On such a day the school is a terrible mess. Something must be done and it is presumed that you are familiar with this weatherstrip. The Principal advises me that the Company asked for measurements of all windows and doors and have been given the information.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. J. Gooderham\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOPY OF LETTER.\n\nWinnipeg Van.\nFeb 26th, 1881.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nSince returning to Winnipeg I have gone carefully into the matter of the best kind of weatherstrip to make the new Old Sun School dust-proof, and strongly recommend the \"Peace\" weatherstrip, samples of which I am forwarding to you by parcel post today. Enclosed herewith you will find the original of a letter from the manager of the Peace Weatherstrip Company and a copy of the same, giving the prices per foot of the different kinds of weatherstrip for windows, French windows and doors. The \"Peace\" weatherstrip costs brass 40cvs. is cheaper than the other lines, but it is undoubtedly the best for the windows. You will note that there is a weatherstrip sealing rail to close up the space where the upper and lower sashes meet. This seems to me to be very important. I may state for your information that I have consulted Mr. Taylor of the Harbour Co. Ltd., who built our block school, and Mr. Matthews, Chief Architect of the Dominion Govt. In this City and all the men stood in the highest terms of the \"Peace\" weatherstrip and of Mr. Smith, the manager of this Company. I have, therefore, the fullest confidence in recommending that the \"Peace\" weatherstrip be utilized in making the Old Sun School dust-proof. There are other lines of weatherstrip but they will not be so successful. I shall be glad to be advised in the course of the decision which you and your Department may reach in this important matter.\n\nI have not forgotten the question of the terrazo floors but so far have been unable to locate the firm that installs them. I asked Inspector Dunn to help me in this matter but he had no information or record.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.B.C.

In regard to the condition of the windows, I am attaching hereto a complete copy of all correspondence forwarded at that time.\n\nSomething must be done but I am not sufficiently conversant with this type of construction to give any recommendation. I do know that there is 3/8\" to 1/4\" play in practically all the windows and during the past month, when the district experienced the worst dust storms ever seen in these parts, it was nearly impossible to live in the building. Pupils were put to bed with chest pains and it is reasonable to assume that the fine dust was the cause. Today the principal and a mechanic are taking the extractor pieces and cleaning out the duct. This machine was so clogged with dust that it didn't work. I mention these things to show the urgency of necessary improvements and hope that something will be done to the windows at an early date.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 1C, Volume 6369, File 759-5, part 7)\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your B.12 of the 29th ultimo, with enclosures, concerning the advisability of having weather strip placed on the windows and doors at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.

PAUL, ALTA.\n\nMay 13th, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nRe: the new Old Swan School, Gleichen\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 7th inst. with regard to looseness of windows at the above school I would say that at the time they were installed they were fitted as tightly as would allow of their working at all. Any looseness now existing can only be the result of the inevitable shrinkage of winter construction followed by the extreme dry weather of summer.\n\nI am inclined to think that the conditions have been somewhat exaggerated, but when next in Calgary I shall go on to Gleichen and check over the building, especially the windows, and shall then report back to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction\nOLD SUN'S C. OF E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nAs this school has just recently been opened, there is very little that I can report upon. At the time of my visit there were 72 children in residence. There is practically an entirely new staff at this institution. The Rev. J. W. House, is in charge as Principal, and the staff consists of 10 - 7 women and 3 men, including the Principal. From my observations of Mr. House and the staff, I would say that there is quite an improvement here. The Principal is energetic and active, and appears to have some force behind him.\n\nNaturally, a man of this type would demand a better staff, and I would say, from the Department's point of view, that this part, which is an important one, is quite satisfactory.\n\nThere is a tremendous lot of work to be done around the premises in the way of cleaning up, re-arranging the grounds, and getting them in shape, and a good start has certainly been made.\n\nThe farming operations are very discouraging as the top soil on their farm land, consisting of approximately 300 acres, had practically all blown away. This land is comparatively light, and it is absolutely useless to try to farm it under present conditions. One hundred acres have been sown to coarse grain, and 40 acres to grass. It is the intention of the Agent and Principal to seed all this land to grass and coarse grain. Feed is going to be a valuable asset in this part of the country, and hay would be of just as much value to the school as grain. The Agent had already suggested to the Principal that he break up 100 acres of prairie land, which is available.\navailable in the valley towards the river from the school. I think this would be a good idea as no doubt there is more moisture there and less wind. This land could be used for the purpose of sowing wheat, oats, etc. The Principal, however, did not know whether he would have time to break up this land this summer or not. As an old irrigation ditch runs around this land, if surplus water comes down through the C.P.R. spillway, they might be able to irrigate this part at very little cost. The matter is being looked into by the Agent.\n\nThe school has a very good herd of milk cows, 12 in number, mostly holsteins, 10 of which were milking, so the children are getting an ample supply of milk. They have approximately 25 head of cattle altogether, and 11 good horses. The Principal brought to my attention the fact that he needs a holstein bull as the one he has should be destroyed as he has become quite vicious. It occurred to me that Dr. Murray had a 4 yr. old bull which we purchased from the C.P.R. Farm at Strathmore, and for which he has no further use. I advised Mr. House to see this bull, and told him that the Department might be willing to turn it over to him. If he decides that this animal would be suitable, a request will no doubt be made by the Agent.\n\nPigs and chickens are also kept at the school. The boys do the milking in the winter, and the girls in the summer.\n\nThe school building, as you are aware, is new; it was only opened in February of this year. They are experiencing a great deal of difficulty in connection with the windows. They have shrunk until there is a space of about\nOLD SUN C. OF E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nabout one-eighth of an inch between the outside of the window and the casing. The dust that has been blowing in is terrible; although they still had all the storm windows on, there was dust all through the building. It was being cleaned up all the time, but there was so much of it coming in that it was impossible to keep it clean. The Agent has taken up with the Department the matter of tightening the windows, but nothing definite had been decided upon. I wish to point out that something should be done to remedy this condition as, when winter comes, if the windows are not tightened up in some way, there will be sufficient cold air coming in to make the school impossible to live in.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Thanking you for your kindly interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. What do you wish done with the plans?\nSt. Paul, Alta. June 15, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Windows at Old Suns School, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nNo. 104-1-5.\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 7th regarding reported looseness of windows in the above school, I may say that on the 5th instant I visited this school, as instructed, and made a careful inspection. I was accompanied by the Indian Agent, Mr. Gooderham, and by the Rev. Principal, Mr. House.\n\nThere has been very little, if any, more than normal shrinkage in these windows. It is impossible to fit windows so tightly under winter-time construction that when they become exposed to the extreme heat and dryness of southern Alberta's summer climate a certain looseness will not develop. At the time these windows were fitted, the painters complained that it was almost impossible to raise them. However, regardless of the cause, it must be admitted that a considerable shrinkage has taken place, with very trying consequences to the inmates of the building, as I shall try to point out.\n\nIt may be recalled that in my regular reports sent to the Department during the construction of this school, I made references to the frequent and almost overpowering dust storms driven over the school site by the strong prevailing west winds. So bad was this condition at times that it seriously interfered with the progress of the work, and the workmen had to be supplied with fur-lined aviator's goggles to enable them to carry on. As the building approached completion it was found that even then, with absolutely tight windows, the fine smoke-like dust penetrated to some extent, to the great chagrin of the plasterers and painters.\n\nSince the completion and occupancy of the school the conditions have grown worse. The windows have inevitably become somewhat looser, and raging west winds have forced dust into the building to an almost unbelievable extent. To appreciate fully the conditions it may be well to point out that Old Suns School finds itself in the very path of a dust blizzard every time the prevailing west wind blows, during dry weather; and as the late seasons have been unusually dry, with abnormally frequent and high winds, this condition has been the rule rather than the exception. To make matters still worse, there is a large field of summer fallow S.W. of the school where it has been the intention to get a catch of hay, but owing to\nsuccessive dry seasons this has been found impossible, and the necessary working of the land to keep down weeds, has had the result of providing a never failing dust reservoir for the winds to draw upon. Apart from this, the lightness of the soil in the locality is such that this particular location will always be subject to more than the usual amount of dust. Even the added protection of storm-windows is not sufficient to prevent dust penetration, and additional special protection seems called for.\n\nPrevious to visiting the school I took some pains to investigate what was being done elsewhere to exclude dust. I found that in the Calgary schools it had been found necessary to provide the windows with additional protection, and that the school architect, after investigating the various weather strips on the market, has had 21 schools equipped with Chamberlin Metal Weather Strips. The new Post Office building now being completed in Calgary is being similarly equipped with Chamberlin window protection; also Lethbridge schools.\n\nAfter consulting with the Indian Agent and Rev. Principal, I phoned Mr. Stanley Ford, the Calgary representative of the Chamberlin line, and he came to the school for the purpose of seeing for himself the existing conditions, and to prepare an estimate for installing the Chamberlin protection on the windows and doors of Old Suns School. Mr. Ford was asked to submit alternative tenders, one for equipping all the windows and outside doors; and one for equipping part only, the idea in the latter case to give protection where the access of dust is the worst, with a view to the rest being done later. It will be noted that for complete protection the quotation is $95.00; and for partial protection where the conditions are the worst, the quotation is $545.00, the expectation being that the cost of the complete protection might be deferred to another year, if necessary. Now that the maximum shrinkage has taken place, I should prefer seeing the complete job done while the workmen are there, if the necessary funds are available, and if the Chamberlin proposals meet with the Department's endorsement.\n\nI enclose correspondence and tenders on the Chamberlin line submitted by Mr. Ford for the consideration of the Department. The quotations are slightly less than I expected (a most unusual event) and I believe that the proposed protection would prove efficacious in removing what is at times an almost unbearable condition, or at any rate in very greatly ameliorating it. Mr. Ford will guarantee the Chamberlin protection to keep out 90% of the dust. There are other lines of window strips on the market, but I do not care to recommend costly experiments.\n\nShould the Department sanction proceeding with this proposed installation, the Rev. Principal would like the work to be done during the approaching school vacation.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files,\n(RG 10, Volume 6360, File 758-5, Part 7)\nOttawa, June 26, 1931.\n\nIf it is decided to place metal weather strips on the Indian school at Gleichen, kindly report as to the quality and probable cost of material required.\n\nMr. Stanley Ford, c/o Dr. D.

Mr. Gardner Smith, at the request of the Department, made an inspection and he believes it advisable to improve conditions at this school. Mr. Stanley Ford, of Calgary, who is favourably mentioned in your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, has quoted $695 for a complete job and $645 for weather stripping for the most exposed parts of the building.\n\nNo funds were provided for this purpose and the Miscellaneous item in the Indian Education Vote has but $3,000 unassigned.

Gooderham Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nGlenchen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter the experience of last Monday's dust storm, I am of the opinion that we made a mistake in not including the main entrance doors of this school in our estimate for weatherstrip.\n\nThese doors, having vestibules, were not considered necessary at the time, so were omitted, as you will note by referring to your office copy. We are now convinced that they should have been included. I would also like to state that the plans did not indicate how the transom windows over the fire-escape doors and chapel windows were set in place. These are all movable instead of being fixed as is usually the case in buildings of this type.\n\nThese transoms and entrance doors should most certainly be weatherstripped and I beg to quote you the sum of Forty Dollars ($40.00) for this extra work.\n\nI have also been asked by Mr. House to quote you to equip the Engineer's house, and beg to say that it would cost for all outside windows and doors, the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) not including basement windows.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nSigned: Stanley Ford.\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder authority of your letter of July 8th last, Mr Stanley Ford of Calgary has proceeded with the work of installing Chamberlin weatherstrip on windows and certain doors of the Old Sun School. It would appear that Mr. Ford's tender did not include certain moveable transoms and entrance doors and the Principal is very anxious to have these weatherstripped.\n\nHe also makes a request to have the Farm Instructor's house equipped with weatherstripping. The windows are very loose and something must be done to make them more weather proof.\n\nI submit herewith a copy of Mr. Ford's letter giving quotations on this work.

Such heaters have a much longer life than a cast iron heater and use less fuel.\n\nAlso have the safety valve placed direct on the heater not in a remote position as at present.\n\nI am yours very truly\n\n(Signed) A. W. Dick\nGleichen, Alta.\nDecember 28th 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe hot water service heating element at Old Sun School was broken by an explosion during the early hours of December 13th. Fortunately, no one was near when the explosion took place. The Principal reported the matter later on in the day and it was decided to call in the boiler Inspector for the Province of Alberta and have him examine and report. He made his inspection on the 14th and a copy of his report is submitted herewith.\n\nThere is nothing further to be said, except of course, that this institution must have a replacement as early as possible.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing copy of the report of the Provincial Inspector of Boilers on the explosion of the hot water service heating element in the Old Sun Indian Residential School. It is noted that the Inspector did not find the explosion due to neglect in attendance but owing to the heating element not being of proper strength to stand the pressure of the system.\n\nAs it is necessary that replacement be made, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a steel heater having an ample number of head holes to facilitate the cleaning out. Proper safety appliances should be installed on both heater and storage tank, and the installation inspected by the Provincial Boiler Inspector before the heater is used. You have not stated the cost of supplying and installing the new heater. I have to request that you will see that the total cost of this work is kept down to the lowest possible point. After same has been satisfactorily installed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Our Commission have the same rule.\n\nNone of us doubt the wisdom of such a regulation but there are certain difficulties accompanying the carrying out of it that, in this school, are of a serious nature.\n\nWe have already had an attempt by an outside Indian to gain admission to the Senior Girls' dormitory and have had our store room entered with intention to steal.\n\nOur fire escape doors enter rooms as follows:\nTwo open directly into the Junior dormitories on the top floor. On the Senior floor, the girls' escape goes through a Staff bedroom and out to the stair. On the boys' side, the escape is opening from what we call our \"bale room\". It is a store room for all our clothing, bedding etc. In order to have this escape open we have to leave one door open to the boys inside, and another to the outside Indians. We have no other room we can change into a bale room, so we cannot avoid this. On the main floor one escape goes through the Matron's bedroom and the other through the boys' club room.\n\nNow as these rooms are in such places that they cannot be continually under supervision, we shall have to have some means of knowing when the fire escape doors and that to the bale room are opened. I have investigated the ways of doing this and think that a burglar proof system should be installed, such as was explained to us by Mr.Cole. The cost of this would be approximately $100.00.\n\nWould you please take this up with the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGIGNED: John W.House\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach hereto a letter from the Principal of Old Sun Residential School relative to Fire Escapes and Protection.\n\nFire escapes at this institution are situated so that access to private quarters and to store rooms is unavoidable. It is not reasonable to expect doors leading in or out of these rooms to be left unlocked. The suggested burglar alarm system will solve the problem and will be further protection against illicit entry into dormitories.\n\nThe cost is based on wholesale prices submitted by the Canadian General Electric Company of Calgary plus cost of installation. If the Department has funds to install such a system in this school, I believe the expenditure is justified. Your reply will be awaited with interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 2, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School regarding the installing of a burglar proof system on the doors leading to the fire escapes.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it is considered the system suggested by the Principal is too expensive. Where it is necessary to have the exits leading to the fire escapes locked from the outside, it is thought that a suitable door lock could be installed - one where the outside door lock refuses to turn the lock and the inside one opens freely. There are comparatively inexpensive sets of this kind on the market - for example, a lock of the Yale type. It is thought this would be less expensive and just as suitable as an electric alarm bell. Could not a lock of this type be installed, which would prevent access to the school by way of the fire escapes? The school authorities should be able to arrange that the pupils would not leave the school by the fire escapes, except in case of fire or during fire drill.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The suggestion of the Department, that locks which will only open from the inside of our fire escape doors, is not any more protection than the catches we have already installed, and has the disadvantage of being more complicated for little children. Any expense on an installation of that kind would be wasted.\n\nThe difficulty of the whole situation lies in this. Being right on the Reserve, with numbers of young men looking for something to do all around us, there is nothing to prevent one of my children being intimidated by them and getting up in the middle of the night and admitting as many as like to come. Once inside the whole school is open to them. The first thing I know I shall find some of my big girls pregnant and then the damage is done. It isn't fair to take a girl away from her parents and make her sleep in dormitories that are unsafe from outside or even our inside boys. To imagine that any school management can prevent such a thing happening when doors are at the mercy of Indian Children is absolutely unreasonable. I wouldn't have one of my own girls in a school where such a condition existed and neither would any other father. Since we have already had evidence of the desire of outside boys to get into our girls even with locked doors, our fears are by no means groundless.\n\nThen, on two floors the fire exits are through our store room and staff bedrooms. The latter are alright, but having to have both entrances of the Store room at the mercy of anyone is surely not businesslike. This cannot be altered, because I have no other room available as a store room.\n\nNow I think that unprotected doors in a school of this description, where everything is as fireproof as possible, is liable to result in more harm to the children than locked fire escapes. Our Fire protection and drill is fairly efficient, so that even with locked doors the chances of children being damaged in case of fire, are very remote; but the possibility of immorality and theft are at a maximum, unlocked doors that are not properly protected.\nIf the Department is not willing to send $166.00 in a system of protection which will be adequate, there is the alternative of withdrawing their ruling about locked fire escapes and leave that question to my own common sense. I would say that the doors were open because it is better to be prepared when children's lives are at stake, but I have no doubt that we could get everyone out before fire did much damage here, under almost any condition.\n\nIt seems as though there is no halfway house in this question; it is a matter of either doing the thing properly or leaving it alone. The matter of saving a few dollars should not enter into the consideration when the price of saving is either the lives or morality of children.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering yours of the 2nd inst. in which you state that a burglar system to fire-escapes at Old Sun School is too expensive and suggest instead Yale type locks, I attach hereto a letter from the Principal of the school in which he clearly explains the situation.\n\nThe hook now used on the inside of the doors leading on to the escapes is quite as effective as a Yale lock and certainly much cheaper. Neither is of any value when a scheme has been arranged between pupils and outsiders to get in or out of the school. Inside doors cannot be fitted with either hook or lock if the regulations in connection with fire escapes are to be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 21, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School with reference to the installing of a system that would make the exits to the fire escape safe from entrance from the outside.\n\nIn reply I have to say that in view of the Principal's report regarding this matter, the Department will approve of an alarm system being placed on two doors where necessary. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the materials required and for the installation of the alarm system. The cost of the materials and installation should be kept as low as possible.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. Estimates dated 1932/33.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, November 2nd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your Voucher No. 314, for $34.84, covering the cost of repairs to barn pump at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you quote as authority for this expenditure \"Estimates 1932-33\". You should obtain specific authority from the Department before incurring any expenditure and not proceed with same simply because it was included in your estimates.\n\nIs the pump which has recently been repaired the same as the one for which a charge of $10.15 was included in your Voucher No. 230? It is also noted that the amount of $34.84 includes 14 hours' labour at $1.10 an hour. This appears rather high.\n\nConsideration of payment of this account will be withheld until full explanations are received from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nNovember 8, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering yours of the 2nd instant, with respect to Voucher No 314 in favour of L. Michael for repairs to the pump at Old Sun School barn, I beg to say that the Principal of the School reported that it was practically impossible to get sufficient water for the stock from the well as the pump was not working properly. This is a deep well pump so I called up L. Michael to report on the matter.\n\nMichael with assistance from the school went ahead and had to do considerable work in his shop besides using his car to haul material from his shop to the job. Michael is a first class mechanic besides being a plumber and steam fitter and works very rapidly. In fact, there is no one in the district available who has the necessary tools to do this class of work.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. Michael regarding his charges stating that I considered $1.10 per hour rather high and he has consented to accept $1.00 for future work. This wage is much less than that paid in Calgary for similar work and with the equipment available. The job was an emergency and fortunately was completed in the nick of time as a few days afterwards, the pump which supplies the water for the school broke down and the water supply was obtained from the barn well.\n\nThe item on Voucher #230 amounting to $10.15 was for work done on the pump which supplies the school and not the barn well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe septic system at the Farming Instructor's house at Old Sun School is not working properly. In fact, in the vicinity of this building, the soil is so saturated that the sewerage oozes out to the surface.\n\nWhile Mr. Petterley was taking levels for the proposed irrigation system, he took levels about this house and tells me that it will be necessary to dig a ditch at least 300 feet long and lay tile into a new field. This is necessary since the condition of this sewerage is, to say the least, a danger to the health of the people who occupy the house as well as to the pupils at the school.\n\nThe cost of the tile will amount to $30.00, and as the work will be done by the school no further expenditure will be incurred. Is the Department prepared to authorize this expenditure?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the septic system at the farm instructor's residence at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. It is noted that the soil in the vicinity of this building is so saturated with sewage that it will be necessary to dig a ditch and lay tile into a new field, and that the cost of the tile will be approximately $30.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding the above amount in the purchase of the tile required. The work in digging the new ditch, laying the tile and refilling the ditch is to be carried out by the school authorities without expense to the Department. After you have purchased the tile, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

November 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI am herewith enclosing a Blackfoot Agency Voucher amounting to $153.65, in connection with repairing the pumping plant at the Old Sun's Residential School. I am also enclosing a copy of Mr. Gooderham's letter, and wish to state, that as you will note from his letter, this was not authorized by me, but I was down there at the time they were repairing the plant, and can say that this expenditure was absolutely necessary and urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS - CANADA\n\nOffice of Indian Agent,\nGlenchen, Alberta,\nNovember 25th, 1932\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Voucher No. 367\n\nI enclose herewith Voucher #367 in favour of L. Michael of Glenchen, for the sum of $153.65 for repairs to the pumping plant at Old Sun Residential School.\n\nAs I reported to you previously, the deep-seated pumping plant at this institution broke down on Sunday, October 2nd, and in a few hours no water was available for the school. I immediately secured the services of Mr. L. Michael and on inspection he found that the repairs would take some time to effect. In the meantime the school was carrying water in limited quantities, of course, from the barn well. A large sprocket wheel was broken and this had to be taken to Calgary and electrically welded because a new wheel could only be secured in the United States, and this would take at least one month. So far, the welding has held. It was also necessary to get a new silent chain as the one in use had stretched and could not be repaired.\n\nI draw all this to your attention because the Department has not yet been advised, and recent letters and circulars emphatically state that emergency expenditures must be reported immediately. This pump has been a continual source of trouble. I believe it is required to lift too great a weight of water at each stroke as it is equipped with a 3/4\" pipe. The cause of the trouble has not yet been definitely ascertained. Fluctuations in voltage in the power line were suspected and the Calgary Power Company installed a volt meter to check this up. Whatever the cause, the pump had to be repaired as quickly as possible and Mr. Michael had done good work and his account is less than I expected.\n\nI also attach Crane's account for material supplied and you will note that L. Michael has charged less than Crane. It will be appreciated if you will forward this voucher to Ottawa and return Michael's account with Crane.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"G.H. GOODERHAM\"\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nNovember 30, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe hot water boiler at Old Sun Residential School has sprung a leak in two of the tubes and cannot be used. I have instructed Mr. Michael to give me a report on necessary repairs and he informs me that it may be necessary to purchase two new tubes in order to place the boiler in working order and the cost should not exceed $25.00. I would therefore ask for authority to proceed with the repairs.\n\nI may say that this boiler was installed about 8 months ago by the F.H. Lepper Co Ltd of Calgary and I wrote this Company explaining the matter and asked them if this trouble was due to faulty installation and if they would consider making the necessary repairs at no cost to the Department. They are not prepared to do this and they claim that the leak may be due to peculiarities in the water, probably lime, and that the deposit will increase very rapidly in another year or so. Under these circumstances, I did not think it necessary to call on this firm to come from Calgary to do the work when Mr. Michael is on the spot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:-\n\nDuring the cold spell last month, a radiator in the veranda off the infirmary at the Old Sun Residential school burst. On inspection, the local plumber found that four sections were damaged beyond repair. The Peace Foundry Co of Toronto are the manufacturers of this radiator and as they have no Agents in this part of the country, it will be necessary to order from Toronto. It is estimated that the total of repairs will amount to $20.00. As the infirmary is in constant use the radiator must be repaired immediately and I beg to ask for authority to proceed.\n\nIt has been found very difficult to heat the South wing and it can only be concluded that the heating system is at fault somewhere. Some qualified engineer who has nothing to sell should be asked to look over the system and report on it. Possibly the trouble can be corrected at a small cost and as this condition may be serious in extremely cold weather, I think that something should be done as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDec. 9, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the hot water boiler at the Old Sun's Residential School, I beg to say that the Department approves of having the necessary repairs made.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant regarding the radiator on the verandah, you may also arrange to have the necessary repairs made. It is rather hard to understand why this radiator should have burst from freezing, as if the trap on the radiator is working properly there should be no water in the radiator.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter I note that there is difficulty in heating the south wing. If you will remember some changes were made in the heating system a few years ago, and this was supposed to have provided even and adequate heat for all of the building. If you think, however, that changes are needed I would ask you to kindly have Mr. A. Walker, who represents the Dunham Heating Co. in Calgary, make an inspection and report at the first opportunity. He is familiar with this installation and is probably in the best position to make a report and recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

In this connection I have to say that Mr. Inspector Christianson in a letter to the Department dated November 26th, last, enclosed a communication which he received from you, together with a voucher in favour of L. Michael, Gleichen, for the sum of $153.65 for emergency repairs to the pumping plant. Did not the repairs carried out by L. Michael place this pumping plant in a satisfactory condition, or is it necessary that further work be carried out? If so, you should furnish a full report as to the work required, giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

MacKinnon,\nInsurance Agent,\nDrumheller,\nAlberta.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, February 11th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will know that when Old Sun Residential School, on the Blackfoot Reserve, was destroyed by fire in June, 1928, that it was impossible to rebuild at that time until the Blackfoot Indians consented to loan $50,000.00 from their interest account to enable the work to proceed. The Department paid $40,000.00 from Appropriation and $50,000.00 from the funds of the Blackfoot Band, with the expectation that this money would be returned to the Band account. Owing to financial stringencies the money has not been returned to the account and it is considered that the Indians' interest in the building should be protected by placing fire insurance thereon.\n\nAccordingly it has been decided to place $40,000.00 fire insurance on the building itself in which the Indians have an interest, no insurance on the contents. You should consult Mr. C. A. McKinnon, Insurance Agent, of Drumheller, Alberta, to have this insurance placed on the building for $40,000.00. You should be able to give Mr. McKinnon full particulars as to the construction of this building which is considered fireproof. There is also water provided in case of fire and other precautions taken and it should be possible to secure a low rate of fire insurance on such building. It is advisable that the Insurance Agent himself should go over the building to determine the class of risk on which he is placing the insurance. The policy should be made to read that loss, if any, is payable to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and be forwarded here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen,\nAlta.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\nCALGARY, ALTA., January 26th, 1933.\n\nINSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON'S REPORT ON OLD SUN'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN THE BLACKFOOT AGENCY:\n\nDear Doctor McGill;\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Old Sun's School which I made on the 19th, instant, during my recent visit to the Blackfoot Agency.\n\nThere were 89 children present,\u201450 boys and 39 girls \u2014 which number is two in excess of the total enrolment.\n\nI spent all afternoon between the two classrooms of the school, and in my opinion, both teachers are very efficient in their work and are obtaining splendid results. Mr. Gooderham, the Agent, was with me, and we were both of the opinion that the children were responding well, taking into consideration that all the older children spend so much time out of the classroom.\n\nHEALTH:\n\nThe children presented a well-kept appearance, and they are evidently being well fed and cared for in every way. I checked up on the amount of milk they were receiving as well as other food, and they are receiving an abundance of everything. Seventeen cows were being milked, and at the present time they are getting an average of 350 gallons of milk per month. This supply is sufficient to provide all the milk required for the children as\nOLD SUN'S SCHOOL (Continued),\u2014\n\nHealth (Cont'd),\u2014\n\nwell as butter, which they have on the table at all meals.\n\nI checked over the clothing supply and found that they are well provided with changes of apparel.\n\nTRAINING OUTSIDE OF CLASSROOM WORK:\n\nI questioned the cook, girls' matron, &c., as to what instructions the girls were receiving in the way of cooking and other household work. I saw the girls at work doing cooking, sewing, ironing, &c., and must say they were doing very nicely. In the summer they are taught milking, but the boys do this during the rest of the year.\n\nThe boys at this institution do all the outside work. I have mentioned that they do most of the milking, and besides this they do practically all the work on the land as well as the general chores. One thing, however, that is certainly needed here is a work shop of some kind. No instructions in blacksmithing or carpentering can be given to the boys as they have no place to work. I wonder whether it would not be to the advantage of the Indians to build work shops at the two schools in this Agency out of Band Funds.\u2014I am quite sure that the Indians would readily agree to have this done, but I am merely putting this in the form of a suggestion.\n\nBUILDING:\n\nThe school itself, of course, is new, and in first class shape. It is evident that the best of care is being taken of the entire building and equipment. During the present fiscal year the following painting has been done on the interior...\nOLD SUN'S SCHOOL (Continued),-\n\nBuilding (Cont'd),-\n\nof the school by the staff and boys; the Department furnishing the paint: The corridor on the ground floor, bakery, staff dining room and pantry; Children's dining room, Principal's dining room and playroom.\n\nThe Principal also informed that they still have some paint on hand and the matter of painting would be gone on with in the spring. This is a step in the right direction, as the boys are thus taught how to do this kind of work, and the building is kept looking well at a very small cost.\n\nFARMING:\n\nThis school has about 1240 acres of land. They have 200 acres under cultivation and out of this acreage 60 were seeded down to grass. No wheat was threshed, but 1000 bushels of oats and 500 bushels of barley were harvested, as well as 20 tons of green feed and 40 tons of hay.\n\nThey harvested an excellent crop of potatoes: 700 bushels, which was sufficient for all needs. Besides this they had a ton and ahalf of other garden truck.\n\nForty-six head of cattle are kept at the school,\u2014mostly cows, as they sell the calves as veal, or butcher them. They also have 10 horses, and 24 pigs, but no chickens.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nThe staff at this school consists of the Principal and two other men as well as seven women. From my observation and what I gathered while there they have a very good staff there at the present time, with the exception of the Farming Instructor, whose services, I understand, are not very satisfactory.\nOLD SUN'S SCHOOL, (Continued),-\nGeneral, (Cont'd),-\n\nMr. House, the Principal, informed me that he intended making a change there.\n\nSince coming to this school, Mr. House has been showing splendid results, and I have no criticism whatever to offer: I am quite sure he is doing his utmost to cope with the situation there. The condition of the farm a few years ago was very bad, and before much can be accomplished, the land has to be brought under a proper state of cultivation. Most of the land under cultivation is sandy and without irrigation will not yield very much.\n\nThe outbuildings at this institution, with the exception of the barn, are simply terrible. I will admit that I arranged for the erection of these buildings, &c., some years ago, but at that time I had only $1,000 to spend, so had to keep within that amount. The reason that the school has not been keeping chickens is that they have no chicken coop.\n\nThe machinery all seemed to be well taken care of and was all in good order except the well. The school is having some trouble with the cylinder in the well, and I am arranging with Mr. Fetterley, from the Water Power Branch, to go down on Monday to look this over.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nJanuary 31st 1933\n\nRE: Old Sun School Water System.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis matter has received the attention of Mr Inspector Christianson, P.A., Fetterly and mechanics in whom we have confidence and the finding is as follows:\n\nThat the existing 3/4\" pipe is too large - there are 175 feet of pipe in the well and the load raised in a pipe of this size as well as pumping against 80 lbs pressure is too much for the pump causing frequent minor breakages and will ruin the plant in two or three years. The remedy is to replace the 3/4\" pipe with a 3\" pipe and a 3\" ball valve cylinder which will be larger than the existing 3/4\" spring valve cylinder. The spring valve has caused a lot of trouble.\n\nThe approximate cost of the pipe, cylinder and labour is estimated at $300.00 and we will have the 3/4\" pipe for some other use.\n\nYou will no doubt receive through the Director of Water Power Bureau Mr. Fetterly's report. I may say that Mr. Fetterly made his findings when on a visit to this Agency in connection with our proposed Irrigation system for which he is now preparing plans.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFeb. 14, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st with reference to the water supply system in the Old Sun's School you may arrange immediately to have the changes made as recommended in your letter. This work is authorised on the understanding that the work will be completed and the vouchers forwarded to the Department to reach here not later than March 31st. Kindly be guided by your list for the purchase of material and the employment of labour.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenchen, Alta.\nOttawa, February 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 401-11A C.E. of the 28th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Old Sun Indian Residential School. It is noted that conditions generally at this school are satisfactory; that the teachers are efficient and obtaining good results; also that the children are in good health and are receiving an abundance of food. The training which the children are receiving, outside of classroom work, is also noted.\n\nI regret that there will be no funds during the next fiscal year to build workshops at the two residential schools in your Agency, or to provide any outbuildings or repairs to same at the Old Sun School.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the well, I have to say that Mr. Agent Gooderham, in a recent communication, stated the requirements in placing the well in satisfactory condition, and he has been authorized to make immediate arrangements to have the work done and to forward a voucher covering the cost in time for payment before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nREPORT\non\nWELL SITUATION\nat\nOLD SUN (C of E) INDIAN SCHOOL,\nGleichen, Alberta.\nby P.A. FETTERLY\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nI. Purpose of Report.\nWhile in Gleichen on January 30th on the proposed Irrigation Scheme for Old Sun Indian School, Mr. Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Mr. Gooderham, Indian Agent, and Mr. House, Principal, requested the writer to advise them regarding repair of the well at the School. As no extra expense or time was involved he acceded to their request.\n\nII. Condition of the Well.\nThe well is 175 feet deep. The pipe is $3\\frac{1}{2}$\" diameter, the cylinder $3\\frac{1}{4}$\". The cylinder is about 20\" long. The pump was the highest priced pump on the market at the time it was installed costing over $1000. It is very strongly built. The Government demanded a 1000 gallons per hour capacity. In order to obtain this capacity a $3\\frac{1}{4}$\" cylinder was installed. This produced a load on the pump which was too close to the ultimate factor of safety and consequently the pump is overloaded. A weight of 150 lbs. per sq. inch is exerted on the plunger. As a consequence it has been breaking down more and more frequently during the last year or more. It now ceases to function almost every week, leaving the school without water.\nfor several hours at a time while it is being repaired.\n\nThe valve breaks through after a short time and is made into a washer. The cylinder and rods have to be removed and repaired and are a continual source of expense.\n\nThe overloading of the pump causes different portions to break. One main 16\" drive wheel broke and a new one had to be purchased in the United States, the pump having been obtained originally from Ward Love Pump Corporation of Rockford, Illinois, through Crane's Ltd. The main drive chain also broke but was welded. It did not fit properly having stretched because of jerking, and will have to be replaced ultimately at a cost of $100.\n\nThe pump does not get credit for the amount of work it does. The School uses upwards of 6000 or 7000 gallons per day when run to capacity.\n\nThe rods, 175 feet in length, have repeatedly been broken and splintered during the frequent removals and replacement for repair. Some of these will have to be replaced. At present the time of 3 men for 3 days is occupied each time it is repaired.\n\nIII. Necessary Improvements to the Well.\n\nThe present 3\u00bd\" pipe should be replaced by 3\" plugged and reamed pipe. The present 3\u00bd\" cylinder should be replaced by a 2\u00bd\" cylinder (for a 3\" pipe) 3 feet long. The lower half of the cylinder can be used for a few years and then, if and when necessary, the rods can be shortened by cutting off a foot from the upper end, provided the\nlower part of the cylinder becomes so worn that new leathers will not repair it. The upper half of the cylinder can then be used. This method will double the life of the cylinder without having to remove it, as 9 men days are occupied each time it is removed. The capacity of the pump will then be 750 gallons per hour instead of 1000 gallons.\n\nThe cylinder should be driven at a slower speed than the motor is capable of doing. The motor is 3 h.p. 1725 r.p.m., 21 amps at 220 volts, and 42 amps at 110 volts. By lengthening the time per day occupied in pumping, through a slower stroke, the lift of the cylinder is lengthened, and the change of weight is not so abrupt.\n\nIV. Estimates.\n\n175 feet plugged and reamed pipe @ 80\u00a2 140.00\n100 feet of rods, each 20', @ 32\u00a2 32.00\nWith drop forged couplings.\n5 sets couplings @ $4.50 22.50\n1- Cylinder, ball valve. 3'x2\u00be\" 60.00\nLabour, 3 men, 6 days. 60.00\n\nTOTAL. 314.50\n\nV. Conclusion.\n\nIt is obvious from the frequent failure of the pump to function, that something more must be done than to withdraw the pipe and cylinder every week or so for repair as this is an ever recurring source of expense.\nRepair has been tried and found wanting. It is therefore necessary to make a permanent improvement. The above is offered as a solution.\n\nCalgary, Alta., February 1, 1933.\n\nP.A. Jetterly\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.H. Hoover\nEngineer in Charge.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith is a report on the condition of the well supplying water to the Old Sun Indian School on the Blackfoot Reserve at Gleichen, Alberta, prepared by Mr. P.A. Fetterly of our Calgary staff.\n\nThe report shows that the well is not in a very satisfactory condition. Repairs are continually being required at a considerable cost. Mr. Fetterly suggests replacing the present pipe liner and cylinder with ones of a slightly smaller size, the estimated cost of which is $314-50.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nFeb. 25, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, and to thank you for the report with reference to the well situation at the Old Sun's School, Alta.\n\nOn January 31st a letter was received from Indian Agent Gooderham, advising the Department that Mr. Fetterly had made an inspection and asked that he be allowed to proceed with the work as recommended. Mr. Gooderham was instructed on the 14th to proceed with the changes as recommended by Mr. Fetterly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F.

It was necessary to send to the United States for some of the material and some delay has occurred. As soon as weather conditions are favourable, Mr. Michael will install the outfit and I hope to be able to submit the Voucher for the labour early in April. I do not think that the work will be completed before March 31st. In any case, no delay will occur in submitting the voucher in favour of Mr. L. Michael.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of insurance policy for $40,000.00 on the Old Sun Residential School. Payment of the premium has not been made because it is considered that the rate of 1% is altogether too high for a fire proof building such as this is and isolated from other buildings or a large community.\n\nThe Department is asking for a report from an Insurance Appraiser, and, until this is received, definite action cannot be taken, but if Mr. McKinnon cannot give a better rate than this on the building, it will likely result in the insurance being placed elsewhere.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nG.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, May 12th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nYour attention is directed to official letter of March 29th last, with reference to the premium rate of insurance on Old Sun Residential School. It is desired to know if the Insurance Agent, Mr. McKinnon, can give a lower rate than that quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nReporting on the Insurance Policy for the Old Sun Residential School, I beg to say that some few weeks ago Mr. Michols of Calgary who is Inspector of Insurance for the Newark Fire Insurance Co. and in which Company Mr. McKinnon placed the insurance, interviewed the writer. He told me that he had inspected the building with Mr. McKinnon and on your request for a re-rating, Mr. McKinnon asked him to come and see me.\n\nHe stated that the Insurance rate had been fixed by the Underwriters Association and was high because the sum of $40,000.00 covered only a small portion of the value of the building. I had given a value of about $175,000.00 for the whole building. The rate would be much less if the amount of insurance was increased and the valuation decreased. In fact, I believe $50,000.00 could be placed on the building for less than $20,000.00 if the valuation was in the neighborhood of $200,000.00. It was finally agreed between ourselves that Mr. Michols would advise the representative of the Insurance Company at Ottawa to discuss the matter with the Deputy when all values and other details could be settled, as it is a very difficult subject for me to explain fully by letter.\n\nI am writing Mr. Michols today to ascertain what may have caused the delay and also asking him to communicate direct with you giving the necessary details. I regret the delay in getting this matter settled and can assure you that the delay is no fault of mine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Gordon,\n\nGoubaux - $143.178.00\nBoiling - $3625.00\nSawmills - $250\nPovesh - $227\n\nTotal - $147380\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe Newark Fire Insurance Company Policy No. 75862\n'Old Sun' School, Gleichen, Alberta\n\nThis will confirm my interview with Mr. G. A. Conley\non the afternoon of the 29th inst., with reference to the fire\ninsurance rate of 1.50% for three years charged under the above\nmentioned policy covering the building referred to for the sum of\n$40,000.\n\nThe reason for the apparently high rate is that the\nbuilding is insured for a small proportion of its value, whereas\nthe usual practice in rating fire resistive buildings is to make\nthe rate contingent upon insurance equal to at least 30% of value\nbeing carried. On this basis the rate on this school would be\n.74% for three years.\n\nIf less than 30% insurance is carried but more than\n50%, the rate can be adjusted to any amount within this range,\nbut a certified valuation by the architect must be filed with\nthe Western Canada Fire Underwriters Association, and a clause\ninserted in the policy providing that a stated amount of insurance\nwill be carried, and all losses adjusted on the basis of the agreed\namount having been carried.\n\nI understand the cost of the building was $120,000,\nand the Indians have an equity of $80,000. in it. If $80,000.\ninsurance was carried, representing two thirds of value, a rate of\napproximately .85% could be obtained, thereby giving you double\nthe protection at a total cost of $650., an increase of only $80.\nover the present premium on $40,000., for a further $40,000. of\ninsurance. These quotations are on a three year basis.\n\nIf you will forward to the undersigned at our Montreal\noffice, No. 500 Place d'Armes Square, a letter setting forth the\namount of insurance you propose to carry, and also the actual\nvalue of the building exclusive of such furnishings and fixtures\nas do not form part of the building, I will negotiate with the\nWestern Canada Fire Underwriters Association for the promulgation\nof a revised rating.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector.\nJune 1st, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy,-\n\nIn memorandum of January 25th last, instructions were asked as to name of person with whom fire insurance should be placed on Old Sun Residential School on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve.\n\nThe name of Mr. C. A. McKinnon of Drumheller, Alberta, was given and accordingly he was asked to place the insurance.\n\nWhen this new building was erected it was necessary to use $50,000.00 of the Trust funds of the Blackfoot Indians, and this was made possible by P.C. 207, dated 29th January, 1930. To protect the Indians' equity of $50,000.00 it was considered a policy of $40,000.00 should suffice, and a policy for this amount was secured. The rate charged was 1\u00bd which was considered too high a rate for the class of building and the matter was referred to the insurance company.\n\nThe Inspector of the insurance company, for which Mr. McKinnon is agent, was at the Department today and will place insurance for $50,000.00, full equity of the Indians, at a rate of 9\u00bd per hundred for three years, and I would recommend that a policy for this amount be placed to cover fully the Indian equity. No insurance will be carried to cover money spent from Parliamentary Appropriation on the building.

Mr. House informed me that if the Department would furnish the paint, he and his staff would do the painting.\n\nIf the Department have any funds available to purchase this paint, it is a very economical way of keeping the building in repair. What he asked for was about $100.00, but a smaller amount would be acceptable, as paint can be bought at a very reasonable price at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Michael for work and material supplied for the pumping plant and the grease traps at Old Sun School.\n\nThe rod which is connected to the cylinder broke and to remove and replace takes considerable time. The check valve was so badly worn that it would not retain the back pressure and no doubt had a lot to do with the breakdown. This was replaced to ensure satisfactory operation.\n\nThe grease traps in the kitchen & auxiliary had given trouble for some considerable time. Apparently, they had not been properly installed and the grease entered the pipes and blocked them. The stench was terrible. Mr. Michael pulled the pipes and installed the traps so that the grease congealed in the trap. It is understood that this is the way these should function.\n\nAll this work was done, as you note, before the Departmental ruling of the 30th May File 104-2-5 was received here. The account is respectfully submitted for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 5th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School to be furnished with the quantity of paint required to carry out some necessary painting, amounting to approximately $100.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our Appropriation this year has been so greatly reduced, the Department will have no funds to provide the expenditure required in doing any painting at residential schools. I regret we will be unable to authorize the amount necessary to purchase the paint required by the Principal of the Old Sun School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Michael, for work and material supplied for the pumping plant and the grease traps at the Old Sun Indian Residential School and stating the work that it was necessary to perform in this connection.\n\nIn reply I have to say that a cheque in payment of this account will be forwarded in due course. I would point out, however, in connection with future repairs at the schools in your agency, that it will be necessary for you to report the matter to the Department before incurring any expenditure. You should give full particulars concerning the work, the materials required and the approximate cost.\n\nI may add, further, that as our Appropriation has been so greatly reduced, we will have no funds to cover the cost of any repairs or the providing of any equipment for this school during the balance of the present fiscal year. Should it be necessary to undertake repairs, the expense required will have to be met by the school authorities from their per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R.

This figure is evidently an approximate verbal quotation made by the writer during his interview with Mr. G. A. Conley, and while we will make every endeavour to obtain this rate for you, we have to advise you that the actual calculation on the basis of value given in the architect's statement, brings out a rate of .93%. In view of Mr. Conley's remarks when the approximate rate was quoted, we are assuming that such a small difference will not require reconsideration of the matter and are accordingly requesting our Branch Manager at Winnipeg to arrange for the issue of a new policy for the sum of $80,000 dating from the 17th instant, the date of your letter, full credit for which will be given to Mr. C.A. McKinnon of Drumheller, Alberta.\n\nUpon receipt of the new policy from Mr. McKinnon, kindly surrender for cancellation Policy 75662 and return it to Mr. McKinnon. The surrender form on the policy should be signed by a responsible official of the Department.\n\nThe 'Newark Fire Insurance Company', a subsidiary of the Royal Insurance Company Limited, is holding you covered for a total amount of $80,000 on the building of the Old Sun School further described in Policy 75662, which is to be cancelled upon the issue of a new contract, as of the 17th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nDr Harold W McGill Deputy Superintendent General Dept of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding to you Policy No 2287 replacing Policy No 73862 Please have Surrender form completed & return to me with old policy.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nC A McKinnon\nDistrict Agent\nDrumheller - Alta.\nFile No. 104-1-51.\n\nJuly 7th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will note that a policy for $40,000.00 was placed through the office of Mr. McKinnon, of Drumheller, on Old Sun Boarding School.\n\nThe rate of 1.50 per hundred was considered excessive, and a lower rate of 92 cents per hundred has been obtained by replacing the policy for $60,000.00, covering fully the equity of the Blackfoot Indians.\n\nIt is necessary to return the policy for $40,000.00, and accordingly it is enclosed with the Form of Surrender duly signed. This policy with the attached Form should be delivered to Mr. McKinnon, and it will then be in order to submit his account to the Department for the premium.\n\nFor your information I might say that the new policy in the Newark Fire Insurance Company, and No. A 2287 for $60,000.00, is in the hands of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nEnc.\n\nG.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that on Thursday I was down to Gleichen and was talking to Mr. House, the Principal of Old Sun School, and he brought to my attention that he had asked for some paint in the Estimates, and he was very anxious to get it so that he could put the boys to work doing some painting in the interior of the school. I have looked up the Estimates and find $200 was the amount placed therein for paint for the barn and interior of the building. If this amount cannot be allowed a smaller quantity of paint would do, as long as he gets .25 or 30 gallons of paint and some linseed oil, &c. Probably a few paint brushes would be required also.\n\nI think in allowing a little for paint each year, the work being done by the older boys, a big saving can be effected, and at the same time the walls are kept in first class shape. I would ask that if at all possible this be allowed immediately so that the work can be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n401-11A R.C.\n\nOttawa, May 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to provide the sum of $200 for painting at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. You may, however, purchase approximately 25 gallons of paint and some linseed oil. It is noted that there will be no charge for labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that I was down at the Old Sun School on the Blackfoot Reserve a few days ago and the Principal pointed out to me that he had asked for a hen-house in the 1934-1935 Estimates, and he was wondering whether this was going to be allowed. I might state that this building certainly is required as he pointed out that the Doctor was continually advising him that he should feed eggs to the children, but he could not do this unless he produced them at the school, and if he is expected to feed eggs to the children, the Department will have to supply him with the necessary chicken coop. I shall be glad to be advised if this expenditure is going to be allowed.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your 401-11A C. E. of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that no provision was made in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for the erection of a hen-house at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. If the school authorities are willing to provide the labour, you might let the Department have an estimate of the cost of the material that would be required. On receipt of your reply, the Department will be in a position to decide if funds for the purpose can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

G. H. GOODERHAM\nFOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1934, ON THE OLD\nSUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on No. 104-1-7.\n\nSomething must be done to improve the heating system. During the very cold weather the radiators fill with water and the circulation is poor.\n\nParts of the building are poorly heated and radiators may freeze and burst. The Department has on file a recommendation from the Dunham heating expert in Calgary as to how this condition may be remedied. This should be brought to the attention of the departmental architect.\nOttawa, January 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report for the month of December, last, on the Old Sun Indian Residential School, in which you request that something be done to improve the heating system, as, during the very cold weather, the radiators fill with water and the circulation is poor, parts of the building are poorly heated and the radiators may freeze and burst.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to the last paragraph of official letter dated December 9, 1932. You were requested, at that time, to have the representative of the Dunham Heating Company, at Calgary, make an inspection and report. We do not appear to have on file the recommendation of the Dunham Heating Company expert. As the Durham Company are familiar with the installation of the heating equipment, they would, no doubt, be in the best position to make a report and recommendation. You may have their representative visit the school and submit a definite report, stating the cost involved in having the alterations made to the heating system in order that it will work satisfactorily in heating the entire building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nbut I will forward you a special bottle which you might fill with water from the well and forward it to the C. A. Dunham Company Toronto, and I will write and ask them to have the Vinsco Company make a test of this water to see if Vinsco will neutralize the effects of the soda.\n\nYou might see to it that your Engineer cleans out the boilers and changes the water as per the instructions I gave him.\n\nNow that you have a twenty-four hour Electric Service, it would be a good investment to install an Electric Condensation Pump, instead of the Return Trap. To make this installation, however, it also requires that the Radios in your basement shall be fitted with a small trap and the ends of the steam mains trapped through #25 Plant Traps.\n\nThe pump could be installed alongside the small pump which takes care of the Residence, and the four return pipes going into the boiler room could be brought together into one header and connected to the pump. This change would allow your system to circulate steam much quicker and at lower pressure, and a saving in fuel would result and of course more comfort to the occupants of the School. For instance, just compare the comfort in your residence with what it was before the small pump was installed.\n\nI have figured the cost of the above changes to be approximately $375.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Walker\n\nC. A. Dunham Company Ltd.,\nCalgary Branch No. 7.\nNovember 26, 1931\n\nReverend John W. House,\nPrincipal,\nOld Sun Indian School,\nGlenichen, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. House:\n\nHaving checked over the above plant, I have found that the trouble you have experienced in heating the boys' class-room during the cold weather, was caused by two conditions. First, priming in the boilers, and second the Return Trap being unable to return the condensation to the boilers as fast as steam condensed, and the result was that the steam mains were filled with water and it was not possible to get circulation.\n\nI do not possess a Trane catalogue, so I am unable to give you the manufacturer's rating of your Return Trap, but comparing the size with the plan that the Dunham Company would install for a building such as yours, I find that the Dunham trap is much larger than the Trane.\n\nYour Engineer informed me that your Return Trap (before priming was noticed), was working continually, and this is not a good feature in a Return Trap.\n\nIt is pleasing to note, however, that the heating system in the Residence which Mr. Legger changed last year, is giving you first-class service.\n\nOn testing the water in the boilers, I found that it was foaming and no doubt there is a quantity of oil in the boilers, as the water from the well appeared to be all right under a test.\n\n18.1.35 - There is foaming in the boiler now.\n\nThis has been corrected.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

Mr. Walker was ill at home but I secured from his office a copy of a letter written in 1931 when he inspected the heating plant at Old Sun's for the same trouble that exists today. Mr. Walker told Mr. Christianson that there was nothing further that he could suggest and that the remedy and approximate cost would be very much the same as his recommendation in 1931. A copy of this letter is attached hereto.\n\nThe Provincial Boiler Inspector just dropped into the office after making an inspection of the boilers at Old Sun School and I also attach a copy of his report on the condition of the plant.\n\nOn discussing the matter with Mr. Dick with a view to correcting the corrosion mentioned in his report, he is of the opinion that this would also correct the lack of heat in the South Wing. He drew my attention to the fact that there are three systems of return involved i.e., the pump system from the residence, the Trane trap from the Central portion and the gravity from the South Wing. He recommends that the South Wing return be connected to the trap. This change would undoubtedly improve the system and the cost of alteration would be very much less than the installation of a pump system. Besides, no operating costs would be added. Something must be done as the cost of replacing corroded return pipes under the corridor and dining room floor will be very costly. Wouldn't it be good business to have the local steam fitter make the alteration suggested by Mr. Dick? No damage would result and the system could be tried out this winter. It is now 40 below and I would ask for a wired reply.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files.\n(RG 10, Volume 6360, File 758-5, part 8)\nActing Deputy Minister,\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIt has been reported to the department that considerable difficulty is being experienced in heating a portion of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School near Gleichen, Alta., which is caused by priming in the boilers and the return trap not returning the condensation to the boilers as fast as the steam condenses.\n\nIn order to remedy this condition it will be necessary to install an electric Condensation Pump in place of the return trap.

In making this inspection I went over buildings and equipment, machinery, etc., and in general enquired into the management of this institution.\n\nI found there were 88 children on the register: 83 present and 5 were at the hospital as T.B. patients.\n\nHEALTH:\n\nThe health of the children at the school seems to be good: There was no sickness of any kind at the time of my visit although a few children were under observation for T.B. and these children are given a rest period every afternoon.\n\nI checked over the clothing supplied to the children and found that this was ample: Every child has three or four changes of clothing, and they are well dressed. I learned from the Principal that their method\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill, - of -\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nHealth. (Continued).\u2014\n\nof providing the clothing is as follows: Until the children are 12 years of age, the supply of clothing is taken care of by the ladies of the Anglican Church in Toronto. They are made up there and forwarded to the school. When the children have reached the age of 12 years, their clothing is supplied by the Commission who purchase most of it in Winnipeg.\n\nTRAINING OUTSIDE OF CLASSROOM WORK:\u2014\n\nBesides their academic instruction the children follow the general routine in vogue in practically every Indian boarding school. When the girls graduate they are fairly well fitted to look after their own homes as they are taught sewing, cooking, and general household science. They do the milking during the summer time and are taught how to make butter. The boys do the milking during the winter. I was there while they were milking, and was telling them that I hoped they would continue to do this after they left school.\n\nIn addition to this, the older boys are taken by the Principal every afternoon, for about two hours, to the carpenter shop where they are taught to do a certain amount of carpenter work. They are also taught by the Farming Instructor to repair machinery, &c. The work on the land, such as cultivating, &c., is all done by the boys attending the school.\nFARMING:\n\nThe farming operations at the school have not been very successful on account of the drought. They only threshed 490 bushels of oats last fall and the balance of the crop was cut for feed. They had 7 tons of potatoes and about a ton and a half of turnips and some other small garden truck.\n\nThe only cattle kept at the school are cows and heifers, and they have 41 head at the present time and as a rule they have 15 or 20 cows milking. At the time of my visit they were milking 17. A register is kept of the quantity of milk that comes into the school every day and in checking it over I found that there are approximately 700 gallons of milk produced each month and the average amount of butter made per month is about 190 pounds. Both milk and butter are used by the Staff and the children of the school. I am quite sure the Department will see that the children here are getting all the milk they can drink; they also get butter with most of their meals.\n\nBUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT:\n\nThe school building itself is in a first class state of repair: The Department have supplied a small quantity of paint each year which has helped to keep the interior of the school looking bright and clean. The painting is done by the staff and the older boys. There is a lack of cupboard space in the dormitories.\nBuildings & Equipment, (Continued),\u2014\n\nThe only out-building worth mentioning is the barn. This building is in good shape and is kept very clean and tidy. The exterior, however, is badly weather-beaten and the paint is practically all worn off. As soon as arrangements can be made it should certainly be painted to preserve both the shingles and the siding. There is a silo attached to the barn, and it has been used regularly. It is now rotting, and I believe it is beyond repair; High winds have caused it to shift on the foundation and it is leaning to one side. The other out-buildings are not very good, and if my memory serves me correctly they were all put up for less than $1000.00; but they are answering the purpose for the present, at least. As I have mentioned on several previous occasions, this school requires a chicken-house, and this should be provided.\n\nAs this school is connected with the hydro-electric, we have no expensive machinery here, with the exception of a few motors. The only machinery is a low-pressure boiler which furnishes the hot water to the school, and a high-pressure boiler for the laundry. I had a talk with the fireman who also handles the boilers and motors, and as far as I could ascertain, he has the necessary papers to look after a high-pressure boiler. He seems to keep the machinery in good working order.\nBuildings & Equipment, (Continued),-\n\nThe same applies to the heating plant which is in good order except that more water gets into the radiators than steam, evidently on account of faulty circulation. This is not noticeable when the weather is mild, but during this cold spell it has caused some trouble. I shall leave this matter stand as it has already been taken up by the Agent and reported on by Mr. Alex. Walker, one of the best heating engineers in this part of the country.\n\nThe school also had some trouble a few days before my visit with the school well, but it had been repaired and they were getting an abundance of water. The well that supplies the water for the school cattle needs cleaning out. At the present time it is only sending a very small stream through the pipe. I had a talk with Mr. Michael from Gleichen, who looks after matters of this kind for the school and the Agency, and he advised me that he thought a new cylinder was necessary for the well.\n\nGENERAL:-\n\nAs far as I could ascertain this school is very well conducted and has an efficient staff; For some years I was not satisfied with the different Farming Instructors they had employed, but the present man seems to be giving good satisfaction, and Mr. Gooderham informed me that he thought he was an exceptionally good man \u2014 the best Farming Instructor they had ever had there.\nGeneral, (Continued),\u2014\n\nI examined the fire equipment and learned that the fire extinguishers had recently been refilled. There are six rubber fire hose in the building and these have become useless as they are rotting and the water comes through the walls of the hose when the pressure is turned on. Therefore six rubber hose, 50-ft. lengths, should be supplied. Also reels of the round type, as the present one are those in which you fold the hose back and forth and lie it flat in the rack and this has been the cause of ruining the present hose. Although I am explaining these matters in the report, I shall take the requirements of the school up in a special letter so that they may be more easily dealt with.\n\nThere is a skating rink at the school and all the children are supplied with skates. They also play hockey and play with teams from the local towns around there.\n\nThe staff of this institution consists of the Rev. Mr. House, Principal, the Fireman and Farming Instructor, and 7 lady employees; a total of 10. From personal observation I would say that the management of this institution is very satisfactory, and Mr. House is considered a fairly efficient Principal. The feeling between the Indians and the School is all that could be desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

As you were informed in our letter of the 2nd instant, certain funds will be available for repairs and additions to the outbuildings at this school. I would suggest that, early next spring, you submit a definite report concerning the repairs that you believe should be undertaken, giving full particulars of the cost, etc. When the Department receives the information requested, regarding the fire hose required, consideration will be given to placing the order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This commenced on the 4th when there was no water. The pipe was pulled and the lower valve was found to be stuck. This condition was repeated every few days until we had our local lumber made 15 trips to the school and pulled the pipe completely out 3 times and partially pulled it several times. The weather was subzero until the 15th when it again failed to run water. Mr. Michael pulled everything out on that date and made changes in the lower valve believing it would help. The tremendous suction and force of this pump apparently unloosened it again and there was no water on the 30th.\n\nWe concluded that the well was drying up and would not stand continuous pumping so made arrangements with the Principal to shut it off at night. Even on part time it has failed again, so today, we are pulling everything again and will have the lower valve (electrically welded). If the pump then fails, and there is no water, I am afraid we are beaten. We can only conclude that the well is going dry. We hope not, since there is no well to replace it except one in the barn and the water is not very good.\n\nWhat has already been done means a big labour A/C. Before the well is not drying up but it is possible since there has been so little precipitation during the past two years. The Town of Gleichen had similar trouble in 1894 and a second well had to be drilled. We must hope for the best.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, regarding the water supply at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted there is very little supply of water in the well and that the pipe has been pulled up and overhauled several times, in an effort to obtain a better supply.\n\nAs stated by you, the small quantity of water is, no doubt, due to the lack of precipitation during the past two years. It is hoped that conditions will soon improve and that an ample supply of water will be obtained. Would you recommend the deepening of the well? No doubt, there was certain expense incurred in the pulling up of the pipe. The Department will be prepared to pay for this work, upon receipt of a certified account, in triplicate, from you. Full details should be shown on the account, regarding the number of hours employed and the rate paid per hour.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised, later, if the water situation has improved and, if not, what steps you would recommend be taken in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nCalgary, Alberta, Feb. 8, 1935.\n\nPreliminary Report\non\nWell Situation\nat\nOld Sun Indian School,\nGleichen, Alberta,\nby P.A. Fetterly.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nMr. G. Gooderham, Indian Agent, of Blackfoot Reserve, Gleichen, Alberta, phoned this office on Feb. 6, stating that the well at Old Sun School was failing. He stated that he had written to the Indian Department at Ottawa about Feb. 1 on the matter but that as some days would elapse before our Calgary Office would receive instructions, and since immediate action seemed necessary, he wished to have the writer investigate immediately. He stated that no expenses would be needed on the part of this office as he would supply gas, meals, etc.\n\nThe writer, after consultation with Mr. Hoover, proceeded to Gleichen on Feb. 7. He interviewed Mr. Michel, Gleichen plumber, who has been attempting to rehabilitate the well; Mr. Gooderham and Rev. Mr. House, Principal of the School.\n\n2. Result of Investigation\n\n(a) Former Activities\n\nReference to a report by the writer dated\nFeb. 2, 1933, will indicate that the original well contained a 3\u00bd\" pipe and 3\u00bd\" cylinder, installed in 1930. The pipe and cylinder were found to be too large, causing breakages, the load being too heavy for the plant. Consequently a 3\" pipe and 2\u00be\" cylinder were installed. This installation worked efficiently, until about Dec. 25, 1934. Trouble has occurred every day since then, a period of over six weeks.\n\n(b) Primary Cause.\n\nThe primary cause of the trouble appears to be the lowering of the water table; in other words, the supply of water is lessening, the pump is removing water faster than it comes into the well. Every well in the vicinity of Gleichen has lessened considerably, including the two town wells during the last year.\n\n(c) Behaviour of Well.\n\nThe trouble began about Christmas. The pump activates for several hours. It then ceases to yield water. The plumber from Gleichen, Mr. Michel, then goes to the school (one mile south), disconnects the working head, and raises the rods and plunger a few inches in the cylinder (working barrel) by means of a chain and block which he installed in the pump house. After the first release the whole string jumps a foot, apparently releasing air. It then settles down and he reconnects everything. The pump will then activate properly for the rest of the day. Next morning he repeats the operation. Since Christmas he has had to do this every day except two days.\nThe writer tested the capacity of the well on Feb.7,1935. The well was idle for about half an hour while being disconnected and until an outside discharge pipe was connected. The performance was as follows:\n\n| Time   | Flow Rate |\n|--------|-----------|\n| 3:35 p.m. | 7\u00bd gal. per minute |\n| 3:40 \"    | 5\u00bd \"       |\n| 3:50 \"    | 5\u00bd \"       |\n| 4:30 \"    | 5\u00bd \"       |\n| 5:10 \"    | 5-1/8 \"    |\n\n(d) Mr. Michel's Experiences.\n\nMr. Michel states that it never falls below 5 gal. per minute. He thinks that while idle the water rises 29' in the 8\" casing of this 175' well. Then for a few minutes it pumps to full capacity (7\u00bd gal.) per minute. Then the water is being pumped out faster than it comes in and the cylinder \"sucks\" air. This air stays in the cylinder and at last becomes so compressed that water is prevented from coming in through the lower valve. By disconnecting the working head and raising the rods and plunger - supposedly to a point just above the cylinder, the air is released and works efficiently as before until sufficient air accumulates to prevent ingress of water. In other words the cylinder becomes air-locked. It is known that so much air enters the pressure tank that the regular air-compressor is not used at all. On the contrary air is let out of the pressure tank for half a day at a time through the stop-cock on the glass gauge because...\nso much compressed air comes in with the water. It was noticed that the water from the discharge pipe yesterday was continuously full of tiny air bubbles.\n\nMr. Michel states that in 18 years' experience around Gleichen with wells he has never met this particular type of difficulty.\n\n(e) Mr. Joe Maughan of Calgary, Well Driller.\n\nMr. Maughan, who rehabilitated the well at Sacred Heart Indian School last year, was interviewed today on the matter. The action was described to him. His opinion was that the length of pipe under the cylinder was too long or too short. He thinks that a vacuum is formed in the cylinder instead of compressed air. Thus on release the water rushes in through the bottom valve. He also thinks that an air hole \u00bd\" diameter should be drilled just under the working head to allow air to enter the casing as he thinks that a vacuum is being gradually produced in the casing. The writer visited Cranes Limited, who provided the working head. They stated that the casing does not fit tightly (air-tight) on the top of the casing.\n\n(f) Bell and Morris.\n\nThis firm provided the Hoosier cylinder in use. Their opinion was that a length of 1\u00bd\" pipe should be inserted below the cylinder (the well is 12' deeper than the pipe so that the pipe will always be below the\nsurface. This is an obvious partial solution, of course, and occurred to the writer yesterday.\n\n3. Remedies\n\nThe troubles are apparently two in number, viz:- apparent misbehaviour of the cylinder as described above. The plant has a larger capacity than the well will produce under present climatic conditions. Several remedies were proposed, as follows:-\n\n(a) Mr. Michel.\n\nMr. Michel wanted to replace the 3\" pipe and 2\u00bd\" cylinder with a 1\" pipe and 5/8\" cylinder. This would produce 3 gal. per minute or more, being less than the probable 4 to 5 gal. capacity of the well, and thus being on the safe side. The writer negatived this solution for the present as being too expensive after the installation of two years ago and also because it would produce only 2160 gallons per day, the requirements of the school being 6000 gallons or more. It might be added that the present working head delivers with a 12\" stroke, 40 strokes per minute with a 3 h.p. motor, 0.309 gal. per stroke x 40 strokes = 12.4 U.S. gallons - 10.3 Imp. gallons. Please note that the writer's full supply test was 7\u00bd gallons per minute. Mr. Michel then proposed another alternative. This was to leave the plant as it is, but to demount the 3 h.p. motor from the top of the working head, suspend it from the ceiling to the east of the working head, place a pulley wheel on the drive shaft of the working head, and drive with a belt. The motor would be 7' away from the working head. The belt would be 7' centre to centre of pulley wheels. The pulley\nwheels would be chosen so that their ratio would be\n2 to 1, i.e., change from 40 strokes to 20 or better\nstill 5 to 2, and so reduce the strokes to 16. The\nproduction would then be 16 fourtieths of 10.3 gallons\nor about 4 gallons per minute, which is a little less\nthan the apparent capacity of the well.\n\nThe latter is the more sensible solution.\n\nMr. Geoderham, Indian Agent, and Rev. Mr. House, Principal.\n\nMr. House thought that possibly another well\nwould have to be drilled. This is of course out of the\nquestion until the present well proves useless. He also\nwas apprehensive of the fact that the 3 h.p. motor on\nthe working head was only doing a portion of this work and\nso he was using twice as much electrical energy as he\nneeded to activate the pump. The writer interviewed the\nCanadian General Electric on this point. They stated that\nif a 3 h.p. motor was called on to do, say, 1\u00bd h.p. of work,\nthen the electrical energy was only about 1\u00bd or 2\u00bd more\nthan 1\u00bd h.p. In other words the energy used is directly\nproportionate to the load regardless of the h.p. of the\nmotor. Mr. House also complained that the power (Calgary\nPower Company's lines) fails for two weeks at a time\noccasionally, and after every thunder storm. At these times\nthey have to haul water by team. He would like to have an\nauxiliary gas engine to connect up with the working head\nfor use in time of failure of power. His point is well\ntaken.\n\nHe has a well under the stables motivated\nby a 3 h.p. motor. This well has been condemned for human consumption because of location. He objected to the use of a 3 h.p. motor here also as the load is much less than capacity. This well produces 3 gal. per minute by test yesterday. However his point is not well taken in this case as the above argument appertains here also as regards cost. The total bill for power for the two wells amounts to $55 per month, according to Mr. House. He thinks this unnecessarily high, although it does not appear so to the writer, considering the rates at Gleichen nearly 100 miles away from the source of power, Ghost Dam.\n\nExpenses are high at the school and present revenue is barely sufficient to allow them to carry on.\n\nMr. House would also like to have a windmill on the barn well to take care of this load. This point is also well taken as he would save considerable expense. This well has 138' of pipe, i.e., about 140' deep.\n\nOne water vein is at 65', the next is at 125' and the next at 175'. One horse power would raise 13.8 Imp. Gallons per minute to a height of 150'. Therefore 3 gal. per min. would be lifted 150' by a 10' windmill producing 3/6 h.p. in a 15 mile wind. An 8' mill would leave no factor of safety. The cost of this windmill complete would be about $150 with a tower 35' high.\n\n(4) Conclusions.\n\nThe writer tested the well for 2 hours on Feb. 7, at the end of that time the well was still producing 5 gallons per minute. Mr. Michel and Mr. House both stated that the well\nwould be air-locked in the morning and would have to be temporarily rehabilitated. The writer considered waiting until morning unnecessary.\n\nMr. Gooderham called at the office in Calgary on Saturday morning, February 9, and stated that Mr. Michel has pulled all of the pipe four times since Christmas. These operations are gradually spoiling all of the threads and should be done as little as possible.\n\nAfter discussion with Mr. Gooderham on Feb. 9 it was decided to pull the pipe on Tuesday (Monday is wash day). He will take a new cylinder with him to Gleichen, also a length of 1\u00bd\" pipe. On receipt of news the writer will proceed to Gleichen on Tuesday and experiments will be carried on in an attempt to correct the difficulties.\n\nMeanwhile the matter of an auxiliary Lister engine for the house pump and a windmill for the barn pump, together with the question of remounting the motor, can be left in abeyance. The latter problem which is involved with available supply, may be solved by the use of a 1\u00bd\" pipe below the cylinder.\n\n[Signature]\nO.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\n[Signature]\nP.A. Fetterly,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nCalgary, Alta., Feb. 9, 1935.\n\nP.S. After the conversation in the Calgary Office\nwith Mr. Gooderham, it was expected that Mr. Michel would pull the pipe and rods on Monday, Feb. 11, attach the cylinder borrowed by Mr. Gooderham from Bell & Morris, and try again. However, Mr. House called the writer on the phone Saturday evening and said that there was seven or eight feet of pipe already below the cylinder and that Mr. Michel did not want to pull the pipe unless absolutely necessary as the threads and bolts were wearing badly, it having been pulled four times since Christmas. Mr. House wished the writer to authorize remounting and gearing the motor down from 40 to 16 or 20 strokes.\n\nThe writer called Mr. Maughan on the phone today to ask him whether he would be prepared to accompany Mr. Hoover and himself to Gleichen on Thursday or Friday. He agreed to do this providing expenses were paid together with a small unstated honorarium.\n\nThis will be carried out on Thursday or Friday.

He agreed to do this providing his expenses were paid. He would also accept a small honorarium of unstated amount.\n\nI will carry out this plan, probably on Thursday morning, before Mr. Michel, the plumber, releases the air-lock.

Fetterly.\n\n1. Purpose of Report:\nThis report is submitted subsequent to\na visit to the above-named school on February 18 by\nMessrs. Hoover, Wm. Maughan, Manager of the Union\nDrilling and Development Co. (named \"Joe\" in the\npreliminary report, dated February 8) and the writer.\nThe imminence of this visit was mentioned in the report\nof February 8.\n\n2. Result of Visit:\nThe matter was discussed, and the well\nexamined, by those mentioned above, with Mr. Michel, the\nplumber at Gleichen. No decision was reached as to\nwhether the trouble was caused by compressed air or by\na vacuum. A most searching enquiry was made by Mr.\nMaughan, than whom there is no better in the West, in\nthe opinion of the writer, as he has obviously made a\nscientific study of these matters, being a theoretical\nas well as a practical well man.\n\nHis suggestion, after canvassing the matter\nthoroughly was as follows:\n\nThe well is 177 feet deep. The cylinder\nis 153 feet deep. The cylinder is therefore 24' from the bottom of the hole. Under the cylinder is a 3\" pipe, a continuation of the main 3\" pipe, 18' long in which 1/4\" holes were drilled by Michel below a point 12' below the cylinder. In other words, the last 6' were drilled with 1/4\" holes close together. This is, then, virtually a screen. The bottom of this pipe is plugged and would be 12' from the bottom of the hole.\n\nMr. Maughan suggested that the cylinder be lowered several feet and a short piece of perforated pipe be placed below the cylinder. The clearance between the bottom of pipe and bottom of hole need be only 2 or 3 feet. He thought that the automatic switch, whose limits as to minimum and maximum pressure are now 25 and 55 lbs., should be 30 lbs. and 40 lbs. respectively. This would prevent the present wide spread of pressures. He suggested that the mounting of the motor or change of gearing from 40 strokes per minute to 16 or 20 be left for the present. He naturally will not guarantee that this will cure the trouble as the cause is not yet certain. However, in answer to this suggestion the following material has been ordered for immediate delivery:\n\n1 length (18' or 20') of 3\" plugged and reamed pipe.\n2 - 20' lengths 1-5/8\" Octagonal wooden pump rods with 3/4\" Blacksmith couplings attached.\n\nThe Crane Co., who supplied the working head and automatic switch, state that the switch need not be replaced as the present one may be adjusted.\n3.\n\n3. Further Developments.\n\nSince writing the above it has occurred to the writer that the trouble may be caused by natural gas, i.e., that gas in some way became incorporated with the underground water about Christmas time. If that be the case, then the gaseous substance pumped into the pressure tank would be natural gas, not air. It would also follow that gas would be present in the cylinder, instead of air. In that case the accumulations over night in the pipe would be gas settling from the water and rising as far as possible, i.e., to the cylinder. This is rather a startling idea for several more or less obvious reasons.\n\nNo test was made of the nature of the gas in the water - the fine bubbles are easily noted in the free water immediately after pumping - either yesterday or during the last visit as air only was considered to be present. However one of the staff mentioned that a distinct odour of \"coal oil\" was noted in a pitcher of water standing over night but little attention was paid to this information at the time.\n\nThis new aspect of the case should and will be examined as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Michel is ready to attempt anything as he has reached the limit of his knowledge. Incidentally, he mentioned that when the screw valve in the supply pipe to the pressure tank, about 2' from the working head, is unscrewed, the gas - with little or no water -\nshoots into the air, and would drive the 1 lb. screw cap 10' into the air if he allowed it. Gas is therefore present in this pipe at high pressure after pumping all day and allowing to stand all night, instead of water.\n\nYou will be advised of further developments.\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nP.A.

At the time of my visit we were under the impression that one of them would last a while yet, but we will now require 7 50-foot hose, 1\u00bd\" inside measurement, with 7 couplings sweated into the hose, couplings to be 1\u00bd\" inside and 2\u00be\" outside measurement, and two nozzles to fit the hose. The other five nozzles are in good condition.\n\nI would recommend that rubber-lined hose be supplied; although they cost a little more they last much longer and they are much more satisfactory.\n\nSeven reels of the round type are also required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

At the present time plenty of water can be obtained except in cases when there is an abnormal draught on the supply. The pump is still sucking a certain amount of air which has to be disposed of from the pressure tank, but no airlocking has taken place.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. House is noncommittal regarding a permanent cure but at present no further attention appears to be necessary and Mr. Hoover has arranged that Mr. House will communicate with him in case any difficulty arises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Lepper & Co and I submit herewith account in their favour. I may say that Mr Walker checked the account before it was submitted to this office and found it o.k.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., April 16th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to Dept.'s letter No. 104-1-5 of Feb. 5th last, in connection with repairs, &c., to Old Sun's School. As instructed, I have asked the Agent to give me an estimate of the cost of the various items and this is what he recommends:\n\nReplacement of present silo .................................................. $250.00\nPaint, oil and varnish for interior ........................................... 100.00\nCupboards for clothing in bale room, sewing room & dorms .... 300.00\nChicken house ................................................................. 700.00\nPainting the barn .............................................................. 275.00\nWindmill, and cleaning barn well .......................................... 200.00\n\nI believe this amounts to a great deal more than the Department is prepared to authorize and I would suggest that the following be gone on with if the Department have the funds:\n\nReplacement of present silo .................................................. $250.00\nPaint, oil and varnish for interior decorating ......................... 50.00\nCupboards ................................................................. 150.00\nSuitable chicken house I think could be built for ............... 500.00\nPainting the barn .............................................................. 275.00\nCleaning out barn well, but not the windmill, as they have an electric pump to do the pumping. We could have Mr. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power Branch look after the cleaning out of the well and I am sure this could be done for probably much less than $100.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nApril 25th, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honorable The Superintendent General,\n\nIn the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, provision has been made for the following replacements at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School (Blackfoot Reserve No. 146 - Electoral District of Bow River):\n\n(1) Replacement of present silo, approximately $250.00.\n\n(2) Paint, oil and varnish to paint barn and for interior decorating ........... $325.00\n\n(3) New chicken house .................. $500.00\n\n(4) Cleaning out well at barn .......... $100.00\n\nThe above estimates have been submitted to the Department by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nI would recommend that the arrangements for the above work be left in the hands of Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham and Mr. Inspector Christianson, who will make all purchases from approved sources of supply.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable The Superintendent General.\n\nIn the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, provision has been made for the following replacements at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School (Blackfoot Reserve No. 146 - Electoral District of Bow River):\n\n(1) Replacement of present silo, approximately $250.00.\n\n(2) Paint, oil and varnish to paint barn and for interior decorating .............. $325.00\n\n(3) New chicken house ...................... $500.00\n\n(4) Cleaning out well at barn ............. $100.00\n\nThe above estimates have been submitted to the Department by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nI would recommend that the arrangements for the above work be left in the hands of Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham and Mr. Inspector Christianson, who will make all purchases from approved sources of supply.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 30th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your 401-11A.C.E. of the 16th instant regarding repairs required at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the following improvements may be made:\n\nE.R. 3268 (1) Replacement of present silo . . . .$250.00\n\n\" (2) Paint, oil and varnish to paint barn and for interior decorating . .$325.00\n\nE.R. 3267 (3) New chicken house . . . . . . . .$500.00\n\nE.R. 3268 (4) Cleaning out well at barn . . . . .$100.00\n\nThe handling of the above improvements at the Old Sun's School will be left to Mr. Agent Gooderham and yourself. Purchases of materials should be made from firms on the approved list. You should be guided by previous instructions regarding the employment of any labour that is necessary, although it is hoped that the school authorities will give every possible assistance and, by this means, keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nThe Department does not see the necessity of employing Mr. Fetterly to look after the cleaning out of the well. You can engage a competent person to do this work and Mr. Agent Gooderham can supervise it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., May 31st, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Old Sun's School at Gleichen:\n\nThe sum of $500.00 has been authorized for the hen-house at this school. When Mr. Christianson, Mr. Gooderham and myself were there yesterday, we found that the material for the hen-house will amount to approximately $650.00. This means about $150.00 more than already authorized. I thought it advisable to have the work go ahead, so I authorized the additional expenditure in this regard. The labour is being done by the School Staff.\n\nThe extractor in the laundry recently went out of commission and is being fixed. This will probably involve an expenditure of $25.00 or $30.00.\n\nYou will remember that the Principal wrote a few weeks ago requesting some manual training tools. He has a room fitted up for this purpose and as both the Inspector and the Agent consider it very advisable to go ahead, I authorized Mr. Christianson to incur an expenditure not exceeding $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nGLEICHEN ALTA, JUNE 10TH, 35.\n\nSECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONT.\n\nI REPORT THAT RIVETS BROKE IN WOOD ROD OF DEEP WELL PUMP SYSTEM OLD SUN AND LODGED IN CYLINDER DOING DAMAGE TO PUMP STOP PUMP REMOVED AND SENT TO CRANES CALGARY COST REPAIRS AND LABOR ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS STOP BREAKAGE UNAVOIDABLE AND TEMPORARY GAS ENGINE PUMP INSTALLED.\n\nG.H.

Cancellation of the present policy presently in force, could be arranged as from any near date basis, and if, for instance, this were made effective say, October 1st of this year a refund of $174.76 could be applied on the reduced three year premium under the new policy.\n\nWe trust, as arranged during our conversation, that you will take this matter up with the Department as soon as possible and endeavour to make the suggested re-arrangement which would be advantageous to the Assured, and if you would let us know when you have done so, and, if possible, let us have a copy of your communication to them, we would be glad to arrange to have our Ottawa Office follow up the matter for you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWould like to receive reply of your letter to Dept. as soon as possible to enable us to follow up matter.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nSeptember 23, 1935\n\nDR. MCGILL\n\nI am sending you, herewith, a letter addressed to Mr. C.A. McKimmon, Representative of the Newark Fire Insurance Company at Drumheller, Alta., with reference to the policy for $80,000 carried by the Company on the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will observe the Company is prepared to cancel the present policy on a pro rata basis and to issue a new policy for three years at a rate of 85\u00a2 as compared to 92\u00a2, which is the rate at present in force. This arrangement would appear to be quite satisfactory, and I wish you would advise me if the department is prepared to act on Mr. Michols' suggestion.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnc. (Lr. Sept. 7)\nSeptember 24th, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 23rd instant, enclosing a letter from the Resident Inspector of the Newark Fire Insurance Company in which he proposes that the present policy No. 267 for $80,000.00 carried on the Old Jun's Boarding School Buildings be replaced by a new policy, I would advise that the change is being approved and Mr. C. A. McKinnon of Brumelle, Alberta, who wrote the policy now in force, is being instructed to have the change made.\n\nThe present policy will not expire until the 17th of June, 1936, but it carries a rate of .9% and the proposition is to write the new policy at .65%, thus effecting a saving of .25%.\n\nI consider it advisable to make this change as it will effect saving and the premium is paid from the Blackfoot Funds, the policy being carried to protect the band's equity in the property.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, September 24th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 7th instant, addressed to Mr. C. A. McKinnon, your Agent at Drumheller, Alberta, has been forwarded here and enclosed please find copy of a letter addressed to Mr. McKinnon.\n\nThis conveys full information and will expedite the matter of issuing a new policy to run for three years from the 1st of October at .85% and replaces Policy No. 2267 now in force.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nL. Nichols, Esq.,\nResident Inspector,\nBank of Toronto,\nNewark Fire Insurance Co.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, September 24th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe letter of Mr. Nichols, Resident Inspector at Calgary of the Newark Fire Insurance Company, of the 7th instant, addressed to you has been received. This letter has reference to Policy No. 2267 carried on the Old Sun's Boarding School Buildings.\n\nI note that the Insurance Company is prepared to re-write this insurance at .85% instead of the rate .92% charged in 1932. Policy No. 2267 for $60,000.00 does not expire until the 17th of June, 1936. The Insurance Company offers to cancel the present policy on a pro rata basis making a refund of premium for the unexpired portion of the insurance term.\n\nThis is acceptable to the Department if the new policy will in every way conform to the conditions under which Policy No. 2267 was written. It will be in order for you to forward a new policy at the rate of .85%, or if it is necessary to forward the old policy before a new one will issue, I shall send it upon request. In making the change, I would suggest that the date of the 1st of October be selected.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Nichols.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. A.

House, Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School on the Blackfoot Reserve, of the splendid help you so freely gave him in planning a system of irrigation which will be a great help when completed to the School Management as well as to the Indians on the Reserve. I desire on behalf of our Indian Residential School Commission to thank you very sincerely for this cooperation, and to let you know how greatly it is appreciated by all concerned. Mr. House has stated that without your help, the irrigation project he had in mind could never have been undertaken and knowing as I do, the need of it, I am able to fully appreciate the value of the help you have given.\n\nWith kindest regards and the best of good wishes for a Happy Christmas and Prosperous New Year.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully Yours,\n\nT.B.R.

Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have gone thoroughly into the matter of supplying a starting unit for your 26\" Beaver Extractor with our principals, The Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., Toronto, and they advise that the motor best wired for the type of power used, i.e., 220 volt, single phase, 60 cycle, is the wrong type for an extractor of this size, and is bound to give considerable trouble. They are of the opinion that the motor should be re-wound for three phase as this is much better for extractor duty than single phase. However, upon taking this matter up with the Calgary Power Company, they advised that this type of power cannot be supplied to Gleichen so that remedying the situation in that manner is out of the question.\n\nWe might tell you that our people in Toronto were in touch with the Lincoln Electric Co. of Toronto who supplied the motor for your extractor, but they were not in a position to supply a starting unit which they would guarantee to be free from trouble on an extractor of this size in view of the type of power being used.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that the only thing left to do is to have the present starting unit thoroughly overhauled. This would mean having a new set of condenser units installed. We are advised by the Howell Electric Co. of Howell Michigan, who supplied the starting unit, that a new type of condenser unit is now being used to replace the ones with which your starting unit is equipped, and they state that the new type have given much better satisfaction. Since there are only four of the new type compared with eight of the old type, it is reasonable to expect that the new units will give greater satisfaction.\n\nThe fact that your starting unit has been moved to a more suitable location should also materially increase the efficiency of the starting unit, and should further add to its length of service.\nWith regard to the cost of overhauling the present Starting Unit. If you will have your engineer dismantle the Unit and send to us at Calgary, we will have it thoroughly overhauled, equipped with new condenser units, returned to Gleichen and installed for $145.00.\n\nWe trust this gives you all the information you require, and assuring you of our desire to serve you whenever possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nBy: [Signature]\n\nSales.\n\nDMD/W.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nThe Division is forwarding the starting unit by express to you today.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nB.7.\n104-1-5\n\nGleichen, Alta.\nMay 23, 1936.\n\nRE: Voucher #28.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach hereto letter received from the Stanley Brock Limited dated April 6th in connection with the overhauling of the starting unit at Old Sun School. I also attach a letter received today giving further details of the work done. I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to my report on Old Sun's School at Gleichen, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent general, and to bring to your attention the following requests from the Principal arising out of his estimates sent to the secretary of the I. R. S. Commission in Winnipeg last summer:\n\n- Pig House ........................................ $750.00\n- Brick Wainscoting .................................. 300.00\n- Cement to make walk around school ............. 300.00\n- Paint for interior ................................... 150.00\n- Cupboards .............................................. 200.00\n- Windmill for the barn pump ....................... 200.00\n- Shop for manual training .......................... 3000.00\n\nI wish to point out to the Department that if there is any possible way of furnishing $750.00 to build a pig pen I would strongly recommend this: We have a make-shift affair which is really not fit for use, and unless a piggery is built we will have to stop raising pigs at this school.\n\nRegarding the brick wainscoting for the boys' play-room, they can do without this for another year. I will admit it should be done: Mr. Orr went over the school in the winter time and he is familiar with what is required. The cement walks around the school are also required and any amount that can be allowed will be appreciated. The paint for the interior is also required. We could cut this down to $100 or $125. The cupboards are required, but the school can do without these for the present. The windmill for the barn would, of course, be a saving to the school as they have to pump water there for about 16 hours every day, which uses up a lot of electricity. The work-shop for manual training is not absolutely essential at the present time. I trust that whatever expenditures can be allowed by the Department in connection with the above, will be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, June 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 12th instant, regarding the requests from the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School, arising from the estimates submitted by him to the Field Secretary of the I.R.S. Commission, last year.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it was only possible to provide the following items in our Appropriation for this school for the current fiscal year:\n\n- Paint for interior - $150,\n- Miscellaneous repairs - $450,\n- Windmill for barn pump - $200.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, of the paint required for the interior of the school building, not exceeding in cost the amount of $150. It is noted that it might be possible to cut this down to $100 or $125. If any saving in the amount provided can be made, I should leave a further amount for miscellaneous repairs. I would suggest, for the consideration of the Principal and yourself, that the funds provided for miscellaneous repairs be used in the purchase of cement to make walk around school and in supplying and installing cupboards. However, the amount of $450 may be utilized as decided by the Principal and yourself in carrying out the work considered most urgent, and you may arrange for the purchase of the materials.\n\nThere will be no funds this year to erect a pig-house, to complete the brick wainscoting of the boys' playroom or to provide a shop for manual training.\n\nRegarding the windmill for the barn pump, as stated above, the sum of $200 is available for this purpose, and you may arrange for the purchase, from the best available source of supply.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized expenditures, which you should certify and forward in the usual manner.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Gurney Orr,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nWhen you were at the school, I showed you the condition of the plaster in our boys play room. We have just been trying to patch it again and are finding that the metal lath is so loosened and sprung that the plaster will not stay in place. It bulges out as soon as it is finished and begins to break away. I am afraid it has reached a point where it is about impossible to fix.\n\nI think you said that brick from the floor to the level of the windows would not be satisfactory because of the difficulty of tying it to the wall, and your suggestion was to take the plaster right out and then replaster directly upon the hollow tile wall. I am not sufficiently experienced in the art of building to know what would be best, but I do know that a plastered play room for boys is an impossible proposition from the point of view of upkeep. Could you not help us to get something to take the place of that plaster.\n\nI notice that the plaster is now beginning to separate farther up the wall. The reason for that seems to be that the lower part is so weakened that the weight of that above is gradually pulling it from the ceiling. I am afraid the whole thing will come down if we leave it much longer.\n\nThe length of wall needing repair is 140 feet and the plaster is ruined to a height of 5 feet. That is just the outside wall and a few feet of the inside.\n\nWith kindest regards,\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn W.

He phoned to me and explained the situation and said that his instructions were not to tamper with the sealed unit. I suggested he should call Bruce Robinson Company by phone as they had installed the unit.\n\nThey advised that this was a minor trouble and would be in the Gleichen District shortly and their service man would correct the trouble. He found certain parts had worn and required replacement or adjustment.\n\nWe now receive this account but no authority was requested as we expected that the total would be less than Ten dollars.

Pupils did not have holidays at Easter but got three days when interest payment was made on the 15th & 16th. All pupils look well. The school farms and gardens are being seeded and work is being done very well. Some handicraft work has been started and Coronation Programmes are being prepared. The Principal at Crowfoot School wants more land, a problem to be considered and one which is not easy because Indian farmers are close neighbours and have valuable buildings on the land which the school desires. However, I believe there is a solution.\n\nThe Old Sun school is not so situated; unoccupied land near the school and in the flats where irrigation is possible is now capable of intensive production of feed and garden crops for this institution. This year, I expect that Old Sun's will grow all vegetables and feed required. Formerly this was impossible on dry lands.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent\nOld Sun School  \nGleichen, Alta.  \nJune 15, 1937\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham  \nIndian Agent,  \nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham,\n\nIn my estimates of requirements from the Department for 1937 there were two items as follows:\n\nPaint ........ $125.00  \nRepairs to wall of boys' playroom .. $300.00\n\nAs the summer holiday time is the only period when interior painting and repairs can be conveniently done, I wish you would ask the Department if I can have the paint right away and the playrooms bricked within the next two months.\n\nOur paint requirements are:\n\n- Inside white 15 gals\n- Ivory 10\n- Russet brown 3\n- French grey 2\n- White enamel 3\n- Outside green 5\n- French grey cement paint .......... 2\n- Shellac 1\n\nBrushes 2\u00bd\" 2  \n\" 1\u00bc\" 2\n\nIt would be a convenience to us if we could have BARCO Satin Glo paint because that is the paint already on the walls where patching is needed and, unless the same kind is used, the colours do not match often necessitating more extensive painting than is really necessary. We have found Satin Glo by far the best and most economical paint for our walls.\n\nFor four years I have been asking that the boys' playroom be bricked or cemented and nothing has been done. The inevitable has happened; instead of only having the lower part of the walls falling to pieces we now have the plaster to the roof loosening and if something is not done soon we shall have a complete lining of the whole room to consider. I wish you would bring this matter before the Department as a real urgency.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.W. House  \nPrincipal\nCOPY\n\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.,\nJune 15, 1937.\n\nRe: Old Sun Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach hereto copies of a letter the Principal of Old Sun Residential School wrote to me as the result of an interview about estimated requirements.\n\nThe immediate need is paint. The school was erected in 1930 and during the past five summers, some painting of the plaster walls has been done. You know how dirty the unpainted plaster wall becomes and that the only real remedy is paint. He has also some outside work to do this year. The walls of the boys playroom are in bad shape. I would like you to see them.\n\nI hope you can see your way clear to ask for the paint now. As Mr. House says, painting can only be done when the children are on holiday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) \"G. H. GOODERHAM,\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nC. F.

Gooderham, Indian Agent, Blackfoot Agency, by Rev. J. W. House, Principal of the Old Sun Residential School, which speaks for itself.\n\nThe matter of brick wainscotting in the boys' play-room was placed before the Department by Mr. Inspector M. Christianson last year, but was not allowed due to lack of funds. (Reference Departmental letter No. 104-1-5 dated June 16th, 1936.)\n\nI recommend that the request for paint - $150.00 be granted, and that Mr. Agent Gooderham be authorized to make the purchase. If funds are available I would also ask that the brick wainscotting be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant.

Hoover, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Calgary, on the water supply from the well at Old Sun Indian School, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nIt appears that this well has been causing trouble for some years and in 1935 it was rehabilitated by changing the pipe and cylinder to a smaller size. This gave satisfactory results for one year but the same trouble - pumping air - again started with the result that the water supply is insufficient, probably due to water filling too slowly into the drilled hole.\n\nAs no suggestion has been made for correction of the trouble and as it is imperative that something be done before the opening of the school in September, we are having one of our engineers make a thorough investigation and will advise you as soon as his report is received.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nJuly 5, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\nDirector - Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI wish to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your memorandum of the 29th of June in which you advise that you are having one of your engineers make a thorough investigation into the water supply from the well at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School, at Gleichen, Alta.\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nTERRACE BUILDING\n\nMESSRS.\n\nTO Mechanical Branch, Dept. of Public Works\nMAKE CHEQUES PAYABLE TO PROVINCIAL TREASURER, and\nForward to Inspector\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 3rd   | To Inspection of Boiler No 10669, Cert No    | 10.00  |\n|            | 62209                                        |        |\n|            | 10670, \"                                       | 5.00   |\n|            | 10754, \"                                       | 10.00  |\n|            | Interest Acct.

Gardens at both schools are irrigated and are good. Old Sun school has a good fodder crop under irrigation. At Crowfoot grain crops were poor and are out for feed; the Principal augmented this by purchasing between 30 and 40 tons of prairie hay and wheat hay from Indians. We allowed this to co-operate, but God Knows, every ton offered is needed and then it will cost $10.00 to $15.00 per ton for extra feed for Indian stock. The well at Old Suns was inspected again by an engineer of our Department. The water level is dropping and an auxiliary well is needed, I believe. The basement of this school is being repaired. The Chief's are prepared to supply nurses at the schools for the year 1937-38 on condition that they have T.B. experience, are recommended by the Medical Branch and follow the instructions of the Medical Superintendent; all of which is reasonable, I think. The time is near at hand when this should become a Departmental and not a Band obligation.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nSTATEMENT\n\nGleichen Alta, Aug. 1937\n\nM.

Shelson.\n\nSome delay has been experienced in getting out the further report, due to the fact that Mr. W.H. Shelson is now on sick leave and for several weeks has been absent not only from the Banff office, but from Banff itself. As Mr. Shelson is the only engineer in the Engineering and Construction Service who has had an opportunity of looking into this question, I forwarded a copy of your letter of the 3rd instant to him and asked that - if possible - he should supplement his original report. I am quoting below from Mr. Shelson's reply to the above request, and trust this will convey all the information necessary:\n\n\"The well at the school was producing, at the time of the test on July 10th, at the rate of slightly less than 3,000 gallons per day, and under more favorable rainfall conditions had been producing between 4,000 and 4,500 gallons per day. A well near the hospital and Agency office, about three-quarters of a mile distant North from the school, is now supplying 5,000 gallons per day to the hospital office and other government buildings. While it is impossible to determine the flow that might be obtained from any new well before drilling, it was assumed that the new well would tap the same water-bearing strata that are supplying the two existing wells, as the log of wells drilled in this locality shows in general that the water-bearing strata are pierced at 65, 125, and 175 feet; therefore, if a well were drilled within approximately 100 yards of the present school well and the work properly done, it should produce at least as much as a mean of the above wells (4,000) or between 3,000 and 5,000 gallons per day. This amount, when added to the flow of the present well, should total between 6,000 and 8,000 gallons per day. The requirement of the school is at present approximately 6,000 gallons per day.\"\n\n\"A tentative site for a new well was selected near the residence of the farm superintendent, some 500 feet west of the present well.\"\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) C.M. Walker.\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT\nof\nMINES AND RESOURCES\nSurveys and Engineering Branch\nBanff, Alberta.\nJuly 22nd., 1937.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Water Supply, Old Sun Indian School\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nIn compliance with your request of the 5th instant, Mr. Nelson inspected the water supply of the Old Sun Indian School at Gleichen, Alberta on the 16th instant.\n\nThis system consists of a cased well 177 feet deep fitted with a 3\" discharge pipe and 24\" Hoosier pump cylinder. A 3\" pipe, 36\" long, with lower end capped and 15\" of perforations above cap, is attached to the lower end of the pump cylinder. The cap is three feet above the bottom of the well.\n\nThe pump is operated by a gear head connected to a 3H.P. 60 cycle, single phase 220 volt motor. On test this motor ran the pump on a ten inch stroke at the rate of 36 strokes per minute. This gives a computed pump capacity of 80 gallons per minute. A test of the capacity of the well, made February 7th, 1937, gave an average hourly supply of 150 gallons per hour. A similar test made on the 17th instant gave an average hourly flow of but 112 gallons per hour, a decrease in supply of some 38 gallons per hour. This decrease in supply is without doubt due to a general lowering of the ground water table throughout the district, caused by the greatly decreased annual precipitation of the past two or three years. The last test was made under most favourable conditions as the school has been closed for some time and therefore the daily demand on the well has been at a minimum.\n\nIn as much as the discharge of the well at present is insufficient for the needs of the school, and as climatic conditions favouring a rise of ground water and increased supply to the well may again occur soon, I would recommend that the supply of the present well be augmented by drilling a new well on a favourable site near by. This new well should be drilled to the depth of the present one and have a motor and pump capacity to deliver 4 to 5 gallons per minute. I would recommend that a pump and discharge pipe of between 1\u00bd and 2\" be selected.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work will be approximately $1200.00 as follows:\n\nMotor and Pump..........\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMotor and pump head ........... $400.00 installed\nSmall pipe and fittings ...... 125.00 \"\n6\" well casing .................. 150.00 \"\nLabour drilling well .......... 300.00 \"\nSmall building to cover well .. 225.00 \"\n\nTotal ........ $1200.00\n\nIt is not anticipated that any further trouble from air-locks will be experienced when both wells are in operation, as the combined flow from the two wells should be between 7,000 and 8,000 gallons per day while the maximum daily consumption at the present time being placed at 6,000 gallons per day. The \"air-locks\" of course occurred when the rate of supply of water to the well fell below the discharge capacity of the pump. The pump then \"sucked\" air, and built up an air-lock in the discharge system.\n\nHowever, to prevent and relieve any further air-locks in the present well I would recommend the installation of a \"cast iron automatic air bent, 1/2\", for a working pressure of 1 to 30 pounds\", similar to Crane's No. 984. Estimated cost $10.00. This valve should be attached to the discharge pipe and placed between the pump head outlet and the first check valve.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) C.W.

We have now received reports from our Engineer, of dates July 22nd and August 19th, copies of which are attached.\n\nYou will note that the recommendation is that a new well should be drilled at a site some 500 feet west of the present well and near the residence of the Farm Superintendent. The total estimate of cost of such work is $1,200. It is further recommended that an air valve at an estimated cost of $10.00 be attached to the present well to prevent and relieve any further air locks.\n\nKindly advise if you can arrange for this amount to be transferred for the above work.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 3, 1937.\n\nG.

The water table is not likely to rise \u2014 we must anticipate a fall and if it does, the supply will be inadequate this coming winter unless water is rationed.\n\nI located a driller who will operate for $1.25 per foot and it is my honest opinion that the Department should spend up to $500.00 in an attempt to get water. It is possible that it may be brought in at less than 200 feet; if it is dry hole at 200 ft. I do not recommend going much deeper. The Town of Gleichen have been unsuccessful in securing water at a lower depth and this is only one mile from the school, then the Town fathers failed to get water for the Town they looked around for old wells and finally came up with one which has been flowing for many years. The idea is a good one but in the case of Old Sun's, I would recommend the use of the barn well only as a last resort. This well has not a strong flow, but seems to be steady. On analysis, we found that the water contained considerable animal matter and should not be consumed by humans. However, it might be mixed to the school and used for cooking as a last resort.\n\nAfter a well is brought in it is not a big job to connect with the school when necessary. If water is located under 200 feet it will not cost $150.00 to complete the connection. First let us get the well. I may say that Mr. Betterly and Mr. Huleman were very conscientious in their investigations of the Old Sun's water situation. I believe the demand for an auxiliary supply is urgently needed.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1937.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Hardie\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of the first instant with reference to the water supply at the Old Sun's Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta, the Department wired our Indian Agent at that point.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of his reply.\n\nAs no special provision was made in the current year's appropriation, it is difficult to find funds for any extensive work at Old Sun's School.

Walker, Engineering Branch, Banff to drill. In this, the writer assisted in finding the driller and the location.\n\nI am pleased to report that a reasonably good well has been brought in at 185 feet and the total cost is, I understand $505.00. I have conferred with the consulting engineer Mr. Snelson, and we strongly recommend that a pumping plant be installed and pipe laid to connect with the existing water system. This well will then become the main source of water supply and the old plant the auxiliary.\n\nThe present water supply is inadequate and unreliable. We should not go into the winter depending on it alone. I understand that it will cost about $500.00 for the plant and the connections and sincerely hope you can find the funds to install it.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 5th with reference to the water supply at the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that you estimate the cost of a new pumping plant and connections at $600.\n\nIn order that we may have the necessary information to place before our Purchasing Agent, please let me have full details regarding the equipment that is required. You should state the capacity of the pump that is necessary and any other information that is required to assist the Department in placing an order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nNovember 12, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Water supply, Old Sun Indian Residential School, Gleichen.\n\nA report has just been received from my Supervising Engineer in the West that the work of drilling a new well at the above point has been completed with very satisfactory results. Tests show a water supply of more than 4 gallons per minute has been obtained which, combined with the flow from the old well, will give ample supply for the needs of the school.\n\nOur Supervising Engineer points out, however, that there is no pump or other convenient means of supplying water from the new well to the school. This matter has been discussed with the Superintendent of the School and with the Indian Agent at Gleichen and as a result our Engineer recommends that in order to avoid a shortage of water during the coming winter, the purchase of the following equipment be made:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Electric motor and pump                   | $198.00|\n| Cylinder                                  | 17.00  |\n| Drop pipe and rods                        | 50.00  |\n| Electric wiring switch and drop light     | 21.00  |\n| 30-gallon pressure tank                   | 28.25  |\n| Cartage and installation                  | 25.00  |\n| Labour, digging 350 feet of trench and laying connecting pipe | 150.00 |\n| Small concrete house for pump             | 125.00 |\n| Connecting pipe, 200 ft. of 1\u00bd\"           | 50.00  |\n| Incidentals, valves, strainer, etc.       | 40.75  |\n\nTotal - $700.00\nYou will note that the above estimate of $700 covers installation. You might kindly advise if funds can be made available to cover this work.\n\nNo report as to the cost of drilling the new well has yet been received but it is likely that the greater portion of the $500 made available has been expended.\n\nIf funds for the above equipment are not available, enquiry will be made as to whether or not an ordinary hand-pump fully insulated from frost would be of use. This would involve transporting water from the new well to the school building.\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA, November 18, 1937.\n\nG.H.

There was a water shortage and on investigation I found that the water cooled engine, operating the refrigerator, took 1000 gallons of water per day to cool it and then the water ran into the sewer. Is it not wonderful economy to dig a well and put in a pumping plant, which supplies little more water than it requires to cool a 3 H.P. engine. It should be replaced of course, by an oil bath engine. To supply the bare necessities, the refrigerator is shut off part time and hose from the water cooled engine and also from the barn well, where a borrowed pressure tank is installed, augment the water supplied from the plant installed in 1937, and gives the institution sufficient for the present. The old well should be cleaned and if there is then a fairly good supply of water, a Delco plant should replace the obsolete one. This will be a summer holiday job. We ploughed some land for this school with an engine outfit, as they are low on horses. Here's hoping the church has a prosperous year and funds to equip themselves.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Alta.\nMay 12, 1938.\n\nRE: Old Sun's Refrigerator Plant\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the Old Sun Residential School a water cooled compressor was installed to operate the Frigidaire. This was installed when the School was erected and equipped.\n\nRecently, one of the plants which supply water to this institution gave out and temporary measures were necessary to get sufficient to meet dire needs. Among other things, we looked at the refrigerator compressor where water was used and wasted into a drain. On a test we found that this compressor used between 900 and 1000 gallons every day. That is a terrible lot of water when it is so scarce and when the cost of power to pump it is so high. It is bad business.\n\nI consulted Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd of Calgary Provincial Agents for Frigidaire and am advised that the water cooled compressor can be changed for an air-cooled compressor and installed for about $55.00. I beg to recommend that the change be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant recommending the installation of a new air-cooled compressor in the frigidaire equipment at the Old Sun's Residential School.\n\nNew purchasing regulations require that any articles costing over $50.00 must be secured through the office of the purchasing agent. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to forward me full details regarding the compressor and if possible state the name of the firm by which this is manufactured and the catalogue number. When this is received I will recommend that the purchasing agent secure it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H.

The old well and the plant which has been in use for some years, gave out. The cost of repairing the plant will be considerable and, in our opinion, is not justified. It is of obsolete type.\n\nWe believe the well is still good if cleaned out, and it is our recommendation that it be cleaned and if the water supply is satisfactory, that a Delco Plant be installed to replace the old plant which is little more than scrap.\n\nThe only reliable driller in these parts is Myers Rasmussen and he is prepared to clean out the well for the sum of Seventy Five Dollars. We think the well has filled in from 30' to 40' with silt and sand, and as there is a small brick building over the well, it will not be an easy job to clean it. Rasmussen's offer is reasonable. Would authority be granted to do this work?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $75.00 in cleaning the well at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. In connection with this school I may say that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $750.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment. Owing to the present set up of our appropriation it is practically impossible for us to exceed the amount specifically provided.\n\nRecently we placed an order for an air-cooled compressor for the frigidaire. The approximate cost of this is $65.00 and this amount, together with the cost of cleaning the well, will have to be deducted from the amount provided. This leaves a balance of $10.00 which amount is all that we can expend during the current fiscal year at the Old Sun's School for repairs, improvements and new equipment.\n\nYou might consult the Principal and if it is necessary to expend this amount you should supply full particulars regarding what you consider is most necessary. In the event of any equipment or material being required full particulars should be given in order that the matter may be placed before our purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H.

We are now satisfied with the water supply and believe which does not pump over 3 gallons per minute will not draw too heavily on this well and will be sufficient, since a similar unit operates in a well drilled in 1937. The total supply from the two wells would be in the neighborhood of 5 gallons per minute and that is a lot of water per day. The local plumber, L. Michael, has kindly assisted us in compiling the bill of material required for this system and same is attached hereto with estimate of labor costs. Mr. Michael is the local agent for Bruce Robinson, Calgary, general agents for General Motors products.\n\n2. Re the upright heating boiler, 50 flues are leaking badly and must be rolled and beaded. Mr. Michael has offered to do this for $25.00 and I recommend acceptance; he does finished work.\n\n3. A root house was built some years ago from old lumber and fence posts. Most of it rotted and\nsaved in this year, needless to say a frost proof cellar is needed. The Principal removed the top and will require some new material to rebuild it.\n\nThere is only one Lumber yard in this district, the Crown at Gleichen. Attached is a bill of material. The cost if purchased from the Crown Lumber Company will be $52.45.\n\nThe Principal of the School has just returned from holidays and after consulting with him and keeping in mind that the appropriation for this school is limited, we ask that the foregoing be approved.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be little delay. The water plant and boiler will be needed when the school opens in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H.

H. Beach in payment of an insurance premium of $650.00 on the Old Sun Residential School and was charged to the Blackfoot Band Trust Account No. 137, the school being insured at $50,000, a portion of its total value.\n\nThis building was constructed by the Department of Indian Affairs in the fiscal year 1929-30 at a cost of approximately $135,000. At the time it was found that the amount set aside in the Parliamentary Appropriations of that year was not sufficient to carry the school to completion, and so under the circumstances the Blackfoot Band agreed to loan the Crown $60,000 from their Capital Funds under Section 93 of the Indian Act. The loan was approved by Order in Council 207 dated January 29, 1930, and reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The Minister states that it is proposed that this amount should be refunded to the band within the next two fiscal years in conformity with the department's policy that all cost of Indian Education should be defrayed from public funds.\"\n\nTo date the loan has not been repaid and reference has been made to it in various letters relating to the audit of revenue and verification of cash.\n\nI would be pleased, however, to learn why insurance is carried on this apparently government owned building, since the Department considers the $60,000 a responsibility of the Crown. Also in the event of the destruction of the building by fire would the Band be entitled to the insurance and the repayment of the loan?\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Geo. Gonthier\nAuditor General.\n\nCharles Gansel, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 4th, I wish to advise you that the insurance carried on the old Sun Residential School, Blackfoot Reserve, was placed in 1933 for the purpose of protecting the equity of the bond in the building after the term of the loan had expired without repayment having been made and no immediate prospects of funds being available to do so.\n\nIn the event of the building being destroyed by fire, it is considered that the bond would be entitled to receive the insurance or repayment on the loan, but certainly not both.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nGeorges Gonthier, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 27, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe - Old Sun Indian Residential School\n\nYou are probably aware that when the Old Sun C. E. Residential School, on the Blackfoot reserve, Alberta, was destroyed by fire in June, 1928, it was impossible, owing to the limited appropriation set apart for the project, to rebuild at that time until the Blackfoot Indians consented to loan to the Crown $60,000 from their Interest Account to enable the work to proceed. The Department contributed $40,000 toward the construction of the new building. The present school was constructed by the Department during the fiscal year 1929-30.\n\nThe loan secured from the Blackfoot Band was approved by Order in Council 207 dated January 29, 1930, and reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The Minister states that it is proposed that this amount should be refunded to the Band within the next two fiscal years in conformity with the Department's policy that all cost of Indian Education should be defrayed from public funds\".\n\nTo date this loan has not been repaid although the desirability of making repayment has come up for discussion on more than one occasion during the last two or three years.

Michael, for work done at Old Sun Residential School, this is to advise you that the work and material were necessary to keep the plant operating.\n\nOwing to sand formations which were difficult to counteract in one of the wells supplying water to the school it was necessary to replace a plunger and belting to keep it in operation. It was also necessary to stop steam from leaking from a heating boiler which has been in operation since the school was erected.\n\nThis Voucher is submitted because it is felt that this is something that should be paid by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nGHOR\nAttention: Education Branch\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Old Sun School\n\nRoof drains on the flat tar and gravel roof of this institution have commenced to leak and will destroy plaster if not attended to immediately. There are three copper roof connections now leaking, which is due to corrosion caused by sewer gas as they are connected with the sewage system.\n\nThe cost to replace the copper connections and to repair the flashing which in recent high winds has been loosened and ripped off in places, will, according to Mr. Michael, Gleichen plumber, total $58.00.\n\nLast year the main chimney of this institution was hit by lightning and the falling brick apparently damaged a space about 20 x 30 of the tar and gravel roof over the chapel. The cost of repairing the chimney was borne by the Insurance Company who carried this risk, but the writer failed to note this particular damage and it must now, therefore, be attended to. To re-tar and gravel will cost about $34.00.\n\nWould authority be given to incur the foregoing expenditures, which should be attended to immediately to avoid further damage?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nApril 12, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may expend an amount of $58.60 in making the necessary repairs to the roof of the Old Sun Indian residential school.\n\nYou may also expend $34.00 in repairing the tar and gravel roof over the chapel of the Old Sun school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nAttention: Supt. Welfare and Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter addressed to myself by the Principal of the Old Sun Residential School in which he sets forth in detail the immediate requirements at his institution which include paint and renewals for taps, showers and toilet flush systems.\n\nIt is not known here what the authorized expenditure allowance for this school is for the present fiscal year; however, these items represent the immediate requirements which, undoubtedly, will not amount to the funds made available for work at this school.\n\nAs considerable of this work must be done before school reopens, it would be appreciated if authority could be raised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nGNG:R\nE.C.\nOld Sun School, Gleichen,\nJuly 18th, 1939.\n\nMr. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nAt last I have a complete list of the things urgently needed from the Department: They fall into two classes: 1. Paint; 2. Renewals for taps, showers and toilet flush systems.\n\nWith regard to No. 1 (Paint) the majority is to be used for retouching playrooms and dormitories and classrooms which have one coat of paint already. That means I must have the same kind as is already on the walls or the whole room will have to be redecorated. No two firms seem to manufacture the same tints so we must have \"Bapco\" Satin Glo. You can see the force of this when I state that there are over 170,000 sq. feet of paint surface in this school and the school management cannot possibly hope to do more than renovate the more necessary parts each year. I am stating the amount of paint required with the prices quoted by the B.A. head office in Calgary.\n\n| B.A. Satin Glo |\n|----------------|\n| Inside white   | 10 gals. $32.50 |\n| Ivory          | 15 gals. $40.75 |\n| White enamel   | 2 gals. $7.50   |\n| Russet Brown   | 3 gals. $6.70   |\n| Outside green  | 5 gals. $14.50  |\n| French grey    | 5 gals. $6.50   |\n| Turpentine     | 5 gals. $4.50   |\n| Linseed Oil    | 5 gals. $5.00   |\n| Long hair paint brushes | 2 - 4 in. $.70 |\n| Chisel pointed brushes | 2 - 1 in. $.70 |\n| Containers     | $2.00           |\n\nWith regard to No. 2: Our water has a peculiar corrosive action on all metal work. This is particularly evident in taps and toilets which are continually in use. The seats of practically all our taps in the children's washrooms are now gone beyond repair. We have reeated them so many times that there is now no seat left. The only remedy now is to replace them. The same thing has happened with\nour closet flush systems and shower baths. I am asking for parts which will put them in shape again. These have all been in continuous use for ten years without spending money on them so it is time they were thoroughly renovated.\n\nThe one toilet bowl has become so rough that it will not flush. The sets of pump belts are necessary for renewals for the pump installed last year. Sand finds its way up from the well and cuts them to pieces. We seem to require two a year. The following is the list of requirements with prices quoted by Mr. L. Michael:\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Price |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Syphon jet bowl                           | 1        | $9.70 |\n| Toilet supply pipe 5 ft                   | 3        | 21.54 |\n| Toilet supply pipe 2 in                   | 3        | 4.50  |\n| Elips M.P. 2 x 14                         | 3        | 3.90  |\n| Slip nuts 1/2                             | 6        | 2.28  |\n| Slip nuts 2                               | 3        | 1.92  |\n| Open front closet seats                   | 3        | 14.07 |\n| Brackets 12 high                          | 5        | 6.25  |\n| Pull chain                                | 5 yd     | 1.05  |\n| Elevated ball cock, complete              | 6        | 10.04 |\n| Ball cocks complete                       | 6        | 20.10 |\n| Double bath cocks, complete               | 6        | 23.40 |\n| Flush balls and stems                     | 6        | 3.00  |\n| Bath waste & overflow (Crane)             | 3        | 11.31 |\n| Hose bibs M.P.                            | 6        | 7.14  |\n| Hose bibs L.N.P.                          | 4        | 7.00  |\n| Elips 1/2 galvanized                      | 8        | 1.20  |\n| Tees 1/2 galvanized                       | 2        | .45   |\n| Com.

Your 10-1-39.\n\nLarge doors on the hay loft of the school barn have broken away from the trackage and it will be necessary to set them on new trackage, with new trolleys, pulleys and cables of a very much stronger type than formerly in use. These doors are very large and heavy and in this country where winds are so high it is always found difficult to keep them in order. The estimated cost for material and labor is $55.00, of which only $10.00 is labor. Could immediate authority be given to have these repaired, please?\n\nReferring back to our letter of July 22nd, you will note that there was an item in the list of required materials and repairs submitted by the Principal of the school for repairs to outside door frames on the main building. The writer inspected these the other day and finds that these heavy doors have pulled clear of their frames and in fact one door has been taken off. The cost to replace and fix them in such a manner that they will be reasonably firm is $15.00. Authority to get these frames fixed as soon as possible is also required.

This is particularly evident in taps and toilets which are continually in use. Practically all the taps in the children's wash rooms are now gone beyond repair and the only remedy is to replace them. The parts requested above will put everything in good condition. Those that are worn out have been in continuous use for 10 years. As the installation of the above equipment should be made during the summer holidays while the pupils are absent from the school it would be appreciated if this order were placed immediately.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.
