Brother Gauthier's suggestion was not considered advisable and, in any case, no funds are available this year. The Department Architect believes that it may be necessary to add a supplementary unit to the present heating system if it is really overloaded. A note will be taken for future Estimates.\n\nWith reference to the present sewage disposal, I may say that the only criticism of the system has been that there was a pollution of the lake.

During the Fall and Spring, this room is habitable but it is hardly so during the cold winter months. In view of this, I am sure that the Department will wish to reconsider its decision and that it will at least have a small radiator installed in that room. The addition of this small radiator will not materially decrease the efficiency of the plant as far as the school is concerned and will make the room referred to above more habitable. It is really too much to ask of anyone in our northern country, to occupy a room that is not heated and I am sure that the Department is fully aware of this.\n\nSo, although I am not urging the expenditure of any large sum on the Kenora School Heating Plant, I nevertheless am of the opinion that some radiation should be installed in the above room.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter early and favorable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE REVEREND OBLATE FATHERS\n\nPer;-\n\n[Signature]\n\nWith regards,\nSister [Signature]\nOttawa, October 30, 1931.\n\nRev.

Ferguson, Department Medical Officer and also Medical Officer for Health of the Town of Kanora.\n\nHe believes that either of the two proposed systems would, in his opinion, meet with the approval of the Ontario Board of Health, but of course is not able to speak for them, and would suggest that the matter be taken up with Dr. W. J.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa - Ont.\n\nAEB/K.\nToronto, Dec. 18, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal for the Indian Residential School, Kenora.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, together with report on the proposed sewage disposal system for the above school.\n\nAfter reviewing this report we are of the opinion that Scheme No.1 (the cheaper of the two) with certain modifications can be made quite satisfactory for this purpose. We understand that the population here is about 75 persons. We feel that the design should be made for a population of 100.\n\nUtilizing both tanks in Scheme No.1 should provide sufficient sedimentation and storage for this purpose. We are not certain, however, from the report as to just what is intended to be done with the second tank. It is stated in the report that a syphon chamber will be constructed. There is some doubt as to whether it was the intention to utilize the entire second tank as a syphon chamber, or to use only part of it. We feel that it would be more desirable to use both of these tanks for sedimentation purposes and to construct a small syphon chamber as an addition to this. This would not be an expensive item.\n\nIn connection with the disposal bed, it would appear that the bed suggested for Scheme No.1, with the addition of some extra rows of tiles would be made satisfactory. You have in this bed now approximately 1000' of distribution tiles. We believe it would be advisable to increase this number to probably 1500'.\n\nWe are also interested in the method suggested for the disposal of the laundry wastes. It would not be satisfactory to discharge this into the water without treatment. We see no reason why it cannot be passed through the septic tank system. This amount of waste should not upset the condition in the tanks, particularly if both are used for sedimentation purposes.

Murphy,\n\nThe Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Kenora is located close to the shore of a small bay of the Lake of the Woods about three miles from Kenora. There have been many complaints in the past few years from the Ontario Department of Health that the sewage from this School is contaminating to a great extent the water in the Lake of the Woods. The School is located about half a mile above the intake of the Kenora water supply system, and at the present time the Kenora water supply is being chlorinated to such a degree as to render it very disagreeable to drink, and still the Ontario Department of Health is not satisfied as to its safety. Steps are being taken to prevent the pollution of the water of the Lake and the Residential School is considered to be a very grave offender in this respect. It is therefore necessary to arrange this year for alterations to the existing septic tank and the installing of a new filter bed.\n\nLast year Mr. J.M. Cox of the Winnipeg office of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service made a survey and report as to what is required. He submitted two proposals. The first scheme provides for making use of the existing septic tank, with minor changes, and the entire construction of a new disposal bed. This scheme will cost approximately $1,600.00.\n\nScheme No. 2 provides for a more complete disposal system, more in conformity with modern installation. It involves the complete scrapping of the existing disposal system and the construction of an entirely new one. The estimated cost of Scheme No. 2 is $4,000.00.\n\nA copy of Mr. Cox's report was submitted to the Director of the Sanitary Engineering Division of the Ontario Department of Health, and they reported that, with a few modifications, they considered Scheme No. 1 would be satisfactory, and the Architect of the Department also recommends that this scheme be adopted.\n\n$1,600.00 has provided in this year's estimates for this work and if you approve Mr. Cox will be asked to proceed with the work, the same to be under his supervision.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nKENORA ONT 26\n\nASST DEPUTY AND SECY\n\nDEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nSEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM AGAIN BROKEN DOWN AT KENORA CATHOLIC SCHOOL\nAND SEWAGE CANNOT GET AWAY CAN YOU GIVE INSTRUCTIONS IMMEDIATELY\nTO DOMINION WATER POWER PLANT TO START ONE OF THE SUGGESTED\nSCHEMES IN THEIR REPORT THIRD JANUARY NINETEEN THIRTY ONE OR\nSHALL WE ORDER TEMPORARY REPAIRS WHICH WOULD BE EXPENSIVE\n\nFRANK EDWARDS\nApril 27, 1925.\n\nHonourable Thomas G.

Kelly & Kimberley, inform me that the sewer pipe at the School has been cleaned out, and that the sewage should now be able to get away satisfactorily, till you start the work, when the children go on vacation. The pipe had got blocked up through years of accumulation of debris, and it took some considerable time to trace the pipe, so as to get to the seat of the trouble.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\nnecessary to construct the bed would render terracing necessary if an additional 500 feet of tile had to be placed. Please ascertain from the Department of Indian Affairs if the proposed modifications of the Ontario Department of Health are to be complied with. The Department of Health's assumption that as the population of the school is about 75, that the design should be made for a population of 100, is hardly a correct one to apply, since this is an old school and it is altogether probable that the population of 75 will be decreased rather than added to. Personally, I still consider that the Scheme No.1, as outlined, is quite adequate to provide a very thorough method of sewage disposal.\n\nMr. Williams' letter instructs to have the work commenced at once. I doubt very much whether the frost is out of the ground as yet and the lake is not free of ice. The work cannot be commenced until such time as the frost is entirely out of the ground and free access can be had to the site from the lake. The work will probably take three weeks at least, during which time the school sessions after once will be in operation. I will know better tomorrow after my inspection, whether or not the present blockage of the system can be temporarily overcome. If it can be overcome, then the remodelling of the system can be deferred until the time of the school vacation. If it cannot be remedied then it will be necessary for the school authorities to see along without any sewage system until such time as the new work can be undertaken and completed. If such a condition is intolerable, the school can be closed and the children sent home to their reserves a few weeks earlier than is customary.\n\nAs you are aware, this office has no funds available to meet expenditures undertaken in connection with the work for the Department of Indian Affairs. According to the new system of accounting, it is impossible to take monies from our own appropriation to spend on this work and later have the money returned from any other vote. Accordingly, I would request that you take up with the Department of Indian Affairs the matter of having sufficient funds advanced to this district office as will defray all expenses incurred in connection with this work. It might also be advisable to suggest to the Department of Indian Affairs that in future all arrangements for work to be done under the direction of this office should be arranged through your office at Ottawa.\n\nUpon the conclusion of my visit to Kenora I will write you further re the proposed remodelling of the sewerage system at the R.C. Indian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) D. H. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of correspondence received today from the Acting Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs in connection with the R.C. Indian School at Kenora. Captain Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, phoned me this morning re the very serious condition prevailing at the school and at his urgent request I agreed to leave tonight for Kenora to look into the situation and see what, if anything, can be done to remedy conditions by temporary expedients.\n\nFrom Mr. Williams' letter I would infer that the work is to be carried out under the personal direction and supervision of someone from this staff. Mr. Rose is the only member of the staff available who has had any experience with such work, and his services are required in connection with hydrometric work in this district. The work, when undertaken, will probably take three weeks to complete so that it will be difficult to have anyone from this staff assigned to the work unless the job is undertaken at such time as suits our convenience.\n\nMr. Williams states that the work is to be carried out by day labour and the material to be purchased by this office, and certain individuals in Kenora are to be consulted as to where materials are to be purchased and through whom labour is to be obtained. Personally I consider that it will be preferable to have the work undertaken by a competent local contractor on a basis of cost plus a fixed sum, the contractor placing on the work a competent foreman at a daily wage scale. Considerable equipment and tools would be required and the contractor could furnish all such tools, equipment and material. I may say that the arrangement adopted by this office in connection with work undertaken at the Sandy Bay Indian School in Manitoba, and proved to be a most satisfactory manner of having the work completed. It will, of course, be necessary to have an engineer on the job to give levels and to supervise the work as it progresses.\n\nI notice that the Ontario Department of Health have approved of Scheme No.1 as outlined in my report of January 3, 1931, with some modifications however. These suggested modifications will materially add to the cost of the work - possibly to the extent of 50%. The construction of an additional retention chamber would be expensive enough and adding 50% to the extent of the disposal bed would practically add 50% to the cost of the same. - Inasmuch as the steep slope upon which it is\n\nJ.

Indian School at Kenora, I beg to advise you that I visited the latter place on May 5th. On my company with Mr. Kelly of Kelly and Kimberley, and we came to the conclusion that the present trouble in the sewerage system could possibly be easily overcome by some minor cleaning out of the line leading to the septic tank. I recommended to Captain Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, that Mr. Kelly be instructed to engage two men to clean out the septic tank and to get the system operating again temporarily.\n\nI am today informed by Captain Edwards that the sewage pipe at the school has now been cleaned out and that conditions are again very satisfactory. I believe that this work has been done at very little expense, but it will suffice to permit the school to operate until early in July when vacation starts. Accordingly, the new work will not be undertaken until that time.\n\nThe expenses in connection with my trip to Kenora have been paid by me personally and the account will be forwarded in a few days to be presented by you to the Department of Indian Affairs for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) D. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nJ. T.

Indian School at Kenora, written after the receipt by him of your night lettergram and letter of April 30th.\n\nYou will note his suggestion that the work would be more easily carried out by contract than by day-labour as it would obviate having to obtain tools and equipment.\n\nMr. Gow also comments upon the modifications proposed for Scheme No.1 by the Ontario Department of Health. He asks for your instructions whether these modifications, which he considers unessential under the circumstances, are to be complied with or not.\n\nYou will observe that Mr. Gow asks that sufficient funds be advanced by your Department to defray the cost of the work. His suggestion as to having all arrangements carried out through this office requires no comment as I understand that the departure from the usual procedure in this instance was made in the emergency on the Minister's instructions.\n\nI also enclose copy of a letter dated May 7th written after Mr. Gow's visit to Kenora from which you will observe that the septic tank and sewage pipe have been cleaned out and that the system will now probably operate satisfactorily until vacation begins early in July and the new work can be undertaken.\n\nI shall be glad to learn your wishes, both as to the method of carrying out the work, i.e., whether by day labour or contract, and as to whether the modifications suggested by the Ontario Department of Health are to be complied with or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMay 20, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 18th of December last, with reference to the sewage disposal system for the Kamloops Indian Residential School. The Department is arranging to proceed with this work and your recommendations with reference to the changes in the system were submitted to Mr. Gow, District Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Kamloops, under whose supervision the report and plans for the work were made. Mr. Gow is of the opinion that the local conditions do not warrant the changes asked for, and I quote the following from his letter:\n\n\"I notice that the Ontario Department of Health have approved of Scheme No. 1 as outlined in my report of January 5, 1931, with some modifications however. These suggested modifications will materially add to the cost of the work\u2014possibly to the extent of 50%. The construction of an additional sump chamber would be expensive enough, and adding 50% to the extent of the disposal bed would practically add 50% to the cost of the same. Inasmuch as the steep slope upon which it is necessary to construct the bed would render terracing necessary if an additional 500 feet of tile had to be placed.

Personally, I still consider that the Scheme No. 1, as outlined, is quite adequate to provide a very thorough method of sewage disposal.\"\n\nI would be glad if you would approve of Scheme No. 1, as outlined in Mr. Gow's report, as we feel that it will provide adequate drainage for this Institution.\n\nDr. A. E. Berry,\nDirector Sanitary Engineering Division,\nProvincial Board of Health,\nToronto, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nPlease refer to my letter to you under date of May 2nd in connection with the proposed work at the Roman Catholic Indian School at Kenora for the Department of Indian Affairs. I would appreciate knowing at the earliest possible moment whether or not this work is to be proceeded with, and if so, whether in accordance with the original design of this office, or should the suggested modifications of the Ontario Department of Health be followed. I would also appreciate knowing whether my recommendations as to the carrying out of the work have received favourable consideration.\n\nRegarding the suggested modifications by the Ontario Department of Health, I may say that No.1 tanks, according to our proposals, will be entirely satisfactory, since there will be more than one-half of the second tank will be used for the same purpose; the remaining portion of the second tank being remodelled for use as a siphon chamber. The capacities of these two tanks considerably exceed the requirements of the school and in the writer's opinion no addition is at all necessary. As for the disposal bed, its size is entirely limited by the space available and the conditions prevailing, but if at all possible it will be enlarged. I must point out, however, that the disposal bed as designed, will be constructed built up from graded and selected materials and will give maximum duty so that 1,000 lineal feet of tile is considered quite adequate. The laundry water will all pass through the septic tank.\n\nThe material for building up the disposal bed has all to be brought in by snow train along the shores of the Lake of the Woods, also considerable skilled labor is required in the installation of the siphon chamber and in the laying of the tile and making pipe connections and so forth. Very close supervision of the work will be necessary to insure the efficient operation of the system when completed. Under these circumstances I am strongly of the opinion that the work should be entrusted to a dependable contracting firm who will be able to place upon the work all equipment needed and also such skilled labor as may be required. The work should be let on the basis of cost plus a fixed sum, which fixed sum would be 10% of the estimated cost of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDom.

You will note that Mr. Gow refers again to the question of whether this work is to be carried out by day labour or by contract and recommends strongly that it should be by contract. This matter was raised in my letter of May 10th but we do not appear to have received any reply since that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the disposal system proposed for the Indian Residential School at Kenora.\n\nWe have gone into the matter again and after thorough consideration we do not feel that we can approve of your original proposal called \"No.1\". The suggestions which we made in our letter of December 18th 1931 were the minimum that we felt necessary to handle this situation. It is quite useless to alter this system unless it is done properly. I do not see that there are any great difficulties in the carrying out of the suggestion offered in our former letter. We do not permit the discharge of laundry wastes without some treatment; this, of course, requires an additional number of field tiles to what was originally proposed in scheme No.1. We felt that placing the number at 1500' we were keeping quite close to the minimum.\n\nIn view of this situation I should like to advise that this office cannot approve of your original scheme No.1.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.E.

School, I have received a further letter from Mr. D. B. Cow, of Winnipeg, and for your information I beg to quote from his letter as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the suggested modifications by the Ontario Department of Health, I may say that No. 1 tank, according to our proposals, will be used entirely for sedimentation; also more than one-half of the second tank will be used for the same purpose; the remaining portion of the second tank being remodelled for use as a siphon chamber. The capacities of these two tanks considerably exceed the requirements of the school and in the writer's opinion no addition is at all necessary. As for the disposal bed, its size is entirely limited by the space available and the conditions prevailing, but if at all possible it will be enlarged. I might point out, however, that this disposal bed as designed, will be entirely built up from graded and selected material and will give sanitary duty so that 1,000 lineal feet of tile is considered quite adequate. The laundry water will all pass through the sewage tank.\"\n\nYou will note that the size of the disposal bed is entirely limited by the space and land and to increase the amount of field tile as suggested by you would add considerably to the cost. I would also say that $1600 are all the funds that the Department has available this year for this work, and it is therefore necessary for us to keep within this amount.\n\nAs mentioned in previous correspondence the school is an old one, and will not accommodate more than are at present housed, and if a septic tank is installed for the present number it should amply meet the requirements. I will be very glad to hear further from you at your earliest convenience, as Mr. Cow is anxious to get the work under way as soon as possible.\n\nDr. A. E. Berry,\nRIT. OF MANITOB,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your further letter of the 15th instant in connection with the above, and I note the remarks by Mr. J.B. Gow, of Winnipeg, indicating what, in his opinion, is necessary as a way of escape from difficulties. I regret that it is not possible for me to agree with the suggestions of Mr. Gow.\n\nIn reconstructing this plant one point must be kept clearly in mind, namely, that the plant must be built so that it will give satisfactory results. We stated in our previous letter what was considered to be the very minimum treatment which could be given to this sewage in order to prevent objectionable conditions arising; consequently I see no reason which would justify reducing that minimum requirement. It would be most unwise to put in a system which will only be a makeshift and will not give the desired results. We could not at all recommend anything less than that given in our previous letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector,\nSanitary Engineering Division.\n\nA.F. Derry, M.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Public Affairs,\nDepartment of Health,\nOntario - Canada.\nI think that the additional tiles in the disposal bed and this change in the siphon chamber, if it is permitted, will make the system more satisfactory for disposal of the sewage from this school.\n\nMay I urge that work be started on this at as early a date as possible. Complaints are reaching this office concerning this sewage and its effect upon the water supply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector, Sanitary Engineering Division.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSec'y, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nB/C.\nONTARIO\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, June 27th, 1932.\n\nRe: Ignora School Sewage Disposal.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have this morning had a conversation with Mr. Gow of Winnipeg in connection with the above.\n\nI am accordingly advising you of the discussion we have had with reference to the disposal system to be constructed at this institution. The bed for disposal of the effluent measures 40 feet x 120 feet. In the present arrangement the tiles for distribution of the effluent from the septic tank are laid 4 feet apart. It has been suggested that the same size bed be used but that an additional two rows of tiles, each 120 feet long, be employed to distribute the sewage. This will give approximately 1500 feet of drainage tiles.\n\nThe other point raised was the question of the syphon chamber. As was proposed on the original plans the syphon chamber was to be made a part of the final settling tank. It was pointed out in our previous correspondence that it would be more desirable to utilize this tank completely for settling purposes and to construct a new syphon chamber outside this tank. In going over the plans it was felt that it would cost very little, if any more, to build a syphon chamber adjoining this settling tank. The one wall of the settling tank could be employed in the construction of the syphon chamber.\n\nIn view of the fact that this tank would be quite shallow and not large, the cost would be practically negligible. According to Mr. Gow it may not be feasible to do this when examination of the local conditions is made. The final question in connection with this was that an additional syphon chamber would be constructed if local conditions permit. If not then the arrangement shown on Mr. Gow's plan would be adhered to.\nJuly 5, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nFor your information I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from the Director of the Sanitary Engineering Division of the Ontario Department of Health.\n\nAccording to this letter it appears that Mr. Gow was able to make satisfactory arrangements with the department while in Toronto, and you may therefore advise him to proceed at once with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian School near Kenora.\n\nReferring to the second last paragraph of your letter, if I remember correctly the manner in which the work was to be carried out was not definitely decided upon during my visit to Ottawa. However, from your letter I would infer that the work is to be carried out by day labour, in accordance with former instructions.\n\nThis method of carrying out the project, in my opinion, will require the presence on the work continuously of a government representative, one thoroughly experienced in contracting work, etc. This office with its greatly curtailed staff is unable to place an engineer on the job continuously during the three or four weeks necessary to complete the work. However, I can arrange to have Mr. Rose relieve Mr. C.J. Galloway, our Recorder at Kenora while the latter is taking his holidays at such time as the work is in progress and Mr. Rose can arrange to render whatever engineering service and assistance are necessary insofar as his regular duties will permit.\n\nI would, therefore, request that you please notify the Department of Indian Affairs that this office, on account of the necessity of carrying on other work with a greatly curtailed staff, is unable to take the responsibility for carrying out the work at the R.C. Indian School at Kenora, and that it is considered advisable to have the carrying out of the work under the direction of the Indian Agent at Kenora, but that this office will gladly render engineering service and technical advice and assist generally in the carrying out of the work under the proposed day labour basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

The Department would suggest that the painting of the outbuildings, the decorating of the interior of the main building and the repairing of the wharf should be among the improvements carried out. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials required from firms on the list to receive consideration. With reference to the labour to be employed, you should consult Mr. Frank McManus, of Kenora. It is considered that all work should be carried out by day labour. Please keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, of the labour employed. These should be signed by the individual labourers and certified by yourself. If necessary, an advance could be sent you to pay labour. These improvements should be undertaken at an early date.\n\nWith reference to the 40 mattresses required, I shall be pleased if you will state definitely the sizes of the beds for which they are needed and the number of each size. Consideration will then be given to placing an order here for the supplying of these.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the work to be undertaken in improving the sewage disposal plant, I have to say that an accountable cheque, amounting to $300, has been sent you to pay labour. You should keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, and have them signed by the individual labourers and certified by yourself in accounting for the disbursement of this advance. When forwarding vouchers in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the improvements, you should state definitely the work that was undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The remainder, namely, $31.20, covers the proportionate amount of the expenses of Mr. J.T. Rose while at Keewatin for about three weeks, also relieving Mr. G.A. Galloway who was on his vacation. It was arranged that Mr. Rose was to relieve Mr. Galloway during the time that the work was in progress at the R.C. Indian School, and during this time Mr. Rose spent fully 50% of his time at the school rendering engineering and technical assistance. Mr. Rose's railway and living expenses while at Keewatin amounted to $82.40, of which amount half has been charged to the Department of Indian Affairs. This is considered a very fair arrangement.\n\nWill you please submit this statement of disbursements to the Department of Indian Affairs so that the amount of $33.36 may be credited to my personal account and debited against the advance made by the Department of Indian Affairs to the undersigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

If any of the improvements considered by the Principal and yourself to be the most urgent cannot be carried out before the extreme cold weather sets in, they should be postponed until next year. Our funds are limited and any unexpended portion of the sum authorized can be utilized elsewhere.\n\nIt is noted the Principal would like to have the cattle shed built. If the cost of this work can be included in the amount which was authorized, the erection of the shed may be proceeded with. It should be distinctly understood, however, that the sum of $2,000 for labour and material in carrying out the repairs which are considered the most urgent is all that can be provided this year. I would request that you arrange to have the improvements considered necessary carried out as soon as possible, the total cost of which must not exceed the sum authorized.\n\nI enclose herewith, as requested, a copy of that part of official letter authorising the expenditure referred to above.\n\nRegarding the mattresses, you will be further advised in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenna,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOctober 6, 1938.\n\nVenerable:\n\nMR. BUSKARD\n\nForty mattresses are required for use in the dormitories at the Kenora Indian Residential School, the cost of which will be approximately $250. Funds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education. I shall be pleased to be informed of the names of the firms from whom quotations for the supplying of the mattresses should be obtained. The School is in the federal district of Kenora-Rainy River.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS                                                                 | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | NET |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|-----|\n|          | EXPRESS CHARGE ON 1 WATCHMAN'S CLOCK BILLED ON OUR FILE # 66287                     |            |                 |          |     |\n|          | ORIGINAL RECEIPT ATTACHED TO ABOVE INVOICE                                         | 2 15       |                 |          | 2 15|\n|          | SHIPPED BY C.P.

Donner\n\nIt would be well to verify the sizes before obtaining prices and also ascertain the number of each size.\n\nYou should request quotations from the above mentioned firms to supply mattresses of the sizes required; filling to be of white layer linter cotton felt; ticking O.C.C. No. 12 or Canadian Cottons S.M.

Residential School.\n\nThe Principal informs us that he has a large amount of the painting of the out-buildings done as he anticipated the authority of the Department, and has spent roughly $200. on this work. He says that this is the first time these buildings have been painted, although authority was granted for this work two or three years ago. It was left over at that time as it was too late in the year to do anything, and authority has not been granted since. He would like to get the expenditure refunded.\n\nWe will go ahead with the repairs to the Wharf, the building of the Cattle Shed, and will do an amount of draining and grading the road to the school to the value of about $150.00. This is an imperative need.\n\nThe Principal would also like to have the Pump House and the two sheds wired for electric light, and estimates the cost of this as $100.\n\nThis would leave a balance of roughly $550. which the Principal would like expended on clearing land.\n\nThe above, the Principal informs us, is the most imperative work required, and we would be glad to know if this meets with your approval.\nof the expenditure available, viz., $730. Your letters have been rather indefinite as to the work the Principal desires to have carried out, and I would request that you enumerate in detail the work proposed to be done before the extreme cold weather sets in this fall, and give an approximate cost of same. As far as we are aware, the sum of $1270 will cover all expenditure as mentioned in your letter of the 14th instant, while it is noted you request an advance of $1400 to cover labour. The Department will forward you an advance to pay labour at the present time to the amount of $1000, and later, if a further amount is required, you can requisition for same.\n\nA supply of labour return forms is being sent to you. A proper record of all labour employed should be shown thereon, giving full particulars as to the number of hours or days each man was employed and the rate paid. You should see that these returns are properly signed by the individual labourers, and you should certify and forward same in triplicate to the Department in accounting for the expenditure from the advance sent you.\n\nThe Principal and yourself should see that all work is satisfactorily completed and at as low cost as possible. You have already been advised regarding the labour to be employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, October 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enumerating the improvements the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School requests be carried out from the expenditure authorised, viz., $2,000, by official letters of August 15th, last, and 5th instant.\n\nIn this connection it is noted the Principal has already carried out a large amount of painting to the out buildings, at a cost of approximately $200. You may forward vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material. You should prepare time sheets, in triplicate, for the labour employed, paying for same from the advance referred to hereunder.\n\nBesides the above, it is noted the Principal desires to carry out repairs to the wharf, which you stated in your letter of July 26th, last, would cost approximately $150, also the building of a cattle shed, at an estimated cost of $120, and the draining and grading of the road, at a cost of $150. The Department will approve of having the pump house and two sheds wired for electric light, at an estimated cost of $100.\n\nYou will note that the total of the above work amounts to $720, and in your letter you request that the balance, which you state to be roughly $550, be used in clearing land. This would make a total expenditure of only $1270. You will please state what other repairs or improvements the Principal will carry out for the balance.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nFISCAL YEAR 1932-33\n\nDepartment: Indian Affairs\n\nDate: Oct. 19, 1932\n\nApplication is hereby made for the issue of the following cheques: (This application to be submitted in duplicate, accompanied by the vouchers).\n\n| Cheque No. | IN FAVOUR OF                  | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------|--------|\n|            | Frank Edwards,                |        |\n|            | Indian Agent (In Trust),      |        |\n|            | Kenora, Ont.                  | $1000.00 |\n\nOct. 19/32\n\nTOTAL: $1000.00\n\nBeing for payment of labour, painting, repairing and altering buildings and clearing land, Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nChargeable to:\nVote 201\nAgency 129\nAllot. 243\nEnnumb. 49\n\nI certify that each item of this account has been incurred under the requisite authority and that the expenditure was necessary for the public service.

Owing to the small amount of money we have to spend on the road, we shall be glad to know, if you will be willing to allow us to fix up and use the road on which a certain amount of work has already been done, as a temporary measure. If at a later date, we can get funds from our Department, to fix up the old road, which was built some time ago, we will do so. We would also be willing to change the present fence, which is on your property, by restricting the wires from the gate on the old road, to and along the boundary line, and at a future date, change the other part of the fence on your property.\n\nWe wish to cooperate with you in every way, but owing to the shortage of funds, at the present time, cannot suggest anything further.\n\nPlease let us know if this would be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario.\nOctober 28th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of 19th inst. and previous correspondence re expenditure of $2000.00 on improvements at the Kenora R.C.

Cameron's property, and we inclose a copy of letter sent to Mr. Cameron, which explains itself. Later on should we be able to get a little more money, we will require to fix up the other road, but as this would cost in the neighbourhood of $600.00, at the present time, we have to make the temporary road do.\n\nThe Principal has agreed to our spending some of the clearing of land money in securing the fence in the correct place.\n\nOur letter of 19th inst. explains the difference of \u00a3700.00, Interior Decorating, which was unfortunately omitted in our letter of 14th.\n\nWe have received the cheque for $1000.00 but will probably have to write you for a further amount for work at a later date.

The principal has complained on several occasions of defective heating. The matter was previously taken up with the Department and action was promised but so far nothing has been done. It is possible that for a relatively small amount the heating could be improved to a point where there would be no further reason for complaint on the part of the staff.\n\n2. There is very little land suitable for farming. The Department in the last few years has spent some money in clearing land for this purpose. An additional grant of $200.00 would be of great assistance in this connection.\n\n3. The present store house is too small and an addition of 16 x 16 would be greatly appreciated. The principal estimates that this could be done for $800.00.\n\n4. The painting of the outbuildings is not complete and an estimated amount of $150.00 is needed for this purpose. The interior of the building was painted only in part last year and it is estimated that $300.00 more are required for this purpose.\n\n5. The fence between the school property and the land adjoining it to the north was not properly laid out in the first place and a correction of the fence line is desired. It is estimated that this would cost $300.00.\n\n6. The road from the village to the school is in very bad condition and during bad weather is almost impassable. Drainage and grading to the amount of $300.00 is asked in this connection.\n\n(Sgd.) J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nTHIS IS\n129-1-5 D.

Dubois, Chief of the Fire Department, Kenora, regarding the matter of fire protection at Indian residential schools. He does not refer to any school by name but states in his letter as follows:\n\n\"... The conditions found around some of them is deplorable, and it is no wonder that they burn up so frequently. Allow me to put up to you one instance. I will not mention any names, but I can produce the facts in full if necessary. I found hand chemicals, the two and a half gallon size, supposed to be in readiness for business in case of fire, in such shape that they would not even shoot a drop of water. In examining them I found that the metal cork usually used for coking the acid bottle setting on the head of the bottle was the original rubber cork still in the neck of the bottle. It had never been taken out and naturally no acid would flow if the machine was tipped over for use. The one setting up these machines did not even know why and how the metal corks were used. I might say that metal corks replace the rubber ones when the machine is set for use, and these machines had not been touched for at least over twelve years, when in reality they should be charged yearly.\"\n\nI would request that you interview the Fire Chief and ascertain from him the school referred to in his letter. If the school is located in your agency, you should immediately make an inspection of the fire equipment and its condition and report to the Department. The condition referred to by the Fire Chief in connection with the extinguishers on hand should be remedied at the earliest possible moment. These extinguishers should be placed in a condition ready for immediate use. If any refills are required, you may purchase same forwarding accounts in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nPlease report regarding the fire escapes, stating whether they are kept in a satisfactory condition or if any repairs or improvements are required. Your recommendation, together with the cost involved, should be given.\n\nYour early attention to this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKENORA, Ont., February 6th, 1933\n\nCaptain F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\n\nTown.\n\nRE R.C. Residential Indian School\n\nDear Captain:\n\nIn reference to the items we were discussing in connection with the conditions at the R.C. Industrial Indian school as mentioned in correspondence from the headquarters of your Department, I wish to state the conditions I referred to in my letter to the Minister were the conditions that we dealt with some three years ago and which are now in excellent shape due to the very prompt manner in which my recommendations were given attention to through your very kind efforts. I might state that this building is out of my jurisdiction as it is outside of our town limits but through your intercession I was given the authority to give not only this school but the Cecilia Jeffrey school as well a good thorough inspection from a fire protection point of view and I am pleased to state that practically every suggestion that I made in this connection was very satisfactory attended to in every respect and that now both these schools are in very good condition and are periodically visited and I am sure that I am only too well pleased to be always at your service at any time that any question may crop up where the safety of the occupants and property are at stake for I certainly am one of the last Citizens of Kenora that wants to see a fire occur in any one of these institutions for, as I said before although they are out of our district we shall only be too pleased to render any assistance we can if an emergency occurred that we would be notified of.\n\nI am sure that the occurrence we experienced a few years ago at the Cecilia Jeffrey school where our assistance aided in keeping down the damage to nearby structures when the school stable burned will convince you that we are always at your service.\n\nRespectfully submitted by yours truly,\n\nChief Fire Dept.\nKenora, Ontario,\nFebruary, 7th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter 129-1-5 of 3rd inst., re communication from the Kenora Fire Chief to the Superintendent General, Indian Affairs.\n\nWe have today interviewed the Town Fire Chief, F. Dubois, and he informs us that the school referred to in his communication, was the Kenora R.C. Residential, in this Agency. Several years ago we thought it advisable to ask the Fire Chief if he would make an annual inspection of our schools, to make sure the equipment and necessary protection were in good order. It was found at that time, that one of the Hand Chemical Machines was not in good shape, through the rubber cork having been left in instead of being taken out when the machine was installed. Every year since that time periodical inspections have been made by the Fire Chief and his Staff, and I have been present with him throughout. Although he is not paid by Town limits, the Fire Chief has been glad to make these inspections, for which he has made no charge, even using his own car for the trips. After his inspections we get a letter from him, making any suggestions for improvements he thinks advisable, and in every case the suggestions have been carried out.\n\nThe Fire Escapes at the School are now in good condition, with the exception of some slight alterations to be made at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, which are authorized, and will be made as soon as the weather moderates.\n\nI have been Chairman for the last two years of the Civic Affairs Committee of the Kenora Board of Trade and have conducted and marked all examination papers for the Town of Kenora Firemen, and have signed and forwarded the certificates to those who have passed.

He was requested to interview the Fire Chief and ascertain from him the school referred to in his letter.\n\nFor your information, I attach hereto the reply of Mr. Edwards, together with copy of a communication he received from the Fire Chief.

School reports that owing to the heavy rains the Sewage Disposal Bed at his School has been damaged, by the amount of water running from the high banks behind and some of the pipes of the disposal bed are broken and the bed washed out, causing the fluid to come up out the ground and run into the Lake. Dr. Ferguson our Medical Officer went to look over the situation this morning and informs us that something must be done immediately as the water runs into the Lake just over the intake of the Town's water supply.\n\nMessrs. Kelly & Kimberley inform us that in their opinion it will cost in the neighbourhood of $400.00 to put the field in first class shape, and if this is not done at once, there is liable to be damage done to the whole field. If the face of the disposal bed had been rip rapped this would not have happened, but of course it was unforeseen, and we have had very heavy rains. We have given instructions to Kelly and Kimberley to make a temporary repair and will be glad if you will send your instructions direct to the Principal, as we leave for the North on Annuity payments tomorrow morning at 3 A.M., and will not be back in Kenora till nearly the end of the month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJune 7, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA letter has been received from the Indian Agent advising that recent heavy rains are affecting the sewage disposal bed recently installed for the Kenora (N.

This representative of the school would be Brother Gauthier, who I believe could be made available for this work. Even after repairs have been effected, it will be necessary that considerable attention be given this sewage system to prevent deterioration of the disposal bed. Circumstances would not permit placing this disposal bed in any other location and the present location is most unfavourable and accordingly necessitates constant vigilance to prevent deterioration.\n\nThe Principal of the School complained about the offensive odor from the drainage issuing from the disposal bed. It was explained to him that the sewage system is greatly overloaded with the laundry water and etc., and it is to be expected that as time passes the efficiency of the bed will decrease. It was never anticipated that the system, as constructed, would prevent offensive odors or prevent bacteria from being discharged from the disposal bed. The writer did not consider that the odor was very offensive. It also must be borne in mind that the circumstances at this school do not permit of an efficient sewage disposal bed and it cannot be expected that ideal conditions will be experienced now or in the future as long as the school remains in its present location.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nJune 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: R. C. Indian School near Kenora.\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 8th instant, I examined conditions of the sewage disposal bed at the R. C. Indian School at Kenora on the 16th instant. Both Captain Edwards, Indian Agent, and Dr. Ferguson, Medical Health Officer, were absent from Kenora on Treaty Payments, but I found that temporary repair work was in progress under the direction of Kelly and Kimberley, Contractors of Kenora. I was given to understand that temporary repairs were authorized by Captain Edwards at the insistence of the Medical Health Officer. These temporary repairs were merely to prevent further deterioration in the event of further heavy rainfall.\n\nThe sewage disposal bed at this school was of necessity laid in a restricted area on the slope toward the lake in front of the school and in a slight depression where rock was not too close to the surface. The disposal bed was apparently constructed in accordance with the plans which did not provide for rip-rap facing on the south and west slopes, exposed to prevent erosion from wave action on the lake side. It was hoped that the surface drainage would not erode the slopes of the disposal bed, but would follow a natural drainage depression leading immediately south of the bed. However, heavy rainfall this spring caused considerable drainage around the bed, eroding away part of the south and west slopes of the bed and possibly exposing the voids in one or two places. It now appears as if additional expense should have been incurred at the time the disposal bed was constructed and the south and west slopes of the bed protected with a wall of broken rock, carefully laid so as to contain only small voids. Furthermore, cut-off ditches should have been cut along the slope immediately above the disposal bed, so as to bypass the run-off from the slope above.\n\nI would suggest that this work be now carried out. The entire south and west slopes of the disposal bed should have loose rock facing, carefully laid and following the original slope right up to the top of the disposal bed. The general level of the disposal bed should then be brought up to the original elevation. Cut-off ditches should be constructed to prevent the run-off from the slope above the system. Every effort should be made to effect a growth of grass on the disposal bed. This rock facing should consist of flat broken rock placed horizontally with the voids carefully filled with small stone so as to make a wall with a thickness of about ten inches. It is very difficult to give an estimate of the probable cost of this repair work. However, the work is entirely labor and no skilled labor is required. I would also suggest that this work should\n\nJ. T.

Residential school, I enclose copy of a report received from Mr. Gow who has examined the existing conditions.\n\nMr. Gow recommends that the entire south and west slopes of the disposal bed be faced with loose rock and cut-off ditches provided to prevent surface water from above flowing over the disposal bed.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND HYDROMETRIC BUREAU\n\nOTTAWA, ONT., July 29th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nFurther in reference to my telephone conversation with you regarding vouchers missing from the June account of D. C. Govt. of our Winnipeg Office, in connection with expenses incurred at the Roman Catholic Indian School at Kenora, Ontario, I now enclose these vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncs.\n\nD. C. Donnelly, Esq.,\nAccounts Branch,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Aug. 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your voucher No. 6725 for $59.65 in favour of Kelly & Kimberley in connection with the cost of repairs to the sewage disposal bed at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the account of the firm mentioned amounts to $54.25, to which has been added a percentage of 10%. No doubt, you arranged with this firm to do the work on a cost plus basis. If so, you should forward the contract which you made with them, otherwise the percentage of 10% cannot be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 129-1-5 of 2nd inst., re Voucher No.6725 for the amount of $59.65 in favour of Kelly and Kimberley for work done on the sewage disposal plant at the Kenora R.C. School. This work was done when we were on annuity payments, on a day labour basis and Kelly & Kimberley supervised it adding 10% for their fee, but if they had added the foreman's name to the pay list, it would have been better than adding the 10% although we think it is quite a reasonable charge. It was impossible for anyone from this Office or from the School to attend to the work. No contract was made, and if it is necessary, and you return the labour sheets, we will have the foreman's name added to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt will cost us $140 to get a large load of suitable rock to the property, and it is doubtful if this would be enough to complete the necessary work, and the balance of the money allotted $100.00 would not go very far toward the work, in addition to this there will be a certain amount of filling required to make the land level to the road, and for this purpose we must have more than $100.00.\n\nIn addition to the above the Principal informed me of Brother E. Gauthier to come to help us to look after the work, and I shall try to get some outside help to assist him.\n\nI suggest we get the rock, and build up for as long as possible with what money we have to expend, and do more work when we can. As soon as more money is available for the work, the rock work should be completed now if funds are available, and then we can of course do more work, and as we have had a good start, we may hope for more success.\n\nI am in receipt of your instructions,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHawk Edwards\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the further amount that will be required to complete the repairs necessary to the sewage disposal system at the Kenora Indian Residential School. The sum of $300 was previously provided for this work, but it is noted that $200 extra will be required to complete the job. Therefore, I enclose an encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure to this amount. This will make a total of $500 provided for this work, which is the full amount that can be allowed in this connection. You should therefore carry out as much work as possible for the money provided. It is hoped, however, that this will be sufficient to complete the whole undertaking.\n\nWhen the work is finished, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials and for the labour. Please state on each copy of the vouchers that the expenditure was authorized by E.R. Nos. 876 and 717. I would request that you have this work completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Besides, we had to feed them extra on account of this work. I am ready to help and glad to do so, but not to carry most of the burden.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

He recommends that one Thermin be kept handy for the laundry-boiler room and one for the laundry room. One Gardene Soda & Acid chemical for the hallway of the first floor and one at the end of the hallways of the other floors. One Pyrene should be kept in the kitchen and one in the office. The John Hanville hand extinguishers should be installed in the class rooms and some in the dormitories. One 5 gal. water tank should be kept in the work shop building and one in the stable and these two machines filled with a non-freezeable liquid. In the basement the hose there at the present time is quite sufficient to take care of that section of the building, but this place should be kept in better order, and wood or chips kept away from the furnace. He recommends that a piece of asbestos about 1\" thick 2 feet wide and 4 feet high be placed next to the wood box. In the kitchen stove, the bottom of the ash pit should be covered with fire clay, as there being no ash tray, the heat may cause trouble in this spot. The Chief further suggests you should appoint some reliable employee to keep all the fire appliances, including fire escapes and exits in proper order and also see that the extinguishers are not interfered with, and replaced, at least once a year. Fire buckets used formerly are worn out and should be replaced as they may come in handy for bush or fires near the water front.\n\nWould you kindly attend to the Chief's suggestions and we will write Ottawa for authority to purchase fire buckets, asbestos and the fire clay as soon as possible.\n\nThe school bell could be used as a fire alarm.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nKENORA, ONT., November 3rd, 1933\n\nCaptain F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\n\nTown.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter our recent inspection of the two Indian residential schools I wish to submit as per your request the following report on the conditions found as well as suggestions for improvements on some of the equipment in use.\n\nAt St Anthony's R.C. School the conditions found were that two of the water five gallon hand pumps were empty and not in use, in other sections of the building but the basement I would recommend that one Thermene be kept handy for the laundry boiler room and one for the laundry room, also one Guardene soda and acid chemical for the hallway of the first floor and one at the end of the hallways on the other floors, one Pyrene should be kept in the kitchen and one in the office, the John Manville hand extinguishers should be installed in the class rooms and some in the dormitories, one five gallon water tank should be kept in the work shop building and one in the stable, these two machines can be kept filled with a non freeze liquid in these buildings, in the basement the hose there at present is quite sufficient to take care of that section of the building but I would recommend that this place be kept in better order and wood or chips be kept away from the furnaces.\n\nI would recommend that a piece of asbestos about a quarter of an inch in thickness be placed next to the wood box and the oven fire box, this piece of asbestos should be about two feet wide and at least four feet high, in the kitchen, the bottom of the ash pit should be covered with fire clay as there is no ash pan and the heat from the hot ashes may cause trouble in this spot.\n\nAs regards to a fire alarm system there is a small steel triangle already installed which is loud enough to be heard during class hours but it may be possible to install a regular striker on the large bell on the building which would be heard all over the premises as a fire bell and as a fire signal it would be heard by everyone both inside and out in all the other sections of the institution, the rope for this striker could extend through the building to the lower floor and I believe it would serve to advantage in this respect.\n\nThe Pastor in charge should appoint some reliable employees to keep all fire protection appliances including the fire escapes and exits always in proper order and should see that the extinguishers are not meddled with and recharged at least once a year, the fire buckets used formally are worn out and should be replaced as they may come handy for bush or fires near the water front.\n\nYours truly, F. Dubois, Fire Chief.\nOttawa, November 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing the report of the Kenora Fire Chief on his inspection of the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School and requesting that refills be supplied for the fire extinguishers on hand. The copy of the letter which you directed to the Rev. Principal in connection with the Fire Chief's report, was also received.\n\nYou should see that the Principal carries out the recommendations of the Fire Chief. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the chemical refills required for the extinguishers. Further, you should procure the number of fire buckets required and a piece of asbestos to be placed next to the wood-box and the oven. It is considered that six fire buckets should be sufficient. The purchase of the above equipment should receive your early attention. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nWhen the refills are delivered at the school, the Principal should see that they are placed in the fire extinguishers and also that the extinguishers are thoroughly overhauled and placed in good condition, ready for immediate use. The extinguishers should be distributed throughout the building as recommended by the Fire Chief.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Then we had no night watchman the workmen slept in the loft of the carpenters' shop, but since the School has been obliged to employ a night watchman, the old sleeping quarters are unsuitable because the watchman complains that with the noise going on in the shop it is impossible for him to sleep.\n\nIn order to correct this situation, the Oblate Fathers are offering to the School the use of a house which they own on a lot about 200 feet distant from the School property. This house was at one time the residence of the Principal, but as it has not been used for many years, considerable repairs have to be made to it so that it may be habitable. I believe that the material needed for these repairs would amount to about $475.00. If the Department would assume this expense we would assume the labor cost for same.\n\nWill you also ask the Department to kindly give us a Hot water Tank to replace the old one we have in the kitchen, which is completely worn out and must be replaced. The capacity of this Tank is 60 gallons and would cost not more than $45.00.\n\nThe reasons why I did not mention these items at the same time with the other estimates are the following: for the water Tank, it did not seem to be necessary at the time; as to the employees' house, the night watchman was not complaining too much then, but now he says he cannot sleep when they are working downstairs, and no one can blame him for that.\n\nHoping that you will kindly forward the above request to the Department, I remain Sir,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.E. Baillargeon\nKenora, Ontario,\nMarch 28th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a letter we have received from the Reverend Principal of the Kenora Residential R.C. School, asking us to expend an amount of $475.00 for repairs to the Principal's residence and $45.00 for a 60 gal. Tank for the kitchen at the school.\n\nWe would like to call your attention to the fact that the house he writes about, is the old Principal's Residence on the School property, and in our opinion is not owned by the Oblate Fathers, as when we purchased the property and buildings from the Fathers some years ago, the house mentioned would naturally be included. It has not been used for a long time and is in a bad state of repair.\n\nWe would recommend the above expenditure, if at all possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 105-12 of the 28th ultimo, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a 60 gallon tank in the kitchen at the Kenora Indian Residential School. It is noted that this can be secured at a cost of $45.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to authorize the expenditure that would be required to provide a residence for the night watchman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Since the creation of the position, the night watchman has had sleeping quarters in the loft of the carpenter shop, as there is absolutely no room for him in the school proper. These sleeping quarters are far from being comfortable. Each night watchman that we have had to date has left more or less because he had no proper place to sleep during the day. The noise of the gasoline engine, as well as the continuous hammering going on in the carpenter shop, makes sleep impossible.\n\nI quite understand that the building of a house for our night watchman is out of the question at the present time owing to the curtailment of all expenditures that is being going on in the Department; but would it be possible for the Department to allow the school a sufficient amount of money to buy the material to repair the building situated on the school grounds which, at one time, was used as a residence by the Principal? I am quite sure that, for the sum of $250 or, at most, $300., this building could be put in fair condition. I will pay all wages out of the grant.\n\nI had hoped not to have to bother the Department with this matter but, as my night watchman threatens to leave me unless I provide him with proper sleeping quarters, I think it is my duty to ask the Department to assist in this regard.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your immediate consideration,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.E. Baillargeon\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that a residence is required for the night watchman at the Kenora Indian Residential School. We are further advised that there is a building on the property which could be put in proper condition.\n\nYou may inform the Reverend Principal of the Kenora School that the Department is prepared to pay the cost of the material required to the amount of $250.

C.

If he has not paid this account, it is considered that a voucher should be prepared, in favour of the above company, and a cheque sent them. However, if he has paid this firm, the account should be receipted by them as paid.\n\nAn account should also be obtained from John Nevesad, Kenora, for the 9 pieces of lumber supplied, and, if the Principal has paid for same, the account should be receipted.\n\nI am returning the vouchers, with attached accounts, as the Representative of the Treasury has refused payment until the information asked for is received.\n\nI would draw your attention, also, to the manner in which the vouchers are prepared. The name of the Principal should be stated in each case, instead of \"Reverend Principal\" or \"Principal\", as cheques in payment cannot be drawn to the \"Principal\" of a School - his name should be given on the voucher.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA.

Indian Residential School: We find this building in a well kept condition, pupils healthy looking and contented. We would recommend, however, that the two porches on West side be demolished and replaced, as posts, railing and floors are in a decayed and dangerous condition. It is also our opinion that an additional fire escape is very necessary.\n\nOCEILIA JEFFREY INDIAN SCHOOL: We find this building to be well managed and attendance above the average. The building itself, however, is badly in need of painting, both inside and out and is deteriorating on this account. The sashes are shrunk and windows need weatherstripping and caulking. If this were done a huge saving could be effected in fuel. We also note that sewage from seepage field is rising to surface and running into lake endangering the purity of the water supply. If this condition is not remedied an epidemic might result. We would, therefore, recommend that additional tile piping be added to existing distribution field to obviate this nuisance by increasing the area of seepage field.\n\nSt. Joseph's and the Kenora General Hospitals:\n\nAs these buildings and equipment are daily inspected by the Public and have been inspected by preceding Grand Jurors; and as this inspection would add to the work of the staff and discomfort of the patients we decided that this inspection would well be dispensed with.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nGeorge K.

When replying, you should give full particulars.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan recently visited the school, he noticed that the verandah near the Principal's residence was in a very bad condition. He authorized the Principal to purchase lumber to the approximate value of $150. He, also, requested the Principal to consult you regarding the firm from whom the lumber should be purchased. The Principal will arrange for the necessary labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nPP/O'M.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nEducation Branch, Indian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am just back from Kenora, Ontario. I went down at the request of Rev. Father Baillargeon to talk over the matter of repairs to his school.\n\nAs you know, there is provision for the building of a Hog House for the estimated amount of $900. While this is a needed improvement, Father Baillargeon is of the opinion that it would be better to postpone the building of the Hog House and to use the sum provided for this purpose for very urgent repairs to the school, particularly the floors in two of the classrooms and in the boys dormitory. These floors are of fir and were put in when the school was first built. They show considerable wear; in fact, in some places they are worn right through to the rough floor. Keeping these floors clean is almost an impossibility; it is moreover quite dangerous for the girls, as in the process of cleaning the floors they injure their hands with splinters.\n\nThe school has no garage; the automobile now used by the school for trucking is in the open and suffers considerable depreciation from being exposed to all kinds of weather. Father Baillargeon believes that with the sum of $900 provided for the Hog Pen that he could not only put in new floors where such are urgently needed, but that he could also build a one-car garage.\n\nThese matters were submitted to your agent, Captain Edwards, and he has approved this substitution but we would not like to proceed without the authority of the department.\n\nHoping that you may be able to give us an immediate and favorable answer, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOP:LR\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of 31st ultimo #129-1-5 re appropriations for improvements at the Kenora Residential R.C. School.\n\nWe have gone into this matter with the Principal and Father Flourde of Winnipeg, and they are endeavouring to get a foreman for the dock and road work, and will do what they can with the appropriation but this will not complete the road.\n\nRegarding the new Hog Pen, they have decided they can do without it this year, but have asked us to substitute the $100.00 for repairs to floors of the Junior Class Room and Dormitory as these floors were not done when repairs were made to other floors and they are in bad shape.\n\nAfter this is done they wish to use the balance of the money towards a Garage for the school car.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the heating system, the Church is very anxious to employ James Turner of the Standard Plumbing and Heating Co. of Winnipeg, but we informed them it would be better to employ local labour, they inform us that they have no confidence in the local heating firms. We therefore told them that provided they asked Mr. Hamilton if Mr. Turner was on the preferred list and provided he used local labour to assist him, we would have no objection.\n\nWe have also informed that they will require to employ day labour and also send in accounts for material and that they were to purchase lumber for the verandah from the Keewatin Lumber Co.\n\nWe will be glad if you will send us a supply of labour sheets, form 18, also an accountable cheque for $100.00 for labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

If his estimate does not exceed $2,000., you may authorize him to proceed with the work in order that it will be completed at the earliest possible date. If, however, the estimate exceeds the amount stated above, you should communicate with the Department.

An accountable cheque for $100., also a supply of labour return forms, will be forwarded to you.\n\nMaterials should be purchased from firms on the approved list and any extra labour required should, also, be engaged by you.\n\nWith regard to the repairs to the heating plant, the Department is communicating with Inspector Hamilton in order that he may arrange to have The Standard Plumbing and Heating Company do this work.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to the Principal of the Kenora School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I note that you will write again in the course of a day or two giving the approximate amount required for wages to complete all improvements authorised.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of August 29th, last, the Department is extremely anxious that the road should be put in as good condition as possible. I trust the work on this road will receive your continued attention, as the weather cannot be depended on after this\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan was at the school he authorised the Principal to replace one of the verandahs. Payment of the wages of the carpenter who is doing this work should be made from the accountable advance that is being forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nN. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of August 21st, in which you request an increase of $150.00 for lumber to repair the verandah and dormitory. We understand that the Principal has informed you that the floor in the workshop and the dormitory will be repaired at a later date.\n\nIn connection with the above, the Principal considers it necessary to authorize an additional amount of $150.00 for the Junior Classroom and Dormitory section of the school, repairs to book and road.\n\nIn conclusion, the Principal considers it necessary to authorize an additional amount of $150.00 for the Junior Classroom and Dormitory section of the school, repairs to book and road.\n\nWe also consider that the savings on the time lost should be used on the road and other work that needs to be done on the Junior Classroom and Dormitory (part of the dormitory) should also be a separate expenditure, according to the Principal.\n\nPlease advise me on the figure for the Junior Classroom and Dormitory section of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 108-12 of the 4th instant, I beg to say that the cost of the lumber to repair the verandah at the Kenora Residential School, amounting to approximately $150, is in addition to the other work, and a separate voucher should be submitted by you for payment. The work on the junior classroom and workshop may also be considered a separate expenditure, provided the cost does not exceed $150.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the heating system will cost $1,256.42. This will leave a balance of $2,591.58, which amount can be used for the other repairs at this school, viz., repairs to floor of dormitory, erection of garage, repairs to deck and road.\n\nThe point to be kept in mind is that the Department wishes as much work as possible done for the amount available, and the Principal's wishes should be met.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPP/OIM.\nOctober 25, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: R. C. Indian School, Kenora, Ont.\n\nUpon the occasion of my visit to Kenora on October 22nd and 23rd, I visited the R. C. Indian School at Kenora to ascertain the condition of the sewage disposal bed at that point.\n\nThis disposal bed, as you are possibly aware, was constructed on the water's edge of the Lake of the Woods and was protected on the shore side by a hand laid rock rip-rap. The disposal bed has now become covered with a growth of grass and as far as appearances went, is operating very efficiently. It was noticed, however, that a portion of the rip-rap on the water's edge had become displaced and needs repairing. This repair work could now be possibly done at a cost of $10.00 or $15.00, whereas it will possibly cost $100.00 if allowed to deteriorate much further. I would, therefore, suggest that the Indian Agent at Kenora - Captain Edwards, be instructed at the very earliest possible date, to have this rip-rap replaced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

The 18% addition covers our cost of overhead expenses, which includes use of equipment, cost of maintenance and supervision. Our Superintendent made three trips to Kenora and spent seven days time.\n\nThe extra 10% is our profit on the entire job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE STANDARD PLUMBING & HEATING CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHarold Turner\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department Letter 129-1-5 dated October 18th, I am returning the voucher in favour of the Standard Plumbing & Heating Co. with a letter of explanation by Mr. Turner who was in charge of the work.\n\nIn submitting the account, the company listed the repairs at cost price and showed the wages at the rate actually paid, which I understand is in accordance with the Fair Wage Schedule. You will note that the 15%, according to the attached letter, covers the work and supervision of the Superintendent who made three trips to Kenora and spent seven days there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 1, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of letter dated the 25th ultimo from Mr. D. B. Gow, Acting District Chief Engineer, in connection with the sewage disposal bed at the Kenora Indian Residential School. This letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The disposal bed has now become covered with a growth of grass and as far as appearances went, is operating very efficiently. It was noticed, however, that a portion of the rip-rap on the water's edge had become displaced and needs repairing. This repair work could now be possibly done at a cost of $10.00 or $25.00, whereas it will possibly cost $100.00 if allowed to deteriorate much further. I would, therefore, suggest that the Indian Agent at Kenora - Captain Edwards - be instructed at the very earliest possible date, to have this rip-rap replaced.\"\n\nPlease give the above matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We understand that the pumps are drawing in sand and, as a consequence, the pumps have to be cleaned and freed from sand once or twice each week. A request has been made that the intake pipe be extended or a change made in order that the drawing in of sand can be prevented.\n\nI would request that you discuss this matter with the Principal and inform the Department what action you would advise be taken to overcome the conditions complained of. Would you recommend that the matter be referred to an engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, or would it be possible for the Principal and yourself to arrange for having any necessary changes or extension made in the pipe.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Residential School. We have had trouble with the pump drawing in sand for some time and have spent considerable money on this outfit.\n\nWe have had Mr. Campbell of the Miners and Heating Supply Co. make an examination of the condition, and he claimed the sand was in the water and that there was nothing that could be done. If a small mesh screen was put on the intake, it would simply clog up.\n\nUnder these conditions we would suggest that an engineer from the Dominion Water Power Branch be asked to make a report as to what he would consider would be best to be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nH.

T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe 4\" pipe line should have been laid at least 3' below the lowest anticipated water level of the lake. It has been laid only about 1' below the water level prevailing in April and May and at the present time, for a considerable distance from the shore. The fact that the old pipe line never froze is no reason to assume that the new one will not, especially since the old pipe is set nearly 9' lower than the new pipe and another pipe. The only safe measure for ensuring that this new pipe line will not freeze is to lower it so that there is five feet of solid earth covering out to the point where the water is now 4' deep. I would not care to recommend any other course. It might be possible to so cover up the pipe line as it now rests, in shallow water as far as to prevent freezing but I have no suggestions to make along these lines. You know what the consequences would be should this pipe line freeze up so no expense should be considered too great to ensure uninterrupted water service.\n\nI expect that Mr. J. T. Rose of this staff will be proceeding to Renora this week to carry out some investigations in connection with the proposed new sewage disposal system for the H. C. School and I have instructed him to accurately measure the suction lift, as the pump is now located, also in the recommended new location, also to determine the profile of the pipe line as laid. Mr. Rose's services will be available to you for any further investigations you wish made and for consultation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nDepartment of the Interior  \nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau  \n\nWINNIPEG, Man., September 16, 1930.\n\nCaptain Edwards,  \nIndian Agent,  \nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Captain:\n\nFollowing our examination of the new pump and pipe line installed at the R. C. Indian School at Kenora, I have studied the Campbell Heating Company's proposals, made in writing to you under date of April 30, 1930. This firm reported that the lake level was about 22 feet below the pump and recommended their \"First Proposal\" as \"the proper and thorough way to install this job\", and \"For the reason that this pump motor and suction line are of the proper capacity to do the job thoroughly and depending upon these reports and recommendations, I understand you advised that the work be proceeded with. Later this Company demanded and secured an additional $600.00 above their original offer for doing the work. Mr. Campbell now states that the lake level is 25' 8\" below the pump. I would here like to point out that on September 13th the lake level was 105.40 and on no day during the month of April, 1930 did the lake level reach this elevation; it was always lower. Had the suction lift been only 22 feet and had the 4\" pipe line been properly laid below the frost line and otherwise properly laid, in all probability the system would have worked, but, however, with little margin of safety. I am now assuming that the suction lift has been found to be nearly 25 feet. The Campbell Heating Company, acting in the capacity of Advisory Engineers and Consulting Contractors, have therefore the responsibility of seeing that the system is made to work in a \"thorough way\".\n\nAssuming the suction lift to be 25 feet, I am of the opinion that taking into consideration friction losses in the pipe line, and the possibility of still lower water in the lake, that a new pump as installed cannot be made to serve satisfactorily and that no time should be wasted in attempting to make it do so. The pump and motor are efficient but not dependable against a suction lift in excess of 22 feet when there are several friction losses. The remedy, therefore, is to decrease the suction lift by lowering the pump. Being as it is necessary to move the pump it would be advisable to lower it sufficiently to ensure sufficient operation. I would suggest that a new pump house be erected immediately over the check valve now installed below the old pump house. This pump house should be 8' x 10' with an 8\" wall, with an 8\" concrete floor slab resting on gravel with wooden trap door giving access to the check valve. I would set the motor and pump as low as possible but resting on a concrete platform, say 4\" or 6\" above the concrete floor.\nsuction line and the escaping air can then be detected from the surface. Under open-water conditions such an inspection would entail no difficulties but with the ice in place an immense amount of ice cutting might be necessary. On the other hand should the inspection reveal breaks in the pipe line, it would be necessary to raise the whole line to the surface and this could most readily be done with an ice cover.\n\nWhen this suction line was laid the water of Lake of the Woods was approximately four feet lower than it is at present. The pipe line extends for approximately 650 feet out into the lake from water's edge and if breaks have occurred the repairing of the line will be a difficult matter and will entail considerable expense. An examination of the profile of the water line leads me to the belief that if a break has occurred that such break might be approximately 325 feet out from the shore line. Furthermore, it is our belief at the present time that the inspection and repair work could be undertaken most economically late in March, while the ice is still in place and at a time when moderate temperatures will probably prevail.\n\nFurther consideration, however, will be given to this matter and a trip will be made to Kenora to consult with people there who have had more experience in dealing with such matters than the writer. After this trip has been completed we will again communicate with you with respect to this situation. At that time definite recommendations and estimates of cost will be submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDe B. Cow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nJanuary 24, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the water intake at the Roman Catholic Indian School at Kenora, Ontario. It is noted that sand is being drawn into the pump and as a consequence considerable trouble has developed.\n\nThe writer was at Kenora on October 22nd last in connection with a visit relating to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School and upon that occasion also visited the Roman Catholic Indian School - being interested in learning how the water intake was laid as we were then considering the laying of a suction line at Lebret, Saskatchewan. Mr. Kimberley, who had something to do with the laying of the suction line in 1920, informed me that the pump was drawing in sand at that time - that is, in October, 1920. Accordingly, the present trouble can be attributed to the same cause and it is not considered necessary to make an immediate visit to the school and examine the intake. Severe winter conditions are being experienced and similar conditions can be expected to prevail until late in March, preventing inspection and repair work being carried out except at great inconvenience to the school and heavy expense to the Department.\n\nThis office had nothing to do with the placing of this suction line in 1920, but as the accompanying copy of a letter written to Captain Edwards on September 16, 1920 will reveal, we were rather critical of the pumping arrangements and also of the laying of the suction lines. Our suggestions regarding the pumping arrangements were ignored and when the suction line was tested immediately at a later date Mr. Rose of this office made a profile of the suction line pipe and also located its position on the lake bottom with reference to the school location. This profile, when plotted, revealed that it would be possible for many air pockets to form in the pipe line.\n\nIt is noted that Captain Edwards has examined the situation and claims that the sand is in the water and is drawn into the pumps. In our opinion, however, the water of Lake of the Woods at that particular location is not subject to agitation and furthermore that the end of the pipe line is resting upon a rock bottom. It is our opinion, therefore, that the end of the pipe line is either immersed partially in sand now or that breaks have occurred at one or more points along the suction line and that sand is being drawn in from the lake bottom.\n\nIt will be necessary to determine whether or not there are any breaks or leakage throughout the length of the suction line or whether the end of the line has become partially immersed in sand. This can be determined by using the air in the pressure tank to force the water from the\n\nJ. T.

These describe the situation with respect to the intake in Lake of the Woods.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Gow suggests that the inspection and repair work could be most economically undertaken late in March but he proposes to visit Kenora before that time to find out what is best to be done and will then submit definite recommendations and estimates of cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

I would request that you consult the Principal of the School, and, in cooperation with him, advise me regarding the work that you would recommend be done for the above amount. As full particulars as possible should be given as to any materials required, also the labour and the approximate cost of each item of work you recommend. I should be pleased if the Principal could give this matter full consideration and report early date.\n\nThe Department understands that there still remains work to be performed in completing the road to the Golf Links. It also gives an estimate of the cost of having the road placed in good condition. We believe there are a number of men employed on relief who are available for this work. If any further work connection with completing the road to the Golf Links can be possible to utilize labour of this type. We would like to have your suggestions regarding how this labour could be utilized if it is decided to proceed with the work.\n\nI may add, however, that the question of whether further expense on the road this year will depend upon what would be involved.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nA.A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nKenora, Ontario.\nMay 6th, 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 129-1-5 of ultimo regarding appropriation for the Kenora R.C.School.\n\nRegarding the $850.00 provided, the Principal informs us that in order of importance he would like the following work done:\n\nRepairs to Deck etc. $250.00\nVarandah on Girls side $250.00\nStore House $600.00\n\nIt might be possible to do the work for less than the $1100.00 estimated, but it could not be done for the $850.00 appropriated, and we therefore do not know how the money should be spent, unless the appropriation is exceeded.\n\nMr. Gow of the Dominion Reclamation Bureau recommended repairs to the wall of the sewage disposal bed but the water was too high for this to be done then. If the water is lower this spring, the Principal will have this work done at a cost of $50.00 and we would have authority for this work to save future expense.\n\nRegarding the road to the school, we have been over this with the Superintendent of Works for the Town of Kenora and he informs us that Town could do this work or us, using the unemployed and any Indians who might want to work at a cost not more than say $500.00.\n\nThis would include Labour, Gravel, Grader & Tools and would put the road in fair good shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nhave this information, the matter will be submitted to\nthe Honourable the Minister for his approval to proceed\nwith the work, to a cost not exceeding your estimate.\n\nRegarding the repairs to dock and verandah,\nplease state what labour would be required and if you\ncould arrange for the purchase of any materials necessary,\nfrom firms on the approved list.\n\nThe question of enlarging storehouse will\nreceive further consideration after it has been decided\nwhether the work of completing the road can be undertaken.\nIf this latter work is undertaken, there will be no funds\nto enlarge the storehouse.\n\nWith reference to the repairs required to the\nwall or the sewage disposal bed, I have to say the Depart-\nment will approve of you incurring an expenditure of\napproximately $50 in having this work carried out, at a\ntime considered advisable by the Principal and yourself,\nwhen the water in the lake is at a low level. Proper time\nsheets, in triplicate, should be kept of the labour\nemployed. Indian labour should be used as far as possible.\n\nPlease supply full information, as requested,\nregarding the road and the repairs to dock and verandah.\nIt will be necessary, when this information is obtained,\nto submit the whole matter to the Honourable the Minister\nfor his approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, informing the Department, in the order of importance, of the work the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School requires be carried out during the present fiscal year.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 24th ultimo, the sum of $500 is the total amount provided for this school. Therefore, if it is decided to complete the road work, at a cost of approximately $500, there would only be funds available to carry out the repairs to the deck - $250, and the verandah on the 'girls' side of the building - $250. The work of enlarging the storehouse would have to remain over for a further period.\n\nBefore considering the authorising of any further expenditure on the road, it will be necessary to have additional information. The Department understands that the portion of the road to be completed extends from the school to join up with the road the town of Kenora has built to the Golf Club. I would request that you will state if any portion of the road to be completed is within the town limits. If so, we would be unable to provide any part of the cost in completing that portion of the road within the town. I would request, also, that you state the distance from the school to the point where the road joins up with the road to the Golf Links. I may say the question has arisen as to whether any part of the road which we are asked to complete is within the town limits. If you could supply a sketch, showing the course of the road from the school to the town, it would be of use.

They cannot spend more than $859.00 and the question is what to do with the best.\n\nIf we complete the road work which is estimated to take about $500.00 to complete, there would only be funds available to carry out repairs to the deck $250.00 and the veranda on the girls side $250.00. The work of enlarging the storehouse would have to remain over for a further period.\n\nBefore the Department can consider spending any further money on the road, they require further information. Could you write them in Ottawa and inform them I am on Treaty and give them the following information, at my request.\n\nThe portion of the road to be completed is between Cameron Camps and the school, and leads to no other place; it joins up with the road through the Indian house property which the Town is willing to the Golf Club, and none of it is in the Town limits.\n\nYou should also give the Department the distance the road runs from the School to where it meets the Cameron Road. You might also send them a rough sketch of the road showing where it joins Cameron Road.\n\nWhen the Department have this information they will take the matter up with the Honorable the Minister for his approval.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the Deck please state what labour would be required.\n\nThe question of the storehouse will receive further consideration after it has been decided whether the work of completing the road can be undertaken; if the latter work is undertaken there will be no funds for the storehouse.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the sewage disposal bed please see this is done as soon as the water lowers, the cost must be kept down to the lowest as I explained to you. It should only cost a few dollars if repaired soon.\n\nIf you write direct to Ottawa and give me a copy of your letter we may be able to do something. I tried several times today to get in touch with you by phone, but no reply. I leave for treaty tomorrow morning and will not be back until late on Tuesday, and leave again on Wednesday returning Saturday, and leaving Sunday for the C.P.R., so cannot reply to Ottawa myself in time to get things going.

MARY'S INDIAN SCHOOL\nKENORA, ONTARIO\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nJune the 6th, 1936.\n\nTo the Secretary;\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAs requested by your local agent in his letter dated the 16th of May, I am forwarding to you the specifications required with reference to road work and other minor constructions on the school property.\n\nFor general information I am stating that this road referred to branches off from the route built to accommodate the Golf course and the Cameron Camps and leads to the school covering a distance of half a mile more or less. This portion of the road has been considerably improved in recent years, but owing to the lack of funds it was built too narrow and moreover was not completed to the school. Personally, I do not think it is necessary to broaden the road along the whole course. For my part I deem it sufficient to make four or five meeting places for vehicles so as to ensure more safety. With regard to the last portion of the road which was not completed and which trails from the entry of the school property to the house\u2014a distance I would say of two hundred yards\u2014I understand that to make a good job it would be a costly proposition, owing to the fact that rock barriers lie across the roadway. But I think it would be reasonable to spread a little gravel over this portion to ensure a better outlet during wet seasons.\n\nNow I would not like to leave you under the impression that this road though leading to the school serves only the interests of the school. As a matter of fact this road is used as much if not more by our Indians who live on the reserve which lies beyond the school property leading towards the Devil's Gap.\n\nThese suggested restrictions upon road work would perhaps enable us to accomplish more of the proposed items. For instance the dock is decayed and calls for a complete renewal. It measures 30x12 ft., built of heavy log crib work and covered with plank. In connection with the dock and surrounding the two boat houses, there are three sections of side walk which are badly rotted. This would call for an expenditure of more than $250.\n\nFinally,\nIt measures 30 ft. x 12 ft., built of heavy log crib-work and covered with plank. The crib-work and plank require renewal. The verandah on the girls' side of the school is badly in need of repair.\n\nI would request to be advised the names of the firms from whom the materials for the dock and verandah should be obtained; also the name of a competent foreman-carpenter to oversee the work in repairing the verandah and a competent man to supervise the repairs to the dock. A large part of the labour in repairing the dock can be done by Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 13, 1936.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General:\n\nIt is intended to complete the building of the road leading from the Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ont., to join the road from the town to the golf links - covering a distance of approximately one-half mile. This road was considerably improved last year, but the work has not been completed. The road will not only serve the interests of the school but will also be used by the Indians who live on the reserve beyond the school property. The sum of $500 will be available for work on the road. Last year, the work was carried out by men on relief in the town of Kenora, under the supervision of the Indian Agent and the Principal of the School.\n\nI beg to recommend your authority to incur an expenditure to the amount of $500 in completing the work on the road; that the Agent engage the labour, using the services of men on relief and that he supervise the work. Should the above arrangement for the labour not meet your approval, I should be pleased if you would advise regarding the labour to be employed.\n\nBesides the road work, funds are provided to carry out the following repairs:\n\n1. Repairs to deck - $250.\n2. Repairs to verandah on girls' side of school building - $250.\n\nThe deck is decayed and calls for complete renewal.\n\n- It measures\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJuly 2, 1936.\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nIn response to your memorandum of June 13th (your 129-1-5) regarding the construction of the road leading from the Indian Residential School, Kenora, to join the road from the town to the golf links - Mr. H. Jalman Erickson, of Kenora, may be employed to supervise the work; the labour to be provided by the Indians.\n\nMr. C. G.

Mr. H. J. James, Engineer of Kenora, may be employed to supervise the work. Indians to be engaged for the labour. You should keep proper time sheets in triplicate, for all labour employed, and, if an advance is required to pay the labour, same will be forwarded you upon request.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the dock, Mr. C.

The sum of $250 is available for material and labour for repairing the dock and the sum of $250 for material and labour in repairs to the verandah on the girls' side of the school building. If possible, the expenditure should be kept within these amounts.\n\nYou should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, for all materials and proper time sheets, in triplicate, for the labour employed. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

The extreme lift of this pump even in low water level will not be 10 feet. With the amount of sand and dirt that has been pumped through this plant, the cylinder linings of the pumps are cut out and the pump will require relining and overhauling. As soon as the breakage in intake was discovered, I notified the principal of the school that they should not use any of the water from the plant for household uses or for the stock, as the outlet of the septic tank is very close to it.\n\nIf you would like to have me repair the pipe as it is or install the new copper line, I can make an immediate start, and can assure you that I can give you and the principal of the school every satisfaction.\n\nShould you require further details or information I would be pleased to submit same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas. Hatchford\nKenora, Ont.\nJuly 20, 1936.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs: Re St. Mary's Indian School, Kenora.\n\nAt the request of the principal of this school, I have made a check of the water pumping system. His reason for having the system checked was that sand and dirt were being taken in through the pump lines, and the pump was slowing up and losing its prime.\n\nOur check-up showed that the 4\" iron intake pipe is broken off at a distance of 150 feet from the shore line. The original end of this suction line where the water should be taken in is 900 feet from the shore line. At the point where the breakage is, the water is 9 feet deep. The pipe is enclosed in a wooden crib and the crib is loaded with dirt filling. In order to repair this break, a coffer dam would have to be constructed. This dam would have to be long enough to work at a 20 foot length of 4\" iron pipe. Making this dam would be a real job, as the bottom of the lake at this point is mud. The crib work would have to be cut away before the dam could be put down.\n\nI would estimate the cost of the dam and the repair to the pipe and the back filling of this crib at $2,000.00 or more. There is also always the chance that after this break has been repaired that other breaks may show up or develop, or with the weight of the dirt being put back in the crib the pipe may snap off again.\n\nI would propose that in view of the outlined conditions that this pipe line be discarded and a new line of copper piping be put down to replace it. This line could be of smaller size, say 2\u00bd\" or 2\". This pipe would have some give and would fit down to the bottom of the lake. It could be placed in the water beside the present crib and very little additional frost covering would be required.\n\nThis pipe should be connected without check valves so that it can be back-washed and cleaned with the water from the\nJ D SUTHERLAND\nSUPT OF INDIAN EDUCATION OTTAWA\n\nBREAK IN SUPPLY PIPE KENORA R C SCHOOL RENDERS WATER UNSAFE FOR CONSUMPTION STOP WOULD YOU PLEASE HAVE MATTER INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY STOP HAVE RECEIVED LETTER TODAY FROM PRINCIPAL LEBRET SCHOOL STATING THAT WATER SUPPLY SO DEFECTIVE THAT WATER HAS TO BE HAULED FOR SCHOOL STOP I UNDERSTAND GOW HAS MADE SURVEY OF CONDITIONS BUT SO FAR NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS STOP IMMEDIATE STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INSTALL IN BOTH SCHOOLS WATER SYSTEMS SATISFACTORY TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES\n\nJ O PLOURDE\nOttawa, July 27th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the water pumping system at the Kenora R.

Indian Residential School. The matter has been referred to Mr. Gos for a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indians Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am sorry to inform you that the water situation at the Kenora school requires immediate attention. I understand that Dr. Ferguson has forbidden the use of the present supply of water on account of the danger of contagion.\n\nThere is a break in the supply pipe 150 feet from the shore line. As this break is very close to the septic tank, it is feared that contaminated water is being pumped into the pressure tank in the basement of the school. That is the reason why Dr. Ferguson forbade the school authorities to use any lake water.\n\nAs the school children are now on their vacation, the inconvenience caused by this break is not very serious as water can be hauled for ordinary culinary purposes but, as soon as the children return, this will be an impossible task and besides, there might be the danger of the children and members of the staff drinking the contaminated water.\n\nWill you be good enough to have this matter investigated immediately? Mr. Charles Batchford, of Kenora, made the survey of the whole system of water supply and has submitted a price for the laying of a new pipe line. Mr. Batchford has done considerable work for the school in the past and his prices were always fair and the quality of his work very satisfactory. As he is a local man, we are quite sure that if he were given the contract for this work, it would be done quickly and to the satisfaction of the department.\n\nHoping that you will attend to this matter without further delay, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE REVISED OBLATE FATHERS.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 22nd, 1936.\nOttawa, August 8, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo regarding the water situation at the Kamra Indian Residential School, the Department arranged with the Dominion Water Power Branch, on the 27th ultimo, to have one of their engineers visit Kamra at the earliest possible date and report concerning what is required.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nAugust 13, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested by your letter of July 28th, I visited Kenora in connection with the water intake at the R. C. Indian School.\n\nRecently the Principal of the School had a local firm examine the intake and I believe this examination revealed a break in the pipe line about 150 feet from the shore and no doubt the water supply has been taken from that point rather than from the end of the line about 700 feet from shore. The break in the line was located under the crib which protects the line from freezing during low water - this cribwork at that point being 10 to 15 feet in width and from 5 to 7 feet deep and is submerged at the existing lake level. The cribwork is filled with gravel, earth and possibly some rock and sheet piled at the sides.\n\nThe intake was laid in 1930 and a new pumping unit was also installed at the same time. At low lake elevation the pipe line has very little protection from freezing but to date no trouble has been experienced. The present pipe should still be in serviceable condition but it may be possible that other breaks exist in the line cut from the one located.\n\nWe would suggest that the existing intake pipe line be repaired. This will involve removing the cribwork protection at the location of the break and repairing the break by means of rubber hose couplings. Tests must then be made to determine if other breaks occur. Removing the cribwork will be expensive, involving the use of drag line and possibly dynamite. After the break has been sealed it will be necessary to rebuild the cribwork protection.\n\nThis office was not connected in any way with the placing of this intake in 1930 but while carrying out other work at the school later did locate the pipe line, secure a profile of the same and locate the cribbing. A plan was prepared to show these details. It is necessary to make further examination of the pipe line now, also to examine more closely the work involved in getting at the break under the cribwork, etc. The results of these examinations will determine whether or not it is advisable to relay the pipe line.\n\nThe writer endeavored to secure some reliable estimates of the probable costs of repairing the existing line and also of laying a new line. The opinions of those questioned were apparently influenced by the desire to secure considerable work as they considered it would cost as much to repair the existing line as it would to lay a new line. The writer does not share their view and would recommend that the old line be repaired. The cost may exceed $1,000.00 but will be much less if suitable equipment is available to remove the cribwork.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 17th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of July 27th regarding the water supply at the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Gow dated the 13th instant in which he reports on the situation and recommends that the break in the pipe be repaired.

It is considered that approximately $500.00 will be required to pay the labour in constructing the road, and it is thought that the sum of $200.00 would be sufficient for the labour in carrying out the repairs to the verandah and deck.

Such methods cannot be followed if a proper intake is required, although the use of Anthes pipe will give much more flexibility in the line. The new intake, repairs to pump etc., might cost $3,500.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B.

Indian School, Kenora.\n\nWe have made further investigations regarding the water supply intake at the above mentioned institution. Compressed air was forced through the pipe line, area of crib work was determined and soundings taken to determine depth of water.\n\nIt was ascertained that a major break in the pipe line existed 118 feet from the pump house and a minor leakage was located about 70 feet from the pump house. Because of the major break 118 feet out, it was impossible to determine with air whether breaks occur beyond that point, but there probably are several breaks. The cribwork extends 151 feet out from the pump house so both located breaks occur under this protective covering.\n\nAt present the water supply for the school is being obtained by means of the pump and pipe line in use prior to the new installation made in 1930. Sand, silt etc., is being drawn in and the pump will soon be useless. The pump, installed in 1930, will have to be overhauled before again being operated as the cylinder walls are badly scored.\n\nIt would appear advisable to abandon the pipe line laid in 1930 and to lay a new intake. It would prove expensive to gain access to the present line to make repairs and the intake line is improperly laid and many breaks may exist.\n\nWe would recommend the laying of a new intake from pump to a point about 500 feet into the lake. This new line to be 4\" anthracite pipe and to be protected by well fitted cribwork for at least 100 feet from the pump house. The new crib work would commence with the old cribwork and would be from 5 to 6' wide. Because of the narrow lake bottom the outer 500 feet of line would have to be supported on cribwork where necessary, to prevent any sagging or breaking.\n\nThe pump will also have to be overhauled if its condition warrants this being done. If the pump is ruined it will have to be replaced.\n\nThe school will soon be in operation and the water supply will be inadequate and unsafe until such time as the new intake is installed. The present water supply is more or less contaminated and probably is dangerous for use.\n\nIt is difficult to give an estimate of the cost of placing a new intake. Should it be possible to secure a foreman, expert in such work, I do not believe the installation would be difficult. The intake placed in 1930 was pushed out through the\n\nJ.T.

He now considers that it is necessary to lay a new intake to a point about 700 feet into the lake, the estimated cost of this work including repairs to the pump is $3,500.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Indian School at Kenora.\n\nThis letter apparently was written previous to the receipt of my letter of August 25th in which I recommended the laying of a new intake and the repairs of pumping plant - the estimated cost being $3,500. As this amount is greatly in excess of the $1,000.00 estimated for the repair job outlined in my letter of August 13th, we will await further word from the Department of Indian Affairs. The recommendations set out in my letter of August 25th were, of course, based upon the results of examinations carried out after the letter of August 13th was forwarded.\n\nIt is noted that tenders for carrying out the work are to be asked from Mr. Charles Batchford of Kenora. Of course these instructions also relate to the repair work outlined in our letter of August 13th. It is our intention to prepare some plans with respect to the laying of a new intake but the rocky and stony lake bottom is very uneven and the exact location of the new intake would only be determined after numerous soundings were taken to ascertain the most favourable location. It is not feasible now to prepare drawings showing details sufficiently accurate to permit of tenders being called.\n\nThis work should be given to a good contractor with the necessary equipment for carrying out the job rapidly and inexpensively. The only plumbing involved is in connection with the pump. As the pipe requires no plumbers or steamfitters to connect up, Mr. Charles Batchford is a plumber and his services could possibly be utilized in connection with the pump equipment. On a small job of this kind calling for tenders would be disadvantageous. Under water work involves many uncertainties and tender or no tenders, the Government would have to pay the total cost plus a reasonable profit, since a responsible firm would tender sufficiently high to cover the uncertainties and the individual with no financial responsibility or experience would, if his tender was accepted, exhaust his resources and have to be rescued and the job finished for him.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs approve of the laying of new intake and the repairing of the pump, we suggest that the work be entrusted to a good general contractor on a cost plus basis, or that a man, thoroughly experienced with such work, be selected to superintend and direct the work. This office will endeavour to give engineering assistance and to check labor and material costs.\n\nIf this work is to proceed we would appreciate receiving early advice regarding the carrying out of the same and also as to the arrangements for providing the monies necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, OTTAWA.\n\nD. B. Lee,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the new water intake to be constructed at the R.C. Indian School at Kenora, I enclose herewith a further letter from Mr. Gow, dated the 4th instant in which he makes suggestions regarding the carrying out of this work. Mr. Gow has apparently not realised that the authorisation from the Indian Department covered the estimate included in his letter of August 25 but it seems desirable that his recommendation regarding the carrying out of this work should be given careful consideration.\n\nI should be glad to have your instructions with regard to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F.

It is noted that, during that week, Mr. H. Erickson, foreman, was employed 6 days at $3.60 per day. The amount due him for that period is $21.60, and not $24.60, as shown by the return. You should obtain a refund of $3.00 and also forward a receipt from Mr. Erickson for the amount of $21.60. When you have obtained the refund and the receipt, you should attach the receipt to the paylist and return same to the Department. When this is received, the balance due you will be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

The account is not certified by yourself.\n\n3. The advance which was sent you was to pay for labour, only, and this account should not have been paid from the advance but it should have been forwarded to the Department and a cheque in payment sent from here.\n\nI would request that you have each copy of the account receipted by Mrs. W. E. Long and also certified correct by yourself. It should then be returned to the Department for credit against the advance sent you for labour.

Indian Residential School, Mr. Gow supplies the following information in a letter dated the 21st instant:\n\n\"Definite arrangements have not as yet been made with Lindstrom and Wilson as to the basis upon which the work will be carried out. It will, however, be on the basis of cost plus 10%.\"\n\n\"I am proceeding to Kenora tomorrow to initiate the work there and will endeavour to arrange for the work to be carried out as economically as is possible. We are prepared to allow the contractor 10% profit on labor and all material supplied, other than pipe and plumbers' supplies but no rental will be allowed on any equipment used. Purchases of supplies will be made upon our order only on competitive basis and invoices will be forwarded to Ottawa for payment. Labor costs will be paid through this office and we will have a representative from this office on the job who will act as time-keeper, supervisor, engineer, etc.\n\n\"I do not know what the probable labor costs will be, but they will doubtless exceed $1,000, and an advance of $500 will be required immediately. Please arrange to have this advance forwarded and additional advances will be requested as needed.\"\n\nWill you please arrange for the advance of $500, requested above, to be sent to this office and made available to Mr. Gow in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

With reference to your letter of October 5th in which you ask to have the time sheets sent to the department, these are now with the Representative of the Treasury in this department and will, no doubt, be sent to you in due course.\n\nIf you find that Mr. Gow's request is in order I should be obliged if you will arrange for payment to be made in accordance with his statement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nController,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau.\n\nEnc.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nDivision of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Gow, your Acting District Chief Engineer, requesting that a cheque be sent Messrs. Lindstrom and Nilson, to cover the 10% profit which was to be allowed these contractors on cost of material, labour and special equipment in the construction of the new water intake at the Kenora Roman Catholic Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it will be necessary for Mr. Gow to prepare a voucher, in triplicate, stating thereon in detail the accounts on which he recommends that the above firm be allowed 10% profit. The Representative of the Treasury of this Department requests, as the work was carried out under the direction of Mr. Gow, that he certify the voucher in favour of the 10% profit to Messrs. Lindstrom and Nilson. We will be pleased to receive, in due course, the time sheets and any other accounts for material, etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nJ. T.

This rate classification is the same as that of the railroads and the rate per hundred pounds is also the same, as is required by law.\n\nReplying to the third paragraph of Mr. MacKenzie's letter, I would point out that it was more economical to utilize the services of Moore's Trucking Service than it would have been to have used the facilities of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Canadian Pacific Railway does not provide any trucking facilities between Winnipeg and Kenora. It would have been necessary for the Cartage Companies to have picked up all supplies and deliver the same to Railway Freight Office in Winnipeg and this service is not rendered free of charge by any means. At Kenora the Roman Catholic Indian School is situated over two miles from the Town of Kenora and approximately two and a half miles from the Canadian Pacific Railway Depot. Accordingly, it would have been necessary to hire a Cartage Company to transport all these materials from the Freight Sheds to the school grounds and back again. This would have been approximately the amount of the freight charges. Furthermore, in this particular instance, rapidity of delivery was of major importance.\n\nI would also point out that the rate charged by Moore's Service was from point of pick up to the Indian School and that the same rate by railroad only applies from freight shed in Winnipeg to freight shed in Kenora.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Cow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFurther in reference to your letter of November 23rd returning for revision the account of Moore's Taxi Limited for freight on equipment and materials from Winnipeg to the Roman Catholic Indian School at Kenora, Ontario, I am enclosing copy of a letter dated December 5th received from our engineer at Winnipeg together with the revised account.\n\nIt is hoped that with Mr. Gow's explanations you will now be in a position to pass this account for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This error proved to their satisfaction the next following and they forwarded the fitting stating that they would pay the express on the same. However, it was sent Collect and the $35 express was paid by Mr. Wallace who included it in his expense account in the regular way. We asked Crane Limited to forward us a Credit Note of $35 and this accounts for the necessity of the Credit Note.\n\nCrane Limited were asked for the Credit Note about November 1st, it being explained that their account could not be forwarded to Ottawa for payment without the Credit Note being attached as we do not carry any accounts with the firm. It was promised immediately but it had to be drawn to their attention twice afterwards before it was finally sent. It was then sent to the office of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa on Nov. 14th, receiving the balance of the last week. Their account amounts to $80.55 with $5 discount if paid by November 20th. We make it a rule to take advantage of all such discounts and in this instance were prevented from doing so by the delay of the Company so that we think it justified to subtract the $5 discount on $81.55 or a discount of $35. This discount together with the $35 Credit Note reduces the amount of the account to $80.55.\n\nI trust that the above explanation will clear up any misunderstanding with respect to this account and we are now returning the account and would request that the Department of Indian Affairs be asked to pay the same at their earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Dow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nController,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing an account of Crane Limited, Winnipeg received from our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, amounting to $21.33, for material supplied for use at the Roman Catholic Indian School, Kenora, Ontario. It will be noted from a letter received with the account from Mr. D.B.Gow, our Engineer at Winnipeg, that this amount of $21.33 is subject to a reduction to $20.57, being the amount of a credit note 33\u00a2 attached to the account and 2\u00bd discount, 43\u00a2.\n\nProvided this account meets with your approval, Mr. Gow asks that this account be paid direct from your office at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Lindstrom & Nilson of Kenora.\n\nAs you will observe from the details of the drawing, the intake extended out into the Lake of the Woods for a distance of about 750 feet from the pump house, the intake consists of 4\" Universal Cast Iron Pipe and the intake follows as closely as possible the contour of the lake bottom. In order to overcome failures of other pipelines that were installed, precautions were taken at this time to support the pipe at sections where the bottom was shelving or very uneven. At the shore end of the intake it was also necessary to provide protection from freezing covering those intervals when the lake would be drawn down to its minimum stage at elevation 1056.\n\nCopies of this blue-print have also been sent to the Principal of the school and to the Indian Agent at Kenora.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.L.

Edwards, KENORA, ONT., March 4th 1938\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Captain:\n\nI hereby wish to present to you my report on the inspection made of the St Mary's Indian residential school.\n\nThe premises were found in very good order and well kept; the fire extinguishers were found in want of recharging and the new ones were also in need of charging; the firehose on the water standards are useless and four reels need new hose; the hose rack in the basement should also have a fifty foot length of rubber lined treated hose. The dormitories should be furnished with a new fire alarm and in case the pupils were outside at their games or at work the large bell on the roof could be arranged with a special striker that would give an alarm for such an emergency.\n\nFire drills should be held regularly and from both the dormitories and the school rooms at different intervals.\n\nOne employee should be put in charge of all the fire protection apparatus including the looking after the exits and condition of the fire escapes to keep them free from snow or ice during the Winter months and free from obstructions at all times. The night watchman's clock routine should so be arranged that all doors leading to exits could be kept unlocked during the night hours; if one or two pupils act unruly in this respect they could be penalized instead of having to keep the doors locked endangering the lives of the whole of the pupils in case of an emergency or a fire.\n\nRespectfully submitted by\n\nChief Fire Dept.\nwould require 4 soda & acid extinguishers.\n\nThe Principal would also like us to purchase two fire alarm gongs which can be got for about $9.00 or $10.00 each to install in the basement and of the other rooms; this is also recommended by the fire Chief.\nRequirements of the Kenora Indian Residential School\n(St. Mary's Indian School)\nFor 1938-1939.\n\nAdditional storage for flour and grain, 16x16 ft., lined with galvanized sheet iron.

Has this matter been brought to your attention? Do you know the name of pump best suited to meet the requirements? Kindly supply whatever information you can, advising at the same time whether or not you have written Ottawa concerning the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

He has received the quotation of $572.00 less 7% 60 days F.O.B. Kenora, and he will install it without extra cost, but there may be extra expense later for extension of suction line if the pump is installed in the lower house instead of in the much smaller pump house near the lake to save the expense of heating two buildings.\n\nThe price seems pretty high for a pump for the school such as this but the Brother is anxious to get it, as he is decidedly satisfied it will last for some years and give no trouble.\n\nOwing to the difficulties they have had in the last few years, I would recommend that the purchase be made.\n\nThe motor for the old pump is considered suitable for the proposed pump.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\nApril 5th, 1938\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter All-11 A.R.O. of 26th ult., re new pump for Kenora, R.C. Residential School.\n\nThis matter has not been brought to my attention before, and I have had no communication with Ottawa regarding same.\n\nI delayed answering your letter till I had seen the Principal of the school and Brother Eugene Gauthier.\n\nThe Brother came into the Office this morning and informs me that the old pump had too fast a stroke and was not functioning properly as it was much worn, and much repair work had been done on it.\n\nThe matter was not reported to us although we knew they had been having difficulties.\n\nThe Brother recommends that we purchase:\n\nA Gardner-Denver Co. Pump from Messrs Yates Reale & Co. Brandon Manitoba who he believes are the only firm handling this pump in this part.\n\nSimilar to pump mentioned has done work for us at the Camperville Indian School, it was installed 9 years ago and the Brother has given and is still giving entire satisfaction.\nSELECTING A POWER PUMP\n\nIn the selection of a Power Pump the questions of efficiency and cost of operation have an important bearing and in the variety of types and sizes listed herein, prospective buyers will find the power requirements of these pumps in line with greatest economy. There are several types of Reciprocating Power Pumps on the market, but the Duplex and Triplex are most used. The Gardner-Denver Duplex will handle a third more water than a triplex with the same size cylinders, both pumps operating at the same speed. This is due to the fact that the duplex is double-acting whereas the triplex is single-acting.\n\nGardner-Denver Duplex Power Pumps operate with highest mechanical efficiencies resulting in low power consumption. A duplex power pump will operate under a wide variety of pressure conditions with little change in efficiency, and capacity can be varied over a wide range by changing the stroke.\n\nEstimates and complete engineering information will be promptly furnished upon request. Inquiries should include complete information as to the type of power available for driving the pump.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR ORDERING\n\nThe Pumps shown on the preceding pages are such as will ordinarily meet most requirements. Our patterns are subject to various changes, all of which could not be shown in this catalogue. If, therefore, the pumps listed will not answer your purpose, write us stating the conditions fully, and we shall be pleased to submit quotations on pumps to meet your requirements.\n\nWhen in doubt as to the particular type of pump suitable for you, it is well to give us the information indicated by the following questions:\n\n1. For what purpose is the pump intended?\n2. What is the liquid to be pumped? Is it cold, hot, gritty, acid or fresh? Does it contain alkali?\n3. What is the average quantity to be pumped per minute or per hour?\n4. State to what height the liquid is to be lifted by suction. What is the diameter and length of the suction pipe? What is the temperature of liquid? When hot water is to be pumped, the difficulty of lifting it by suction increases as the temperature increases. Hot water should always flow into the pump. See chart on page 26.\n5. State to what height the water is to be forced or give maximum pressure in pounds against which the pump is to operate. The pressure in pounds per square inch of a column of water is equal to the height of column in feet multiplied by 4.34. A rough estimate is one-half pound pressure for one foot head. This allows for ordinary friction. The height in feet of a column of water is equal to the pressure in pounds per square inch multiplied by 2.31.\n6. For STEAM PUMPS What is the available steam pressure at the pump? If you do not know, give us the boiler pressure and the size and length of the steam pipe. To obtain the steam pressure necessary for pumping against a pre-determined water pressure proceed as follows: Multiply area of water cylinder by the water pressure per square inch, add from 20 per cent to 40 per cent (for positive pumps) or 30 per cent to 50 per cent (for plunger pumps) then divide by the area of the steam piston. The result is the steam pressure per square inch.\n\n7. For POWER PUMP If pump is to be motor driven state the characteristics of the electric current available. If alternating current, state cycle, phase and voltage. If direct current, advise voltage. If you prefer to furnish your own motor, certified drawings of the motor giving frame number, speed and characteristics, must be sent so that proper gears and motor supports for the outfit can be selected. It is recommended that wherever possible motors be sent to us for mounting so that proper alignment of the motor gears may be assured before drilling for the motor feet. We cannot drill holes for the motor unless the motor is sent to the factory for mounting.\n\nBe careful to order a pump large enough. It is better to have surplus capacity than not enough. Normal and maximum speeds are given in all tables, but pumps should not be operated at more than specified speeds when absolutely necessary; pumps that must be run at high speeds to fill the requirements will wear rapidly and the saving in first cost is then far lost through the expense in repairing that will be necessary to keep it in good condition. A slow piston speed is desirable particularly when pumping against pressure and when pumping heavy liquids, also with high suction lifts and long suction lines.\n\nAll references in this bulletin to illustrations shown are to be understood to represent the type of machine and general construction only and not the exact details of construction which necessarily vary somewhat in different sizes of machines of the same class.\n\nA correct drawing of any individual pump will be furnished upon application.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th April, file 108-12, in view of the information therein, I would suggest you present this need direct to Ottawa. I am returning the enclosure, which no doubt they will need.\n\nI was of the opinion the matter was one which had previously been submitted to Ottawa.

School.\n\nThe correspondence explains itself.\n\nI will be glad to hear if you consider I should recommend a new pump, or not.\n\nThe present pump is still functioning, but is a little light for the work.\n\nThe Principal should have reported this before certifying the account for the pump.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the pump required at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the pump suggested by the school authorities would cost approximately $575.00. For your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation it was only found possible to include an amount of $400.00 for repairs and improvements at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate your discussing this matter again with the principal and advising me if another make of pump could be secured which would cost less. In that event you should let me have full particulars regarding the name of the manufacturer and the catalogue number in order that the information may be placed before our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

Laverde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nsays, if there was a bell put from the doors of the dormitories to the persons room who is supervising the dormitory at night, that person would quit, as her rest would be broken all night, and she would not get proper sleep. I cannot agree with his contention, but would like to know if I should instruct both schools, that some arrangement must be made so that the doors would not be locked.\n\nAs regards direct fire escapes from the dormitories at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, the children have to leave the dormitories and come down a few steps to reach the escape, which are near the staircase, and there is no doubt a certain amount of danger in this, but as I pointed out to the Principal, if escape were placed at each dormitory, this would give another avenue of escape to the pupils should they wish to get out at night.\n\nI am informed that a verandah is being built at the Sioux Lookout Residential School, (which is the same design) as the Cecilia Jeffrey, this will act as an escape in case of fire, but will also allow the children to get out at night should they wish to do so.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario,\n16th April, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe Grand Jury in making their report to Mr Justice MacKay, yesterday, report; in connection with the two Indian Residential Schools in Kenora, as follows:\n\nSt Mary's Industrial School (R.C. Residential School.) The school was found to be well managed. The building is in urgent need of painting and decorating throughout. The fire hose condemned by the Fire Marshal should be replaced. The fire extinguisher should be re-charged at least once annually. The last inspection was in December 1933. They also require new enamel plates and cups for dining room use. One verandah needs a new roof, and one more fire escape is needed in the girls dormitory.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian School. The school appeared to be well managed, and the pupils contented. We found that no dormitories are provided with direct fire escapes. The existing fire escapes in center of building should be repaired. Floors in all dormitories and class rooms should be covered with linoleum.\n\nIn reference to the above reports;-\n\nThe painting, decorating, and floor covering does not come under me, as all estimates come under the Inspector now, and not through this office as we do not see them.\n\nNo Fire Marshall has ever to my knowledge ever inspected any of my schools, but I do ask the local Fire Chief to inspect these buildings with me annually, and to give me a written report, as to anything he considers should be done, so as to make the schools as safe as possible from fire. These reports are always sent to Ottawa, and most of his recommendations are usually carried out.\n\nThe fire hose for the Kenora R. C. Indian Residential School is being purchased by the Purchasing Board as per Departmental letter #129-1-5 of 11th instant, and the Fire Chief has been requested to see the extinguishers are filled. They are inspected every year by him, but are not marked by us, as we considered they should be marked by the person who fills them. They were all inspected by us in March, 23rd ult.\n\nOur letter of the 11th instant gives the requirements for the Cecilia Jeffrey School, and your letter #129-3-5 of 30th ultimo informs us the School will be supplied with hose. As regards the extra fire escapes I will discuss this with the Town Fire Chief. But this is a standard school, and no such recommendation has been put in before by any Jury or Fire Chief.\n\nNeither of the two schools approve of your and the Jury's suggestions, that the dormitories be kept unlocked, shall I give definite instructions to the Principals on this point, they claim they cannot be responsible for the children, if doors are left unlocked at nights, and the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|------|-------------|-------|----------------|--------------|---------|\n|      | To material for addition to shed 14'x42' |       |                |              |         |\n|      | 26 pe. 2x8x4 | 448   | $40.00         | $17.92       |         |\n|      | 350 ft. 2x6 \u00bd Pine Flooring | D     | $32.50         | $27.63       |         |\n|      | 210 lin. ft. 2x4 | 140   |                |              |         |\n|      | 28 pe. 2x6x12 | 284   |                |              |         |\n|      | 20 pe. 2x6x10 | 67    |                |              |         |\n|      | 7 pe. 2x6x12 | 56    |                |              |         |\n|      | 25 pe. 2x4x14 | 251.720 | $39.00        | $23.03       |         |\n|      | 30 pe. 2x6x12 | 360   | $40.00         | $14.40       |         |\n|      | 1000 ft. 1x6 \u00bd Drop Siding | 0     | $36.00         | $36.00       |         |\n|      | 400 ft. 1x6 Cedar Shiplap | 0     | $32.00         | $12.50       |         |\n|      | 6 Window Frames for 1x6x14 lts. | 0     | $7.75          | $16.50       |         |\n|      | 6 pr. each 10x12x4 lts. | 1     | $175           | $10.50       |         |\n|      | 4 pe. 2x10x12 | 30    | $43.00         | $3.44        |         |\n|      | 7000 ft.

There is no reason why this cannot be done at the Cecilia Jeffrey and Kenora Residential schools because such procedure is followed at other Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI feel certain that if the Principals give the matter further consideration they will realize that in the event of a fire serious fatalities would undoubtedly occur if the doors to the fire escapes were locked.\n\nI trust that you will be able to advise me in the near future that the Principals of these two schools are complying with Departmental regulations in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Indian Residential School. Brother Eugene Gauthier was in this morning, and I phoned Mr. Robb, Engineer for the Ontario Department of Highways and he kindly went out to the Schubl with his level for me, without cost, and met the brother there.\n\nLevels were taken and the brother now informs me he does not know of any other pump that would be as satisfactory, and particularly wishes to get this particular one. I pointed out to him what the Principal had already asked for in the estimates, and also that we only had an amount of $400.00 available, he informed me this was entirely inadequate, and he did not know what could be done, but asked me to write you again to see if there was any possible way in which it could be got. The Principal would be responsible for digging and laying the new main, if the old one was not suitable, but if new pipes had to be purchased he believed we should also buy these at an estimated cost of $35.00 or $40.00.\n\nThe old pump is still working but the brother says it may play out at any time.\n\nUnder the circumstances I cannot give you the name or make of any other suitable pump.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMay 6, 1938\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Kenora R.C.

The cost of this pump will be approximately $575.00 and the excess will have to be taken from a very small amount that we have available for miscellaneous expenditures.\n\nIt will, therefore, not be possible to favourably consider any further expenditure for repairs or improvements at the Kenora Residential School this year. A new pump was not included in the estimates forwarded for this school and I would point out that in view of the present set up of our estimates it will be increasingly difficult, if not impossible, in future to provide for any expenditure over and above the amount specifically provided for any Residential School.\n\nThe Principals will have to anticipate their requirements and forward full particulars at the time the estimates are being prepared each year. Otherwise they cannot expect to receive favourable consideration to their requests for expenditures.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1938.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Kenora reports that the water pump at the school is worn out and should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nThe school engineer, who is a very capable mechanic, considers that the most suitable pump for the work that has to be done in pumping the water at this school is a pump manufactured by the Gardner-Denver Company. The estimated cost of the pump required is $575.00.\n\nAs funds for the purpose are available in our appropriation for the current fiscal year I would appreciate receiving the approval of the Honourable the Minister for this expenditure. In that event kindly hand the enclosed purchase form to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nDirector.\nSioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nMay 4th, 1938.\n\nMr. E.W. Byers,\nOceilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast Saturday night I received a wire from you, \"Do you leave dormitory doors unlocked at night?\" We replied, \"Boys' dormitories locked, girls' dormitories unlocked.\"\n\nNow I presume from your haste in a wire that you must be up against some difficulty. I have visited too good many Indian Residential schools and others in the course of my work and in some of the very best schools I notice that they lock both girls' and boys' dormitories at night. In some schools I have even noticed padlocks on the doors as the principals of these schools said these boys were experts at picking locks. We got into difficulty here some years ago when the boys' Master left a dormitory door unlocked because he had a boy who needed constant attention. While he was watching a few hours asleep three boys slipped down stairs and started a fire in the wood room and were heard returning to the dormitory by one of the men of the staff. He went downstairs to find out who had gone down, and found one of the boys still in the wood room adding coal oil to the flames.\n\nWhatever your difficulties may be I certainly would not leave boys dormitories unlocked under any consideration. But we do leave the key turned in the door from the hall side so that any member of the staff can open them. We have not found it necessary to lock the girls in, although, they know that the same thing would happen to them if they disobeyed rules.\n\nAs for having some member of the staff sleeping in the dormitory I cannot agree with it. It is trying enough to work with these children in the daytime without having to sleep in the same dormitory and contact them all day the Indians odor from them. As for the trusted boy or girl who could have their bed close to the door I have never seen one who hasn't been sound asleep and you could have moved the whole dormitory out before they could have wakened up. I know this from years of experience and before my time I walked through this building every night and walked past every child's bed to see if they were properly covered, sometime about midnight.\n\nIf you are confronted with some difficulty do not hesitate to write and I will give you the benefit of my knowledge and experience not only as Missionary and Principal but as eight years Police Magistrate with the Mounted Police.\n\nThe best policy I know of to follow is good common sense.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.F.J. McFadden\nPrincipal\nhappened in an Indian School, in this Agency, a short time ago, some boys having made use of a ladder to gain access to the girls' dormitory.\n\nWe have a night watchman for only six months in the year, and even when he is on duty, he has to make his inspection of the barn and the pump house, and would be away for several periods during the nights. While he was absent, the girls and boys could easily mix in the dormitories.\n\nI have found that the strictest supervision has to be exercised at all times, to keep the boys and girls in their places, and when discussing this problem with other Principals, I find they have the same difficulties.\n\nI hope the Department is not going to ask one School to put into practice methods, which are not required by the other Schools. I certainly would not appreciate working under such conditions, and I would like to receive further instructions from the Department, outlining how one might proceed to run a mixed school and at the same time safeguard the morals of the pupils.\n\nThe system we use is to lock the doors with padlocks, that can be removed almost as readily as turning the knob of the door. We arranged it this way, in the event of fire, so that we should feel we were using a system that would not, in any way, endanger our pupils.\n\nI am giving your letter considerable thought, and I shall await further instructions from the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School\nPRESBYTERIAN\n\nKENORA, ONT. May 4th, 1938.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards, Agent,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: 108-13, April 29th, 1938.\n\nIn reply to your letter, I wish to make the following observations.\n\nIn the first place, I feel that there must be some misunderstanding as to which of the doors of the school are to be locked and which are unlocked. It has always been the practice in our School to see that all doors leading to the fire escapes are unlocked during the night but the dormitory doors have been locked. I notice, in your letter, that you state that the procedure followed at other Indian Residential Schools, is to have the dormitory doors unlocked. I have communicated with six different Indian Residential Schools and inquired regarding their procedure, and they all inform me that they lock their dormitory doors at night.\n\nIn addition to this, I have visited some other Indian Residential Schools, and they, too, locked their dormitory doors. In fact I do not know of any Indian Residential School that does not lock their dormitory doors during the night.\n\nI would very much appreciate having the addresses of some of the Schools, which leave their dormitories unlocked, so I would like to communicate with them, with a view to obtaining their methods of keeping the boys and girls under control. I cannot devise any plan that I feel would work satisfactorily with unlocked doors, and I think that it would be asking something very unfair, to a member of the staff, who was trying to obtain a night's rest, to be responsible for the boys and girls in dormitories with unlocked doors. She would not only have to be responsible for those in the dormitories, but she would also need to be on guard against young men, who visit these Indian Schools, and watch for some opportunity of obtaining entrance to the girls' quarters. This\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 129-1-5 of 25th ultimo, re looking dormitories at residential schools.\n\nI wrote a letter to each Principal asking them to as far as possible carry out the Departmental instructions, and enclose replies from the Principal of the Kenora R.C. and Cecilia Jeffrey Schools.\n\nThe letter from the Principal of the Kenora R.C. School is pretty hard to understand, but from what I can gather he puts hooks on the doors that could be pushed out in case of emergency.\n\nAs regards the Cecilia Jeffrey School the Principal apparently got in touch with other schools and asked what they did. I enclose his letter to me and also copy of a letter sent to him by the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nIf hooks were put on the dormitory doors, that could be pushed open by the pupils in case of emergency, I think this would answer the purpose, so the pupils could escape should there be a fire, without danger.\n\nMr. Byers was very positive that no schools left the dormitory doors unlocked at nights and wanted me to tell him the names of any that did; I informed him all I knew was what the Department informed me, and also that the Sioux Lookout School did not lock the girls in, he said he could not trust the girls any more than the boys, but I said if he punished them severely for leaving the dormitories at night without permission he would soon stop the trouble, but he said this was impossible.\n\nShall I give the schools definite instructions to carry out orders or what action should I take.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO\nRev.

The Indian Agent replied as follows: \"Brother Eugene Gauthier was in this morning and I phoned Mr. Robb, engineer for the Ontario Department of Highways, and he kindly went out to the school with his level for me without cost and met the Brother there. Levels were taken and the Brother now informs me he does not know of any other pump that would be as satisfactory and particularly wishes to get this particular one.\" I might add that Brother Gauthier is a practical man having been for years in charge of mechanical equipment at various Indian Residential Schools.

Indian Residential school, in company with Mr John Kelly, the Boiler Inspector, I found Father LeMire now installed as Principal.\n\nI know the Father well, he is a young man and full of ambition for the school, and I would like to help him if at all possible.\n\nHe has men making repairs to parts of the building, and informed me he was going to send me the bill for materials. I informed him I had no authority to purchase anything, or to certify to any accounts for materials or labour.\n\nHe also informed me he required paint for the school, as it required painting inside and out. This is quite true; as it looks very badly at present, and much damage is being done by the weather, on account of the paint being worn off, and some of the buildings never having been painted.\n\nI am informed the Principal wants to get the following:\n400 lbs white lead, 1 barrel linseed oil, 1 barrel of turpentine, 5 gal linseed, for outside work, and the following for inside work: 20 gal flat paint, 20 gal enamel, the school would furnish the labour and coloring material.\n\nHe is also anxious to get battleship linoleum to floor the Principal's room which is 13 feet by 16 feet, and an extra four yards for patching in the hallways.\n\nEstimates are not put in through this office now, but through the Inspector in Winnipeg, and if only part of the material were delivered now it would be a help; the school re-opens 1st September and the Father would like to do as much as possible before the children get back from their holidays.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 26, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of May 6 only $400.00 was specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Kenora School. This amount will be required to cover the cost of the new engine about which you were written on July 27 and August 19. Under these circumstances it is not possible for the Department to provide any funds for the repairs which the Principal wishes to make nor for the purchase of the material required to paint the exterior of the school.\n\nYou should point out to the new Principal that while certain repairs and painting are possibly quite necessary at the same time funds have to be provided before such improvements can be approved by the Department.\n\nWe will endeavour to provide in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 the amount required for painting the exterior of the Kenora School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.

He informed me that he had visited the school recently and that the building was in good condition. He also mentioned that the school was well-kept and that the students were happy there.\n\nThe school has been in operation for many years now and has served its purpose well. The students have benefited greatly from their education and have gone on to lead productive lives.\n\nI am confident that the school will continue to serve its purpose well in the future. I urge you to consider the needs of the students and to provide them with the best possible education.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the report for your information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant the Purchasing Agent is being requested to purchase the pump recommended by Brother Gauthier.\n\nIn connection with the new pumphouse that will be necessary it is noted that this can be constructed for an amount not exceeding $250.00.

We make special mention of the splendid art exhibits and manual training exhibits of this school and also desire to congratulate this school on the production of such a splendid Indian child.\n\n\"In the general line up of this school we found that the entire building, both interior and exterior is very badly in need of paint and should be taken care of at the earliest possible date. The condition of the present school is such that a complete paint job should be a profitable investment as there has not been a drop of paint on the walls since the school was built ten years ago. In addition to the walls and woodwork inside being in a deplorable condition, the exterior woodwork is beginning to decay for want of paint preservation. This we strongly feel is a matter that should be looked after by the Department of Indian Affairs without delay.\n\n\"We found the children clean, happy and well governed in all departments.\n\n\"ST MARY'S INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.\"\n\n\"Visiting this school we were met by Father J. Lakeres (J. Lekire) who conducted our tour at this point. We found the same condition in this school, as in the other schools, in so far as need of paint is concerned. This school also must have paint inside and outside without delay for the preservation of same.\n\n\"We found 94 children in this school, including the kitchen and dining room we found the ceiling in bad condition, the plaster being cracked. However, the beds and mattresses in this school are in fine shape, the mattresses being new.\n\n\"The paint which we have to draw your attention to is the fire escape which is unsafe owing to the fact that it passes several inches from the paint above and for that reason if a fire should break out on the first or second story the escape would be cut off by the fire and out of these windows on the way going down. The landings of the fire escape are also in poor condition and would recommend that your Fire Marshall view this and place his report with the proper authorities.\n\n\"At this time we might also point out that the appropriation of the Department of Indian Affairs is made in March of each year and would therefore suggest that the foregoing request be placed prior to that date.\"\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI enclose account covering the cost of travel purchased for the Kenora Indian Residential School.

This payment was for material and labour putting in floor and building cupboard January 14, 1938, but we do not appear to have made another payment of $41.50.\n\nCheque No. 60455 referred to in your letter was in payment of building material to the extent of $101.57 supplied during November and December, 1937.\n\nWe have referred your letter to the Administrative Branch of the Department for investigation and when a report is received you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.

Lindstrom and Nilson have a credit of $41.30 on their books in favour of the Department. Cheque No. 18398 which he mentions was in payment of an account of $41.33 for material and labour supplied on January 14, 1938, putting in floor and building cupboard. We do not appear to have made any payment of $41.30 to Messrs. Lindstrom and Nilson. Possibly the Principal of the school may have paid the account the second time.\n\nCheque No. 60455 was in payment of an account of $101.57 for building material supplied during November and December, 1937, and has no bearing on the question.\n\nI should be pleased if you would have this matter investigated and let me have your finding so that we may further advise Indian Agent Mr. Edwards.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nA.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nKENORA, ONT., November 5th 1938\n\nCaptain F. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Captain:\n\nAfter our inspection tour made yesterday at the St. Mary's Indian residential school, I wish to make a number of recommendations which I am sure will greatly assist to make the conditions there much safer and more satisfactory in connection with the fire escapes which should also meet with the approval of the recommendations made recently by the visiting Jurymen.\n\nThe windows that would cause trouble if a fire occurred can be made safe to prevent passage danger on the fire escapes if they were equipped with wire glass and metal covered. There is also a small door outlet from the South side of the basement which comes out almost immediately beneath the base of the fire escape on that side of the building; this door should be made of metal the same as an ordinary fire door including the door frame. On the North side there is a large double door that is situated almost beneath the fire escape; this door leads out from the boiler room and would cause serious trouble and make this escape impossible to use; this door way should be made fire resistant as possible.\n\nThe stay bolts on the top of the escape on the North side are loose and require new fastenings.\n\nThe two fire escapes have electric light sockets at the outside doorway; these sockets should both have a light in them that would burn nights, and they should be on a separate circuit from the house circuit.\n\nProvision should be made to have auxiliary lights kept ready in this building in case the power went out on the electric lines leading to this building; the pupils would not only have a difficult time to get out in the dark if the lights were out but there might occur a panic which would cause probable loss of lives.\n\nThe premises were found in very excellent condition and all appliances in proper order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. Dubois,\nChief Fire Dept.\nI got the local Fire Chief to visit the schools with me and enclose herewith his report on the R.C. Residential School. He had not made any recommendations on the last visit to the school to cover the recommendations he now makes.\n\nThe loose stay bolts, etc., should be removed from the outside doorway, and all other defects will be attended to in due course.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa,\nDecember 5, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo it is noted that the Principal will arrange for certain improvements to the Kenora school as recommended by the fire chief.\n\nYou may obtain a report regarding the cost of carrying out the recommendations contained in the second paragraph of the fire chief's letter. As the end of the fiscal year is approaching our funds are becoming quite limited and it should, therefore, be understood that an estimate should be obtained on the work that is absolutely necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Captain:\n\nAfter the recent fire at the St Mary's Indian residential school the Father in charge has asked me to help him out in figuring out how much hose and the amount it would take to reach the largest buildings on the premises from the pump house on the water front; this will take at least five hundred feet (500) of one and a half inch hose and this size of hose can be procured from seventeen cents per foot for the linen unlined forestry type of hose, to the cotton rubber lined hose which costs somewhere around eighty cents per foot; the latter kind is of course the best hose for fire purposes and if looked after will last around ten years or so, while the other line will last only for a certain period as the starch in it gradually wears off and then the hose has no body to it, it therefore is practically useless for fire purposes.\n\nAfter making a special inspection of the premises I certainly would recommend that good hose be purchased and be placed in a convenient place for immediate use and I believe that along with a good fire drill and proper instructions along fire fighting activities among the older boys and the male help around the school very efficient work could be accomplished in case of fire. Several extinguishers require refilling and this should be done at once as they were used on the fire just lately.\n\nI remain yours as ever,\n\nChief Fire Dept.\nKenora, Ontario,\nJanuary 11, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter from the fire chief of the Town of Kenora re: fire protection at St. Mary's R.C. Indian Residential School which explains itself.\n\nYou will note he recommends the purchase of 500 ft. of 1\u00bd\" hose at the cost of about 17\u00a2 per foot of unlined forestry hose and 80\u00a2 a foot for cotton rubber lined hose. The reason they require this hose is so that it will reach from the pump house to the out buildings.\n\nThis is a large expenditure and I hesitate to recommend it although there is no question that if they had this protection they would be better off.\n\nSeveral fire extinguishers require refilling as they were used at the late fire which burned down completely the principal's old residence.

The Principal also informs me the school would supply a large part of the labor if the Department will supply the materials and the balance of the labor.\n\nIn the meantime he has temporarily fixed up a room over the work shop. He has had to purchase material to the extent of about $60.00 for this and he wishes to know if the Department would pay for this material which will not be wasted as the room may be used for other purposes afterwards.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your reply and will then know if I should have a scaled plan made of the type of building required for your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the old residence destroyed by fire at the Kenora residential school.\n\nYou may forward an account covering the expenditure of $60.00 for material purchased to temporarily fix a room over the work shop.\n\nAt the present time we have no funds available for the erection of a new residence.

C. Indian Residential School, informs me that the grates in the school have burnt out.\n\nOn taking the matter up with the Campbell Heating Co., of this Town, I find we supplied new grates in December 1933 at a cost of $256.20 but the Company say that prices have dropped, and they can supply what is required at a cost of $235.00. This appears to be a very big expenditure so soon after the other grates were supplied, and there is no reason why, with reasonable care, they should have been burnt out so soon, as the School only burns wood.\n\nHowever, the Principal has not been at the School long and the engineer they have there now, was away for some years so neither of them can be blamed.\n\nCampbell informs me the reason the cost of these grates is so high is that the original makers of the boiler are out of business, and the grates have to be specially made. The last lot we got weighed over 1050 lbs.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1959.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the grates in the furnace at the Kenora Indian residential school.\n\nIt is felt that there must have been considerable carelessness on the part of the firemen as these grates should not have burnt out within the time stated in your letter.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding the type of grate that is required as it is our intention to refer the matter to our Purchasing Branch in order that competitive prices may be secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Indian Residential School, the place of residence destroyed by fire.\n\nThe Principal has been in to see me and I enclose a Bill of Materials and quotations of prices for materials he claims are required to construct a new building.\n\nI understand from him that the school authorities will be responsible for the ordinary labour, but he would have to have a foreman and possibly a couple of carpenters, which he considers should be paid by the Department.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions and also the return of the Bill of Materials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief\nWelfare and Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nCould you let me know as soon as possible if the Department will be able to supply the materials required for building the staff residence at the Kenora school.\n\nShould your Department find it absolutely impossible to pay for this material out of the 1938-39 vote, I believe that both the Provincial of the Manitoba Province and the Principal of the School would rather give preference to the proposed new classrooms over the staff residence.\n\nI expect to go East again in about two weeks' time but I would appreciate receiving an acknowledgment to my letter before leaving Winnipeg.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOP/TR\nOttawa,\nMarch 31, 1939.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant in connection with the Kenora residential school.\n\nI regret that it will be impossible to pay for the material for the staff residence from the 1938-39 appropriation. At the present time it is doubtful if we will have sufficient funds to pay for expenditures already approved.\n\nRecently we received a letter from Indian Agent Edwards enclosing a list of the materials required for the staff residence. If the materials were supplied it would involve an expenditure of approximately $1700.00 and in addition the Agent states that while the school authorities will be responsible for the ordinary labour it will be necessary for the Department to employ and pay for the services of a foreman and possibly a couple of carpenters.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 16th instant I am advising the Agent that the provision of the materials for the staff residence will be delayed until the matter has received further consideration.\n\nI note that you expect to be in Ottawa about the end of the month at which time the matter can be discussed further.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, C.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing list of materials that would be required in the erection of a new staff residence to replace the one destroyed by fire.\n\nAs it will not be possible to provide funds for these materials from the appropriation for the current fiscal year purchase of them cannot be made in any case until next month. Final consideration regarding the supplying of these materials will, therefore, be delayed until that time when you will be advised what action we decide to take.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A.

Pardon me for not acknowledging it sooner.\n\nThere is no doubt that something should be done immediately at the above school to provide accommodation for the staff.\n\nYou will remember that the staff residence was destroyed by fire last January and that nothing has been done so far to replace it. We are now studying the possibility of a small addition to the school which would serve the purpose of a staff residence. Separate staff houses have their advantages but they also have their drawbacks, particularly in the matter of heating and general upkeep. We find that in Western Canada, where the weather is extreme, the heating of the staff houses is a serious problem. If attached to the school the premises could be heated from the same boiler with a consequent material saving in fuel cost.\n\nWe have asked our own engineer to suggest the best method of providing quarters for our employees and as soon as I have received his report I shall communicate with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFunds for the above-mentioned amount of $8000.00 are available as follows:\n\n(a) $3000.00 in the main appropriation for Indian Education\n\n(b) $5000.00 in the special supplementary appropriation.\n\nI, therefore, recommend, for the approval of the Honourable the Minister:\n\n1. That the Roman Catholic Church authorities be authorized to proceed with the erection of a wing consisting of basement and one floor 60' x 34' as an addition to the Kenora Indian residential school, the material to be purchased by the Church authorities from firms on the approved list and the labour to be engaged by them; it being understood that as many Indians as possible will be given employment.\n\n2. That the funds for the above expenditure be charged as follows:\n\n$3000.00 to Vote 168 -- Indian Education\n\n$5000.00 to Vote 626 -- Special Supplementary.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Kenora Indian Residential School,\nKenora Indian Agency, Electoral\nDistrict of Kenora-Rainy River.\n\nThe residence used by several members of\nthe staff at the above-mentioned school was de-\nstroyed by fire last fall.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church authorities, who\nare associated with us in the management of this school,\nconsider that instead of erecting a new separate building\nfor the staff it would be preferable to make an addition\nto the school. This would permit a re-arrangement of\nthe rooms and would provide staff rooms, and in the new\naddition would provide class rooms and accommodation for\nvocational training.\n\nThe Church authorities recommend a wing 60' x 34'\nconsisting of a basement and one floor -- all fireproof\nand ventilated.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., on behalf of the\nChurch authorities, advised me recently that they were\nprepared to undertake this work and they estimate that the\nnew wing can be completely built for an amount of $8000.00.\nIn erecting the building in this manner, with the Church\nauthorities handling the work, I feel that there would be\na considerable saving.\nFunds for the above-mentioned amount of $8000.00 are available as follows:\n\n(a) $3000.00 in the main appropriation for Indian Education\n\n(b) $5000.00 in the Special Supplementary appropriation.\n\nI, therefore, recommend, for the approval of the Honourable the Minister:\n\n1.

The approval of the Minister has been secured and you are authorized to proceed with the project at an estimated cost of $9000.00.\n\nI have discussed with you personally the actual design of the building and it might be advisable for you to point out to those responsible for the construction that the design submitted by you is acceptable to the Department and consequently approved.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that this work should be undertaken and the project completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. HOEY,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. O. PLOURDE, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 15, 1939.\n\nDear Father Plourde,\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your guidance and direction, copy of a memorandum relating to the construction of a unit at the Kenora Residential School, approved by the Minister a few days ago. May I direct your attention particularly to the dimensions of the building as outlined in this memorandum. These dimensions are to be sixty (60) x thirty-four (34).\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1939.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copies of official letters of the 12th and 15th instant addressed to Rev. Father Plourde in connection with the construction of a unit at the Kenora Indian residential school.\n\nYou will note particularly the second paragraph of my letter in which it was pointed out that the design submitted to the Department by Father Plourde had been approved. This design provided for a wing to be placed at right angles to the present building and on its southern end. The dimensions of this wing were shown on the design as 34 feet from south to north and 60 feet from east to west.\n\nI believe the manner of placing the wing as shown on the design is the most suitable for the Kenora school and our promise of funds has been made on the distinct understanding that the new unit will be erected in the manner shown on the design submitted by Father Plourde.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVery Rev. K.

In looking over the school, I believe I may be able to make some recommendations.\n\nI was very pleased to find that the school is well kept and the buildings are in good condition.\n\nI am confident that the young people who attend this school will benefit from the improvements that have been made.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the Kenora residential school.\n\nSome months ago the Minister authorized the authorities in charge of the Kenora residential school to proceed with the erection of an addition to the school.

I will make every effort to attend the next meeting.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. Dubois\nChief Fire Department\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI made my annual inspection to the two residential schools in the agency and met the Fire Chief of Kenora, as I do annually, and enclose his report.\n\nThe school room doors have always opened the way they do now, but if you think they should be changed I will ask the Principal to have this done where possible. I do not presume it will cost much. The new addition is not yet completed, but when this is done, I will ask the Principal to let me know.\n\nArrangements for fire protection required will be reported to you. The above applies to the Kenora Roman Catholic School.\n\nAs regards the Cecilia Jeffrey School, refil is required for one Thermone Fire Extinguisher, Standard size (I believe about one gallon size.) No size is marked on it. The Fire Chief reports this can be got from a local man, but he is out of town and I cannot ascertain the cost locally.\n\nThe fire hose, 15 feet, is badly needed, to reach to the barn, i.e., badly perished, the Firemen of the Town have cut off a couple of pieces to try and put it in good shape, but it is too far gone.\n\nThe hose is all 1\u00bd inch.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 5, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRes: Kenora Indian Residential School,\nKenora Indian Agency, Electoral\nDistrict of Kenora-Rainy River, Ontario\n\nIn a memorandum dated August 9, 1939, the Minister approved of an expenditure of $2,000.00 for the construction of a staff residence at the above noted school. The Roman Catholic Church authorities were authorized by the Minister to proceed with the construction.\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Branch from Reverend P. Lemontagne, O.M.I., and Reverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I. You will note that the original amount allowed for the construction of this building has been exceeded by approximately $8,700. An inspection has not yet been made of this addition to the Kenora school, but it is my understanding that the construction is fireproof throughout. No funds are available to meet this expenditure in the current year's estimates. Consideration should be given, therefore, to the advisability of including the amount necessary to make the payment in the 1940-41 supplementary estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nPAH\nOttawa,\nDecember 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo you may request the Principal of the Kenora residential school to arrange to have the school room doors open out where possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.

Indian Residential School due, I think, to the drinking water. There were 50 cases all told, some of these had haemorrhage from the bowels as well as dysentery. The septic tank and filter bed are not functioning properly. There is a break somewhere between the syphoning chamber and the filter bed so that the sewage does not go through the filter bed, but runs direct into the lake. It has cut out a small channel between the filter bed and the edge of the lake. The intake pipe for the water supply is 125 yards off shore. I am of the opinion that some of the raw sewage finds its way into the pipe line, polluting the water, and is pumped up to the school. I have taken the precautions to have the water supply chlorinated, which is being done at present, but think that the septic tank and filter bed should be examined by a sanitary engineer. I may state that this raw sewage is being discharged into the lake one third of a mile above the intake pipes of the water supply of the town of Kenora, so that there is some danger of polluting Kenora's water supply.\n\n---\n\nExtract from Indian Agent's letter dated December 11, 1939:\n\nIn reference to the remarks re the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School:\n\nI have been to the school today with the Doctor and Doctor Moseley of the Ontario Department of Health and the Provincial Sanitary Inspector. They inspected the sewage disposal and I informed them what Mr. Rose the Engineer had said in reference to the sewage liquid coming out of the bed. No doubt you have now received Mr. Rose's report.\n\nThey seemed satisfied but have asked the Doctor and Sanitary Inspector to take some more samples of the water and send them to Fort William to be analyzed, which will be done.\n\nThe septic tank and filter bed are apparently working satisfactorily now, but we don't know if this will continue.\n\nWhen we arrived at the school they were having some trouble and pumping out the tank as it was stopped up and getting a large quantity from the laundry, being washday. However this will be attended to, apparently some paper or other material had got in the pipes.\nIn reference to your letter, dated March 12th, 1939, No. 129-1-5, regarding supplies purchased from the Kenora Company, I wish to call your attention to the fact that the prices charged by this firm are upwards of 10% higher than current retail prices.\n\nWill you please advise if competitive prices were secured from other local firms including Bergman & Nelson and J. P. Williams & Company.\n\n[Signature]\nWm.

Huey,\nDept. of Welfare & Trac\nThe disposal tile were dug up at a couple of places and it was found that about 1/8 inch of slime was collected in the bottom. The excavation holes were left open an hour or more and there seemed to be no change in water level which stayed at about half way up on the tiles. Possibly laundry water made this occasion one of the worst. However, since this bed has been in operation about eight years, it is believed all the tile should be lifted, trenched a foot below tile level and this lower section of the trench should be refilled with broken stone or coarse gravel. It is estimated that this would cost $250.00 were it done in the summer time when the school's sewage system could be shut down.\n\nThe settling tanks and siphon seemed to be functioning properly and had been cleaned during the past spring. As 16 inches of floating sludge had collected in the septic or upper settling chamber in less than six months, the Principal was advised that this tank should be cleaned out immediately and subsequently twice a year, as long as this excessive accumulation was obtained. It was found that the screen in the manhole above the septic tank had disappeared and the Principal was advised that this should be replaced. If this screen was cleaned regularly, the top scum accumulation in the septic tank would most likely be much reduced.\n\nThe present sewage disposal system was remodelled about eight years ago to provide for a total school population of 85 which has since been increased to about 100 and a further increase to 120 is contemplated. A new south wing of three-storeys has been added to the institution this year. It may be then more disposal area will be required and the nearest area is about 350 feet to the northwest. This area would be of ample size but pumping may be required as none of it is lower than the bed at present in use. However, it may be found that the school drainage can be separated for its easier use. Laundry and kitchen water might well be handled by this separate system, including a tank which could be located high enough to use the new disposal area mentioned.\n\n(sgd) J.T. Rose,\n\nWater and Power Engineer, Grade 2.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. D.B. Gow\n\nRe: Kenora Indian Residential School,\nSewage Disposal System.\n\nOn December 4th an inspection was made at the Kenora School to find out particulars of overflow from the sewage disposal field. Along the lakeside of the disposal bed, leakage liquids were trickling down through rocks and coming out on the flat sloping rock ledge 20 feet from the water's edge and extended 20 feet across the length of the bed. This leakage amounted to about one gallon per minute.\n\nIt was learned this flow ceased at times but was most noticeable on a day such as a Monday when laundry work was going on. There was partial absorption by the bed.\n\nThe break had been caused several years ago when surface drainage, following an unusual storm, had washed out a triangular section about 25 feet along the front of the bed. This was cut in about six feet back from the front and was deep enough to wash out two 25-foot lengths of tile. The break had been filled in - mostly with rocks dumped in the pit.\n\nTo complete the inspection, sufficient stone was removed to get at the tile and plug sacks into the two lines running from the centre feeder. This seemed to stop all the overflow previously seen. As it was comparatively mild and the ground had not frozen deeply, School employees undertook to try to obtain clay to fill in the hole temporarily prevent further vent of liquids at the old break. This repair work was done in the afternoon and the following morning another visit was made to determine whether leakage had appeared anywhere else but none could be found. As the bed had really been partially short circuited until the open tile were stopped up, it was requested that a report be made of any further occurrence of leakage or seepage from the bed.\n\nIt is estimated that it would cost about $25.00 to repair the break and put back into operation the outer two lines of 4\" tile in the north end of the bed. They constitute 1/3 of the total effective footage of the disposal tile. The estimate is contingent upon the work being done during the summer months. Proper consolidation, particularly in the outer bank, could not be readily assured under winter conditions.\n\nAs the second paragraph of your letter referring to this sewage plant requested an estimate of any improvements considered necessary, the system was looked into generally.\n\nD.B.

It is felt that it is especially necessary that consideration be given to the last recommendation if it is proposed to any further increase the attendance at this school in the near future.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer\nDecember 27, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: ... Residential System, Kenora Indian Residential School, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 25th ultimo with attached copy of a memorandum which you had received from the Director of Indian Affairs regarding the above, a report has now been received from Mr. Gow following an examination made at the school by Mr. Rose. A copy of the latter's report is attached.\n\nIn his covering letter Mr. Gow comments that the condition now brought to the attention of the Department by Captain Edwards, Indian Agent, has existed at this school for at least the past four years but is now much more evident on account of the prevailing low elevation of the water of Lake of the Woods.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Rose estimates it will cost about $250.00 as an emergency repair to build up the bed where leakage is occurring, but Mr. Gow is doubtful whether or not direct overflow from the bed to the lake can be completely stopped. It is noted that according to information gathered by Mr. Rose that apparently the school population has been increased over and above that provided for originally in the sewage disposal system and that there is still a further increase contemplated. It does not, therefore, appear that any more funds than absolutely necessary should be spent on this system until full future requirements are known, and then suitable provision made for same.\n\nIt appears that there is provision in the school for an unlimited use of water and, therefore, with an increase in attendance at the school, it is altogether probable that a suitably enlarged sewage disposal system will be necessary. It appears that the site of the present bed would not provide sufficient additional space and according to Mr. Rose the nearest available area is 150 feet distance. While this new area would be of ample size pumping would probably be required as none of the area is lower than the bed at present in use. Under the circumstances, two recommendations are made - first, that emergency temporary repairs to the extent of $250.00 might be made at once, but as this would only remedy a condition that has existed for some time, there would not appear to be any necessity for undertaking any such manner of repair work until after the frost has left the ground next year. Secondly, we would concur in Mr. Gow's suggestion that the Indian Affairs Branch might include in their estimates for the coming year an item of $500.00 to modernize the existing disposal bed and to provide\n\nJ.M.

A copy of Mr. Rose's report and covering memorandum is attached in which the following points are brought out:\n\n1. Conditions now prevailing at the school have existed for at least the past four years;\n\n2. That the space available for the sewage disposal is not sufficient to provide for the enlarged population of the school and any future increase;\n\n3. That under these circumstances $25 be provided for emergency repairs to be carried out as soon as the frost is out of the ground for the purpose of building up the bed where leakage is occurring;\n\n4. That the nearest available area which will provide sufficient additional space is 350 feet distant and Mr. Cow suggests that $500 should be provided to modernize the existing disposal bed and to provide for additional disposal area.\n\nThis information is forwarded now for the consideration of your Branch.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 5, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Kenora Indian Residential School,\nKenora Indian Agency, Electoral\nDistrict of Kenora-Rainy River, Ontario\n\nIn a memorandum dated August 9, 1939, the Minister approved of an expenditure of $8,000.00 for the construction of a staff residence at the above noted school.

I am, however, communicating with Mr. Desrosiers, who was Superintendent of the job, and who purchased these materials. I am asking him to forward all competitive prices that he secured. You will remember that work on this project was started towards the very end of the month of October. This made it difficult in some cases to secure competitive prices as materials had to be delivered in the shortest time possible. In all cases materials were purchased at the lowest prices obtainable. Mr. Desrosiers had been instructed by Rev.

Indian Residential school due, I think, to the drinking water. There were 50 cases all told. Some of these had Haemorrhage from the bowels as well as Dysentry. The Septic tank and Filter bed are not functioning properly. There is a break somewhere between the syphoning chamber and the filter bed so that the sewage does not go through the filter bed, but runs direct into the lake. It has cut a small channel between the filter bed and the edge of the lake. The intake pipe for the water supply is 125 yards off shore. I am of the opinion that some of the raw sewage finds its way into the pipe line, polluting the water, and is pumped up to the school. I have taken the precautions to have the water supply chlorinated, which is being done at present, but think that the Septic tank and filter bed should be examined by a Sanitary Engineer. I may state that this raw sewage is being discharged into the lake one-third of a mile above the intake pipes of the water supply of the Town of Kenora, so that there is some danger of polluting Kenora's water supply.\n\nA. D. Ferguson.\nKenora, Ont., Dec. 11, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find Doctor Ferguson's report for the month of November.\n\nIn reference to the remarks re the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential school.\n\nI have been to the school today with the doctor and Doctor Moseley of the Ontario Department of Health and the Provincial Sanitary Inspector. They inspected the Sewage disposal and I informed them what Mr. Rose the Engineer had said in reference to the sewage liquid coming out of the bed. No doubt you have now received Mr. Rose's report.\n\nThey seemed satisfied but have asked the doctor and Sanitary Inspector to take some more samples of the water and send them to Fort William to be analyzed, which will be done.\n\nThe septic tank and filter bed are apparently working satisfactorily now, but we don't know if this will continue.\n\nWhen we arrived at the school, they were having some trouble and pumping out the tank as it was stopped up and getting a large quantity from the laundry, being washday. However this will be attended to, apparently some paper or other material had got in the pipes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ont., Jan. 10th, 1940.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is a synopsis of my work among the Indians in the Kenora and Savanne Agency for the month of December, 1939.\n\nI visited both schools, saw several cases of Influenza, looked over sanitary conditions at the R.C. Indian Residential school. Owing to the recent outbreak of Dysentry at this school I think it would be well if a chlorinating machine was installed to chlorinate the water.\n\nA. D. Ferguson.\nabout $150.00, these of course would not be permanent, and could be removed in the spring, and the lumber used for other purposes, the chemical toilets could be kept at the school.

C. Indian Residential School.\n\nYesterday afternoon our Medical Officer Doctor A. D. Ferguson called at the Office with Mr. D. E. Moore, the Ontario District Sanitary Inspector for this District and asked me to go out to the school with them; unfortunately I was very busy at the time and said I could not get away just then, but I sent McKeirle, my clerk with them.\n\nOn their return they reported that the leaks were bad, and that sewage had been running down the bank and onto the ice, travelling about 150 feet from the shore, which will cause a serious situation to the town in the spring, if nothing is done.\n\nThe Doctor and Inspector suggest that outside toilets be built for the boys, about a five or six holes, and that chemical toilets be installed inside for the girls and staff.\n\nThe sewage running the ice should be scraped and all matter and ice that is discoloured should be removed and buried.\n\nThe Inspector recommended to the Principal that the chlorine contents be increased, and the Principal has promised to see this is done. I am also informed that the Doctor is arranging for the town water supply to be chlorinated a little more.\n\nThe Doctor apparently visited the school, as Medical Officer for the Town and not as Medical Officer for our Department.\n\nOn his return yesterday he promised to give me a report but today when he was in the office and I asked him if he could give me a written report, he said that I had more time to do this, and that I was Officer of Health for the Indians and not him, and that I should have gone to the school with him and made out my own report, he refused to make one out. If he had done so either as Health Officer for the Town or even as Medical Officer for us, his report would have been of considerable benefit. However as he refused, I asked Mr. Moore to give me his ideas as to what should be done, and his suggestions are as outlined above. He is making a separate report to his superiors.\n\nI may say Mr. Moore is most courteous and kind and is only too glad to co-operate and assist in any way he can.\n\nIf you consider it desirable to install the toilets as outlined above, I believe temporary ones could be used for\nSaint-Boniface December 28, 1939\n\nHonorable T.A. Crerar,\nMines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI wish to thank you for the Staff Quarters which your department has erected in connection with the Kenora Indian Residential School. This new unit, when completed, will provide fire-proof dormitories for at least part of the children. I understand that the amount expended has run over the appropriation for this purpose. Under the circumstances this could hardly be avoided. Among other things considerable rock was encountered in the basement and its removal considerably increased the original estimate.\n\nIt is to be hoped that in spite of pressing circumstances, your department will be able to provide funds necessary to complete this unit. When completed, this new addition to the Catholic Indian School of Kenora will have gone a long way towards removing the inferiority complex under which it has been operated for the past twelve or fifteen years, in fact ever since the Cecilia Jeffries School was erected. When your department is able to vote the funds to add another unit to this school it will be then on a footing of parity.\n\nPlease again accept my very sincere thanks.\n\n[signed] Emile Yelle\n\nArchbishop of St-Boniface\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJanuary 23, 1946\n\nCatholic Indian School at Kenora, Ont.\nre: Completion of new addition.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter addressed to the Minister by the Rt.

I note that the Principal has promised to increase the chlorine content in the water and every possible effort should be made by the school staff to remove the sewage from the top of the ice before the ice melts. This will mean some extra work for the school staff but cannot be avoided at the present time as our funds are so limited that it is impossible to consider expending money for the erection of outside toilets. In your letter of the 18th instant you stated that the Principal had diverted the water from the laundry and possibly this action will be of some assistance to the sewage system.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter from the Dominion Bridge Company Limited, Winnipeg, giving the information you asked for in your letter of January 11th last, regarding quantities, sizes and unit prices of reinforcing steel and joints supplied by this Company to the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nI am also forwarding along with this letter a set of plans giving all details relative to the joists and other materials supplied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\nFebruary 1st, 1940\nCOPY - to be returned to Indian Affairs when letter is signed\n\nOttawa, January 9th, 1940.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Yelle:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Your Grace's letter of December 9th, in which you discuss certain additions that have recently been constructed at the Kenora R.C. Indian residential school. It is to me gratifying to learn that the new unit appears to be very satisfactory to you and to the members of the staff.\n\nNo provision was made in the 1938-40 estimates for an expenditure at this school greater than the original amount of $6,500.00 and I was sorry to learn that actual expenditures exceeded this amount. You can readily appreciate, in view of the dissolution of Parliament, how impossible it would be for me to make any definite commitment in respect to the willingness of the incoming government or the newly elected parliament to approve and pass the additional appropriation. I can assure you, however, that the departmental officials here will be very glad to sympathetically review the claims of this school for the amount necessary to meet the entire cost of construction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend Paille Yelle,\nArchbishop-Coadjutor\nArchbishop's Residence,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI do not mention that you letter has not been delivered until now.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1940.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of January 9 with reference to accounts for building material for the Kenora M.C. Indian Residential School I communicated with the Church authorities and enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter dated January 29 received from the Dominion Bridge Company. You will note that the Company has also forwarded a set of plans giving all details relative to the joists and other materials supplied.\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nFebruary 5, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nIn further reference to your memorandum of January 10th and to our subsequent memoranda regarding the sewage disposal system at the above school, Mr. Gow suggests that the work be done in either July or August and states that if the money is available then, one of his Engineers will be able to supervise and carry on the necessary construction.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Bailey\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of January 9 with reference to accounts for building material for the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School I communicated with the Church authorities and enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter dated January 29 received from the Dominion Bridge Company. You will note that the Company has also forwarded a set of plans giving all details relative to the joists and other materials supplied.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKenora, Ont., Jan. 31st, 194\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KENORA AGENCY FOR JANUARY\n\nDr. Ferguson and Mr. D. Moore, Provincial Sanitary Inspector report a serious situation at the Kenora, R.C. Residential school, owing to the sewage disposal bed leaking and the sewage running down the front of the bed and out on the ice.\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\nCaptain F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDue to frequent discharging of the sewage effluent from the septic tank directly into the bay from which the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School obtain their water supply, it is considered absolutely necessary that this water supply be chlorinated.\n\nFrom the standpoint of economy, and considering the fact that this will only be a temporary system, a barrel chlorinator is suggested. This apparatus consists of an oak barrel fitted in series to the present water system, a small length of piping and two valves. The total expenditure would be less than ten dollars ($10.00).\n\nThe present method of adding a little of the pail is considered inadequate.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nD. E. Moore,\nProvincial Sanitary Inspector.\nKenora, Ontario.\nFebruary 6th, 1940\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Provincial Sanitary Inspector re Chlorination of the water at the Kenora R.O. Residential School, which explains itself.\n\nI have made enquiries and find that I can procure a 30 gal. Vinegar barrel for around $5.00 and according to the Inspector, the total expenditure would be less than $19.00 not including cost of barrel.\n\nThe Engineer at the school would be able to put it together with the assistance of the Sanitary Inspector, who has kindly offered to see it installed without cost.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 10, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, you may expend an amount of approximately $15.00 in connection with the chlorination of the water at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I may say in this connection that the $275 was made up of two parts - $25 for immediate work and $250 for reconditioning the existing disposal bed.

No doubt some of this sewage finds its way under the ice as raw sewage does not freeze readily. The ice for a distance of 75 feet from the shore is discoloured brown, the tank flushes twice a day, two streams about what would pass through a four inch tile in less than half an hour. The upright of the pipe line for the school water supply is about 130 yards from the shore upstream from the condition described above so that I do not think there is very much danger of polluting their own water supply providing the pipe line is intact. I am enclosing an analysis of the water supply from the Provincial Department of Health at Ft. William, which speaks for itself.\n\nUnder instructions they are boiling the water at the school at present. I checked on the school staff re: Typhoid Fever, and there is no person there who has had it so that eliminates the danger of a carrier.\n\nDown stream from where the sewage is running onto the ice the school have taken out their ice supply for the coming winter. A distance of about 100 yards from where the sewage discharges on to the ice. The Cameron Camps are situated about 200 yards from the town. There was another pipe line built by the city for toilet waste. The Kenora intake pipes for their water supply go within about 100 yards to a half a mile of the sewage, but the current is not direct. Two weeks during the spring and at the time break-up of the ice there will be freezing conditions of this discharge so that there will be intermittent flow. The dilution is fairly weak and the water supply of the Town of Kenora is heavily chlorinated. Cameron Camps use the Town of Kenora water supply, but there is considerable bathing and fishing near the shore around these camps. It is impossible to take a permanent job of the sewage system during the winter, but I feel that if an epidemic should arise this spring from the water supply in the Town of Kenora it would be a black eye for the tourist business in this part of the country.\n\nI suggested to the Father at the School and Capt. H., the Indian Agent, that chemical toilets be installed in the house or the barn, however, I believe that the boys at the school will be able to get by without them.

There were nine Indians admitted to the hospital during the month and their complaints are as follows:\n\nOne Scrofula and T.B. Abscess in the Lumbar region, one Hydrocele of the Testicle, one Septic Malignant sore throat, one Dysentry with Haemorrhage and Malnutrition, one confinement and new born baby, one acute Intestinal Indigestion with vomiting, one Chronic Rheumatism and Valvular heart disease, one Venilary and arterio-sclerosis; the latter died and the others were dismissed from the hospital, some improved and some cured.\n\nI made a trip to the Whitefish Bay Band of Indians and visited practically all the homes on the Reserve.

I prescribed for their different ailments and forwarded medicine on my return to Kenora.\n\nThere were the usual number of office calls, the chief complaints were Influenza, Bronchitis, sore throats and Pleurisy. I also extracted teeth for a number of Indians in my office and treated some minor wounds.\n\nI visited the R.C. Indian Residential School and extracted 30 teeth which were in various degrees of decay. I visited the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School several times where they had several cases of Septic sore throats and Influenza.\n\nI made a visit to the R.C. Indian Residential School to investigate some cases of Dysentry and the condition of the Septic Tank which I feel is responsible for the cases of Dysentry we had in this school during the late fall and early winter. The disposal field of the system is out of order due to some breakage or misplacement of the main tile line coming from the syphoning chamber of the septic tank with the result that the raw sewage instead of going through the disposal field where the bacterial action is created, was a direct line over the stone wall, which was filled...\nKenora, Ontario,\n12th February, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nEnclosed please find Doctor Ferguson's report for the month of January.\n\nRe sewage disposal troubles at the Kenora R.C.

He checked the staff re typhoid fever and there is no carrier known.\n\nThe danger seems to be to the Town of Kenora and other places than the school itself from water pollution, and we may have trouble in the spring.\n\nThe Doctor was informed the Department could not supply toilets as recommended by him, owing to the state of our finances at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6198)\n\nFile 465-5, part 4\nKenora Agency - St. Mary's R.C.

Ferguson, had recently visited the school and reported that the leaks in the system were bad and that sewage had been running down the bank and onto the ice, travelling about 130 feet from the shore, which Dr. Ferguson considered would cause a serious situation to the Town of Kenora in the spring if nothing is done. To overcome the difficulty Dr. Ferguson suggested the erection of outside toilets and that the septic tank system at the school be closed down until spring when it can be repaired.\n\nIn reply this Branch informed Indian Agent Edwards that we were not prepared to erect outside toilets at this school.\n\nI am today in receipt of another letter from Indian Agent Edwards, copy of which is enclosed. I also attach extract from letter dated February 18, 1940, from Dr. A.D. Ferguson.\nToronto, February 26, 1940.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRecently, there has been some difficulty experienced in the disposal of the sewage from the above school. I understand that this is normally taken care of by a septic tank and a tile bed which has been constructed rather close to the river's edge. During the present winter the tile bed ceased to function, and the sewage was discharged directly into the river. Not only does this involve the water supply for your own school, which, I understand, is taken from the lake, but it also tends to pollute the lake from which the Town of Kenora derives its municipal supply.\n\nIt is difficult to reconstruct a bed of this kind during the winter time, but we should like to know what plans you have for taking care of this as soon as weather permits. It has been suggested by a representative of this Department, who visits that territory, that it would be better to move this bed from its present location entirely, and place it on the larger area to the north of the present location. The tanks could still be used, although it might be necessary to pump the sewage.\n\nI should be glad if you would advise us as to what plans you have in mind for taking care of this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector,\nSanitary Engineering Division.\nFebruary 27th, 1940.\n\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nKenora, Ontario,\n\"New Construction\"\n\nDominion Government of Canada,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have been referring our account in connection with the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Kenora to the Rev.

It is approximately four months since these books were delivered and I have not received payment. On Feb. 7, 1910, I received a letter from the Supervisor of Education saying that the amount owed has been paid by your department. Please look into this matter and I trust that settlement will follow immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. M. Walberg.\nI can see no particular reason, outside of expense, why outside toilets cannot be provided temporarily\u2014they have been in use for years at the Fort Frances Indian School. They can be erected at small cost.\n\nIn the meantime the Indian Agent at Kenora should be instructed to see that the Principal of the School has the septic tank properly cleaned out immediately and that this cleaning out should be done frequently. There would appear to be no necessity for closing down the septic tank and it is impossible to do so without closing down the institution entirely. The Ontario Department of Health refused us permission to pass laundry wastes directly to the lake and accordingly they had to be passed through the tank and no other solution is possible under the existing conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) D.B. Cow\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your telegram of February 23rd and also your letter of the same date enclosing correspondence relating to the R.C. Indian School near Kenora, Ontario.\n\nUnder date of December 18th last we forwarded to you a report on the situation at the R.C. Indian School near Kenora, following an examination by Mr. J.F. Rose of this office. It is not considered necessary that any further inspection be made at this time as conditions at the school were fully covered by Mr. Rose in his memorandum of that date.\n\nReferring to Dr. A.D. Ferguson's letter of February 18th, I believe he is misinformed in stating that the disposal field is out of order due to breakage or displacement of the main tile line leading from the siphon chamber of the septic tank and that raw sewage takes a direct line to the lake shore and then on to the ice. He is also incorrect in stating that the greatest bacterial action takes place in the disposal bed - the bacterial action takes place in the septic tank. The discharge line from tank to disposal bed is intact and raw sewage is not discharged to the lake.\n\nThe trouble at this school is that all water used at the Institution passes through the septic tank. It is now overloaded as is also the disposal bed so that some discharge passes to the lake and on wash-days undoubtedly there is a considerable flow from the disposal bed due to its partial failure. Frequent cleaning out of the septic tank is necessary to prevent the building up of the same by solids and if this cleaning out has been carried out properly from time to time there should be no passage of solids from the tank. Cleaning of the tank is not pleasant and consequently is very seldom carried out.\n\nThe water intake was laid three years ago by this Bureau and extends about 600 feet out from the present shore line. It was properly laid out to clear water. The water of Lake of the Woods is badly polluted from Fort Frances and International Falls where no treatment of the sewage is carried out. Under winter conditions this pollution is carried into Lake of the Woods and any outbreak of typhoid fever that may occur at Kenora can quite properly be blamed on this pollution rather than on the very light pollution that takes place from the Indian School. However, the situation at the R.C. Indian School is objectionable and should be cleaned up. I understand money will be provided for this purpose this year and later on this office will forward proposals for remodelling the sewage disposal system.\n\nT.G.

This tank is overloaded and the frequent cleaning out necessary, as a result, is not done often enough.\n\nMr. Gow's report of February 26th, attached herewith, gives details of the conditions, and the last two paragraphs indicate what should be done at the present time.\n\nIf you will kindly advise me what funds will be available, we will prepare plans covering the remodelling of the sewage disposal system.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMarch 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo the Surveys & Engineering Branch was requested to review the reports that they had received regarding what action could be taken in connection with the sewage system at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nThe only remedial action that can be taken at the present time is to close down the septic tank and immediately erect as an emergency the required number of outside toilets. You may, therefore, arrange for the erection of these toilets keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nThe septic tank should be properly cleaned out and repaired.

You will note that your letter of November 28 stated that the overexpenditure was $2700.00 whereas the accounts I have on file and unpaid only amount to $1446.34. Have you any additional accounts in connection with the actual expenditure that has been made at this school that you have not yet forwarded to me? If so, I should appreciate your sending them immediately as there is a possibility that we can secure funds from the unexpended amount provided for the Alberni School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware the new unit of St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ont. remains incomplete, work having been stopped last November due to lack of funds. Among the items necessary to complete the building is a new boiler which would cost $1447, less 5%. If funds are available, would it be possible to purchase this boiler before the end of the present fiscal year. In this manner the amount which, I was informed, was placed in the 1940-41 estimates, would be ample to complete the unit.\n\nThe above is submitted only as a suggestion but we will appreciate it very much if it is favourably considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant the Department will allow an expenditure of $18.12 in connection with the chlorinator at the Kenora Indian Residential School. It is noted that your letter of the 12th instant should have stated that this work was required at the Kenora School instead of at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the new boiler required at the Kenora Indian Residential School. Owing to the fact that our appropriation has been completely assigned I regret that it is impossible to consider purchase of this boiler at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey\n\nWe beg to submit a further report on the New Unit which was erected last Fall to St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ont.\n\nOn November 28th., we wrote you regarding this matter and stated that the over expenditure on this project would be $2,700.00.\n\nWe were unable to keep to this figure and the statement which we are now presenting will show a larger over expenditure than the one anticipated when we wrote you in the latter part of November.\n\nPay rolls from no. 1 to 8 inclusively have already been submitted.\n\nWe are now enclosing pay rolls no. 9, 10 and 11.\n\nPay Roll no. 9 - Nov. 24th. 1939 - $327.16\nPay Roll no. 10 - Dec. 1st. 1939 - $272.24\nPay Roll no. 11 - Dec. 8th. 1939 - $39.25\nWINNIPEG, March 30th, 1940\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nAttention Mr. Ph. Phelan:\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 28th instant re the new unit of the Kenora Indian Res. School. You should have on file my letter of January 25; but in case it has been misplaced, I am enclosing a copy along with this letter. At that time I forwarded with the letter, as you will see, three payrolls and invoices from 12 supply houses from which materials were purchased for this new unit. The payrolls and the amount represented by these purchases total $2,739.17. I have kept copies of all the above invoices and can secure other copies for your file if the originals which I forwarded on January 26th have not reached you.\n\nIncluding purchases in my report of January 25, the total amount expended on Kenora would seem to be $12,177.84. Not having on hand statements from the various firms that supplied materials for this unit, it is impossible for me to arrive at an absolutely definite balance. But I am confident that the above sum of $12,177.84 is close enough for your purpose. It would therefore seem that the amount of $8000.00 which was originally provided was over expended by $4,177.84.\n\nHoping that the above information will be found in order, I remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H. C. [Signature]\nWith reference to the account from the Toupin Lumber Company it will be necessary to have a receipt from Moore's Taxi to the Toupin Lumber Company. Apparently this lumber was shipped by truck.\n\nWould it be possible to secure more detailed information on the attached two accounts from the Dominion Bridge Company? I feel certain that as prepared at present we could not have them passed. You will also note that the account dated November 23 should be certified by Father Lamontagne.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give immediate attention to the contents of this letter and have the freight receipts etc. returned to me at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 1, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo and on looking around we discovered your letter of January 25 with the vouchers attached. I am not yet certain that we will be able to secure the funds from the appropriation for 1939-40 but I am very hopeful to this effect. Consequently the vouchers attached to your letter of January 25 have been very carefully checked this morning and in order to complete them and have them in proper line for payment the following receipts are required:\n\n1. Ashdown Hardware Company account No. 88347 dated November 16, 1939, reading -- \"Prepaid freight on mdse. shipped 27/10/39\" .......... $23.71\n\n2. Ashdown Hardware Company account No. 88348 dated November 16, 1939, reading -- \"Prepaid freight on mdse. shipped 30/10/39\" .......... .25\n\n3. Victor Decloux account No. 1331 dated November 15, 1939, includes an item for freight of ........................................... .69\n\n4. Account dated November 19, 1939, from Toupin Lumber & Fuel Company, St. Boniface, reading \"Freight on lumber shipped as per Moore's Taxi\" .................................................. 10.82\n\nIn the case of the first three above mentioned it will be necessary to have receipts from the railway company. As you are aware these are required for audit purposes before we can pay them.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nReplying to your letter #129-1-5 of 19th instant enclosing report from the District Chief Engineer of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Winnipeg, dated the 26th Feb.\n\nI have handed the Principal of the Kenora R. C. Indian Residential School one copy of the report, and he thinks it will not be necessary now to install the outside toilets as he has diverted the laundry water from the school to the North so that it does not go through the septic tank, and although this water for the present is going over the surface of the ground, it will not do any harm, and when the frost is out of the ground no doubt the whole system will be put in proper shape by the Engineering branch.\n\nAs regards the leakage onto the ice, nothing can be done about this as there are no solids that came out, the liquid has stained the ice, and seeped into it, so that it is discoloured, to remove this all the ice would have to be cut away, and they have no facilities for this work, and if outside men were used it would be a very expensive proposition.\n\nThe septic tank is working satisfactory at the present time, owing to the diversion of the laundry water and is cleaned out twice a year in the spring and fall.\n\nThe Engineer's report says \"There would appear to be no necessity for closing down the septic tank and it is impossible to do so without closing down the institution\" but the Departmental letter says \"The only remedial action that can be taken at the present time is to close down the septic tank and erect as an emergency the required number of outside toilets.\" The two recommendations contradict themselves.\n\nPlease let me hear from you again as to whether we should erect the toilets or not in view of the Principal's statements, I think we could save money by not erecting any, and have the Engineering Branch do what is necessary as soon as the frost is out of the ground, so as to put the whole system into good working shape.\n\nThe main difficulty now is to see that the pollution of the water does not do any damage to the Town of Kenora water supply and also the residents living near the school.\n\nAwaiting your early reply,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Reverend Father Lemire, Principal  \n**ADDRESS:** Kenora, R.C.

The Minister was not prepared to approve of this, particularly so in view of the difficulty that he had before with Treasury Board in getting through the transfers from the same vote for the over-expenditures incurred at Sandy Bay and Cross Lake. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Indian Affairs Branch to make some provision out of this year's funds, if that is possible, to cover such additional expenditures at Kenora as the Branch considers it should assume.\n\nI am sending a copy of this memorandum to Dr. McGill.\n\nCate Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEncl.\n\nDR.

School.\n\nMr. D. Moore Ontario District Sanitary Inspector visited the school today and suggests we put up a couple of outside toilets for boys. I wrote him a letter in view of the action he took and stated that it would probably be a good idea to have the toilets, but that if we did, it would be a certain amount of protection.\n\nI informed him I was awaiting a reply to my letter from Ottawa.\n\nMr. J. B. Gow District Chief Engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch called in today after visiting both the Cecilia Jeffrey and the Kenora R.C. Schools.\n\nHe informed me that he did not think it necessary to have outside toilets at the Kenora R.C. School. He also mentioned he intended asking $150.00 to make some improvements in the sewage disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. The pipe should be laid between the two lines of trees and placed so as to fit, and not to be disturbed too much for repair.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs & Northern Development,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nApril 10, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe - Sewage Disposal, Kenora Indian Residential School\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 6th instant, and enclosure, regarding this matter it is understood here from Mr. Gow's report dated February 26th last, that although the disposal system is inadequate to handle the total flow in all cases, it is only occasionally, such as on wash days, that trouble would ensue, if the septic tank were cleaned out frequently. According to the Agent's letter the tank is cleaned out only twice a year and the wash water is not diverted before reaching the septic tank which is contrary to instructions issued by the Ontario Department of Health.\n\nRegarding the fifth paragraph of the letter from Indian Agent Edwards, a careful perusal of Mr. Gow's report would show that although he did state there was no necessity for closing down the septic tank (if it were cleaned out frequently) and that such action would necessitate closing the school, in the preceding paragraph he suggested the erection of outside toilets which would enable the school to operate even with the septic tank closed down.\n\nIt would appear that the recommendations made by our engineer have not been followed in that (a) the septic tank is not cleaned out frequently, (b) the outside toilets have not been erected and (c) the wash water is not being passed through the septic tank.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nApril 15th, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal system,\nKenora Indian Residential School.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 2nd instant, attached hereto is a copy of a memorandum from our Chief Engineer, dated April 10th, commenting on the letter of March 28th from your Indian Agent, Mr. Frank Edwards.\n\nYou will note that the septic tank should be cleaned out more frequently than twice a year.\n\nOur engineers are deciding just what can be done to the best advantage with the amount of $525.00 that will be available in the present fiscal year.\n\nDirector.\nDr. McGill,\n\nFor your information, we will keep you advised as to the report of the District Sanitary Engineer in regard to laundry and kitchen waste being drained directly to the lake, also in regard to the effectiveness of the present disposal bed under such circumstances.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe - Sewage Disposal, Kenora Indian Residential School\n\nIn further reference to our memorandum of the 10th instant, Mr. Gow has reported under date of the 15th instant that he visited the school on the 8th and 9th instant and was informed that the outside toilets had not been built as the Board of Directors of the school had obtained approval from the Medical Health Officer to discharge laundry and kitchen waste into the lake without passing them through the septic tank. This can be considered only as a temporary expedient as the discharge is along a slight depression and creates an unsightly nuisance in front of the school. He is going to interview the District Sanitary Engineer and try to obtain authority to divert all laundry and kitchen waste permanently to the existing siphon drain. The estimated cost of this drain is $600.00 and alterations to the plumbing in the building will cost an additional $100.00. The total cost of this and re-conditioning the disposal bed will be $1,000.00 instead of the $225.00 which has been provided.\n\nMr. Gow is being asked if, with the proposed diversion of laundry and kitchen waste, the present disposal bed will be adequate when the new wing, now under construction, is completed.\n\nIn a report prepared by Mr. Gow in 1931 it was pointed out that the school building had been so located that only one small area was available for use as a disposal bed. This appears to have been developed to the fullest extent and if it is found necessary to construct other disposal beds, the effluent from the siphon chamber will have to be pumped.\n\nAny further information received in this connection will be forwarded to you promptly.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

The accounts on our file total $115.80 but the Company has written to us on several occasions in connection with the delay in payment and in each case only request $97.20. I am under the impression that the difference is due to the fact that two gasoline barrels have been returned and presumably the Company issued a credit note for $18.00. Please obtain and forward this credit note to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A.

However, you may be assured that as soon as funds are available a cheque will be issued to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nImperial Oil Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to call your attention to the heating plant of the Kenora Indian Residential School. For several years past, complaints were registered every year regarding the size of the boiler.\n\nThe northern section of the school was never properly heated due to this cause. The building of the new staff unit has not improved matters.\n\nI know that you have not provided anything for this in this year's estimate, but could not the amount necessary for this purpose be taken out the vote for emergency repairs?\n\nI leave this to your kind consideration knowing that you will meet our wishes, if it can at all be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to call your attention in a special manner to the new wing-unit which was erected last fall to the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen this new unit was first contemplated, the school authorities had in view the replacement of the old staff building, which had recently been destroyed by fire. But since its erection it has been thought feasible to use it as dormitory accommodation for the school children instead of staff quarters. The staff are all adult persons and can more easily save themselves in case of fire; besides they are willing to sacrifice their own comfort in order to provide fireproof dormitory accommodation for the children.\n\nUnfortunately the funds provided last year were only sufficient to erect the walls and roof in the new unit; nothing whatever was done to finish the inside of the building. There are no finished floors, no electric light, no heating and no toilets; the walls themselves are not even plastered.\n\nCould you suggest a method whereby this new unit could be completed this year, so that it could be used for dormitory purposes? Very Reverend Father Lamontagne, Provincial, is willing to supply all the labour, free of charge, in connection with the plumbing, heating and electric wiring.\n\nAs these are three of the principal items of expense the department might be able to find a method, whereby sufficient funds could be allotted to this project to complete it by next September.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your serious and early consideration, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 17 inst., regarding unpaid accounts in connection with the erection of the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School. I have not here with me the full list of accounts, but judging from memory I think that the list which you have submitted is in order and includes all amounts due to date.\n\nI wish to thank you very sincerely for including in this year's estimates an amount sufficient to pay these accounts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa,\nMay 31, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant regarding the new addition erected last fall to the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nI note from your letter that this addition is still incomplete but do not mention what amount would be required to finish it. Owing to conditions at present confronting us I can hold out no hope that funds can be provided in the current year's appropriation if the expenditure required is more than the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school. However, you might let me have a detailed statement regarding the amount that you consider would be necessary to place the addition in proper condition.\n\nEven though the addition is incomplete I feel that it would be advisable to use it for dormitories for the children. If this were done it would relieve the anxiety of all persons concerned in the school as it would ensure the pupils sleeping in fireproof dormitories.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.

This memorandum, which included a recommendation that materials required should be purchased by the Church authorities who were in charge of the work, was approved. Another memorandum dated December 5, 1939, was submitted to the Deputy Minister and pointed out that the original amount provided was insufficient to complete the building. In replying to this memorandum on January 4, 1939, Mr. Jackson directed that the matter be again considered when the supplementary estimates were being prepared.\n\nVote 196, 1940-41 estimates, included an item of $4800.00 to pay outstanding accounts in connection with the erection of the addition to this school.

Our engineer recommends for this job the Spencer Boiler, no. 48-15B. Crane Limited quoted on this boiler, and if I remember well, their quotation was forwarded to you. Marshall-Wells also quoted on this boiler, but their price is exactly that of Crane's. This may come from the fact that Spencer boilers are priced at the factory and our firms quoting on them must strictly adhere to the price set by the manufacturers.\n\nAs we consider this improvement a very necessary one, I hope that the Department will be able to provide the funds necessary for that purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

This makes a total expenditure to date of $18,188.00.\n\nThe Church authorities have advised us that the new fireproof unit is 34' in width and 64' in height. In erecting it there was some delay occasioned by a rock ledge which was uncovered at the east end of the structure. Considerable rock cutting had to be undertaken which added to the originally estimated cost.\n\nI may add that I have been informed by the Surveys & Engineering Branch that they have no official in Winnipeg who could make a valuation of the new wing at the Kenora School.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 5, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Hunter:\n\nLast year your Department kindly arranged to have Mr. Parkinson, your Architect in Winnipeg, visit the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School in Manitoba, in order to examine the new wing and advise this Department if the amount expended by the church authorities was reasonable.\n\nRecently, a new wing was added to the Kenora Roman Catholic Indian Residential School. This was also built under the direction of the church authorities. Accounts have been submitted for expenditures amounting to $8,629.83 for materials and $3,553.12 for labour. This makes a total expenditure to date of $12,182.95. We are advised that this wing is fireproof, 64 feet long and 35 feet wide. In erecting it there was some delay occasioned by a rock ledge which was uncovered at the east end of the structure.

No part of this amount has as yet been paid.\n\nIt is my understanding that this account is to be paid through the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. I am not positive whether a payment is supposed to be made directly from the Government Department or through the religious order which operates St. Mary's Indian School after they have received the necessary funds from the Department. However, we have been informed that an appropriation to cover this account and other accounts arising out of the extension built to the School was to be passed at this present session of the House of Commons and we would appreciate it very greatly if you could advise us as to whether or not such an appropriation has been made or will be made in the near future.\n\nI am not, of course, intending to bring pressure to bear to effect payment of this account but it has been outstanding for such a length of time that any definite information as to an appropriation or as to funds being made available would be very welcome news just at this time.\n\nTrusting that you and your family are all well, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.

The account which you forwarded does not distinguish between the two schools and, as a result, it is impossible for us to arrive at the amount mentioned on your account.\n\nOur records indicate that the only balance due you is an amount of $495.00 covering the cost of 150 bbls. of cement supplied on September 27 for the Kenora School. It is hoped to make payment of this amount in the very near future.\n\nHowever, if you will kindly forward the two accounts, as requested above, the whole matter will be rechecked.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJos.

Joyal & Sons, Inc., Agathe, Ont., it has been found that this covers materials supplied both to the Sandy Bay and Kenora Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe costs of these buildings were paid from different appropriations, and before we can arrive at the balance due the firm, it will be necessary to have two accounts\u2014one covering the cost of the materials supplied to Kenora and the other for the materials supplied to Sandy Bay.\n\nI have therefore directed the departmental officials to communicate direct with the firm and request them to supply the two accounts.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nK.

Agathe, Man.\n\nThe account covers materials stated to have been supplied for the construction of both the Sandy Bay and Kenora Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe Sandy Bay School was completed in the fiscal year 1939-40 and all accounts in connection with it were handled by the Surveys and Engineering Branch. There are still some accounts unpaid in connection with the erection of the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School. Payment of these cannot be made until we receive the report of the Public Works Architect.\n\nBefore the amount due Jos. Joyal & Sons can receive consideration, it will be necessary for us to have two separate accounts - one covering the cost of the materials supplied to Sandy Bay and the other for the materials supplied to Kenora. Jos. Joyal & Sons are being advised to this effect and as soon as the two accounts are received the matter will be carefully reviewed.\n\nI enclose draft letter for The Honourable Senator Beaubien.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 19, 1940.\n\nDear Senator Beaubien:\n\nWith reference to the account of Jos.

Please ask Mr. Gow to undertake the work as soon as possible.\n\nIn regard to the repair of the old sewage disposal bed, this was discussed with Dr. McGill yesterday and he expects that the amount required, approximately $300.00, including engineering expenses, can be found from some appropriate vote of his Branch. The funds consequently will be made available to us as soon as possible and in the meantime, Mr. Gow should make the necessary arrangements to undertake the work.\n\nNo doubt Mr. Gow will send you a report in regard to his survey of the sewage disposal bed as soon as it is completed.\n\nDirector.\n| Date     | Invoice number | Particulars                          | Debit   | Credit   | When Paid |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|\n| Sept. 3  | 588/9867       | To ear GP #132340 Lumber             | 559.22  |          | Cr.

The last time I visited this school was in 1938. Since that time a new principal has been appointed - Reverend J. Lemire, O.M.I. He has certainly cleaned the whole building and made several minor improvements, as a result of which the old part of the school presents a very pleasing appearance. He has also made extensive improvements to the grounds around the school and it is no one of the show places on the Lake.\n\nThe new wing is a very substantial building but, as you are aware, is incomplete. If plumbing facilities were provided it could be used for dormitory purposes and if funds can be secured for this purpose I think the plumbing should be installed. It could be heated temporarily by stoves, but, of course, a new heating system will eventually be required. This system should be sufficiently large to heat both the old part of the building and the new wing. The heating system at present in use is very old and would have to be replaced in the near future, even though the new wing had not been built.\n**TRAVELLING EXPENSES**\n\n(For instructions, see reverse side)\n\n**Public Works**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**CLAIMANT**: E.

Will you kindly have this Department reimbursed the amount mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.

B. Hunter,\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nDr. Charles Camsell,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe Contractor evidently for reasons of cost, failed to perform this essential part of the work, and as reported by Father Lamire the Contractor figured the cost of a tile drain below basement floor to the East wall at $500.00.\n\nRegarding the roofing which may be of good quality and well laid, but the gravel is abominable, some pieces being 2 inches in diameter and the roof only partly covered.\n\nThe flashing is passable but appears senseless over the boiler room, where two window sills are set right on the dead level roofing and cannot possibly be watertight.\n\nReferring to the cost of work to date, $12,182.95, I have carefully checked this over and find the amount very reasonable, I believe the Contractor took advantage of cheap Winter labour; checking back on a cubic foot basis, the rate is 15\u00a2 per foot.\n\nI have roughly estimated the cost of completion which should approximate these figures:\n\n- Plumbing and heating: $6,000.00\n- Electrical work and fixtures: $500.00\n- Plaster: $1,500.00\n- Woodwork: $1,100.00\n- Flooring: $900.00\n- Stairs: $300.00\n- Painting: $750.00\n- Fire doors: $400.00\n- Tile drain: $500.00\n\nTotal: $12,150.00\n\nor about 15\u00a2 per cubic foot of building, giving a total cost of 30\u00a2 per cubic foot, which is quite reasonable for a fireproof (exception of windows) building.\n\nThe building is located on the edge of the Lake of the Woods and materials may be transported by road or water, preferably the latter.\n\nEnclosed is my personal expense account.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) E. Parkinson,\nDistrict Resident Architect.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo. C. D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nMaintenance Office, D.P.W.,\nOttawa, Ontario. Winnipeg, July 29th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe- Roman Catholic Indian School,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nReplying to your letter of July 12th re the above school, enclosed are two sets of prints from measurements, two photos and the following report.\n\nThe building extension is 60 feet long by 34 feet wide, and 9'10\" by 37'6\", two storeys and basement, with an additional boiler room 20 feet by 34 feet one storey.\n\nThe exterior walls above basement are of old and new common brick as indicated on prints and clearly shown on photos, exterior walls are of 8 inch brick backed up with 4 inch hollow tile.\n\nFloors over basement and all floors in stair hall are 5-1/2\" solid reinforced concrete, other floors and roof are 2-1/2\" concrete on metal lath and 18\" built up light steel joists 23 inch centres.\n\nWindows are 1-3/8\" sliding sash without weights and all doors where indicated are 5 panel common fir doors, the doors between old and new building are intended to be changed for fireproof doors.\n\nIn a general survey of the construction, I consider much of it is very satisfactory, particularly referring to the brick and tile walls, also the concrete floors and concrete to roofs. The basement walls are not yet furred with hollow tile and much of the concrete is roughly poured.\n\nUnder the boiler room floor are three lines of glazed drain pipe which should be of iron.\n\nThere has been no proper supervision of related sections, viz no sleeves are installed in any part of the building for plumbing pipes, heating or water pipe or electrical conduit; this will entail much unnecessary drilling of concrete and brick work.\n\nOne unfortunate feature is the seepage of water to East wall of basement; part of the basement wall is built directly on rock several inches above the floor level, this part of the basement will be permanently useless unless a rock channel is cut below basement floor level for a distance of 44 feet.\napproval was given by your Branch for the change in the plans of the building the Minister is not prepared to recommend that the Department should contribute any further funds than were provided in the current year's Estimates and that this should only be paid when the building is completed.\n\nAlso enclosed herewith is another letter from the Deputy Minister of Public Works dated August 28th asking that his Department should be reimbursed for the expenses of making the report. Will you please arrange to have this paid as soon as possible.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, August 27, 1940.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter from the Deputy Minister of Public Works to which is attached report from the District Resident Architect at Winnipeg with plan attached covering the inspection made of the addition being built to the Indian Residential School at Kenora. The report was held here in order that it might be shown to the Minister before being forwarded to you for attention.\n\nYou will notice that a building two storeys high with a basement has been constructed whereas in your memorandum of the 9th August 1939 approval was given to the construction of a one-storey building and basement at a cost not exceeding $8,000. You will also observe from the report of the District Resident Architect that it will cost approximately $12,150 to complete, although approximately the same sum has been spent on the building to date. The Minister would like to know if any authority was given to the Church to increase the size of the building over that authorized.\n\nThe question of the over-expenditure was brought to the Minister's attention by His Grace Archbishop Yelle on the 28th December last but it was not suggested in this letter that the amount would be anything like the amount mentioned in the architect's report. You will recall that the Minister authorized an item of $4,000 being included in this year's Estimates to cover the additional amount that might be required to complete the building and make it ready for occupation. If no\nIncidentally I may mention that it is the Department's desire that the new addition be used for dormitory purposes only.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 13, 1940.\n\nDear Father Flourde:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a report submitted by Mr. K. Parkinson, District Resident Engineer, Department of Public Works, Winnipeg, regarding the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential school. The original understanding was that a building consisting of one floor and a basement would be constructed. Mr. Parkinson, in his report, refers to the fact that a basement and two floors were built.\n\nYou will also note that Mr. Parkinson estimates the cost of completing the building at $12,150.00.\n\nAs you are aware there are accounts still outstanding in connection with the erection of this addition to an amount of approximately $3,400.00. If these were paid the total expenditure by the Department would be approximately $15,600.00 and, as mentioned above, Mr. Parkinson's report states that a similar amount is required to complete the building. This means that the building originally estimated to cost $8,000.00 will in the end cost nearly $14,000.00.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the situation that has arisen at Kenora and I am directed to inform you that the Department cannot see its way clear at the present time to paying the outstanding accounts unless some definite assurance is received that the building will be placed in a habitable condition.\n\nRev. J. O. Flourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of August 27 regarding the addition erected to the Kenora Indian Residential School I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of September 13 which has been forwarded to Rev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nDirector.\nKenora, Ontario.\n11th September, 1940\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI shall be glad to know if the Department authorizes night watchmen at the two Residential Schools in this Agency this winter, the same as in the past, and if so, what dates they may commence their duties, and how long they may be kept on, also the rate allowed.\n\nThe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey wishes to know if he may deduct tax from accounts for materials etc., got for the School, whether paid for by the School authorities or the Department, as he considers this a Government institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant the Department is prepared to allow the following grants toward the cost of night watchmen:\n\nKenora Indian Residential School\nOctober 1, 1940, to April 30, 1941 - $40.00 a month\n\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\nOctober 1, 1940, to April 30, 1941 - $50.00 a month\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nAs regards the amount of $8,000.00 for which we consider the work can be completed it is felt that the Department should allow us any amount remaining out of the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for the Kenora School when the outstanding accounts amounting to approximately $3,400.00 are paid.\n\nAs regards the balance of the $8,000.00 we would be willing to accept the Department's assurance that this would be provided in the appropriation for 1941-42 or we would be willing to accept part of it in 1941-42 and the balance in 1942-43.\n\nI sincerely trust that the Minister will find it possible to favourably consider the proposal made above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMr. C. W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWinnipeg, September 14, 1940\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, with reference to the addition erected at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nWhile it is true that the addition is larger than was originally intended I feel that such action was justified due to the fact that the present building is by no means fireproof and the addition which was erected is absolutely necessary to provide fireproof dormitory accommodation for the pupils enrolled at this school.\n\nMay I be permitted, in this connection, to call your attention to the following paragraph of Mr. Parkinson's report, copy of which Mr. Hoey forwarded to me:\n\n\"Referring to the cost of work to date, $12,188.95, I have carefully checked this over and find the amount very reasonable. I believe the contractor took advantage of cheap winter labour; checking back on a cubic foot basis, the rate is 15\u00a2 per foot.\"\n\nMr. Parkinson estimates that in order to make the building habitable a further expenditure of $18,000.00 would be required.\n\nThe Oblate Order is prepared to finance the proper completing of the building immediately. We estimate that we can handle it for $8,000.00 and are prepared to give a definite assurance to the Department that if the expenditure for plumbing and heating, electrical work and fixtures, plaster, woodwork, flooring, stairs, painting, fire doors and tile drain exceeds this amount the Oblate Order will pay from its own funds the excess amount over $5,000.00.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W.

Father Lamontagne and Father Plourde called at the office and discussed the matter with me at some length. I made it quite clear to them that the Minister had only approved of an expenditure of $8,000 on the building and that when the approval was first obtained the building was not to cost more than this sum. I explained, however, when we were advised last Fall that the cost had been exceeded, an additional $4,000 was provided in this year's estimates and that this was the only sum now available to pay the outstanding accounts, or to pay any accounts that would have to be incurred in the future to complete the building. I did not hold out any hope that funds would be provided in next year's estimates to carry out the proposal set forth in Father Plourde's letter and stated that if the Church wished to complete the building they would have to do so at their own expense without any promise from the Department that they would be reimbursed for any expenditures made.\n\nIn discussing Father Plourde's letter with the Minister he approved of using the amount provided in this year's estimates, namely, $4,000 to pay the accounts that are now outstanding.\n\nWhen you are through with Father Plourde's letter, will you please return it.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnc.\nIMPERIAL OIL LIMITED\nSALES DEPARTMENT\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN. September 20th, 1940\nYour Refs 129-1-5\n\nAttention Hon. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDominion Government of Canada,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nWelfare and Training Service, Ottawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour letter of August 13th has been brought forward for attention. In it you indicate that you then shortly expected a report on the Kenora Residential School from your architect. It is assumed, of course, that the architect has completed his examination, allowing this account, which is now nearly twelve months old, to be paid. Therefore, may we suggest that as there appears to be no doubt that the account is in order and approval will be automatic payment will be forwarded to us within the next few days.\n\nWe are sure that you appreciate our position in this matter and while we do not wish to be unnecessarily insistent while the delay appears to have been due to unavoidable circumstances, we hope that you will give this request your closest consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIMPERIAL OIL, LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\nCredit Manager\n\nR.S./MH\n10.2\n\nALL QUOTATIONS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI desire to refer to my memorandum of June 10 and your reply of June 19 with reference to outstanding accounts for building material for the erection of a new wing at the Kenora Indian Residential School.

Since my return I have received at least half a dozen phone calls from houses that supplied material for this project. All these firms want to know why these accounts have not been attended to.\n\nI wish you to understand that I am not at all blaming the Department for this delay, but anything that can be done to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAttention Mr. Phillip Phelan\nOttawa,\nOctober 1, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo the outstanding accounts in connection with the Kenora reconstruction are in the office of the Purchasing Branch.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nImperial Oil Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nCould you please let me know at your convenience if you expect that anything will be done towards completing the Kenora unit. As you know it cannot be used in its present condition. Moreover should there be a fire with loss of life, it is possible that the Department would be blamed by the public at large for not having completed this unit which would eliminate all danger of such loss.\n\nI know how kind and considerate you have been in this matter and I do not wish you to consider this letter in any other form but that of a friendly reminder.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 17, 1940\nOttawa,\nOctober 22, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the completion of the unit at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nSince your visit to the Department the outstanding accounts have been paid and the amount provided for this purpose in the current year's appropriation is practically all spent.\n\nIt was not found possible, when preparing our estimates, to include any amount for the completion of this unit, although I am hopeful that funds will be available for the provision of heating equipment and possibly some other equipment during the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nI am sorry that I cannot be more encouraging in this regard but you will realize that conditions under which we are working at the present time are most unusual.\n\nI feel, however, that it is most important that this unit should be completed at the earliest possible date. As you have previously been informed it is the express desire of the Department that the new unit will be eventually used for dormitory purposes only. We cannot give approval for the use of the new unit for any other purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A.

His limited staff has also been very busy.\n\nWe are obtaining further information from Mr. Gow, but under the circumstances, it appears this work will have to stand over until next year.\n\nI am quoting herewith from Mr. Gow's letter regarding sewage disposal conditions:\n\n\"In all probability this school will be able to operate this winter continuously, although there may be the usual complaints from the Ontario Health Department about pollution of Lake of the Woods and there may be also complaints from the school management in connection with difficulty of getting rid of the kitchen and laundry drainage.\"\n\nWe will arrange to return the $300 made available if, in Mr. Gow's further report, he confirms our understanding that nothing more to advantage can be done at this time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDirector,\n\nRe: Septic tank, Kamora Indian Residential School.\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of October 25, also our telephone conversation this morning in connection with the above.\n\nIt is absolutely essential that this work be completed this fall and I should appreciate anything you can do to arrange this.\n\nAs you are aware we have already forwarded to you the amount of $300.00 which was requested in your memorandum of August 5. While it is hoped that the work can be done for this amount, at the same time if a reasonable additional amount is necessary funds can be secured.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOctober 26, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nConfirming our telephone conversation this morning, Mr. Gow has been instructed by wire to undertake the necessary improvement work to the sewage disposal facilities at the Kenora Indian Residential School immediately.

I sincerely hope that you will be able to find funds to provide the necessary heating equipment.\n\nI note your remark in the last paragraph of your letter regarding the use to which the new unit is to be put. I quite agree with you in this respect as it would not seem logical to have the children sleep in the old building when fireproof dormitories could be provided in the new section of the school. May I be permitted to say that, as I am not directly in charge of the Kenora School, it might be advisable for the Department to write to Rev. Father Lamontagne, the Provincial of the Manitoba province, and to Rev. Father Lemire, the Principal, to advise them of your wishes in this matter.\n\nThanking you very kindly for what you are doing for Kenora, I remain,\n\nyours very truly,\n\nJ.C.

It was not found possible, when preparing our estimates, to include any amount for the completion of this unit although I am hopeful that funds will be available for the provision of heating equipment, and possibly some other equipment, during the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nI am sorry that I cannot be more encouraging in this regard but you will realize that the conditions under which we are working at the present time are most unusual.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

The reason for this is that as he was being paid on a basis of 5% of the total cost payment was delayed until we had all the accounts paid in order that we could determine exactly the amount due him.\n\nThe account which you submitted showed an amount of $570.37 due Mr. Desrosiers. It is difficult for us to determine in what manner he arrived at this amount.\n\nHowever, our books show that the total expenditure was $11,640.72 and that 5% of this amount is $582.03. It would be appreciated if you would issue another voucher for the latter amount and forward it for our consideration. The voucher should give detailed information regarding the agreement which you had with Mr. Desrosiers in connection with his employ-\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E. Lamontagne, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa November 25, 1940.\n\nJ. M. Wardle\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reference to Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of October 28th last, stating that it was essential that the work be done this fall, and that if necessary, funds in addition to the $300.00 already transferred, would be provided. Dr. McGill has informed me today that the re-conditioning of the sewage disposal bed has been completed except for levelling off the surface, replacing the sod and sodding the slope of the bed. Soil and sod were frozen solid and could not be worked up.\n\nIn addition to the work on the sewage disposal bed, all kitchen and laundry drainage was connected to one main sewer and this was extended to a new drain which extends about 190 feet from the building. This is only a temporary expedient to care for this waste until a disposal system satisfactory to the health authorities can be developed. The cost of this work was $193.00 which includes $77.15 for materials.\n\nThe total cost of the work at this school including the kitchen and laundry waste but exclusive of the engineer's expenses, $228.75, which are being met from Vote 76-33, amounted to $363.45, made up as follows:\n\nLabour - $844.35\nMaterial 118.04\nTelephone 1.06\n\nWill you therefore kindly arrange with Dr. McGill for the immediate transfer of $65.00 which will be required to pay accounts for materials already purchased.\n\nDr. McGill might also be informed that the levelling and re-sodding of the sewage disposal bed will have to be undertaken early next season at an estimated cost of $75.00.\n\nIt might be noted that if it had not been for the expenditure on the kitchen and laundry waste, the $300.00 provided for the re-conditioning of the sewage disposal bed would have been ample for that purpose including the work necessary to complete it next spring.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nChief Engineer,\nDecember 19th, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage disposal, Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will recall that owing to the lack of an engineer to supervise the work, improvements to the sewage disposal facilities at the above school were not undertaken in September by Mr. Gow as desired, and in view of the urgent need of this work as you expressed to me by telephone and by memorandum, Mr. Gow was instructed to undertake it without fail this fall.\n\nAttached herewith is a memorandum received from the Chief Engineer, outlining the work which has to be done. In addition to the work done on the sewage disposal bed, the kitchen and laundry drainage was brought to one catch basin and the latter connected to a new drain extending 190 feet from the building. While this is a temporary expedient pending a modern and satisfactory disposal system, it will greatly improve present conditions.\n\nThe total cost of the work was $368.45, of which $193.00 was spent on the kitchen and laundry drainage system.\n\nThe total amount of funds made available was $300.00, and I would be glad if you would make arrangements to provide an additional $65.00 so that payments of accounts can be completed.\n\nI might call your attention to the fact that owing to winter conditions, levelling and resodding of the sewage disposal bed will have to be deferred until early next year, the estimated cost being $75.00.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your memorandum of December 19 with reference to the improvements to the sewage disposal system at the honora Indian Residential School. I am requesting the Treasury Branch to transfer to your branch a further amount of $65.00.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nPlease arrange for the immediate transfer to the Survey & Engineering Branch of the amount of $65.00 in order to complete the work required in connection with repairs to the sewage disposal system at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTo Mr. Smith, please transfer $65.00 for Kenora.\nSr. Mary's Indian Residential School,\n(For the Rev.

This explains that the total expenditure\nis not $11,591.40 but $11,640.78 according to the last report trans-\nmitted to you and so the $5 on the total sum should be according to\nyour figures $588.03.\n\nI include new invoices on this base and thank you heartily\nfor your earnest cooperation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

He is willing to supply all the labour in connection with the installation of the heating system, if the Department furnishes the boiler, radiators and piping necessary for this installation.\n\nCould you let me know at your convenience if there is any possibility of the Department being in a position to supply the above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJanuary 27th, 1941\nJune 26, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the installation of a heating system at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that a boiler, radiators and piping will be required but that the labour will be supplied by the school management.

This is the total amount that is available and it cannot be exceeded.

Father Lemire, principal of the Senior Indian Residential School, forwarded to Winnipeg a few days ago a 10-hp Johnson outboard motor for overhauling and repairs. The only authorized firm doing such repairs in Winnipeg for the Johnson Outboard Motor Co. is Green's Motor Co., Ltd., 247 Main St.\n\nI have secured a quote of cost from Mr. Green's Motor Co., Ltd., which is $50. However, Mr. Lemire would prefer to receive an estimate from another reputable firm. Therefore, we would appreciate your assistance in obtaining such an estimate.\n\nYour very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant the Department will allow an amount of $55.85 for repairs to the motor at the Kenora Residential School. It is noted that the above amount includes both material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.C. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n610 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nI am taking the liberty of sending you herewith an invoice in triplicate for one article of equipment and two of furniture purchased a few weeks ago by the Principal of the Kenora R.C. School. Father Lemire informs me that the electric washer is a second-hand machine, but in good working condition. The chairs are also second-hand but will serve the purpose for the present time. He would have preferred a new washing machine as well as new furniture, but he thought that under the circumstances he would cooperate as far as he is able to do so in reducing the maintenance cost of our Residential Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 29, 1941\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find tenders from the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Ltd., Crane Limited and Marshall-Wells Co. Ltd., all of Winnipeg, on the boiler and material needed to install heating in the new wing of the Kenora School, and to effect the necessary changes in the existing heating plant.\n\nIt is understood that the Oblate Fathers will supply the labour necessary to install this plant. As the summer season is already far-advanced, we would ask the Department to purchase the above material without the least delay, so that the plant can be in operation as soon as the cold Fall days begin.\n\nAs the funds available for this work may not be sufficient, the Oblate Fathers agree to advance the amount necessary to complete the purchase of the material needed on the understanding that whatever moneys are thus advanced will be refunded during the coming fiscal year. Should you find it impossible to promise the refund of excess expenditure, may we suggest that you nevertheless allow the Fathers to proceed with this work, and that the purchase of part of the radiation be left in abeyance until the Department is in a position to complete the purchase of same.\n\nOur Brothers will be available to undertake this work within two weeks and we would like the material to be ordered immediately, so that the work will not be unduly delayed. Of course almost no delay would occur if you were good enough to allow the Oblate Fathers to place the order with the lowest tenderer. We would naturally be guided in this connection by any advice from you and invoices would be rendered directly to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nand will provide adequate dormitory accommodation for the pupils attending this school. However, it cannot be used during the winter without proper heating, and I feel that it would be advisable to provide the necessary installation this year.\n\nI therefore recommend, for the Minister's approval, the acceptance of the lowest tender, on the understanding, as stated above, that the Oblate Fathers will supply all labour for installing, without cost to the Department.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, August 11, 1941.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nAGENCY MINISTER,\n\nYou will recall that last year a large addition was built at the Kenora Indian Residential School, in order to provide fireproof dormitories for the pupils in attendance at that school.\n\nThe amount provided did not permit the installation of proper heating facilities, and the Reverend J. O. Plourde, C.M.I., acting on behalf of the school management, has secured tenders from the following firms:\n\n1. Marshall-Wells Company, Limited,\n2. Crane, Limited,\n3. J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company.\n\nI attach these quotations for your information.\n\nThe lowest tender is that of the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company, which totals $4,542.87. In the current year's appropriation we have provided an amount of $3,500 for repairs and improvements at this school, and the balance that will be required to provide the heating installation that is necessary could be taken from an unallocated amount in our appropriation.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers will supply all labour necessary to install this plant, without cost to the Department.

This year, they are working on the heating system and the work will not be finished before a few months if it is at all possible during winter months to make the necessary connection with the new boiler.\n\nIn a letter addressed to you on Nov. 15th 1940, I said: \"May I add, this new unit will require a rearrangement of several of the departments of the school, and before any changes are made, the Principal and the Mother Superior will submit a complete plan to the Department for its official approval.\" No alterations of any kind have been made until now in the old building, and it has been possible to remove only one dormitory in the new wing.\n\nI desire to reassure the Department that no alterations will be made for the new rearrangement of the school, before being submitted to the Department for its official approval, and I request that an official of the Department be sent when convenient to study his new setup with the staff of the school.\n\nI wish to assure the Department, of my entire cooperation in all that may be for the greatest welfare of our Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n(Sure was 7/40)\n2.

Indian School, and trouble with the sewage disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey School; these matters are being temporarily remedied by the school Principals as not much can be done during the winter.\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received yours of the 6th instant regarding the completion of the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School. In answer, I beg to say that the Oblate Fathers will adhere strictly to the promise made to your Department that no charge will be made for the installation of the new heating plant of the above school.\n\nYou mention plumbing supplies in the first paragraph of your letter. May I say that no such supplies were provided in your order to the J.H. Ashdown Co. All the material bought was for the heating plants. Last year some plumbing was done by the school and money was paid for by the school and all the labour in connection with it was supplied by your Department.\n\nVery fair progress is being made in the installation of the new equipment and I am glad to report that no interruption in the heating of the school occurred during the ensuing absence of the work. We are extremely appreciative of what has been done so far to complete this new wing to the Kenora School and hope that funds will be provided, in the coming estimates, to at least plaster the walls and ceiling. The building is being used as is, but you will wish to provide for its completion as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFebruary 9, 1947\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDUMONT MELANCON\n\nOn receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 3, in connection with the completion of the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School, we wrote to Rev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I. He replies as follows:\n\n\"I have just received yours of the 6th instant regarding the completion of the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School.

McGill\n\nI have your memorandum of the 12th instant, file 129-1-5, quoting an extract of a letter received from Father Plourde regarding the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School. It is noted that Father Plourde expresses the hope \"that funds will be provided in the coming estimates to at least plaster the walls and ceiling\".\n\nWill you please refer again to my memorandum of the 20th September, 1940. A very definite understanding was reached by myself with Father Plourde and Father Lamontagne that the church authorities would assume a considerable portion of the costs of completing this addition. You will recall that the Minister originally agreed to an expenditure of $3,000, it being stated that the building could be constructed for this sum. Later he approved an additional expenditure of $4,000 and since that time has also approved of the paying of the cost of the plumbing and heating supplies. It would appear that the total expenditures made by the Department now amount to $19,319.99 as follows:\n\n| Date       | Description                  | Amount     |\n|------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| June 22, 1940 | Material                     | $8,639.83  |\n|            | Labour                       | $1,550.12  |\n| April 5, 1941 | Material                     | $1,498.73  |\n|            | Labour                       | $1,097.35  |\n| Jan. 1942   | Plumbing & Heating Supplies  | $4,542.97  |\n\nWhen the Minister approved of the last expenditure he was informed that this would be the last expenditure we would have to make on account of this building. It would be advisable, therefore, if you would write to Father Plourde and tell him that the Department expects the church authorities to complete the building at their own expense, following the understanding that was made when the Department agreed to make the additional expenditures which were not anticipated when authority was first given to construct the new building.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the Kenora Residential School. It is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that you hope that funds will be provided in the coming year's appropriation to plaster the walls and ceiling.\n\nI am advised by the Minister's office that a very definite understanding was reached with Father Lamontagne and yourself to the effect that the Church authorities would assume a considerable portion of the cost of completing the new addition to the Kenora School. The Minister originally agreed to an expenditure of $8,000.00 and later approved an additional expenditure of $4,000.00. Since that time he has also authorized funds for the new heating plant. This makes a total expenditure of $16,310.99.\n\nI am directed to inform you that the Department expects the Church authorities to complete the building at their own expense in view of the understanding between the Department and yourself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIf the Department could accede to the wishes of the Principal and agree to complete the building, a great deal would be accomplished towards removing from the minds of our Catholic Indians, and from those of local friends of the R.C. Indian Residential School at Kenora, the impression that, in comparison with the Cecilia Jeffrey School, the former seems to have been treated pretty much in the manner of a stepchild.\n\nBack in 1928, when it was decided to change the sight of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, a beautiful farm was bought as a new sight at a cost of $12,000. In the following two years at least $170,000 was spent on the construction of the new School. Moreover about $5,500 were allowed for the purchase of farm implements and livestock. Besides the Kenora R.C. School only received $180.00 per year per pupil, whilst $165.00 was being paid to the Cecilia Jeffrey. This discrepancy in the grant lasted until the attention of the Department was called to it. You also know, no doubt, that the pupilage of the Cecilia Jeffrey is 150, but that of the Kenora R.C. School is only 95.\n\nIt must be remembered that both the Cecilia Jeffrey and the Kenora R.C. School cater to the same group of Indians, most of whom are of aboriginal belief, and I still can't figure out why the Department adopted the policy of erecting such a large School for the Cecilia Jeffrey group and refused to enlarge or rebuild the Kenora R.C. School.\n\nAll this is brought to your attention not in a spirit of recrimination, because after all you had nothing to do with the condition which now prevails in that district, but it will supply you with arguments to use when this matter is again brought to the attention of either the Minister or his Executive Secretary. You could spend a large amount of money on the Kenora R.C. School and it would still be in an inferior position to the Cecilia Jeffrey. The policy of the Department has always been to treat both the Catholic and non-Catholic elements with equal fairness and the present may be an opportune occasion to remedy a condition which is apt to leave doubts in the minds of some regarding this determination of the Department to treat all denominations on an equal basis.\n\nI remain, my dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFebruary 24, 1942\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 20th instant regarding the Kenora R.C. Residential School. Whilst it is true that the Government has already expended a fairly large amount towards the building of a fireproof wing to the above School, the fact must not be lost sight of that the Oblate Fathers themselves have contributed a fairly substantial amount in the form of labour. Under present conditions it would seem almost unfair to ask them to complete the building at their own expense.\n\nThis new addition, as it now stands, is larger than was originally planned; on the other hand, it will provide fireproof dormitories for all the children of the School. This improvement could not have been secured if the original plan had been strictly followed, and is an aspect of the problem in which the Department cannot but be very much interested, as the danger from fire to the lives of our Indian children must be eliminated wherever possible.\n\nBearing these facts in mind, we still believe that the Department should not refuse to appropriate at least part of the funds necessary to complete the building. As it now stands, neither the walls nor the ceilings are plastered, and whilst you have asked the School Principal to use both the first and second stories for dormitory purposes, and he is willing to comply with your wishes, you will admit with me that dormitories with such bare walls and ceilings are not very inviting.\n\nAnd may I add the following remarks:\nSt Mary's Indian School,\nKenora, Ontario.\nMarch 23rd, 1942.\n\nMr Frank Edwards, Captain,\nIndian-Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you must know, the Department of Indian Affairs has given a new heating system to this School, which had been put on by the labor of our experienced Brothers.\n\nHaving these Brothers with me for a while yet, I am taking this opportunity to put many things in order. And also by their work I got the first floor in a more liveable way: a corridor, five rooms etc. All this improve the School, especially the commodities to a great extent, and without any abuses.\n\nOf course very seldom improvements can be done without any cost! And I believe expenditures made for these improvements will amount about $350.00.\n\nI would, than, greatly appreciate, dear Sir, if you could be of any assistance and have the Department to cover the expenditures.\n\nMany thanks for your devotedness towards this School, which I always greatly appreciate.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMarch 27, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the request of the Principal of the Kenora Residential School for a further amount of $350.00 expended for improvements at the school.\n\nWe have already approved considerable expenditure at this school during the current fiscal year and there are no funds available for further expenditures. In any case, the Principal should not have made other repairs without first receiving authority.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.

C. Indian Residential School. Very Reverend Father M. Lavigne, O. M. I., the new Provincial of the Manitoba Oblate Province has expressed to me his great willingness to cooperate with your Department in this matter.\n\nHe paid the Kenora school a special visit last week and reported to me that not only is he himself anxious to cooperate but that Reverend Father Lemire was very willing to do everything he could in this connection. Nothing of course, can be done before the children leave for their holidays and if your Mr. Doucet visits the school before the summer holidays he will of course, find conditions as they are at the present time, i.e. the chapel is on the ground floor of the new fire-proof wing. In a former letter regarding this matter I suggested that it would be advisable for the Department to send an architect to the Kenora school to advise the Principal regarding the location of the chapel. The quarters formerly utilized for this purpose are not now sufficiently spacious because in adapting the new wing to the old school part of the chapel had to be taken. Formerly the old chapel was so small that only part of the children could assist at Mass or other religious services at one time. It is essential that the new chapel be made spacious enough for all the children to attend these services together. This will mean knocking down a few walls and this is where the advice of a competent architect would be most welcome. This suggestion is put forward not with the idea of thwarting the desires of the Department in this matter but simply to be helpful.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to state again that both the new\nSt. Mary's Indian School,\nIona, Ontario,\nJune 5th, 1942.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n\"To Grant towards salary of Night-Watchman at St. Mary's Indian Residential School, for the month of April 1942.\"\n\n1 month @ $40.00 per month ...............$40.00\n\nThe duties have been well performed.\n\n[Signature]\nFather J.

This was discarded when the new boiler was installed last year.\n\nThe boiler is a 10 section 48\" x 64\" x 3' size - working pressure 10 pounds per square inch. Same was last inspected by Inspector J. M. Kelly in 1941 - Annual Inspection No. O. A. 4205.\n\nThe other specifications are: \"International Empress Steam\" \"International Heater Co.\" \"Utica N. Y.\" \"Waldon Co.\" \"Winnipeg\" \"No 7-32 A\" \"1910\".\n\nThere is no lagging on the boiler at the present time. The grates appear to be in fair condition. This boiler was in use until the larger boiler was installed - but is not in use now and the Principal is anxious to have same removed from the school basement as he needs the room.\n\nWill you kindly advise what disposition should be made of this equipment. The Principal informed me that if this Department had no use for same he believed the Church might use same to good advantage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

Paint manufacturers find it difficult to get enough zinc oxide in any form to keep their mills running at the usual pace. The tendency will therefore be to lower the percentage of zinc oxide.\n\nPaint manufacturers, thoroughly conversant with what was going on, have experimented with other basic materials in recent years and I believe it would be fair to say that for some time to come all white paste paints you will receive similar to 40-40-20 will not be appreciably degraded. The material may be slightly deficient in one or more respects\u2014for example the white paint may not clean up well or the durability may be somewhat impaired, as compared to the best formulas we have been manufacturing, but, in general, you will receive a product that can be termed reasonably satisfactory, or at least that is my opinion at this time. We may eventually have to cut the hiding power ten or fifteen percent, in order to eke out the total tonnage of white hiding pigments available, but even if we reduced the hiding power twenty percent, the paints would still hide better than those manufactured prior to 1935.\n\nWe sincerely believe that Government Standard Pure White Lead (Master Painter or B.B. Brand) is the safer paint to use at all times. Past experience proves it.\n\nFor all-out defense against weather you can't ask for a better paint than white lead paint. That's why most painters prefer it for exterior work. They've found it doesn't crack and scale, that it keeps its looks a long time, makes a foolproof job. White lead paint jobs mean satisfied customers\u2014and satisfied customers are generally permanent ones!\n\nYou're money ahead when you paint with White Lead.\n\nThis Lead has been known for over a century and a half as a White Lead of unexcelled quality. Its reputation is world-wide. No White Lead stands higher in the estimation of painters anywhere.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: The Western Paint Co., Ltd.,\nADDRESS: Winnipeg,\nManitoba.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1942 | Sept 30 To account rendered as per Vouchers attached | $2.10\nFor 6 gals.

Fr. C. R. Comeau, O.M.I., Principal of the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Kenora for an appropriation to cover the cost of moving bath-room and toilet fixtures from the present girls' dormitory to a new girls' dormitory in the fire-proof wing of the building.\n\nApparently all correspondence and arrangements in connection with the fire-proof wing has been directly handled between Ottawa and the Principal's Headquarters in St. Boniface. Consequently I am not familiar with what agreement regarding the fire-proof wing was arrived at.\n\nHowever, I had a local plumber inspect the job this morning and his estimate on the cost of labour, pipe and pipe fittings is $700.00. If, upon removal, any of the fixtures are found to be defective the cost of these replacements would be extra.\n\nRev. Father Comeau informs me he has received instructions from his Headquarters to the effect that the girls' dormatory must be moved to the fire-proof wing immediately - and consequently he intends to proceed with the moving of bath-room and toilet fixtures at once - but has asked me to obtain authority for an appropriation to cover the cost of same if possible.\n\nThe foregoing is submitted for your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

Roberts,\nActing Agent,\nIndian Affairs,\nKenora Branch.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby appeal to you for the permission to buy a second hand baking oven. The two small ones actually in use do not suffice for the present need for this institution. It requires double time and double cost, together with long overheating of a very small room, thus being dangerous for fire and actually injurious to health.\n\nThe oven referred to was valued when new, at approximately a thousand dollars, and is in excellent condition.\n\nThe two small ones, actually in use, are in good condition. The larger has a capacity of 50 loaves and the smaller, a capacity of 25. They may be disposed of, for less important institutions.\n\nAccordingly you are requested to obtain from the Department, authorization for this purchase.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. E. E. Comeau, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nKENORA, Ont., Sept. 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached please find copy of a communication received recently from Rev. Father C. E. Comeau, O.M.I., Principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School requesting authority to purchase a new oven for the school.\n\nThe Principal has been in touch with the Charlie Dufault Sheet Metal Company of St. Boniface and informs me he can purchase a second hand oven from this firm originally valued at approximately $1000.00 for $300.00. Repairs are estimated at $50.00 and transportation to Kenora, $25.00. Consequently the new installation would cost approximately $375.00 - and make available for use in other institutions, the two ovens now in use - which are in a very fair state of repair.\n\nDuring my last inspection of the School on September 18th this phase of operations was particularly brought to my attention and I am of the opinion the Principal's request should be given consideration - if funds can be made available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nOctober 10, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, careful consideration has been given to the request for the purchase of a second-hand oven. Before definitely submitting this matter to our Purchasing Branch, I should appreciate your ascertaining if it is possible to secure, from the Dufault Sheet Metal Company, any offer for the two small ovens now in use. It is unlikely that they could be placed at any other school and consequently would only be used for scrap metal. It is, therefore, possible that the firm mentioned might be willing to take them over and thereby reduce the expenditure required for the oven which the Principal requests.\n\nI have also received your letter of the last instant, in connection with moving toilet fixtures to the new wing. As you state in the second paragraph of your letter, all correspondence regarding this wing has been with the Provincial of the Oblate Order at St. Boniface. At the present time the Department is not prepared to give a definite decision regarding the Principal's request, but will communicate with the Provincial of the Order at a later date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Roberts,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Roberts:\n\nI wish to submit to you my report on the inspections we made recently at the two Indian residential schools near Kenora.\n\nIn the St. Mary's School the extinguishers that require recharging each year should be done; the others do not need to be done only require an examination to see that the hose carriage of the outfit is in good order; alterations on the fire escapes are needed and there should be a fire alarm both in the dormitories as well as in the classrooms. A hose reel should be installed with all the equipment so that all the hose could be available quickly for fire fighting. For the outside of the building and other buildings on the grounds, the pipelines from the main pump should be so arranged that it could be connected to in suitable places, the older boys could be instructed on how to allow all the fire fighting equipment to be used in case of necessity. This is one reason why equipment is kept in such a condition to be used quickly when necessary.\n\nI have also noted that the fire escape doors and windows are not open outwardly; approaches to escapes should be on a level with the escape doors. The doors of dormitories should be left open so that they can be taken off easily in case of fire. I have also noted that the walls of the dormitories are very dirty and the floors are very dusty. It is important to keep the dormitories clean and the floors swept regularly.\n\nI am enclosing a list of recommendations which I believe will be helpful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[F. Dubois]\n\n[Signature]\nGRAND JURY PRESENT REPORT\n\nTo the Honourable Mr. Justice Fulton, Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario:\n\nMay it please Your Lordship:\n\nWe, the members of the Grand Jury, present at the meetings of the Supreme Court of Ontario at the Court House, October 8th, 1942, beg to present the following report:\n\nKenora General Hospital\n\nWe found this institution to be well managed and in fine condition in all departments. We consider the housekeeping to be very good.\n\nSt. Joseph's Hospital\n\nYour Jury also found this hospital to be well managed and in very good condition.\n\nIn both hospitals there were several cases which should have been just as well cared for in a suitable home, thus leaving more room for those needing hospital care. We would recommend that as soon as possible, measures be provided to prevent the occurrence of similar cases in the future.\n\nProvincial District Jail\n\nWe found this institution to be in excellent condition, but we regard the inmates as being ill-treated. We found that the food prepared was not fit to be eaten. Some of the prisoners were very weak and appeared to be suffering from poor treatment while in custody. We urge that immediate steps be taken to improve the conditions of the inmates. We also recommend that the authorities give full attention to the complaints made by the inmates regarding the manner in which they are treated.\n\nGLORY BE!\n\nFOR FLAKIER BISCUITS, USE\n\nSwift's Brand\n\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential Indian School\n\nWe found this school to be in good condition. The food provided was adequate, and the living quarters were clean and comfortable.\n\nSt. Mary's Residential Indian School\n\nThe living quarters were clean and comfortable, but the food provided was not sufficient. We recommend that the authorities provide better food for the students.\n\nCourt House\n\nThe court House is kept in excellent condition and can readily be seen to be in good order. Our only recommendation is that a separate lavatory be provided for women. All of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nE. L.

Robois, Chief of the Kenora Fire Department, on October 20th, with respect to an inspection made by Mr. Robois and myself on October 15th.\n\nThe minor suggestions made in Mr. Robois' report are being given attention but I would also recommend the major item - fireproofing the dormitories and the boiler houses - and the installation of fire hoses between the two dormitories and the school in the new fire-proof main building to be given immediate attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

To Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nNovember 17, 1942\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that the fire-proof addition to the Lepper Hall, Indian Industrial School is still incomplete. This addition forms part of the old school building which is not itself fire-proof. To make the new building secure against all fire hazard would require the installation of fire-proof doors in the halls connecting the old and new structures.\n\nAlthough due to war conditions the Department has been unable to provide financial assistance towards completing this building, it was our intention to install these doors at our own expense i.e., without any funds. Unfortunately it is practically impossible to secure such fire-proof doors on account of the very stringent regulations regarding the purchase of steel and allied materials, but as soon as conditions warrant it, we undertake this work and complete it with the least possible delay.\n\nMy purpose in writing you about this matter is to have it on record that we are anxious to perform in every respect to the building regulations of the Ontario government so that your own department will not be open to criticism for failing to make this building as fire-proof as it can possibly be done.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. O. Scudder\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you state that it has not been found possible to install the fireproof doors in the halls connecting the old and new buildings at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nI feel certain that you recognize the importance of having these doors installed and consequently I trust that you will continue your efforts to secure the doors and have them placed in position at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The management of the Kenora Residential School intends to install the fireproof doors between the main portion of the building and the new fireproof wing. However, I am informed that they have found difficulty in doing this due to stringent priority regulations regarding the purchase of steel and similar materials. I am definitely informed that as soon as conditions warrant it the management will undertake the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe new oven is at the school but has not yet been installed. However, the Principal states that if the expenditure is approved and the Department wishes to dispose of the two ovens now in use - to Dufault or otherwise - he would arrange to have the new one installed at an early date.\n\nIt would appear, however, that the transportation on the two ovens now in use - to Winnipeg - would amount to nearly as much as Dufault is willing to allow on them - and would seem more practicable, therefore, to advertise them for sale locally, for scrap.\n\nThe Principal informs me he took advantage of Dufault's offer while the oven was available. He states it has not yet been paid for and is prepared to assume the cost from funds at his disposal but has requested that a more application to the Department for an appropriation to cover the expenditure.\n\nThe foregoing is submitted for your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

In conversation with the Purchasing Agent he intimated quite frankly that, in his judgment, the price asked was excessive. Should the Principal desire, therefore, to purchase the second-hand stove for use at the school, it will not be possible to secure from the Purchasing Agent the usual purchase order without which no payment for the stove can be made by this Branch. This is a matter you should discuss with the Principal of the school at an early date and, having done so, send forward your final decision.\n\nH.A.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 129-15, dated Oct. 1st, 1942.\n\nVoucher No. 418. Note: 77-01-819 Date: February 16th 1943\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nA few days ago Father Comeau of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Kenora called to see the Minister but as he was busy Father Comeau discussed and left with me a number of accounts for material and labour which he said were incurred to enable the transfer of the sleeping quarters from the old part of the building to the new part that was recently constructed. The total amount of the accounts which are enclosed is $2478.69.\n\nYour attention is again drawn to my memorandum of the 14th February, 1942. I did not hold out any hope to Father Comeau that the Minister would approve of the Department assuming any part of these recent expenditures but I told him that I would have the matter inquired into. If payment is refused now no doubt the matter will be brought to the Minister's attention. It is suggested, therefore, that you should forward the accounts to Inspector Hamilton and ask him to visit the school and ascertain definitely what they were incurred for. It might be well to forward to him a copy of my memorandum of the 14th February, 1942, in order that he will have some idea of the previous expenditures made by the church, to which the Department has contributed. He should also inquire as to what expenditures were made by the church itself which they are not asking the Department to pay. Father Comeau said that he would not be returning to Kenora before the 25th of March and it would not be advisable therefore to have Inspector Hamilton visit the school before this date.\n\nFather Comeau raised two other questions. The first was the purchase of a secondhand oven. I believe the purchase has already been completed and the oven installed. He requested that the Department should assist the church in purchasing it.\nThe other question he raised was the possibility of increasing the pupilage. He stated that the school is now being paid a per capita grant for 75 pupils whereas there were 112 in the school. I told him quite definitely that there was very little prospect of any increase being allowed during the war.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, March 10, 1943.\nMarch 11, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI enclose accounts amounting to $2,478.69 submitted to the Minister's office by Rev. Father Comeau, Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School. These accounts cover material and labour which the Principal states were incurred in transferring the dormitories from the old part of the building to the new, fireproof wing.\n\nThe Minister's office requests that you visit the Kenora School and ascertain definitely for what purpose these expenditures were incurred. It is also requested that you inquire regarding the expenditures made by the Church itself and which they are not asking the Department to refund.\n\nFather Comeau will not return to Kenora before March 25 and consequently you should not visit the school until some time subsequent to that date, as we wish the Principal to be at the school when you arrive. Immediately following March 25 you should ascertain if the Principal has returned and, in that event, you should proceed to the school immediately.\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 14, 1943, in order that you may have some idea of the previous expenditures made by the Church authorities to which the Department has contributed.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa\nMarch 11, 1943.\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 10, with reference to accounts presented to him by the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School. None of the officials of this Branch were aware that it was the Principal's intention to present these accounts to the Minister.\n\nAs directed by Mr. Jackson, the accounts are being referred to Inspector Hamilton and the latter is also being forwarded a copy of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 14, 1943.\n\nIn connection with the Principal's request for the purchase of a second-hand oven, this matter was referred to the Purchasing Branch in memoranda dated November 23 and December 12, 1942. In memorandum dated December 16, 1942, the Departmental Purchasing Agent wrote as follows:\n\n\"The Deputy Minister thinks this is a piece of equipment that should be purchased by the Church Organization operating the school.\"\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nMarch 27th, 1945.\n\nWith further reference to my report dated today, March 27th, on the St. Mary's Roman Catholic School, Kenora, your file 1291-68, I think it only fair to outline certain other work and expense incurred by the school but which has no bearing on the accounts at present under consideration.\n\n1. All basement windows are being screened; frames bolted together and covered with mink wire; each frame costing approximately $4.00.\n\n2. A special bathroom has been constructed to be used by all. It is called a heat bath, and the idea is to heat the room, causing one to perspire. This removes dust and cleans the pores; then cold water is used as a shower.\n\n3. Two large outdoor swings were built last fall. Each garden swing seats about six pupils. They are well made and strongly bolted together. Probably cost $60.00 each - totalling $120.00.\n\n4. The Principal has purchased four good cows and three heifers; three hundred chickens; and two horses, at a total cost of almost $1,000.00. He is trying to provide milk, butter and eggs enough for the school and some to sell. The team of horses were made necessary because he had to haul the school wood a distance of sixteen miles.\n\n5. There is constant repair work and the carpenter, in addition to special jobs, attends to the general upkeep of the building and equipment.\n\nFather Comeau showed me a bake oven which he intends to install shortly. The present oven is too small, making it necessary to bake every day. The room now used as a bakery is part of the hall way. It is small, dark and when the oven is on the heat is almost unbearable. The Principal states he is building an addition to the kitchen which will be used for the bakery and it will also house the electric refrigerator. The refrigerator at present is in the upper part of the furnace room and the motor is running almost continuously. I understand even though no authority is granted for expense in connection with this work, that Father Comeau considers it absolutely essential and intends to proceed.\nHe also wants the new wing plastered. At present the rough tile and bricks present a very dismal appearance. The walls are rough and ideal for collecting all dust. The steel construction work holding the floors is open with not even the metal lath on. This, too, is a wonderful place for dust and almost impossible to clean. This wing is a very valuable addition to the school and if possible it should be completed. The doors leading from the old building into the new wing are ordinary wooden doors. These fire-proof doors should be provided. These, in case of fire, would prevent smoke and flames reaching the stairway down which the children must pass to escape. If authorized, I can secure prices for these doors.\n\nThis school is well operated. The children have good clothes, are well fed and appear very happy. I understand there are 110 pupils although the ground is paid for only 75. This excess number of 35 pupils makes a further heavy drain on the principal's finances. He explains there is no other schooling accommodation provided for the children and he feels they are entitled to an education.\n\nI trust this further information will help to provide some light to the financial problems of this school.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRE: Accounts submitted by Father Comeau,\nSt. Mary's Indian School, Kenora, Ontario.\nYour file 129-1-5 - dated March 11th.\n\nAs instructed in your letter, I visited the\nSt. Mary's Roman Catholic Indian Residential School and would\nreport as follows.\n\nI went through the list of materials with Father\nComeau and am convinced the same were largely used either in\nthe new fireproof wing or in the re-modelling of the old\nbuildings. I find one exception in that some of the lumber was\nused to complete the chicken-house. This two-storey building\nis 16' x 48' with capacity for about four or five hundred hens.\nI am aware that the Department purchased some material; but\nunfortunately the quantity requested was underestimated.\n\nThe school's donation to this program of work\nconsisted largely in the giving of labor. Father Comeau claims\nthe plumbing labor was donated. He claims this work, if\ncontracted for, would have cost at least $500.00 or $600.00.\nAll the wash basins were transferred from the old building, and\nthe broken ones renewed; toilets were installed both for the\nchildren and supervisors, and this all joined up to the main\noutlet. I am not a plumber; but I am convinced the work is\nwell done and I am also convinced that it entailed many days of\nlabor.\n\nFather Comeau has a carpenter on the staff and this\nman, along with some of the big boys, did most of the painting\nafter the chapel was re-modelled. Contract labor for this work,\nit is estimated, would have cost at least $350.00. The school\ncarpenter also assisted odd days throughout the entire recon-\nstruction period; but no record was kept of the labor.\n\nThe carpentry work consisted of the building of\na supervisor's room in one dormitory, together with cupboard\nspace for clothing. In all, three large rows of storage space\nwere provided, with doors and lockers.\n\nThe old classrooms were re-modelled and are now the\nchapel. This work meant taking out partitions, removing the old\nchimney, putting in heavy beam supports for the upstairs floor,\nand re-flooring places previously used as toilets; and in some\ncases re-plastering walls or renewing them with wallboard. A\nnew wall was required along the sewing-room, and certain altera-\ntions made to the room used by Father Comeau as his office and\nbedroom.\nThe old dormitories were altered to be used as classrooms. Repairs were needed to the walls and floors. Blackboards were installed, also a number of fluorescent lighting fixtures. Good lights were made necessary because the windows are dormer windows and the sunlight cannot spread about in the same manner as with the ordinary window.\n\nAs stated above, I feel convinced that the materials listed were all used to good advantage, and I am sure if the alterations had been carried out by contract a much greater expense would have been incurred.\n\nThe accounts enclosed with your letter are being returned herewith.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEols.\nOttawa, March 31, 1943.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 10 and my reply of March 11, with reference to accounts presented to Mr. Jackson by the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nAs directed by Mr. Jackson, the accounts were forwarded to Inspector Hamilton, who visited the school last week, and, for your information, I enclose copies of his reply. You will note, there are two letters, the first referring particularly to the accounts which were submitted to him and the second letter regarding the improvements that the school management has made.\n\nThe accounts in question are as follows:\n\n| Month | Description                          | Amount   |\n|-------|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Sept. 30 | Lindstrom & Wilson, for building material | $747.82  |\n| Oct.   | Williams Hardware, for plumbing       | $61.74   |\n| Nov.   | Lindstrom & Wilson, for building material | $491.87  |\n| Nov.   | Lindstrom & Wilson                   | $105.83  |\n| Dec.   | Dufault Sheet Metal, for plumbing     | $252.87  |\n| Jan.   | Lindstrom & Wilson (including labour) | $1,109.81 |\n\nTotal: $2,478.63\n\nIn view of the contents of Mr. Hamilton's letters, I recommend that payment of these accounts be made. Funds are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1942-43.\n\nIn regard to the bake oven, I understand the school management has already paid for this, and I do not consider it advisable to make any refund for it.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to The Principal,\nAddress: St. Mary's Indian Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1943 March 21 | Grant toward cost of employing Night Watchman for period January 1, 1943 - to March 31, 1943; 3 months @ $40.00 | $120.00\n\nVote: 77 - 01 - 819\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

McGill\n\nRe Kenora Indian Residential School,\nYour File 129-1-5\n\nPlease refer to your memorandum of the 3lst ultimo in the above matter. Inspector Hamilton's two reports are not very satisfactory. In my memorandum to you of the 10th March it was suggested that Inspector Hamilton should visit the school and ascertain definitely what the various accounts submitted by Father Comeau were incurred for. The only information given by Inspector Hamilton is that the materials were used either in the new fireproof wing or in the remodelling of the old building. This information we already knew. What we wanted him to report on was what actual work was done which required the purchase of the materials referred to in the accounts. It is noted that he refers to the chapel being remodelled. Were some of the materials used for this purpose?\n\nIt is also disturbing to know that there is still considerable work to be done before these buildings are complete. Inspector Hamilton refers particularly to the plastering of the new building. Then, again, he refers to other items of work that will have to be done before the building is completed. Will you please refer again to my memorandum to you in this matter dated September 20, 1940, and also of April 18, 1941, February 3, 1942 and February 14, 1942. In view of the discussions we have had with Father Plourde and Father Lamontagne and the understandings that were reached, upon which the Minister gave his approval to the payment of the accounts that have been paid up to date, it is not thought that the Department should now be asked to stand any further expense in completing the building.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, April 8, 1943.\nOttawa,\nApril 18, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn March 10 we were advised by the Minister's office that you had come to Ottawa and urged payment of accounts amounting to slightly over $2400.00 covering the cost of additional repairs made at the Kenora Residential School. Later Inspector Hamilton visited the school and discussed these accounts with you. On receipt of his report we again submitted the accounts to the Minister's office and I am today in receipt of a reply which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"It is also disturbing to know that there is still considerable work to be done before these buildings are complete.

School Superior, and in company of Mr. Clark attended closing exercises there held at 8 p.m. June 25th. The pupils here too were smart in appearance well clothed and bright. After a brief concert given by Boys & Girls, addressed the pupils at request of Father Comeau. Inspected the Main Buildings and found many needed improvements had been taken care of. Made inspection of the Refrigeration Plant, and believe a new plant is needed to replace the old Unit which would continue to be a source of trouble and expense if used further. This Unit I am told never gave a proper temperature to refrigerator box and foods could not be kept from spoiling. Father Comeau is to get prices and specifications on a new Unit soon.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. R.A.

McGill, and Inspector Hamilton, I was shown over this proposed alteration, and in my opinion I believe it would be of benefit to the classes (Senior and Third) to have this partition erected.\n\nAs to the partition in order to provide room for a Manual Training class, this also seems to be a much needed requisite, as no provision is made for this particular course of training.\n\nMessrs Bergman and Nelson, Contractors of Kenora, were asked to quote on the above work; but informed us they could not consider further contracts this fall.\n\nAm submitting this for your approval, and would recommend, if funds are available, that this work be commenced as early as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nFile No. 189-1-5\n\nSeptember 1, 1943\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Kenora Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nSignature\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\ncontributions from the Department towards the cost of this building could be expected. Notwithstanding this, in the following April additional accounts for plumbing and heating were submitted amounting to \u00a3168.02 and payment was authorized.\n\nThe Director of the Branch was again instructed to advise the Oblate Fathers that the Department would not contribute any further expenditures. By this time the total payments made by the Department had amounted to \u00a319,430.01.\n\nIn March of the current year Father Gomseu left a number of new accounts for further material and labour amounting to \u00a3475.69 and asked that they should be paid by the Department. These accounts were sent to Inspector Hamilton at Winnipeg and he was asked to make an inspection of the building. His report disclosed that in addition to the construction of a new fireproof wing, the old classrooms were remodelled and turned into a chapel. He stated that the work meant taking out partitions, removing the old chimney, putting in heavy beam supports for the upstairs floor and re-flooring places previously used as toilets and in some cases re-plastering walls or renewing them with wallboard. Also a number of alterations were made to the room used by the Principal as his office and bedroom. Inspector Hamilton further reported that the building was not yet completed, that the new wing had to be plastered and that there were a number of other things that had to be done.\n\nI have outlined at some length all of the facts because I wished you to know what had taken place in the past and the reasons why the Department cannot keep on paying the accounts that are submitted from time to time. The work approved of in the first instance was the construction of an addition to the main building to provide quarters for the staff, owing to the destruction by fire of their old quarters. The cost was estimated at \u00a310,000 by Father Plourde. If I had known the expenditure would exceed this sum approval would not have been given because of the conditions existing at that time. It would appear to be quite evident that, without any consultation with the Branch officials, plans were proceeded with on a much larger scale which not only substantially increased the size of the school but involved considerable expenditures in building a new chapel. Instead of the expenditures being limited to \u00a32,000 we have already contributed nearly \u00a320,000 and are being asked to pay now an additional \u00a32,200 worth of accounts and to complete the building, which would probably bring the total cost up to \u00a325,000.\ninspected by the Resident Architect of the Public Works Department, Winnipeg. The report showed that the expenditures already made amounted to $12,000 and that it would probably require a similar sum to complete the building. In September of that year Father Plourde and Father Lamontagne discussed the matter with Mr. Jackson. The following is an extract from a memorandum to the Director of the Branch after this interview:\n\n\"Will you please note the attached letter from Reverend Father Plourde in reference to the addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School. Father Lamontagne and Father Plourde called at the office and discussed the matter with me at some length. I made it quite clear to them that the minister had only approved of an expenditure of $8,000 on the building; and that when the approval was first obtained the building was not to cost more than this sum. I explained, however, when we were advised last fall that the cost had been exceeded, an additional $4,000 was provided in this year's estimates and that this was the only sum now available to pay the outstanding accounts, or to pay any accounts that would have to be incurred in the future to complete the building. I did not hold out any hope that funds would be provided in next year's estimates to carry out the proposal set forth in Father Plourde's letter and stated that if the Church wished to complete the building they would have to do so at their own expense without any promise from the Department that they would be reimbursed for any expenditures made.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the warning given at that time accounts for labour and material totalling $2594 were submitted for payment in 1941. These were incurred without any prior approval being obtained from the Department. At that time this additional expenditure was brought to my attention. I instructed the Branch to again warn the Oblate Fathers that no expenditures should be made without first securing the authority of the Department. At the same time I authorized the payment of the accounts which had been submitted.\n\nIn August of the same year Father Plourde submitted tenders for materials for a heating plant, amounting to $4542 and undertook that if the Department would pay for them the Oblate Fathers would supply all the labour. Approval was given to the payment of these accounts in February, 1942. At that time the Oblate Fathers were informed that no further\nOttawa, November 1, 1943.\n\nDear Father Lavigne,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th September last in reference to the Kenora Residential School, which I have not been able to answer before this owing to my absence from the city for some weeks. The matter is one which has been brought to my attention on several occasions during the past few years. I am sure that you will agree that the unsatisfactory situation now existing is entirely the responsibility of the officers of your order.\n\nMy approval to the initial expenditure was given in August 1939, following the recommendation received from the Director of the School, an extract from which read as follows:\n\n\"The Roman Catholic Church authorities, who are associated with us in the management of this school, consider that instead of erecting a new separate building for the staff it would be preferable to make an addition to the school. This would permit a re-arrangement of the rooms and would provide staff rooms, and in the new addition would provide class rooms and accommodation for vocational training.\n\nThe Church authorities recommend a wing 60' x 34' consisting of a basement and one floor -- all fireproof construction.\n\nRev. J.J. Plourde, O.M.I., on behalf of the Church authorities, advised me recently that they were prepared to undertake this work and they estimate that the new wing can be completely built for an amount of $8000.00.\"\n\nIn December of the same year, less than four months after the original approval was given, a letter was received signed by Father Plourde and Father Lamontagne, stating that they had already expended $10,700 and that to complete the building would involve an additional expenditure of $6,000. In the late summer of 1940 arrangements were made to have the work\n\nRev. M. Lavigne, O.M.I.,\nProvincial of the Oblate Order,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nKENORA, ONT., September 15, 1943\n\nSOLD TO Rev.

Paterson\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 17, 1943.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing plans and estimates from Lindstrom & Nilson and Bergman and Nelson with regard to the erection of a brooder house at the Kenora Residential School. The quotation of Lindstrom & Nilson is the lower, but in their specification dated November 3 there do not appear to be any arrangements made for ventilation under the floor. In addition all Government publications regarding construction of such buildings suggest the advisability of a concrete floor instead of a wood floor. Before submitting the matter to the Minister's office for consideration this Branch felt that the plans and quotations should be returned to you, in order that you may reconsider the points raised in this letter, as, if our suggestions are carried out, it will make a considerable difference in the type and quantity of materials that would be needed.\n\nYou should point out to the Principal that I am not in a position at the present time to promise him definitely that the expenditure will be allowed, but, as intimated in the preceding paragraph, we want to have everything in proper shape before submitting it for a decision. I also enclose, for your information, a copy of a booklet issued by the Department of Agriculture and you will note on Page 8 of this that they strongly recommend concrete floors.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nNovember 18, 1943.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nSince writing to you yesterday I have reviewed the last annual report of the Kenora Residential School and, according to the information given by the Principal at that time, there were the following outbuildings:\n\n- Barn: 60 x 20\n- Piggery: 10 x 10\n- Hen-house: 40 x 16\n- Shops: 20 x 38\n- Sheds: 40 x 15, 20 x 30\n- Implement shed: 30 x 34\n- Boat houses: 40 x 15, 20 x 50 x 12\n\nYou will note from this list that the Principal stated they had a hen-house 40 x 16. If this building is in good condition we feel that a brooder erected according to the attached plan would be much cheaper and almost as satisfactory as the larger one suggested in the correspondence to which we replied yesterday.\n\nOn considering the matter again we also feel that it would not be very satisfactory if a brooder were built and used for pigs this winter and then for hens next summer. It is our opinion that the same building for pigs and hens is not very suitable.\n\nWith the above in mind we thought it advisable to write to you again and, before replying, you and the Principal should give very careful consideration to the points raised both in our letter of yesterday's date and this letter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n| DELIVERIES | PIECES | SIZE | DESCRIPTION | FEET | TOTAL FEET | PRICE |\n|------------|--------|------|-------------|------|------------|-------|\n|            |        |      | Brought Forw'd |      |            |       |\n| 2          | Rolls  |      | Dryden Paper |      |            |       |\n| 2          | Rolls  |      | Tar Paper    |      |            |       |\n| 3M         | #2xx   |      | Cedar Shingles |     |            |       |\n| 3M         | #3xx   |      | Cedar Shingles |     |            |       |\n| 250        | ft.    | 1x4  | #3 F.G.

Indian Residential School.\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-1-5 of the 17th and 18th instant in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nAs requested, the writer checked over this proposed Brooder House plan with Father Comeau, the Principal of the school.\n\nThis building would be a permanent structure, built approximately 70 feet south of the present hen house. There will be a concrete foundation built on solid rock with a wall of cement two feet high on which the wood superstructure will be erected. The concrete sub wall would be lined with Hollow Tile. Air vents below wooden floor are to be provided and this will prevent dampness rising to the floor; and it is also planned to use the chimney as an air ventilator. In this part of Ontario where severe weather prevails, chicken and poultry owners are of the opinion that the wood floor is superior to the concrete; and the majority of the brooder houses which the writer has seen are built on this pattern.\n\nThis Brooder House is of average size and will be well constructed to take care of the 300 chicks. The chicks will be kept in the brooder house until they are three to four months old, having their own run built around the house.\n\nFather Comeau does not intend to keep pigs in this house permanently after the chicks are out, but proposed to use it for this year as he is pressed for room in the barn.\n\nWhat is listed on the Buildings Inventory as a Piggery 10 x 10 is not an out building, but a stall in the stable where the young pigs are kept at present. This barn, by the way, is only large enough for the cattle and horses now on hand. If young pigs are kept for a short time in the brooder house, a rough dwelling will be built over the permanent floor, and the house will be thoroughly cleaned out with disinfectants when pigs are removed.\n\nI strongly advised Father Comeau not to use the proposed building for this purpose, and he stated that this was, of course, his idea as an emergency measure only. The school has suffered heavy losses in chicks during the past due to the poor quarters used; and I am sure this loss could be eliminated in the future by providing a brooder house as outlined.\n\nI trust the foregoing will be of some help and submit same for your consideration.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in further reference to the proposal to build a brooder house at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been very carefully considered but it is difficult for the Department to convince itself that the Principal is making the recommendation that would be in the best interests of the work that he apparently contemplates.\n\nThe plan forwarded to you with our letter of the 16th instant outlined a brooder house which would be suitable for all practical purposes and which would only require an expenditure of approximately $125.00 for material. The building that the Principal now requests would cost approximately $700.00. It would not be any more suitable for use as a brooder house than the much cheaper building just mentioned. It is admitted, of course, that he could accommodate approximately 300 chickens in it, but it would only be necessary to keep them in such a building for a limited time. The building recommended by us would provide more opportunity for training pupils in handling chickens under conditions which they could hope to have at home. Besides, if the building recommended by the Principal were built, there would actually only be accommodation in it for approximately 50 hens.\n\nI am inclined to feel that if the Principal wishes to raise pigs it would be much more desirable to provide some proper accommodation for them rather than the building which he recommends. Dual-purpose buildings are never completely satisfactory.\nI feel that this matter should again be very carefully considered both by the Principal and yourself.\n\nR.A.

The reason given is that a new classroom is being opened. I presume that in opening the classroom the principal is simply providing more accommodation for overcrowded rooms and we are under the impression that possibly he should have on hand sufficient pupils' desks. This is especially true in view of the fact that we have not authorized any increase in the pupilage at this school. Desks are very difficult to secure and before placing an order we would like to be definitely assured that there are no other pupils' desks in the school which could be used and thus avoid the necessity of purchasing new ones.\n\nAn order is being placed for the teacher's desk and chair.\n\nR.A.

Hogg, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nMr. Norman Peterson, Indian Agent, has kindly sent me your letter of November 20th, in which you propose the building of a brooder at the cost of $125.00.\n\nI am sorry to tell you that after having carefully considered this matter and having taken advice from different experts in poultry raising in this country, I have come to the conclusion that the building proposed by Mr. Douglas is not the proper shelter to be used as colony house after brooding time for chicks at the end of three months, but would be of no use here for the three following reasons:\n\n1st. The Miller Co., of Winnipeg forwards their chicks in March when one week old and the latter to be kept at a temperature of 80\u00b0 until the end of May, which means nearly two months of severe winter yet in this country. This will be impossible with a $125.00 building.\n\nActually, at the cost of labor and material, one will not be able to put more than one plinth of lumber, and consequently it will require the time of a man day and night to prevent the chicks from freezing.\n\n2nd. The topography of the surrounding land does not allow a construction of a movable type, the School farm being built on rocks and hills.\n\n3rd. This building is not sufficient to accommodate 500 chicks when they are two months old for then they still have to be kept in on account of the cold weather.\n\nLet us forget about pigs,...I had to kill them being short of place.\n\nAs my chicks are ordered for next March, I consider with anxiety that time is flying. I hate to think that I will have to be in the same predicament as last year and loose half of those valuable chicks. Therefore, I am confident that you will understand my firm stand in insisting on the necessity of my request. It is in the interest of the Indian Department.\n\nWith the best compliment of the season, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely:\n\nC.E. Conner\n\nC.E.

The plan of the brooder house submitted by Lindstrom and Milson is for brooding purposes only, and in no way adapted to protect the chicks as Colony House, or Colony House, as used in Eastern Ontario, can be moved to different locations; but this idea cannot be carried out here owing to the rough character of the surroundings and the extreme cold.\n\nI may also add that the chicks will be housed from the middle of March until the middle of June, when they are allowed to forage and roam at will in the yard.\n\nA letter from Father Comeau, Principal of the Kenora R. C. Indian Residential School, is attached for your information and consideration.\n\nAlthough the cost of the brooder house is high, I believe that over a period of say ten years it will more than pay for itself.\n\nHaving in mind the purpose for which this brooder house will be used, and that a substantial saving can be made through curtailment of losses in chicks, I would recommend that if the full price cannot be authorized that a portion of same be allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario.\nDecember 14th 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-1-5\nof the 2nd instant in connection with the desks\nrequisitioned by the Kenora R. C. Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nI have checked on this matter again, and find\nthat the school has for some time exceeded their quota\nby about 20 pupils, and have been using some large\ndouble desks and odd small tables and benches. A\nnumber of these double desks were second hand when they were\nissued and quite a number are now broken and beyond repair.\n\nThe school has tried to make the best use possible\nof their present seating accommodation, but when the\nclass rooms were altered this last summer, it was thought\nadvisable to see to the comfort of the smaller children;\ntherefore, the small No. 1. desk was asked for.\n\nThe quantity was held to a minimum, and if the\n24 desks as requisitioned for cannot be secured, half\nthe number will help out considerably.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No. 129-1-5\n\nDecember 30, 1943\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Kenora Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 13-491\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

These cannot be refilled with original type of refills and can only be made serviceable by being converted to take later type of refills or replaced. This costs approximately $11.50 each, whereas a new Extinguisher of the lyrene or Guardene type would cost around $13.75 and can be refilled for $.70 cents.\n\nThere are no extinguishers in the barn or Staff House, which should have some protection, especially in the summer.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey I.R.School:\n- 7 Thermone Soda & Acid Old Type 2\u00bd Gal.- Filled & in use.\n- 2 Empty to be filled.\n\nThese were recently converted and recharged at a cost of $11.50 each, and quite some time elapsed before they could be put to use.\n\nThree more extinguishers are required. One in the basement hallway and two in the top floor corridors.\n\nIt appears to me that these Old Type Thermone Extinguishers could be purchased, at considerable less cost, when found necessary to have present ones converted and recharged. In doing so both schools would have similar and standardized equipments.\n\nI would therefore recommend that authority be granted to purchase the following when it is found necessary, after being used, instead of converting and recharging these old type Thermone Fire Extinguishers:\n\nFor St.Mary's I.R.School:\n- 4 Pyrene Acid & Soda 8\u00bd Gal./fire extinguishers.\n- 2 Ditte - One for barn and one for Staff House.\n\nFor Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.School:\n- 7 Pyrene Acid & Soda 8\u00bd Gal./fire extinguishers\n- 2 Ditte - One for basement hallway\n- 2 Ditte - One for top floor corridor\n\nCorrespondence leading up to this inspection is here-with attached.

He wants to get the boys interested in animals and is prepared to pay them a reasonable price for the meat. He thinks the revenue obtained will keep the children interested and the meat can all be used in the school.\n\nFather Comeau estimates it will cost for breeding stock and a small log building fifty dollars ($50.00). May I be advised if the Department is prepared to assist in this undertaking to the amount suggested? Any undertaking of this nature that will keep the children interested and out of the town of Kenora will be well worth while.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, September 7, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n588 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 30, in which you submit a request received by you from Father Comeau, Principal of the Kenora Residential School, for the funds necessary to purchase a number of Giant Flemish Rabbits.\n\nI regret to state that with one single exception - that of Morley, in Alberta - the experiments undertaken by principals of residential schools in the keeping of mink and other such animals have been in no sense successful. However, this appears to be the first occasion when we have had a request for rabbits. In view of the small expenditure involved and the desire on the part of the Department to do everything humanly possible to make training at our residential schools practical and well worth while, you may authorise an amount not exceeding $50.00 for the purchase of rabbits at this school.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKenora Agency, September 7th to 9th.\n\nKenora R.C., Indian Residential School and Buildings: - The school is an old building with a new fire-proof wing recently built\u2014used for dormitories. The old section has been remodelled and adjusted to provide ample classroom space. Rather Comeau, the Principal, is very bitter against the Branch for refusing to pay the cost of the alterations. If money is available, I would recommend that some arrangement be made. He is very pleased with the new brooder house and the grant for the construction of a pigery. The new wing has not been finished inside. Plastering and decorating should be done at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe barns and stables are all in fairly good condition. The farm is small and difficult to work, as it consists of small cultivated areas, very rocky. A great deal of hard work is being done by the Principal and his staff and they deserve a lot of credit for the good condition of the buildings and property. The vegetable garden is particularly good\u2014consisting of every variety of vegetable that can be grown.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nKENORA, ONT  November 25th .... 1944\n\nNorman Paterson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nFollowing our custom of previous years of paying occasional visits to the two Indian residential schools located just outside of our Town limits, I wish to report on the conditions found regarding the safety of the lives of the inmates as well as on the protection of the valuable property involved in these large buildings.\n\nIn the St. Mary's school the recent alterations made have interfered with the location of one of the fire escapes and also with the fire hose standards in the building; these two items should be attended to as soon as possible; there is also the need of a fire door in the door that leads to the west side boiler room and one that leads out of the Boys dormitory out to the corridor of the old building.\n\nThe fire hose connections are not connected on account of two different threads being supplied; a reducer from the two and a half inch to the one and a half inch thread connection is required, and the pupils should be given more frequent fire drills and be made acquainted with the proper handling of all the fire protection appliances and apparatus.\n\nIn the Cecilia Jeffrey school much needed alterations are required on the fire escapes particularly on the ones leading out from the dormitories; the present approaches to the fire escapes can be very largely improved upon and I would recommend that immediate attention be given to these safety appliances.\n\nThe fire alarm systems in both these schools can be improved upon especially in the St. Mary's school where the fire alarm bell most is practically useless; an alarm system should be installed which can be heard in any section of the building.\n\nVery serious occurrences have taken place in several institutions in this Country where lives and property were lost for the want of special attention along the lines as mentioned by the Superintendents and Teachers in charge of both these institutions; I am very attentive to things pertaining to the safety of the pupils and the way have very excellent fire drill programs in operation and anything in which I can assist in this work in the two schools I am sure that I shall be only too pleased to render all the assistance I can in the interest of the safety of the inmates as well as the property concerned in these institutions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChief Fire Officer\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nFire Protection - Indian Residential Schools.\n\nOn November 23rd and 24th, the writer, accompanied by Mr. F. Dubois, Chief of the Kenora Fire Department, inspected the Cecilia Jeffrey and Kenora (R.C.) Indian Residential Schools.\n\nChief Dubois' report covering these inspections is attached herewith, for your information.\n\nThe fire hose connections in the Kenora R.C.I.R. School are not of one size and of very little use in their present condition. It is very important that this be remedied immediately, and instructions have been given Mr. Dubois to go ahead and have these connections standardized, and would recommend that the small expenditure to be incurred be authorized.\n\nWhen conditions warrant, I would strongly urge that the major items noted in this report be given attention.\n\nNorman Watson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 1, 1944.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing report from the Chief of the Kenora Fire Department on the Kenora Residential School. In regard to this school he writes as follows:\n\n\"In the St. Mary's School the recent alterations made have interfered with the location of one of the fire escapes and also with the fire hose standards in the building. These two items should be attended to as soon as possible. There is also the need of a fire door in the door that leads to the west side boiler room and one that leads out of the boys' dormitory out to the corridor of the old building.\n\n\"The fire hose connections are not connected on account of two different threads being supplied. A reducer from the two and a half inch to the one and a half inch thread connection is required, and the pupils should be given more frequent fire drills and be made acquainted with the proper handling of all the fire protection appliances and apparatus.\n\n\"The fire alarm systems in both these schools can be improved upon, especially in the St. Mary's School, where the fire alarm equipment is practically useless. An alarm system should be installed that will be heard in any section of the building.\"\n\nIn regard to the above, you mention only the fire hose connections, and it is noted that you have authorized Mr. Dubois to standardize these. I would appreciate a report on the other recommendations of the Fire Chief, giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSt. Mary's Res.

Until now we have managed under very trying and more than provisory conditions which are becoming impossible.\n\nThis requisition seems to deserve your prompt approval as it coincides with your suggestion of which in your letter to the Agent, dated Nov. 25, 1943, File No. 129-1-5, (1 quote): \"I am inclined to feel that if the Principal wishes to raise pigs it would be much more desirable to provide some proper accommodations for them rather than the building which he recommended.\"\n\nI am therefore forwarding plans and specifications for said accommodations.

We now have more and under very trying circumstances than ever before. I am sure you will agree.\n\nIn order to make it easier, I have attached a proposal as it coincides with your instructions. In the letter to the effect, dated Nov. 5th, 1946, \"We shall see,\" (signature), \"I am inclined to feel that if the school had been able to do so, it should be made possible to provide some proper accommodation rather than the killing which no reasonable person would want.\"\n\nI am therefore forwarding plans and specifications for said accommodations.

It is our intention to consider the matter further, but before doing so we would like to have an expression of opinion from you regarding the advisability of raising pigs on the scale which the Reverend Principal evidently intends. Has he feed available or will he have to purchase all the feed required? If the latter is the case, it might mean that raising pigs at the Kenora School would not be a very profitable venture. As a general rule we do not desire Principals of residential schools to go into the pig raising business on a commercial basis, as we feel that if only sufficient pigs are raised to provide food for the school elaborate buildings are not absolutely essential.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKenora (R.C.) I.R. School\n\n(1) Hose connections - Chief Dubois recommends that all fire hose connections be standardized, and also that two of the fire hose reels now in place, be replaced to a more efficient service position in the building. The connections are now being standardized by Chief Dubois and should be completed in a few days. The cost should not exceed $25.00.\n\n(2) Fire escapes - The old iron fire escape installed on the south west side of main building, has never been extended to ground, and requires an additional 20 feet. This extension would cost approximately $100.00.\n\n(3) Fire doors - A fire door is required to replace present door leading from the boiler house to the boys dormitory, also a fire door to replace present door leading from the boys dormitory to corridor and exit. Two new fire doors would cost approximately $60.00.\n\n(4) Fire alarms - A fire alarm system should be installed that could be heard anywhere in the building at a probable cost of $100.00, and an auxiliary bell in case the electric unit was out of order.\n\n(5) Fire Extinguishers - There are twelve Soda and Acid Type fire extinguishers in the building, well placed and sufficient to take care of emergencies.\n\n(6) Electric wiring - The entire wiring set up in this building should be thoroughly inspected by a competent inspector.\n\nDecember 6th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs (RCIC), Volume 105, File 145-25, Page 10\n\nNorman Patterson\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept' of Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Fire Protection- Indian Res.

Schools, it has been noted that the drinking water facilities are not only antiquated, but most dangerous to the health of the pupils.\n\nThis condition had been noted on previous inspections but owing to other matters pertaining to the fire protection and safety measures being brought up to standard, the report on this matter had been postponed.\n\nThe pupils at the Kenora R.C.I.R. School have access to one only water tap on the hand basin placed near the door of toilet and wash room. The pupils at the Cecilia Jeffrey I.R. School have access to much the same contrivance, placed in the dormitories alongside of the wash basins.\n\nDuring the last T.B. Clinic held in Kenora, one pupil from each school was recommended for attendance to sanatoriums. In view of the unsanitary conditions of the present arrangements in both schools, I thought it best to submit a report immediately. The principals of both schools have readily agreed that a few drinking fountains placed in the most convenient sections of the schools would certainly be helpful in guarding the health of the pupils.\n\nThe Willmar Bronze Company of Kenora, have advised that a wall type of drinking fountain, suitable for the schools, could probably be purchased at a price ranging from $10.00 to $40.00 each, and would cost approximately $4.00 to $6.00 to install, by their local plumber.\n\nThe Kenora R.C.I.R. School would require 5 fountains:\n\n- 1 - \"canteen\" - 1 - \"playroom\"\n- 1 - \"playroom\"\n- 1 - \"reception room\"\n\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.

On March 1, 1945, a memorandum was submitted to the Deputy Minister's office, recommending the plastering and wiring of the Kenora School and also the purchase of the equipment required from the Williams Hardware Company. This recommendation was approved by the Minister.\n\nI would therefore appreciate your issuing purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 465 - 76 - 10-691.\n\nAs we desire to pay this account from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1944-45, your immediate attention to the matter would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept' of Mines & Resources\nOttawa,\n\nTo: Inspector of Indian Affairs, C.E.C. 03\nKenora, Ontario\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Affairs, C.E.C. 03 for\nManitoba, and the writer, visited the Cecilia Jeffrey and Kenora\nI.C. Residential schools on the 26th instant.\n\nWhile at the Kenora I.C. School, the work on the dormitories was inspected. Plastering is to commence on Monday April 30th.\n\nDuring this inspection, the question of installing ventilation in\nthe dormitories was discussed, and it was pointed out by Mr.\nBoux, the contractor, that it would be advisable to do this job\nnow, while he is there with his men. It was agreed that some\nventilation was very necessary. This work should be done before\nthe plastering is commenced, as considerable cutting through the\nceiling and wall will be necessary, and additional expense would\nbe incurred if it were done after all the plastering is finished.\n\nThe Fife Hardware Company was asked to install a straight\nventilator intake in the ceiling of the girls' dormitory at a cost of\napproximately $60.00 and to install an electrical fan assembly\nin the wall of the boys' dormitory at a cost of approximately $125.00.\n\nReverend Father G.E. Comeau has also asked that some\nadditional plastering be done while Mr. Boux has his men at the\nschool. This work consists of patching the ceiling in the classroom; plastering four walls of the Sisters' dining room (2x14 where\nthe plaster is falling off badly); plastering walls of basement\nhallway; and repairing odd patches throughout the school. Mr. Boux\nhas stated that this can be done at a cost of $100.00. Were this work\nto be undertaken at a later date, the cost would probably exceed\nthe figures as quoted, by approximately $100.00.\n\nThere is no doubt that these are very essential repairs\nand if this work was proceeded with while the plasterers and the\nmaterial was at hand, considerable expense would be saved.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the several installations and the additional plastering and repairs be undertaken,\nand if funds are available that authority be granted to proceed\nwith the work as outlined.\n\nNorman Paterson\nin the name of...\nOttawa, May 2, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the Kenora Indian Residential School. In view of the contents of your letter, the Department approves the purchase of the ventilator and electric fan, at a total cost of $165.00. We also approve your arranging for the plastering repairs, at a cost of $350.00. The expenditure in the latter regard should be forwarded under cover of a special voucher. It should not be included in the voucher which you will have to submit later for the balance due L. Bour & Son for plastering the new addition.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood, both by the Principal and yourself, that the Department feels we have dealt reasonably in arranging for the new plastering and wiring and in authorizing the expenditures approved in this letter. Consequently, it is hoped that the Principal will realize that we have many other schools for which we have to provide improvements, and we will therefore be unable to consider additional demands from the Kenora School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTO: The Department of Indian Affairs\n\nRE: St.Mary's Indian School Fire Escape.\n\nFROM: S. Onderheim,\nBlacksmith,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nApproximate cost of new fire escape erected at St.Mary's Indian School.\n\nFirst plan of fire escape called for a 15-foot extension from the present landing. This, on further examination was found to be impracticable and the escape has been made 6' x 13' landing and 9' double rail stairs.\n\nBecause of the size of the landing and stairs extra heavy brackets and also ground posts had to be used to carry the weight on the wall brackets. This job as first designed has been considerably altered and is constructed according to underwriter's specifications.\n\nNo definite estimate of cost could be arrived at when taking on this job owing to the difficulty in getting proper materials and labour.\n\nWe can now give you the cost of material including bolts and spacers.\n\n| MATERIAL | $325.00 |\n|----------|---------|\n| LABOUR making and erecting same | $380.00 |\n| TOTAL | $715.00 |\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Fire escape - Kenora R.C.I.R. School.\n\nIn my report on fire protection at the above noted school, dated December 6th, 1944, file 108-11, it was noted therein, under heading - Kenora R.C.I.R. School -(2) Fire Escapes - that an extension to the old escape would cost approximately \u00a3100.00.\n\nThis estimated cost has been greatly underestimated. On receipt of your authority 129-1-5, dated Ottawa, October 11th, 1944, Mr. Sam Osterheim was asked to go ahead with this work and the cost was based on the making of a short extension to the old escape, without the platform or bracing, and on a later check up it was found necessary to lengthen the ladder and build a landing.\n\nOn inquiring from Mr. Osterheim if this work was about finished, he informed me that it was ready to install. At that time I first received estimate was far too low. I then asked him to submit a better estimate for the department's information. Copies in duplicate of this estimate will be found attached herewith.\n\nIt is regretted that the initial estimate was so far out of line and that I was not aware of this earlier. If this work is completed and ready to install and also that it will provide much needed safety to the children, I would recommend, if funds are available, that Mr. Osterheim be given authority to install this escape as presently constructed.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 12, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the fire escape at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nAs you state in your letter, your original estimate was $100.00. It now appears that the total cost for the fire escape that is considered necessary will be $715.00. I note that you mention you were not advised earlier of the increased cost. Should this information have been given to you by the man from whom you obtained the original quotation, or did the Principal neglect to notify you? You can realise that the very greatly increased cost places this office in an awkward position. Is it possible to secure prices from someone else, and are you definitely assured that all the work proposed is essential?\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this matter very careful consideration and again consult the Principal. We realise that children must be protected, but at the same time we have expended a great deal of money at the Kenora School within the last two or three months, and even as recently as the 2nd instant we authorised additional expenditure.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Kenora, inspected April 26th, 1945.\n\nThis school is allowed 85 grant-earning pupils, but the enrolment shows 96. They were all well dressed, clean and neat in appearance. The classroom work was well done and the pupils are making fair progress.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and plumbing in good condition; the new wing is to be plastered; in fact the preliminary work had started. There was no ventilation provided when the building was erected and Mr. Paterson was strongly advised to provide this at once before the weather started. He had authorized the expenditure and the ceiling ventilator was being installed on the day I arrived. I advise Mr. Paterson to notify Ottawa at once concerning the probable cost and to point out why it was an emergency. Undoubtedly the work can best be done now and the cost will be less.\n\nThe old part of the building is in poor condition and a lot of material and labor is required to put it in good shape. The floors are rough and badly worn; consequently, difficult to keep clean. A quantity of battleship linoleum should be provided. To cover the floors outlined by the Principal about $25 yards would be needed. In any event a start should be made and I would recommend the following, amounting to approximately three sixty-yard rolls, double A (AA) quality, 6 feet wide, together with felt base and cement:\n\n| Corridor          | 75 ft. long 5 ft. wide |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Cross corridor    | 16 \" \" 9 \" \"           |\n| Girls' playroom   | 25 \" \" 18 \" \"          |\n| Chapel            | 44 \" \" 4 \" \"           |\n| Cross corridor    | 10 \" \" 4 \" \"           |\n\nA number of partitions have been changed and the wall board and V joint badly need painting. The chapel floors are also almost void of paint. I would recommend that the following quantities be supplied:\n\n- 20 gals. of Inside White Paint,\n- 5 \" \" Cream \" \"\n- 6 \" \" Light Oak Floor paint.\n\nThe room used by the visiting parents looks bad. The walls are in need of paint and a new floor needed. The present one is badly worn and impossible to clean because of the wide cracks. The room is 30'x20'. I understand fir flooring is available at Kenora. There is other repair work to do which will require some material. The Principal would like the following, if it could be supplied:\n\n- V joint - 1000 ft.\n- Shiplap - 1000 ft.\n- Dimension 2x4 - 1000 ft.\n- Cement - 25 bags.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, May 16, 1945.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.

I am also writing Agent Paterson\nauthorizing him to purchase 5 gallons of roof cement.\n\nNo action is being taken at the present\ntime with reference to the linoleum.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReverend Father Comeau did not press for this much needed protection at the time it was proposed, but as Fire Chief Dubois strongly urged this, and believing it to be very essential, I recommended same in my report.\n\nThis fire escape and landing is now completed and is ready to be erected at the school, and as considerable labor and expense has been assumed by Mr. Onerheim, I would, even though admitting the difficult position I have placed your Department in, recommend that the work be proceeded with, and you may rest assured, that in the future, greater care will be exercised when asking for estimates and prices covering all work of this kind.\n\nNorman Paterson\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nRe: Fire escape\nKenora R.C.I.R. School\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of our 126-11 dated Ottawa 1st March, in connection with the above noted matter, I had explained the discrepancy in the original estimated cost of the escape, and the last detailed cost as given by Mr. Sam Onerheim, I would like to add these further comments and explanation.\n\nWhen submitting my report re fire protection at the Indian Residential Schools, under 106-11 dated December 6th, 1947, it was suggested that the present fire escape on the south side of the school be extended to the ground, and fire doors installed in the building. Lindstrom & Wilson, local contractors, were asked to estimate on the fire doors to where they were there were asked to arrange for the erecting of the addition to the fire escape, and at that time gave me verbally a rough estimate of the cost, which was $100.00 or more, and a written estimate was received, Lindstrom & Wilson, fire doors, $150.00, and fire escape, $100.00. It was stated that the fire escape would require additional materials and after obtaining the material proceeded with the construction of the escape and the landing, having understood that the total cost would be $250.00. This work was completed and I was advised of the approximate cost, which far exceeded the first estimate I had received verbally from Lindstrom & Wilson. I immediately informed Mr. Onerheim submit the detailed cost of the escape and platform as it is presently constructed, as I knew some follow-up had been made of this transaction.\n\nMr. Onerheim is in no way to blame, nor is anyone else to blame. As I see it now the mistake was made in Mr. Lindstrom & Wilson giving me a verbal estimate on something that I am not familiar with, and I fully admit this was a matter, not having come to my attention at the proper time, and considerable embarrassment to all concerned and more especially to the department.\n\nMr. Onerheim has been constructing and erecting fire escapes for a number of years, and he informs me that the builder, Mr. Lindstrom, of Winnipeg, had quoted him the following prices on his work:\n\nConstruction & Erection\nof double railed escape - $14.00 per ft\nConstruction of platform\n12 x 6 per sq.ft. - $5.00 to $6.00\n\nSimilar work has been done by Mr. Onerheim at the Hotel Kenora, the Kenora Post Office and the Cecilia Jeffrey School, and as he was highly recommended by Lindstrom & Wilson, competitive prices were not asked for.\nOttawa, May 29, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the fire escape at the Kenora Indian Residential School. The contents of your letter have been discussed with the Acting Director, Mr. Hoey, and we regret that the matter has been allowed to proceed so far without further communicating with the Department.\n\nHowever, I presume the fire escape was necessary and evidently it has been already constructed. The Department is prepared to consider payment of its cost, and I understand the voucher will be issued in favour of Mr. Sam Onerheim.\n\nIt would make it easier for us to have the account passed for payment if you would attach to the voucher complete details regarding the cost of the material and also a statement regarding the labour. The latter should include the number of hours or days that the workmen were employed and the rate per hour or per day.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRe: Kenora R.C.I.H.

Patterson\nIndian Agent\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have done the plastering of the new wing of St. Mary's Indian School, according to the contract made with the Department of which you are the agent.\n\nAfter this work was done, I was asked to fix certain places which were nearly falling; this was done with your permission and that of the Department.\n\nWhile repairing in the old building, I found many places which would need to be plastered; the coat of repairing in a few years would be more than doubled, on account the continued deterioration.\n\nTo do this work I would need some $250.00.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to ask you if you would authorize me to complete the work already started.\n\nI am sure you will understand my request, which I make only in the interest of the school, for although I have appreciated your contract and I am very thankful for it\u2014this additional work, at a time when we are so busy, does not represent so much for me.\n\nI hope you will be able to give a favourable answer.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Ltd) Louis Loux.\nKenora, Ontario,\n\nJune 14, 1945\n\nA letter has been received from Reverend Father J.J. Thomas, Principal Kenora R.C.I.R. School, requesting that an additional sum of $250.00 be authorized to cover plastering which is over and above the last grant of $350.00, your 129-1-5 dated Ottawa May 2nd.\n\nYou specifically requested that I refrain from making any additional expenditure at this juncture at the present time, and I will not and cannot consent, except to say that a job of this kind is uncertain by any contractor; they never can tell in advance where the work is to end, or what may turn up when tearing down old plaster.\n\nThe new plastering job in the dormitories, is a great improvement and is a sound job, in itself, and will be so.\n\nFather Thomas's letter and also a letter from Mr. Louis Doux, the contractor, is herewith submitted for your information.\n\nNorman Salter,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14, 1945.\n\nMr. H. Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to further plastering at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nThe original contract was for $2,754.75. When we wrote you on January 5 we did not limit the amount of plastering to be done and consequently when you submitted the quotation from Mr. Boux, under cover of your letter of January 24, we presumed that he was quoting on all the plastering that was necessary.\n\nSubsequently, in your letter of April 27, you brought to our attention additional plastering and, in spite of the fact that our funds were limited, we approved an extra expenditure of $350.00.\n\nI now note from your letter of the 12th instant that the Principal states there is still more plastering to be done. It is difficult to understand why this was not included in either of the other two requests, so that the Department could have had the full picture before then before deciding whether, or not, funds would be available.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the request of Father Comeau in his letter of June 8, which you have just forwarded, and it is regretted that owing to lack of funds a favourable reply cannot be given.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSt. Mary's Res.

School Kenora Ont.\nJune 27th, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am really sorry to hear that the Indian Department has refused to consider our request for the building of an hog-pen at the St. Mary's Res. School. Such a building is indeed a necessity.\n\nMy intention is to raise the amount of pigs necessary to provide the school with enough meat for the whole year. For this purpose, it requires from about twenty to thirty pigs. Actually there is no provision made for a single one. The cow-barn and the chicken coop, already too small, have been used for raising pigs. This, you will understand, is an irregular situation.\n\nThe hog-pen I have asked for will be just large enough to serve the purpose.\n\nTherefore, I feel assured that the Department will give this request a favorable answer.\n\nSincerely yours, C.E. Comeau O.M.I., Principal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nKenora\nJUN 28 1945\nIndian Affairs\nSt. Mary's Res., School Kenora Ont.\nJune 27th, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Peterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Education Department has refused to allow our request for the building of an hog-pen at the school. The reason given is indeed a valid one.\n\nIn addition to raising chickens, it is necessary to provide the school with meat for the next year. For this purpose, it requires from two to three acres. Actually there is no provision made for a single acre in the chicken coop, already too small, have been used for this purpose. You will understand is an irregular situation.\n\nThe hog-pen I have asked for will be just large enough to serve the purpose. Therefore, I feel assured that the Department will be disposed to a favorable view.\n\nSincerely yours: C.E. Compton, Principal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.E. Compton, Principal\n\n[Seal]\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept't of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa.\n\nJUL 6\n\nRe: Log Pen - Kenora R.C.I.R. School\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-1-5 dated Ottawa, December 7th, 1944, in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nFor your information, the attached letter from Reverend Father C.E. Comeau, will further explain the need for this building at the school. Substantial aid to the school is derived through the raising of logs; in fact, the school is kept supplied, and the surplus, if any, sold, the proceeds being used to purchase other necessary school requirements.\n\nThe construction of a log pen, as covered by estimates and specifications submitted by Mr. and Mrs. Wilson and by Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, of Kenora, would fill a long felt want, in so far as providing accommodation for more, apart from the crowded conditions prevailing at present.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted for your information and consideration and if funds are available, I would recommend that this request have your favorable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNorman Patterson  \nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 12, 1945.\n\nMr. H. Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the previous request of the Principal of the Kenora Residential School for material to erect a hog-pen at a cost of approximately $2,200.00.\n\nVery careful consideration has again been given to this request, and in view of the heavy expenditure that we have made at this school during the current fiscal year, it is not possible for us to consider a further amount as large as that required for the hog-pen.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE 30th, 1945, ON KENORA INDIAN AGENCY\n\nSchools:\n\nSeveral inspections have been made during past 3 months, at both Residential Schools. Schools have been found to be well conducted internally, orderly and clean. New Boiler has been installed in Cecilia Jeffrey I.R. School and the boiler house has now been made clean & tidy. The old Spencer Boiler has been insulated and will be used as a stand by; hot water Tank has also been insulated.\n\nThe contract of plastering the boys' and girls' Dormitories and other plaster work at the Kenora R.C. IR School has been completed. This has made a wonderful improvement to these dormitories, and a first class job made. Two ventilators were installed, one in each Dormitory.\n\nThe Kenora R.C. IR School closed for summer vacation on the 20th June and the Cecilia Jeffrey School on the 22nd to 24th June. In this Agency, where many of the parents of pupils come long distances to get their children at school closing time, it is desirable and has been the habit in the past, to have both IR. Schools close on the same day. This avoids confusion among the Indian Parents or any hostility and non-co-operation.\n\nNorman Peterson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nre: Drinking Fountains for Schools.\n\nYour 129-1-b dated Ottawa February 28th, 1945, requested that the matter of purchasing fountains for the Residential Schools in Kenora be taken up early in July.\n\nFollowing up on my report in connection with the need for these drinking fountains, in my 106-11 dated February 23rd, I would recommend, if funds are available, that these fountains be installed in the schools as outlined therein.\n\nNorman Paterson\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSt. Mary's Indian School\nKenora, Ontario\nJuly 26th 1945\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am making a request to the Indian Department through you, for 300 feet rubber hose (1\u00bd inch) for St. Mary's Indian School.\n\nWe are very thankful for the setting up of fire escapes and fire-fighting equipment for the building itself; and it is provide adequate protection also to the outside buildings, barn & stable that I am making the above request.\n\nWith this fire fighting equipment to protect Government property, I feel that we will be adequately protected against fire hazards.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nST.

School\n\nSome time ago we were advised by the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests, Kenora, that they had on hand a large quantity of standard 1\u00bd inch canvas rubber lined fire hose which was available at 30 cents per foot, which was considerably less than the usual cost.\n\nLater an occasion occurred where fire equipment at the school, it was found that 300 feet of hose would give adequate protection to the needs of the school buildings, by hooking up to the water system at the back of the school.\n\nTherefore, Mr. J. Johnson's request in a letter attached, in view of the additional protection to the school property, I shall recommend that authority be granted to purchase 300 feet of standard 1\u00bd inch canvas rubber lined fire hose, from the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests, at 30 cents per foot.\n\nNorman Paterson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the drinking fountains at the Cecilia Jeffrey and the Kenora Residential Schools.\n\nIn your letter of February 23rd you stated that the Williams Hardware Company, Kenora, have a drinking fountain suitable for the schools and that the fountains could be purchased at a price ranging from $30.00 to $40.00.

Mr. Onerheim had completed a contract with your department prior to his death and the account for the same remains outstanding. Mr. Paterson the Indian Agent at Kenora advises us that he wrote you under date of November 22nd concerning the same.\n\nWe are taking the liberty of writing you again direct to ask if you could advise us when the cheque will be forthcoming. We may say that this account represents the only liquid asset of the estate which was a very small one. Mrs. Onerheim is depending upon this cheque for payment of funeral expenses and certain other items outstanding. She is therefore hopeful that the matter may be completed in the near future.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate it therefore, if you could expedite this matter as much as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBEN DICKSON & McLENNAN\n\nL.MoL/P per A.A. McLennan\nOttawa, December 21, 1945.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to an amount due the Samuel Onerheim Estate. It is hoped to be able to pay this account in the near future. The delay has been due to the fact that the expenditure was much greater than originally authorized and as a consequence we have had considerable correspondence with the Indian Agent, which delayed payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMessrs. Benidickson & McLennan,\nBarristers,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario,\nMay 7th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe - Fire escape - Kenora R.C.\nI.R. School,\n\nIn my report on Fire Protection at the above noted school, dated December 6th, 1944, File 108-11, it was noted therein, under heading - Kenora R.C. I.R. School -(2) Fire Escapes - that the extension to the old escape would cost approximately $100.00.\n\nThis estimated cost has been greatly underestimated. On receipt of your authority 129-1-5 dated Ottawa December 11th, 1944, Mr. Sam Onerheim was asked to go ahead with this work and the cost was based on the making of a short extension to the old escape, without the platform or bracing; and on a later check up it was found necessary to lengthen the ladder and build a landing.\n\nOn inquiring from Mr. Onerheim if this work was about finished, he informed me that it was ready to install and that his first rough estimate was far too low. I then asked him to submit a detailed estimate for the Department's information. Copies in duplicate of this estimate with a rough sketch of work is attached herewith.\n\nIt is regretted that the initial estimate was so far out of line and that I was not advised of this earlier. As this work is completed and ready to install and also that it will provide much needed safety to the children, I would recommend, if funds are available, that Mr. Onerheim be given authority to install this escape as presently constructed.\n\nNorman Paterson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 18, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the fire escape at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nAs you state in your letter, your original estimate was $100.00. It now appears that the total cost for the fire escape that is considered necessary will be $715.00. I note that you mention you were not advised earlier of the increased cost. Should this information have been given to you by the man from whom you obtained the original quotation, or did the Principal neglect to notify you? You can realise that the very greatly increased cost places this office in an awkward position. Is it possible to secure prices from someone else, and are you definitely assured that all the work proposed is essential?\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this matter very careful consideration and again consult the Principal. We realise that children must be protected, but at the same time we have expended a great deal of money at the Kenora School within the last two or three months, and even as recently as the 2nd instant we authorized additional expenditure.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Onerheim is in no way to blame, nor is Reverend Father Comeau. As I see it now the mistake was made in having Lindstrom & Nilson give me a verbal estimate on something they probably were not familiar with, and I fully admit this whole matter, not having come to my attention at the proper time, has caused considerable embarrassment to all concerned and more especially to the Department.\n\nMr. Onerheim has been constructing and erecting\nKenora, Ontario\nMay 18th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Fire escape, Kenora R.C. I.R. School\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-1-5 dated Ottawa May 12th, in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nFurther to my 106-11 dated the 7th instant, wherein I had explained the discrepancy in the original estimated cost of the escape, and the last detailed cost as given me, by Mr. Sam Onerheim, I would like to add these further comments and explanation.\n\nWhen submitting my report re fire protection at the Indian Residential Schools, under 106-11 dated December 6th, 1944, it was suggested that the present fire escape on the south side of the school be extended to the ground, and fire doors also installed in the building. Lindstrom and Nilson, local contractors, were asked to estimate on the fire doors and while they were there were asked to arrange for the erecting of the extension to the fire escape, and at that time gave me verbally a rough estimate of the cost, which was $100.00 or more. This was shown on my report.\n\nWhen your authority 129-1-5 dated December 11th, 1944, was received, Lindstrom and Nilson was instructed to install the fire doors and they in turn had Mr. Onerheim check on the proposed extension to the escape. Mr. Onerheim on a later check up, found that a more substantial structure was required and after getting the material, proceeded with the construction of the escape and the landing, having understood that he was to go ahead with the job. When this work was completed I was advised by Mr. Onerheim of the approximate cost, which far exceeded the first estimate I had received verbally from Lindstrom & Nilson. I immediately had Mr. Onerheim submit the detailed cost of the escape and platform as it is presently constructed, as I knew some ball-up had been made of this transaction.\n\nMr. Onerheim is in no way to blame, nor is Reverend Father Comeau. As I see it now the mistake was made in having Lindstrom & Nilson give me a verbal estimate on something they probably were not familiar with, and I fully admit this whole matter, not having come to my attention at the proper time, has caused considerable embarrassment to all concerned and more especially to the Department.\n\nMr. Onerheim has been constructing and erecting\nfire escapes for a number of years, and he informs me that the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works, of Winnipeg, had quoted him the following prices on this work -\n\nConstruction & Erection of double railed escape - $14.00 per ft.\n\nConstruction of platform 18-6 x 6 -per sq. ft. - $5.00 to 6.00\n\nSimilar work has been done by Mr. Onerheim at the Hotel Kenricia, the Kenora Post Office and the Cecilia Jeffrey School, and as he was highly recommended by Lindstrom & Nilson, competitive prices were not asked for.\n\nReverend Father Comeau did not press for this much needed protection at the time it was proposed, but as Fire Chief Dabois strongly urged this, and believing it to be very essential, I recommended same in my report.\n\nThis fire escape and landing is now completed and is ready to be erected at the school, and as considerable labor and expense has been assumed by Mr. Onerheim, I would, even though admitting the difficult position I have placed Mr. Dabois in, recommend that the work be proceeded with, and you may rest assured, that in the future greater care will be exercised when asking for estimates and prices covering all work of this kind.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 29, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the fire escape at the Kenora Indian Residential School. The contents of your letter have been discussed with the Acting Director, Mr. Hoey, and we regret that the matter has been allowed to proceed so far without further communicating with the Department.\n\nHowever, I presume the fire escape was necessary and evidently it has been already constructed. The Department is prepared to consider payment of its cost, and I understand the voucher will be issued in favour of Mr. Sam Onerheim.\n\nIt would make it easier for us to have the account passed for payment if you would attach to the voucher complete details regarding the cost of the material and also a statement regarding the labour. The latter should include the number of hours or days that the workmen were employed and the rate per hour or per day.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nTO San Onorato's Estate,\nc/o Donaldson & McLennan,\nKapuskasing, Ont.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nSHIP TO Already received\n\nF.O.S.

At that time we were hopeful that we might avoid probating the will or Mr Omerheim and we requested that the cheque come through payable to Mrs Omerheim.\n\nSince that time, however, we have found it necessary to proceed with probate and we would suggest therefore, that you send in the account as it has been rendered.

Hamilton inspected this school on January 24th last, the Reverend Father discussed the matter of additional furniture and floor-covering as outlined in the attached requisition, and he was requested by Mr. A.G. Hamilton to submit requisition at a later date.\n\nConsiderable repairs and alterations have been completed at the school, to the advantage to both pupils and staff, and the school now is in excellent shape, clean, fresh and orderly. A great deal of hard work has been put into the effort by the Principal and his staff, and I would recommend that if funds are available, the expenditure covering the attached requisition be given your consideration and approval.\n\n[Signature]\nNorman Selwyn\nIndian Agent.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition and find that all the items listed therein are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial schools.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 615\nR. 2717\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate March 25, 1946\n\nFor Murray R.C.\n\nSchool ST.

School.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your 129-1-5,\ndated the 20th instant, in connection with floor\ncovering for the above noted school, and your request\nthat this be reconsidered.\n\nWhen visiting the school yesterday, I checked\nover the rooms and hallways with Father Lacelle. The\nattached report on the requirements of floor covering\nfor the rooms and hallways is submitted for your\ninformation and guidance.\n\nIt will be noted in the attached report on the\ncondition of the rooms, that generally, the floors are\nin very poor shape, and although this condition will in\nno way affect the general routine of the school, it is,\nI believe, from a health and sanitary angle, essential\nthat these old cracked and splintered floors be covered.\nThe saving in labour in washing and keeping the floors\nfree from sand, dirt and dust, would be considerable,\nthus contributing to the health of the pupils, and the\ngeneral cleanliness of the school.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted for\nyour reconsideration.\n\nNorman Watson\nIndian agent.\nReport on Requirements for Floors at R.C. School\n\nSchool Dispensary. Room 10X14 situated on main floor in old part of building. Present flooring in very poor shape, badly cracked, splintered with wide open cracks and worn down in places. Requires floor covering if at all possible.\n\nStaff Room - 2 - Rooms 10X14 situated on main floor, in old part of building. In same shape as above noted room. Requires floor covering if at all possible.\n\nOffice. Missionary Room 10X14 situated on main floor of old building. In same condition as above noted rooms. Requires floor covering if at all possible.\n\nMain Entrances Hallways. Two hallways 10X14 situated on main floor in old part of building. In same condition as above noted. Requires floor covering if at all possible. Old worn linoleum can be partially used for stair treads.\n\nMain Floor Hallway. Hallway on main floor approximately 6' X 76'. About 20 feet situated in new part of main building, in fair condition, balance in old building in very poor shape, cracked, worn and splintered badly. Requires floor covering throughout hall if at all possible.\n\nMain floor hallway extension. Hallway 6' X 28' in old part of building in same shape as above hallway and requires floor covering if at all possible.\n\nGirls' Playroom. 2nd. floor. Room 20' X 34'. Situated on second floor of old building. This is at present covered by 30 Maple, in very poor condition. Very wide open cracks, splintered and uneven. This room, although in need of a floor covering, could be covered at a later date, if unable to authorize the full expenditure at the present time.\nOttawa, April 3, 1946.\n\nMr. W. Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing statement regarding request of the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School for linoleum.\n\nIn view of the information given in your letter regarding the condition of the floors in the rooms mentioned, it is considered undesirable to supply linoleum. When floors are cracked and in many cases, with wide open cracks, it is simply useless to supply linoleum as it will not stick, and in a short time the condition of the floors would be no better than they are today.\n\nEvidently, the condition of the floors in certain rooms is very bad and it is felt that it would be preferable to install new floors. Can you obtain lumber locally? If so, obtain a quotation and forward for our consideration. When submitting the quotation you should state the name of the firm from whom the quotation has been obtained.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, April 5, 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\n76 Allotment 12-4-15\n\nSHIP TO Reverend Chas.

School.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your 129-1-5, dated the 3rd instant, in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nYour remarks concerning the inadvisability of covering the old cracked floors with linoleum, have been noted.\n\nSince my last report was submitted, dealing with the floors and the necessity of having them covered, I had in mind that you had considered purchasing Double A Battleship Linoleum, and not ordinary infield linoleum. I agree that the latter type of covering would not stand up.\n\nDouble A, Battleship Linoleum, if purchased and laid, would outlast even a Maple floor. On an old floor, a coating of cement is laid which fills all cracks and depressions. Then on top of heavy felt paper is laid. It is in turn coated with the floor covering. Then the linoleum is laid.\n\nThe old floor in the agency office was in very bad shape and an excellent job was done by covering with the Battleship Linoleum.\n\nA copy of a quotation from Lindstrom & Wilsons, of Kenora, Ontario, is attached hereto for your information.\n\nFir flooring cannot be purchased and if it were possible to buy, I do not think that it would be economical to lay. The hardwood flooring, if laid, would, I am sure, eventually become loose, open-jointed, and in places would wear badly. This is proved by the existing Maple floor in the school's waiting room, for which new flooring was purchased recently.\n\nThe price of $337.50 covers sufficient Maple flooring to lay on the areas which are in poor shape only. The $94.50 item covers part of main hallway in new building, which is at present covered by Fir flooring, and which is already showing signs of wear.\n\nWere Battleship Linoleum provided, at a cost of approximately $1.70 per sq. yd., with the required amount of floor cement and felt paper, and the work of laying done by the school, it can be believed, more than offset the cost of laying Maple flooring, which if laid by inexperienced help, would only require patching and repairing at a later date.\n\nI would therefore recommend that, if the floors of the school are to be covered, that it be done with Double A, Brown Battleship Linoleum.\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, April 20, 1946.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 10th instant, it has been decided to supply, at the present time, to the Kenora residential School, 150 square yards of linoleum.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe water supply at this school was inspected on February 16th, 1946.\n\nChlorination of the water at this school has been suspended. The only method of chlorinating this water, which comes from the Lake of the Woods, is by the old two barrel hypochlorite method. The chlorine solution is fed from the barrel through a 1/2\" pipe line into the main on the suction side of the pumps. The chlorine feed is controlled by two valves on this line. This system of chlorinating water is extremely antiquated and should be replaced by a proper type of chlorinator.\n\nThe water supply at this school was also inspected on February 16th, 1946.\n\nAt the time of the inspection, no chlorine was reaching the water supply. This was probably due to the presence of sediment in the rubber hose and in the bubble jar. It is recommended that these be thoroughly cleaned. A considerable amount of trouble is being encountered at this institution in controlling the chlorine feed as, on the previous day, an excess of chlorine was being added to the water. The chlorinator is a suction type Wilson hypochlorinator.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSANITARY ENGINEERING DIVISION.\nOttawa, May 1, 1946.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nI recently received a letter from Mr. A. E. Berry, Director, Sanitary Engineering Division, Department of Health, Toronto, in which he states that one of his inspectors, Mr. J. K. Curtis, visited the Kenora Residential School and reported as follows:\n\n\"The water supply at this school was inspected on February 16th, 1946.\n\n\"Chlorination of the water at this school has been suspended. The only method of chlorinating this water, which comes from the Lake of the Woods, is by the old two barrel hypochlorite method. The chlorine solution is fed from the barrel through a 1/2\" pipe line into the main on the suction side of the pumps. The chlorine feed is controlled by two valves on this line. This system of chlorinating water is extremely antiquated and should be replaced by a proper type of chlorinator.\"\n\nAt the present time it is extremely difficult to secure a chlorinator. You might consult the Principal with a view to ascertaining if the system at present in use for chlorinating the water at Kenora could be watched more carefully and as a result would serve the required purpose for the next year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKenora, Ont., April 2, 1946.\n\nMARCH QUARTER REPORT.\n\nKENORA R.C. I.R. SCHOOL\n\nSeveral trips to the Kenora R.C. I.R. school were made during the quarter. On January 24th, a general inspection was made in the company of Mr. Inspector A.G. Hamilton. The school was found neat, clean and orderly. The Reverend Father C.E. Comeau discussed the matter of a new dispensary cupboard and new floor covering for the school. The dispensary is sorely needed as no provision is made for the storage of medicines etc. The present floor oil-cloth is in very poor shape, and should be renewed. The hallways and rooms, which have no covering, require much extra work to keep them clean and sanitary. Three drinking fountains have been installed.\n\nN.

R. School.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your 129-1-5 dated the last instant in connection with the chlorination of the water supply at the above noted school.\n\nReverend Father C.E.Comeau, O.M.I., was interviewed last evening in connection with the water supply at the school. The chlorinating system was also checked over.\n\nWhen this system was inspected by Mr.A.E.Berry on February 16th, last, the school engineer had only been on the job for a short time and had not time to acquaint himself with the water system or to adjust himself to all the conditions around and about the school. This man has since been instructed thoroughly in the maintenance and operation of the chlorine system and the regulating of same.\n\nThe water system is at present being regulated as best possible under the existing condition of this old and antiquated system, and will be watched carefully until such time as a more efficient and up to date system can be installed.\n\n[Signature]\nNorman Paterson\nIndian Agent.\nThe T.

I feel sure that after having seen the beautiful work done by the carpenter employed on this job, you will recommend strongly to the Department the paying of such.\n\nAs I am expecting 50 more yards of Linoleum, may I suggest that the Department include felt paper and cement for this order and assume cost of labor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

(This is the amount which we have decided to make the minimum monthly wage for male help, when employed out of our grants.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n129-1-5 VOL. 11 CLOSED\nFROM DECEMBER 20TH 1943\nTO AUGUST 7TH 1946\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6199)\n\nFile 465-5, part 10\n\nKenora Agency - St. Mary's R.C.
