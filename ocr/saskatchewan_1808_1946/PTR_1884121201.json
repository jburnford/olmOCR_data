Spink has withdrawn from his connection with this paper as a partner. Mr. Spink for many reasons regrets having to leave this enter-\nprise which he has been connected with for many years, and which has been so closely connected with him ever since its inception, as well as the interruption of the many friendships he has formed among the people here, and whose welfare and prosperity will always be a matter of great interest to him wherever he may be. His taking the present step is entirely due to the fact of his conviction\u2014more accurately arrived at\u2014that there can not be found in any manner or form, the best combination of the business of various kinds upon which the permanency of success of a journal depends to justify the presence of two partners in the enterprise. Under these circumstances he goes away without leaving in the field affording a more likely prospect, and this paper henceforth will be conducted by himself, while regretting his departure, God speed, which we know will be forthcoming. We trust that he will hope that even with the disadvantage of the loss of his services, the paper will be conducted in such a way as still to merit the patronage which considering the size of the place, and its importance, the paper has been sufficiently liberal. At any rate should it in any way suffer, it will not be from the want of all possible exertion on our part to prevent such being the case.\n\nLIBEL SUITS.\n\nWe observe that three suits are being brought against the publishers and proprietors of the Maclean's Magazine, for libel and slander, and that one of them is now out of an affair known as the \"Bash\" case, and is also doing good work in the cause of the press. We sympathise with our fellow journalists, and sincerely hope that they will turn their eyes once more toward the cause of the press, and prove that they are willing to do everything possible for the interests of the public. While we are fully satisfied that they are strongly opposed as possible to any name of the greatest, we are not anxious of those who pretend to imagine them so lost to self respect as to do so near or before the middle of June.\n\nTWO SPRING CALVES,\nRed, tan, black and roan, full.

Mr. Macauley is very much interested in politics; but in his capacity as a merchant, I feel compelled to say that we should be more interested in the welfare of our town, and that the best way to promote its prosperity would be by means of improvements which would add to our trade and commerce. Mr. Macauley has been a merchant for many years, and is well known throughout the county for his integrity and honesty. We must hope that he will continue to be so when he takes up the position of aldermanic candidate. We are confident that his experience and practical knowledge will contribute greatly to the welfare of our town, and that his efforts will be directed towards the improvement of our town.\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE.\n\nAll parties are hereby notified that the undersigned committee have sanctioned the following resolutions:\n\nA.

LOUIS, MISSOURI, U.S.A.\nINCORPORATION.\n\nA meeting was called on Friday evening; last week, for the purpose of taking the necessary steps to incorporate in a legally proposed part of this settlement in the town.\n\nMr. Stewart, J. F. Harte, Mr. Macartur, A. Clarke, P. Atkinson, and J. Macdonald having successively been called upon to take the chair, the position was occupied by Mr. Gunn, and Mr. Mr. Macartur was unanimously elected as secretary for the occasion.\n\nMr. Gunn briefly opened proceedings by saying that he had no further knowledge of the subject or interest in the meeting than what he gathered from the notices which called it\u2014there was an understanding among those present that their attention to town incorporation or further discuss the more extended municipal question. He then called upon Mr. Macartur who moved the motion on behalf of the committee to adjourn the meeting.\n\nMr. Macartur thought the committee's work had ended with the accomplishment of the work entrusted to them\u2014viz., the petition to the Honorable Governor, whom on a visit here during the summer, and learning from him the petition sent in\u2014and the way to get the desired object attained\u2014that all that now remained was to see whether everything was being done in accordance with the original intention of the former petition\u2014i.e., that a town should be proceeded with.\n\nMr. Bettis expressed his opinion that Mr. Macartur had put the petition away, saying that there was nothing remaining about proceeding should be taken. A gentleman present invited Mr. Bettis to give his reasons why he thought it desirable to proceed. Mr. Bettis said a town, like a family, required a head to act for it and guide it\u2014that the government of the town should be placed under the hands of leaders of great moral worth, land owners, and government officials.\n\nMr. Gunn finding no one inclined to turn the floor, called upon Mr. Macartur, Mr. Macartur rose to make a motion.\n\nThat gentleman felt surprised at being expected to express any views at that stage of the proceedings, but would take pleasure in a motion called by any member of the committee, fully expecting that common sense have prevailed, and that the day before the meeting, he might have believed in the benefits of incorporation at the proper time, and real question was raised as to what course of action had arisen or not, and hoped to hear something from those who shortly after the writing of the petition, were most in the case\u2014which would enable those in doubt as to what may be anticipated for the future for the town, and what expenditure could be reasonably anticipated to form an opinion. What he had wished was a statement of opinions on what might be stated pro and con.\n\nMr. Macartur said there was no use in going over the old ground, that the subject had been exhausted and the result of opinions by the sending of the petition, that he had no objection and he blamed our manner as much as anyone for the stopping, the matter should have been discussed in a logical fact instead of still in question. In his opinion the benefits of incorporation at the proper time, and real question was raised as to what course of action the people should not be expected by residence on and improvement of town property, and the prosperity of the community, or speculative holding on late while the latter paid no taxes. He commented that if we had responsible government, it would be easy to send a man from Ontario to step in and say that if the people would not oppose the location of the town, they would be entitled to a certain spot, as a reward for their forbearance, he would see his own responsibilities, and the question was where the poor wanted to have it\u2014which he said had been discussed and the question was now before the public. He then returned some of the benefits such as taking advantage of the market, the advantages of the town, threatened epidemics\u2014the utility of machines for weighing loads of hay, etc., the reduction of insurance rates by providing against accidents from fire, etc.\n\nMr. Bettis then moved that a committee of five be appointed to take immediate steps to circulate a petition in favor of\n\nG.
