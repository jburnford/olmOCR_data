I beg to state that in my opinion and that of some others of the Band, it is an unnecessary expense. The seats and chairs are made of wood and strong and in every way suitable for the school. Consider that there are other articles which we stand in more need than these seats. Farming implements, for instance. The Chief did not consult me in this matter nor any of the councillors. Therefore I strongly object to such unnecessary outlay of our funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Jas.

The school was in the midst of the Indians' settlement on the Attawapiskat River, a distance from the nearest settlement village, and school, and therefore presented better educational advantages for their children. I was very impressed with its size and purpose at Pointe-aux-Sables. It was not a large school, but its size was adequate. The school was very near Pointe-aux-Sables and the people are few. Consequently, they choose they might all live at Pointe-aux-Sables. But the fact remains that families have gone to Attawapiskat, and are living there; and some of children belong to this little settlement, Attawapiskat, and it would be well for them to attend school. As it is now, we have no school facilities.\n\nI wrote today the case before the Department and asked what view they take of the case. Are they disposed to build a school for the people and give the necessary work? And with the amount of the school at Pointe-aux-Sables divided into two, in some way, if it is willing between the two schools?\n\nAgain I must venture to urge the Board of Education at Pointe-aux-Sables, to S. Ferriar, whose name is always on whose petition is usually written, should receive $250 per annum instead of $200.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Atkinson\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Dear Sir,\n\nI am writing this letter to you because I believe it is important that the Board of Education at Pointe-aux-Sables should consider the possibility of building a new school. The current school is not sufficient for the needs of the community, and I urge you to take action to address this issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Atkinson\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 12th December, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nWith reference to the application of His Lordship\nthe Bishop of Algoma for the opening of a school for a\nportion of the Indians of the Whitefish River Band who\nhave located at a point four miles from Birch Island\non the Whitefish River, north side of the Georgian Bay,\nI have the honour to state that there is no present a school at Birch\nIsland under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nAccording to the report for the September quarter received\nfrom the teacher, Mr. S. H. Perris, there are 11 children\nin attendance, with an average attendance of 4. The\nsalary, which is voted, is $200.\n\nIn his annual report Superintendent Ross does not\nmention the portion of the Band settled at the point in\nquestion. Speaking of the Band generally he says:\n\"The Indians have a good school and the general profi-\nciency of the pupils is satisfactory\".\n\nIf the school at Birch Island, which has been es-\ntablished for some years at a point suitable for the\nmajority of the Whitefish Band has an attendance of only\n4, it is hardly likely that a new school for the conve-\nnience of only a portion of the Band would have a suffi-\ncient attendance to warrant its being established.\n\nH.C. Ross\nExd.\n\nOttawa, 24th December, 1898.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 25th ultimo, in regard to the establishment of a second school for the convenience of six families of the Whitefish River Band who have settled on the Whitefish River four miles from the school at Birch Island.\n\nIn reply I have to say that as the school already established at a point suitable for the majority of the Band, although in operation for some years, has only 11 pupils or the roll, with an average attendance of 4, it is not considered likely that a second school will attract attendance sufficient to justify its establishment.\n\nI regret, therefore, that the Department does not see its way to increasing the number of schools for the Whitefish Band at present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Molson\n\nRev. C. Thorpe, D.D.,\n\nPimicopurst,\n\nBult Ste Marie, Ontario.\nExd.\n\nI acknowledge your courtesy in replying to my communication of the 28th ultimo respecting the Indian School at Portage la Prairie, and that Mr. Harris the teacher. I shall do all in my power to induce the Indians to make the most of the advantages they have. Mr. Harris will be very thankful for the extra $50.

The Bishop wishes a reply at an early date, so that action may be taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo stating that the Indians of the Whitefish River Reserve are anxious to have a school opened there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to erect a building there at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitoulin, Ont.\nOTTAWA, April 7th, 1922.\n\nDear Chief,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to inform you that the building at McGregor Bay, on the Whitoflan River Reserve, used for school and church purposes, was erected during the summer of 1890. The Department contributed the sum of $300, which was provided from our vote towards the erection of the building. The Indians performed the labour, and they were paid subsistence money at the rate of 50 cents per day while at work on the building. This building was to be used for both church and school purposes, under the auspices of the Anglican Church.\n\nWe are making enquiry regarding the order given the Indians to discontinue the holding of council meetings in this building.\n\nAs soon as this information is received, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChief Wm. McGregor,\nMcGregor Bay P.O.,\nOnt.\nOTTAWA, April 7th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Chief Wm. McGregor, of the Whitefish River Reserve, in which he states as follows:\n\n\"Lately a man came and ordered the schoolhouse to be closed and prevented the members of the band from holding our council meetings and informed us that the old schoolhouse was sufficient to hold our council meetings.\"\n\nThe building referred to is situated at McGregor Bay village, and was formerly used for school purposes. This building was erected during the summer of 1900. The Department contributed the sum of $300 towards the cost from the school vote, and it was understood that it was to be used for both church and school purposes.\n\nI will be pleased if you will make enquiry regarding the complaint of the Chief and ascertain upon whose authority the Indians were refused to hold council meetings, as it does not appear to the Department that there should be any objection to their using the building for this purpose.\n\nAs full particulars as you can supply will be appreciated at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\n\nRussell T.

McGregor of the Whitefish River Reserve, that the members of the Band have been ordered to discontinue the use of the school house for council meetings.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that there should be no objection to the Indians using this building for the above purpose, provided they conduct themselves properly and see that the room used is scrubbed or cleaned after each council meeting.\n\nYou may inform the Chief accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

A good grade of shingles should be obtained. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase, and the shingles should be obtained from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nProperly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred to which should be attached a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nIn the payment of any labour required in putting on the shingles, it will be necessary to keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, which should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYou should give this matter your immediate attention in order that, if possible, this work can be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McKenzie.\n\nWith reference to the communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma regarding the combined school house and church building at Birch Island on the Whitefish River Indian Reserve, I have to state that this building was erected in lady, under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Frost, the Anglican minister on the reserve at that time. This Department provided the funds for the materials used, vizt $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band. It approved of an expenditure to the extent of $48.42, the same being paid from band funds.\n\nThe Department owns this building.\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario,\n26th April 1923.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nEver since I became Bishop of the Diocese of Algoma, twenty-six years ago, we have had the use of a small building at Birch Island, part of the Whitefish Indian Reserve. The Indians at that point are divided between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Communion. There is a disposition at the present time to claim the building for use by the band as a council chamber. This is not at all satisfactory to us, as it interferes with our use of it for religious purposes. Will you kindly tell me the history of this building, and what rights the Church of England has in it. One of the oldest residents declares that the materials were provided by the Church, and that it is to the best of his knowledge and belief a church building. Of course, if it is a Government building the Department has a right to determine what its uses shall be; nevertheless, after so long a period of use, some clear and generous rights should belong to the Church of England, her use of it having been unbroken through the period referred to. Will you kindly let me have an answer at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\nThis building was put up in 1889, for a combined church and school under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Proctor. The Department provided the funds for the materials and the Indians furnished the labour.\n\nG. E. M. Matheson\nMay 1st, 1923.\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nWith reference to the communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma regarding the combined school house and church building at Birch Island on the Whitefish River Indian Reserve. So far as I know this building was erected in 1869, under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Frost, the Anglican minister on the Reserve at that time. This Department provided the funds for the material used, viz: $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band.

Luthertwood\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMay 1st, 1923.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nWith reference to the communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma regarding the combined school house and church building at Bird Island on the Whitefish River Indian Reserve, I beg to say that this building was erected in 1889, under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Frost, the Anglican minister on the reserve at that time. This Department provided the funds for the material used, viz: $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band. We approved of an expenditure to the extent of $45.42, the same being paid from band funds.\n\nThe Department owns this building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. L. MacKenzie\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Thornloe,-\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the building at Birch Island.\n\nI have looked up our records and I find that this building was erected at the expense of the Department, the Indians supplying the labour. Last October, on a resolution of the band, the building was re-shingled at the expense of band funds. It would appear, therefore, that the Church has no proprietary interest in the building.\n\nNo school has been conducted since June, 1907 and it seems to me that the building should serve as it has for some time past, both the Church for purposes of service and the Indians for Council meetings.\n\nI shall communicate with the Indian Agent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Reverend G. Thornloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Lewis,\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has written me in reference to the building on Birch Island which for some years past has been used by the band as a Council chamber and for the purpose of holding church services.\n\nIt seems that the band is claiming all the interest in the building and want to use it for council purposes only.\n\nThis building was erected by the Department All the Indians contributed was the labour until last fall when it was re-shingled at their expense.\n\nIn view of this fact there would appear to be no reason why the arrangement which has obtained for some time should not be continued, that is that the building should be available for the use of the Missionary for church services and the Indians for meetings of Council.\n\nKindly let me have a report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 4th instant, giving information as to the building at Birch Island. I am communicating its contents to our clergyman in charge of that region.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge [Signature]\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter or the 4th instant, in regard to the report made to the Department by His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma in reference to the building at Birch Island which for some years past was used as a combined church and school, and in reply I have the honour to report to the Department that His Grace must have been mis-informed in this matter as the Indians do not wish to rob the building of its semi-sacred character, they only ask the privilege of holding their meetings or the council in the building as they have not any other place to meet in council. After each council meeting the building has been cleaned and everything left in perfect order.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that it is not the Indians that want to use the building for council meetings only, but if it is the missionaries that are trying to prevent the Indians from holding any council meetings in this building and wish to use it for church purposes only, and the teacher in charge of the school at Whitefish River, who is acting as an Anglican missionary among the Indians, has gone so far as to lock the building in order to prevent the Indians from making use of it for council meetings.\n\nAs far as I can see there should not be reason why the building should not be available for the use of the Missionary for church services and the Indians for meetings of council, and the Indians are perfectly willing to abide by that decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nJuly 29th, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the dispute regarding the building at Birch Island. In view of your explanations the building should continue to be used as for sometime in the past both for council meetings and for church services. Will you please advise both the missionary and the Indians to this effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. J. Lewis,\nIndian Agent,\nJuntowning, Ont.\n| Cheifal Receipt | P.A.

I have therefore asked the Department for occasional help. Encouraged by the fact I venture now to ask whether the Department would provide us with remedies for a few simple remedies if I sent a list of what is necessary to the local Agent, Mr. Robert Lewis, for the purpose. Perhaps it would suffice for me to write to Mr. Lewis for further information.\n\nBelieve me,\n\n(signed) George Aurora.\nOttawa, December 15th, 1925.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Grace's letter of the 12th instant, requesting that a supply of medicines be furnished Mr. Hardymon who is conducting a school at Whitefish Valley for Indian and white children, I regret to inform you that the Department is not favourably disposed to comply with this request. It is thought that the Indians should be able to purchase any simple medicines that may be required by them. While we have supplied a small quantity of material for the use of the Indian children in the classroom, we have not otherwise recognized the work which is being carried on by Mr. Hardymon.\n\nWe have noted that Your Grace will in due course forward through the office of the local Indian Agent, Mr. R. J. Lewis, a nomination for the position as teacher of the Sheguianish Indian Day School to succeed Mrs. Fairbairn.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Committee did not feel like spending money on it; in its present condition it is not fit for Divine Worship, and I am anxious to put it in order. I don't think once the new school is built, that the Indians would wish to use our school any longer. I am very obedient without further...\nOttawa, May 28th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, requesting the assurance of the Department that the building in which you are conducting school at Whitefish Falls will not further be used by the Indians for the holding of Council meetings, etc.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, from the information on file, it would appear that this building was secured by the Anglican Church in 1917 for the purpose of carrying on a joint white and Indian school. If this is the same building as referred to by you, it would appear that this Department would have no authority to prevent the holding of meetings therein, or be responsible for repairing same. However, I shall be glad to have particulars from you regarding the building in which you are conducting school. You should state whether it is on the Whitefish River Reserve and if it is the property of the Anglican Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLucius F.

Hardman.\nOttawa, June 5th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nCommunications have recently been received from Mr. Lucius Hardymon, who is carrying on, by means of church funds, a school at White Fish Falls for combined groups of white and Indian children. Mr. Hardymon has stated that he requested the Anglican Church authorities to have the building repainted inside. He states that this building is being used regularly for Sunday School and by the Band for Council meetings. The Church authorities do not feel like spending money on this building unless its use by the Indians for Council meetings is discontinued.\n\nThe Department is in doubt as to the building referred to by Mr. Hardymon. Please inform the Department fully as to whether this building is located on the reserve or not and if it was erected by and is the property of this Department or whether it is owned by the Anglican Church authorities. Please state also if there is any other building in which the Indians could hold their Council meetings.\n\nYour early reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. M. Olean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, June 5th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st instant, relative to the old school building at Birch Island, I beg to say that we are making enquiries in the matter from Mr. Agent Lewis, Manitowaning, and as soon as a reply is received from him, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It has not been in use for school purposes during the last twenty years past, but the Anglican Church authorities have used it regularly for Worship, and the Band use it to hold their council meetings as they have not any other building for that purpose.\n\nAs the Indians have not any other building to hold their meetings, and this building is Departmental property, and after each meeting the Indians clean the building thoroughly also conduct themselves properly; therefore, I cannot see why the Church authorities should object to the Indians holding their council meetings in this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to previous correspondence relative to the building at Whitefish Falls upon which you are endeavouring to have the Church authorities repair inside, provide its use by the Indians for council meetings as discontinued, I beg to state that, as the Indians have no other building in which to hold their meetings, and, also, as it was erected and kept in repair by departmental funds, we are not prepared to withhold its use from the Indians for their council meetings.\n\nWe are informed that after every meeting the Indians clean the building thoroughly, also conduct themselves properly while using same. It is not understood why there should be any objection to their holding council meetings in this building, as they do not interfere with the Anglican Church authorities conducting worship therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In both my letters I referred to the school at Birch Island, not at White Fish Falls as in your letter again referred to above...and I mentioned in my letters that I had been informed it was the\nintention of the Department to build a new school on Birch Island for the Roman Catholic children, and it seemed to me reasonable that in their event, the Indians would prefer to use the new building for their meetings, & thus leave the old school to be used for Worship, which is what we wish, and in that event I would try to make it decent, but until the new building is erected we would have no objections to the Indians holding their\n19-10-5.\n\nOttawa, June 19th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the use of the school building at Birch Island, and not at Whitefish Falls as was stated in our former letters, I beg to say that we are forwarding a copy of your letter to Mr. Agent Lewis with the request that he take such action as he considers advisable in arranging for the use of the building by the Anglican Church and for the holding of council meetings. He will be in the best position to handle this matter, and you should consult him regarding any future arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLucius F.

Hardyman with further reference to the building which he states is located at Birch Island and not at Whitefish Falls. In this connection I would refer you to our letter of the 5th instant and your reply thereto of the 8th.\n\nPlease take the matter of the use of the building referred to by Mr. Hardyman into consideration, and make any arrangements you consider satisfactory for the use of the building for church purposes and for the holding of council meetings by the Indians.

That the school lavatories be separated and moved to different site.\n\nThere are fourteen Indians attending this school, and although it is not on the reservation, we are appealing to you for help, as the inspector requires this site done before September.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.P.\n19-10-5.\n\nOttawa, August 14, 1931.\n\nRev.

McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI want to call your attention to the situation of the Catholic Indians of the Christian Island Reserve, a situation which has been of long duration but of which I was not quite familiar until some months ago. There are on the Reserve about three hundred and fifty Indians, of whom about one-third are Catholics. There is one school, at which I think sixty children are registered, and of these twenty-eight or thirty are Catholics. There are two teachers, both Protestants, and the Principal is a minister of the United Church.\n\nI made enquiries about a month ago at your Department and was told that, insofar as the Department knew, there was no Catholic school on the Christian Island Reserve, but only a school conducted by the United Church. This is a situation which will have to be remedied.\n\nI am very reluctant to cause any difficulty or any embarrassment, and I am aware that the funds of the Indian Department are at a very low ebb through the need of the practice of rigid economy. By rights, of course, in accordance with the Indian Act the Protestants should have their school and the Catholics theirs. This would necessitate the building of a new school.\n\nHowever, if the Department preferred and the United Church authorities concurred in the arrangement, we should be satisfied for the present, and as a temporary expedient, to have a joint school for Protestant and Catholic children. But we should have to insist that one of the teachers be a Catholic and that the Principal be not a minister of the United Church.\nKeep the baby warm and dry. Do not let any old woman or anybody kiss it on the mouth or handle it much.\n\nBe sure that every small child gets some fresh food, meat, fish or soup or berries or canned tomatoes.\nAugust 3rd, 1934.\n\nTo Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter recently received from Very Reverend Mr. Hingston, S.J., Provincial of the Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada, with reference to the Christian Island Indian Day School, Reserve No. 30, Lectoral District of Cinnee East.\n\nPrevious to 1928, the teacher at the Christian Island Indian Day School was nominated by the Indian Council. As it was found that the services of teachers appointed in this manner were not satisfactory and as the majority of the Band were members of the United Church of Canada, the Department requested the Board of Home Missions, in 1928, to nominate a teacher for this school and, since that time, whenever it has been necessary to replace the teacher, the Board of Home Missions has been permitted to make the nomination.\n\nIn the fall of 1933, it was pointed out to the Department that the attendance at this school had increased to such an extent that a second teacher was necessary and Mr. Vernon H. Harris was appointed (reference Mr. Dunkard's memorandum of October 20th, 1933).\n\nStatistics regarding the Christian Island Band prepared this year give the following information:\nThere is no information showing the percentage of Roman Catholics among the children of school age (70).\n\nThis is the first time that the Roman Catholic Church authorities have expressed a wish to have a teacher of their religion on the Christian Island Reserve. Reverend Father Hingston's letter explains the position of the Roman Catholic Church and I would appreciate your advising what reply you wish to be given to him.\n\nIf you consider it advisable to meet Father Hingston's wishes at the present time, I might suggest that Mr. A. B. Caryuthers (reference Acting Deputy Superintendent General's memorandum of July 12th) be sent to Christian Island as assistant teacher and Mr. Vernon R. Morris, at present acting as assistant teacher at Christian Island, be sent to Oneida No. 2.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nThere is no information showing the percentage of Roman Catholics among the children of school age (70).\n\nThis is the first time that the Roman Catholic Church authorities have expressed a wish to have a teacher of their religion on the Christian Island Reserve.

Eade, early this spring, shows that there are seventy (70) children between seven and sixteen years of age. Please make careful inquiries and advise me how many of these children are Roman Catholic. You should, also, state how many of these Roman Catholic children are, at present, attending the Christian Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn the event of the Department authorising a school for the Roman Catholic Indian children, you should advise if there is any building available that could be used for school purposes.\n\nPlease give this matter your early and careful attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. Macdonald,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Allan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\ngin by acquainting Monsignor Carroll, Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto, on his return to Toronto at the end of the week, with the manner that the Department of Indian affairs sees fit to treat our very moderate and just demands.\n\nBoth you and Mr MacKenzie know that I have tried at all times during the past six years to be reasonable and considerate and patient in putting forth my requests and in waiting for action. I am very sorry indeed that I am now being forced into another attitude and into a line of action that is repugnant to me. I am convinced that what we ask for is just, and that the refusal on your part is an injustice towards those with whose care we are charged. The letter received this morning if it accurately reflects the mind of the Department makes it also clear that if we are to get what is due we must make a fight for it. If expediency and not justice is to be the rule, we must try to make it expedient for the Department to do what is right. I sincerely deplore this necessity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.H. Thompson, J.J.\nAugust 22nd, 1934.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBoyd Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nI am writing to Mr MacKenzie in reply to the very astonishing letter received from him this morning in regard to provision for the education of the Catholic Indians of Christian Island.\n\nAs you are well aware, I asked for the minimum that could be asked for, and not for what I had a right to demand. I expressed willingness to concur temporarily in the present arrangements in so far as that is possible, and stated my readiness to be satisfied for the time being with a policy that would have added not one cent to the expense of your Department.\n\nIn answer the Department promises nothing. I am met by a flat refusal to do anything this year. Two pretexts are given as reasons. The first is that the Department lacks information. The Department has made no effort to get this information during four weeks. Surely I am not expected to accept this ridiculous statement as a reason. The second pretext is the lateness of the season. That is no fault of mine. Nor is it a real reason.\n\nSomething is going to happen and happen this year. I shall be-\nAug. 22nd, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 6-1-1, dated August 20th, in reply to mine of July 26th.\n\nI must express surprise at the answer given. In reply to a letter that was both courteous and considerate I am curtly informed that the Indian Department has no intention whatsoever of taking action at present beyond asking a report from the Indian Agent, and later on, not this year, \"the Department will give further consideration to what action, if any, can be taken to meet your wishes.\" Why this report from the Indian Agent was not asked for during the four weeks that were allowed to elapse between my letter and your reply I fail to understand. Moreover, it is not at all a question of my wishes, but of the clear rights of the Catholic Indians, which are completely disregarded and set aside.\n\nAfter lack of information, the lateness of the season is given as a second pretext for deferring the matter, though the delay is due in no small part to the fact that my letter remained unacknowledged for nearly four weeks. I telephoned to your Department a week ago and proposed to go to Ottawa to see you, but was then informed that the matter was in the hands of the Minister.\n\nThe matter cannot be allowed to drop. I have tried to be courteous and conciliatory, and am much disappointed that this attitude has not been appreciated.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H.

The total attendance is, I am told, about sixty. The Catholic children in the list number thirty-one. The number will be greater next year, as there will be more children entering than dropping out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm H. Thompson, F.T.\n\nREF. No. 6-1-1 dated Aug. 20th.\nARCHBISHOP'S RESIDENCE\nHEAD WELLSLEY PLACE\n\nTORONTO...August 28, 1934\n\nVery Reverend Father Kingston, Provincial of the Jesuit Fathers who have charge of some Indian Missions in the Archdiocese of Toronto, has placed before me correspondence that has passed between and the Department of Indian Affairs regarding proper provision for education of Catholic children on the Christian Island Indian Reservation.\n\nFrom what information I have before me, it would appear that no provision at all has been made for these children of our Faith, and that, if they would have any schooling, they are compelled to attend a school in which both teachers are Protestants and one is a Minister of the United Church.\n\nI am quite sure that the late Archbishop of Toronto, who made such a fight for Catholic education, had no knowledge of the state of affairs in Christian Island, and that he would never have acquiesced in their continuance.\n\nI confidently look to an immediate remedy of a situation that is wrong and contrary to the law, now that it has been pointed out to you.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nFrancis P. Carroll,\nAdministrator, Archdiocese of Toronto.\nAugust 29th, 1934.\n\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI hereby tender the use of the Catholic Church building on Christian Island for use as a school for the Catholic children during the coming school year. The Department would have to provide equipment and fuel and any incidentals.\n\nI have offered to be satisfied for the present with the continuance of the present (unfair and unjust) arrangement provided that one teacher shall be a Catholic. If that offer be not acceptable, then I make now another offer.\n\nIf both offers are refused there will be difficulty in escaping a very undesirable conclusion.\n\nCertainly on our part we have done all that is possible to do.\n\nI confidently trust that justice will be done our moderate demands.\n\nIf it would expedite matters, I am ready to lay this matter before the minister, by going to Ottawa. But as this would be particularly inconvenient at the moment, I hope that I may be spared this trip.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.H. Thompson, J.C.\nAugust 30th, 1934.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that pursuant to a decision of the Right Reverend Monsignor Carroll, D.D., P.A., Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto, which has been signified to me today, our missionary in charge of Christian Island is to advise all the Catholic Indians that they may not send their children to the present school maintained by your Department, so long as this school remains an exclusively Protestant school.\n\nIt is unnecessary to add that both Monsignor the Administrator and myself sincerely regret the need of taking such action. We must, however, decline to accept any responsibility for the unpleasant situation which will inevitably result in Christian Island, as well as for any publicity that might ensue.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Thompson, Jr.\nOttawa, September 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 26th ultimo, to which no reply has yet been received. Please let me have, at once, the information requested in the letter mentioned above.\n\nAt the same time, you should state the names of the Roman Catholic children who are attending the Christian Island School. If any Roman Catholic children are not at present attending school on the reserve, no steps should be taken by you to enforce their attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.Y. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Allan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nChristian Island, Ontario\nSeptember 6th 1934\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 20th, file No 6-I-I beg to report that there are at present 26 Catholic children of school age who will be attending school at the opening this fall. After making careful inquiries as to a building which would be available in event of the Department authorizing a school for them I am sorry that there is not one suitable but they could of course use their own church should it be necessary.\n\nYou no doubt know that at present the Indian Council Hall is being used to accommodate part of the school children and in event of a school for the Catholic children being authorized it would be closed leaving the only other building, the old church, which is now being used as a school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nJ.A.Allan\nIndian Agent\nOTTAWA, September 11, 1934.\n\nVery Reverend W. H. Kingston, S.J.,\nBishop's Palace,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\n\nRUSH\n\nSUGGEST YOU VISIT DEPARTMENT TO DISCUSS SITUATION\nCHRISTIAN ISLAND\n\nH. W. McGILL\n\nChg. Dept. I. A.\nI asked that a telegram be sent to me today in Toronto or tomorrow in North Bay. Failing this I shall go to Ottawa in a final endeavour to obtain justice, and also to avert a most unpleasant and deplorable situation.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Thompson,\nProvincial of the Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada.\nIn my telephone conversation this afternoon I renewed my offer to go from Toronto to Ottawa and lay the matter before the Minister and give whatever additional information would be needed to expedite matters. I had made that offer previously in a long distance telephone call on August 14th and again in my letter of August 25th.\n\nOn several occasions I have had to exercise patience with what looked like an anti-Catholic bias in the Department of Indian Affairs. This is an ugly charge to make and I have never made it up to the present, but if required I will produce instances from within my own experience. But in none of these instances has this bias gone to the extent of a direct and evident and complete disregard of the rights of the Catholic Indians, and I refuse to believe that the Indian Department will care to go on record as anti-Catholic.\n\nIn my letter of August 30th addressed to the Honourable the Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs and in my letter of the same date to the Deputy Superintendent I stated that I had received instructions from the Right Reverend Monsignor Carroll, Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto, to advise the Indians through their missionary that they were not to attend a school that was purely a Protestant school, and so long as it remains an exclusively Protestant school, with the permission of the Administrator I have withheld that notification until now in the hope that it would not prove necessary, and in order to allow the Department to do the fair and proper thing.\n\nThe Department seemingly has not appreciated this, and unless I hear immediately I shall feel bound to act without further delay.\nSept. 10, 1934.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to confirm statements made in a telephone conversation from Toronto held with the Department of Indian Affairs this afternoon.\n\nI asked for the Secretary but was directed to ask for Mr. Phelan, the Director of Education, which I did.\n\nI stated to Mr. Phelan that no answer had been received to the letters addressed both to the Minister and the Deputy Minister by myself on August 30th, though these letters were by their very nature urgent. However, I added that I should not complain too much of this discourtesy to myself when the Right Reverend the Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto had not even been paid the courtesy of an acknowledgment of his letter on the same subject posted to the Deputy Superintendent on August 28th.\n\nNo official reply or even acknowledgment from the Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, or Secretary has reached me in answer to my earlier letters of August 22nd, August 27th, August 29th. I had complained in my letter of August 22nd that the Department of Indian Affairs had allowed four weeks to pass before replying to my letter of July 26th. Am I to conclude, then, that the affront is deliberate?\n\nOn my part nothing has been left undone that might smooth over difficulties or might expedite matters. When the law allows a school for Catholics as well as for Protestants, all I asked for was that one of the teachers should be a Catholic. Surely this was a very moderate request. Should this not prove acceptable, I tendered the use of the Catholic church building for a school.\nSeptember 11, 1934.\n\nRight Reverend Monseigneur:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the school situation at Christian Island. As it was necessary to adopt the usual departmental procedure before making a decision, my answer to your letter is somewhat delayed.\n\nI have today wired Very Reverend W. H. Hingston, S.J., suggesting that he visit Ottawa. He will, no doubt, inform you regarding our interview.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Rev. Msgr.

The Honourable the Superintendent General also instructed me that Father Hingston would be satisfied with the Roman Catholic teacher either teaching one room of a graded school, as I understand the school is organized at present, or teaching all the Roman Catholic children irrespective of grade or age.\n\nI was present at the interview between the Honourable the Superintendent General and Father Hingston and this is my understanding of the agreement reached.\n\nHarold Brownell\nSeptember 17, 1904.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 13th instant, regarding the Christian Island School, I beg to say that the only way in which your suggestion could be carried out would be as follows:\n\n1. Transfer Mr. Morris from Christian Island to Oneida No. 2 School - In doing this, his salary could be increased from the amount of $600, which he is paid at Christian Island, to $750, which is the salary rating at the Oneida No. 2 School.\n\n2. Transfer Miss K. O'Toole from the Lower French River School to Christian Island - Salary rate at Lower French River is $600 a year, which is the same as has been paid Mr. Morris at Christian Island.\n\n3. Transfer Mr. Carruthers from Oneida No. 2 to Lower French River. This would involve decreasing his salary from $600, which he is at present receiving, to $500, which is the salary rating at Lower French River.\n\nI would also point out that, in the event of these transfers being made, the regulations do not permit the department paying the transportation expenses of the teachers transferred. In the case of Miss O'Toole, the transfer would involve a trip of approximately 150 miles.\n\nThe reason I suggest Miss O'Toole's name is that she is the only teacher in a Roman Catholic Indian Day school in Ontario who is paid a salary rate of $600.00, which, as pointed out above, corresponds with the rate that has been allowed Mr. Morris at Christian Island.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. R. Smith\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nMr. Sutherland, head of the Schools Branch, has furnished me with the attached memorandum with respect to the school situation on Christian Island.\n\nThe series of transfers outlined by Mr. Sutherland will seem to present the only feasible solution of the difficulty. You will note, however, that it will entail Mr. Cuthbert accepting a salary less than the one he is now receiving, while the salary of Mr. Harris, transferred from Christian Island to Oenada No. 2 school, will be increased by a corresponding amount, i.e., $50.00. I would respectfully request that you have your approval of the scheme outlined.\n\nMr. Sutherland is of the opinion, in which I concur, that the arrangement is least likely to cause friction in the separation of the children into two classes according to their respective religious feelings. It is to be hoped that the teacher at present on Christian Island would teach the children from the Protestant homes in the school building, and the new teacher transferred would teach those adhering to the Roman Catholic faith in the Council hall.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIn this way friction will be avoided and both parties will be satisfied. I hope this will be done.\n\nI am sorry to say that the missionary's house which I said we would offer to the teacher will prove too cold for her occupancy, once the cold weather sets in, but Father Labelle says that the teacher will have no difficulty in finding quarters near the school in the house of one of the families. The Department can count upon our fullest cooperation in the matter.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nWm. H. Kingston, S.J.,\nIn this way friction will be avoided and both parties will be satisfied.

G. Murphy, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, advising me that instructions have been sent to the Department \"to provide a teacher of the Roman Catholic faith at the Christian Island School\".\n\nIn the course of our conversation in the office of the Superintendent General on Wednesday last, September 12th., Mr. Murphy seemed strongly of the opinion that it would be better to separate all the children by religions, placing all the Catholic children under the Catholic teacher and all the Protestant children under the Protestant teacher. He thought this better than separating the children according to their grades; giving the lower grades to one teacher and the upper grades to another.\n\nFather Labelle, our missionary at Christian Island, called to see me this morning and he is very strongly of the same opinion, namely that the children should be separated according to religion rather than to grade.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 17, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 13th instant, regarding the Christian Island School, I beg to say that the only way in which your suggestion could be carried out would be as follows:\n\n1.

By establishing this school, only one teacher will be necessary in the Christian Island United Church Indian Day School. Consequently, as you will note from the enclosed letter, Mr. Vernon H. Morris is being transferred to the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School. You should give him every possible assistance in carrying out the instructions contained in the enclosed letter.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Indian Day School should be conducted in the Council Hall and the United Church Indian Day School in the present school building. The latter school, of course, will continue under charge of Reverend Mr. Dean and Miss M. M.

The Indian Agent at this place is Mr. A. D. Moore, Muncey, Ont. You should reach Muncey by October 13th in order that you may take charge of the Oneida No. 2 School on Monday, October 16th. You will be allowed salary at the rate of $55 a teaching month.\n\nThere is, also, a male teacher at the Oneida No. 3 School and a residence for the accommodation of the teachers of both the Oneida No. 2 and No. 3 Schools is provided by the Department.\n\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The United Church Indian day school will continue in the present building.\n\nMiss M. M. O'Toole, Pickering, Ont., who has been teaching the Lower French River Indian Day School since January 1st, last, is being sent to Christian Island to take charge of the Roman Catholic Indian day school.\n\nThe Indian Agent has been informed that the children of those Indians who are recognized as Roman Catholic must attend the Roman Catholic Indian day school, while the children of those Indians who are recognized as Protestant must attend the United Church Indian day school. Children must not be transferred from one school to the other without first receiving the consent of the Department.\n\nMiss O'Toole has been informed that the Roman Catholic Church authorities will make arrangements to secure boarding accommodation for her. I would, therefore, appreciate if you would arrange to have your local missionary on the Christian Island Reserve write Miss O'Toole as soon as possible advising her where she will board on the Reserve.\n\nI may add that Mr. Agent Allan has been instructed to meet Miss O'Toole in Penetanguishene on the 13th instant and take her to Christian Island.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Morley being transferred to Chelida No. 2 Indian Day and Miss H. M. O'Toole being transferred here, I have written her and informed her as to where I will meet her on her arrival in Penetanguishene on the 13th of this month.\n\nI will give every possible assistance to both teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A. Allan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant enclosing resolution of the Christian Island Council regarding the use of the council hall as a classroom for the school which it is proposed to establish for the Roman Catholic children on the reserve.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, as arrangements have been completed to re-open a class for the Catholic children on the 15th instant, the opening would be delayed by making the transfer from the council hall at the present time. The Department considers that the school for the Catholic children should be conducted in the council hall until the end of the present year\u2014which would give ample time, during the Christmas holidays, to transfer desks, equipment, etc., and have the church fitted up as a classroom, where school could be conducted after the beginning of the new year. I would request that you advise the Indians accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime, we will take up with the church authorities the matter of utilizing their church building and also complete arrangements for the transfer of desks, blackboard, etc., from the council hall at the Christmas holidays. It is hoped that the teacher appointed for the Catholic children will arrive in time to begin duties on the 15th instant and that the work can be conducted in the council hall for the balance of the present year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Allan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with recent correspondence regarding the opening of a school for the Roman Catholic children on the Christian Island Reserve, the Department neglected to instruct you that you should change the desks, in order that desks of the proper size for the children may be available both in the United Church School and the Roman Catholic School.\n\nPlease attend to this matter at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Allan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island,\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 10, 1934.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 29th ultimo, in connection with the opening of a Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Christian Island Reserve, I beg to advise you that the Christian Island Council has passed a resolution requesting the discontinuance of the use of the Council Hall as a classroom. This building is owned by the Band, and, consequently, it is difficult for the Department to disregard their wishes.\n\nIn order that there may not be too much confusion at the present time, the Indian Agent is being informed that the Department wishes the Council Hall used as a classroom until the Christmas holidays.\n\nIn your letter of September 10th, last, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, you kindly tendered the use of the Catholic Church at Christian Island for school purposes. As it is not possible for the Department at the present time to consider the erection of a new school, we will be obliged to take advantage of your kind offer of the church building, and our Agent will be instructed to get in touch with your local missionary with a view to arranging the transfer of the classroom furniture to the Catholic Church during the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian School. I am not at present aware from your telegram that the school is being opened in the Catholic club house. If so, it is considered that you should have awaited receipt of instructions from the Department before taking such action. Possibly, at the time your telegram was sent, you had not received official letter of the 10th instant.\n\nIf the classroom equipment has not been removed from the Council Hall, it should be left there as Mr. Inspector McCookin will reach Christian Island on Tuesday next and will decide what action should be taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Allan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nI am given to understand that the present chief is sending a petition to Ottawa to not allow the Catholic school to continue. This, of course, will no doubt be ignored as it should be considering the circumstances.\n\nThe teacher of the Public Indian School is, as you know, a minister. I suppose he is paid by the Department for teaching the school, and if so, in my humble opinion, he should be instructed to avoid creating any ill-feeling and should be urged to lead in the creating an agreeable atmosphere now that the decision has been made to have a school for the Catholic children. He is in a position to lead in co-operation.\n\nI suppose it is out of the question to take steps to immediately erect a building having a classroom (24' by 32'), a kitchen (12' by 12') and bedroom (12' by 12'). The only cellar needed would be a small one in which to keep food in the warm weather, a box stove can heat the classroom only; a kitchen stove would then be needed. A frame building wouldn't cost so very much. I understand that there is an Indian on the Island named Frank Copsegog who is a good carpenter and who could direct the erection of it under the Indian agent.\n\nThe most urgent things now are wood supply, caretaker, (for the school in the church), the making suitable accommodations in the church for the school (stove pipes, etc.) and the equipment (see next sheet.) The matter of the teacher's residence is settled as long as the teacher stays at the home of the Indian agent, but it may not do during the winter.\n\nKindly act as quickly as possible because what was reported to me here to-night certainly demands immediate attention. Thanking you, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.Bennett\nEQUIPMENT NEEDED\n\n16 single desks\nAt least 20 feet of Hyloplate best grade for blackboard\ninstructions should be given the Indian agent to see\nthat a wooden frame is placed around this board to-\ngether with a homemade chalk trough.\n\n1 large size hand bell for calling the children\n1 small desk bell\na few boxes of white chalk and one of colored chalk mixed\n1 dozen blackboard erasers\nPeacock Ink powder (1 box pen nibs, 2 doz. pen holders\n6 doz. lead pencils, 3 pounds Plasticine (1 doz. empty ink\n3 doz. exercise books, 3 doz. scribblers bottles)\n2 doz. blank Ontario Art exercise books\n3 doz. small art drawing books\n25 packages of crayons 3 doz. 12 inch rulers\n200 sheets of colored primary construction paper (9 x 12)\na teacher's desk and chair\na pointer and a yardstick\n2 doz. ink-pencil erasers and 2 pkgs blotting paper\n1 basin, 1 pail, 1 looking glass, 5 cups\n6 bars Lifebuoy Soap and 10 yards towelling + 5 other items\ntooth brushes for 28 children and usual powder\nsend her some sewing material for children's use with darning\nand other needles\n\n6 each of Ontario Public School Geography, Speller, Arithmetic,\nHealth book and Composition-\nGrammar book, Canadian History\n6 small dictionaries and 6 \"Story of the British People\"\n8 each of the following Canadian Catholic Corona Readers:\nPrimer I, Primer II, First Book, Second Book and\n2 Third Books and 2 Fourth books\n6 copies of \"Two Little Indians\"\n6 \"Joe and Ruth\" work books to go with them\n9 copies \"Our Little Reader\"\n12 copies \"Our First Communion\"\n2 copies of \"Mass for Children\" and \"Our Sacrament\"\n6 copies of Benziger's Bible Stories for little children\nher greatest aid would be a set of the new Beacon Reading and\nFrancis Chalks with the word cards and letter cards.\n\nPlease see that this is sent\nSend set of your Word Cards for the Primer Readers\nSend a dozen boxes of word builders and 12 boxes number builders\nsend along a few St. Basil's Hymn books (1 with the music)\nsome Catechisms should be sent and 2 dozen of the little books\ncalled \"I go to Mass\"\n6 copies of \"Little Flower Prayer Book\"\nSend some small colored pictures for class picture study\nwhy not send a few pictured simple story books?\"\nOct 16th, 1934.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI had a visit this evening from Rev. Father Labelle, the Jesuit missionary to Christian Island. He is, by the way, a graduate of St. Michael's College, Toronto. He came to me soliciting my aid in obtaining some urgent necessities for the new school on the Island. Miss O'Toole arrived there yesterday and on finding no school or equipment and no provision made for a teacher's residence practically broke down. However, she sent a message to me containing a list of the more essential things needed. I would judge from this that she is ready to stick it out for a while anyhow. I understand that the order was that school would be held in the Council Hall. The Catholics, however, were prohibited from using it so they intend to use the church which can be made satisfactory for the time being. There are 25 children in attendance and the old single desks are allowed their use. There is no blackboard or equipment of any kind, only a few pieces of chalk given the teacher. I am enclosing on a separate sheet the equipment that is urgently needed.\n\nThere is a stove in the church but about 3 lengths of pipe are needed immediately. There is no wood for fuel. I think you will have the Indian agent assist you for this. Finally, there is a Catholic Indian named for caretaker at the council room. I think he was to be paid $75.00 for the year. He should be instructed to transfer his duties in the making of fires to the church. This is urgent. The missionary with some of the Indians built toilets (outdoor) this morning. These will have to be paid for but the cost will not be very much.\n\nThe teacher is going to live with the Indian agent for a while. I understand that he is new to the Island. I think he is a decent fellow. I think his wife will like to have this teacher with her but the walk to the school will be over a mile and in winter time the winds and the snowdrifts may force her to live in the back of the church, and if so then this small room would need a kitchen stove, a bed and bedding, a kitchen table and chairs, a Coleman lamp, and the usual cooking utensils and dishes.\n\nThe teacher could live in the Jesuit Missionary's house which is close to the church but it is entirely devoid of furniture of any description. I might say here that the 25 children are crowded into the 2 small rooms of this house for school today until the church can be made suitable for occupation. The missionary needs about 6 weeks.\nOttawa, October 18, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your visit next week to the Christian Island Reserve, the Department now understands that the R.C. Day School has been opened in the church. You should instruct the Indian Agent to purchase and deliver to the school, at once, eight (8) lengths of stove pipe and the wood that is required for the winter, also 1 basin, 1 pail, 1 looking glass, 6 cups, 6 bars of soap, 10 yards of towelling, 1 axe and 1 broom.\n\nTwo toilets have been erected and the Agent should forward certified accounts, in triplicate, covering their cost.\n\nAt the present time, the teacher is living with the Indian Agent but, in the winter, it may be necessary for her to reside at the back of the church. In that event, a kitchen stove, bed, bedding, kitchen table, chairs, Coleman lamp, cooking utensils, dishes and other articles will be required. You should instruct the Agent to arrange for the purchase of these when Miss O'Toole finds it necessary, owing to weather conditions, to live in the back of the church. It is understood, of course, that only serviceable articles will be purchased and the cost kept as low as possible. You should impress upon the Agent that the Department wishes this teacher made as comfortable as possible.\n\nI am, also, informed that only 12 single desks have been placed in the church and, as there are 26 children in attendance, a request has been received for 16 additional desks. I would appreciate your investigating this matter as soon as you reach the reserve and, if other desks are not available, you should advise the Department at once regarding the number of new single desks required and the ages of the children by whom the desks will be used.\n\nClassroom supplies are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office and will be sent by express, addressed to Miss O'Toole at Penetanguishene. Please have the Indian Agent get in touch with the express agent at Penetanguishene in order that the latter may notify Mr. Allan as soon as the shipment arrives. Mr. Allan should then arrange for its immediate delivery to Miss O'Toole.\n\nThe Department has, also, been informed that a frame building, 24' x 32' - with a kitchen 12' x 12' and a bedroom 12' x 12' could be erected by an Indian named Copegog, who is stated to be a good carpenter. Please give this suggestion your careful consideration and advise the Department what would be the probable cost of such a building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThos.

McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI want to call your attention to the situation of the Catholic Indians of the Christian Island Reserve, a situation which has been of long duration but of which I was not quite familiar until some months ago. There are on the Reserve about three hundred and fifty Indians, of whom about one-third are Catholics. There is a school, at which I think sixty children are registered, and of these twenty-eight or thirty are Catholics. There are two teachers, both Protestants, and the Principal is a minister of the United Church.\n\nI made enquiries about a month ago at your Department and was told that, in so far as the Department knew, there was no Catholic school on the Christian Island Reserve, but only a school conducted by the United Church. This is a situation which will have to be remedied.\n\nI am very reluctant to cause any difficulty or any embarrassment, and I am aware that the funds of the Indian Department are at a very low ebb through the need of the practice of rigid economy. By rights, of course, in accordance with the Indian Act the Protestants should have their school and the Catholics theirs. This would necessitate the building of a new school.\n\nHowever, if the Department preferred and the United Church authorities concurred in the arrangement, we should be satisfied for the present, and as a temporary expedient, to have a joint school for Protestant and Catholic children. But we should have to insist that one of the teachers be a Catholic and that the Principal be not a minister of the United Church.\n\nWe are anxious to do everything that is reasonable and to avoid all expenses that are not absolutely necessary.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI am,\nDear Mr. McGill\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n(Sgd) W.H. Kingston, S.J.\nis an injustice towards those with whose care we are charged. The letter received this morning if it accurately reflects the mind of the Department makes it also clear that if we are to get what is due we must make a fight for it. If expediency and not justice is to be the rule, we must try to make it expedient for the Department to do what is right. I sincerely deplore this necessity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.H. Kingston, B.J.\nToronto, August 22nd, 1934.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nBooth Building\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am writing to Mr. MacKenzie in reply to the very astonishing letter received from him this morning in regard to provision for the education of the Catholic Indians of Christian Island.\n\nAs you are well aware, I asked for the minimum that could be asked for, and not for what I had a right to demand. I expressed willingness to concur temporarily in the present arrangements in so far as that is possible, and stated my readiness to be satisfied for the time being with a policy that would have added not one cent to the expense of your Department.\n\nIn answer the Department promises nothing. I am met by a flat refusal to do anything this year. Two pretexts are given as reasons. The first is that the Department lacks information. The Department has made no effort to get this information during four weeks. Surely I am not expected to accept this ridiculous statement as a reason. The second pretext is the lateness of the season. That is no fault of mine. Nor is it a real reason.\n\nSomething is going to happen and happen this year. I shall begin by acquainting Monsignor Carroll, Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto, on his return to Toronto at the end of the week, with the manner that the Department of Indian Affairs sees fit to treat our very moderate and just demands. Both you and Mr. MacKenzie know that I have tried at all times during the past six years to be reasonable and considerate and patient in putting forth my requests and in waiting for action. I am very sorry indeed that I am now being forced into another attitude and into a line of action that is repugnant to me. I am convinced that what we ask for is just, and that the refusal on your part\nToronto, August 22nd, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRef: No. 6-1-1, Aug. 20th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter no. 6-1-1, dated August 20th, in reply to mine of July 25th.\n\nI must express surprise at the answer given. In reply to a letter that was both courteous and considerate I am curtly informed that the Indian Department has no intention whatsoever of taking action at present beyond asking a report from the Indian Agent, and later on, not this year, \"the Department will give further consideration to what action if any can be taken to meet your wishes.\" Why this report from the Indian Agent was not asked for during the four weeks that were allowed to elapse between my letter and your reply I fail to understand. Moreover, it is not at all a question of my wishes, but of the clear rights of the Catholic Indians, which are completely disregarded and set aside.\n\nAfter lack of information, the lateness of the season is given as a second pretext for deferring the matter, though the delay is due in no small part to the fact that my letter remained unacknowledged for nearly four weeks. I telephoned to your Department a week ago and proposed to go to Ottawa to see you, but was then informed that the matter was in the hands of the Minister.\n\nThe matter cannot be allowed to drop. I have tried to be courteous and conciliatory, and am much disappointed that this attitude has not been appreciated.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.H. Kingston, S.J.\nToronto, August 29th, 1934.\n\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI hereby tender the use of the Catholic Church building on Christian Island for use as a school for the Catholic children during the coming school year. The Department would have to provide equipment and fuel and any incidentals.\n\nI have offered to be satisfied for the present with the continuance of the present (unfair and unjust) arrangement provided that one teacher shall be a Catholic. If that offer be not acceptable, then I make now another offer.\n\nIf both offers are refused there will be difficulty in escaping a very undesirable conclusion.\n\nCertainly on our part we have done all that is possible to do. I confidently trust that justice will be done our moderate demands.\n\nIf it would expedite matters, I am ready to lay this matter before the Minister, by going to Ottawa. But as this would be particularly inconvenient at the moment, I hope that I may be spared this trip.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.H. Hingston, S.J.\nToronto, August 20th, 1934.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nBooth Building\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that pursuant to a decision of the Right Reverend Monsignor Carroll, D.D., P.A., Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto, which has been signified to me today, our missionary in charge of Christian Island is to refuse all the Catholic Indians that they may not send their children to the present school maintained by your Department, so long as this school remains an exclusively Protestant school.\n\nIt is unnecessary to add that both Monsignor the Administrator and myself sincerely regret the need of taking such action. We must, however, decline to accept any responsibility for the unpleasant situation which will inevitably result in Christian Island, as well as for any publicity that might ensue.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) W. H. Kingston, S.J.\nand again in my letter of August 29th.\n\nOn several occasions I have had to exercise patience with what looked like an anti-Catholic bias in the Department of Indian Affairs. This is an ugly charge to make and I have never made it up to the present, but if required I will produce instances from within my own experience. But in none of these instances has this bias gone to the extent of a direct and evident and complete disregard of the rights of the Catholic Indians, and I refuse to believe that the Indian Department will care to go on record as anti-Catholic.\n\nIn my letter of August 30th addressed to the Honourable the Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs and in my letter of the same date to the Deputy Superintendent I stated that I had received instructions from the Right Reverend Monaghan Carroll, Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto, to advise the Indians through their missionary that they were not to attend a school that was purely a Protestant school, and so long as it remains an exclusively Protestant school. With the permission of the Administrator I have withheld that notification until now in the hope that it would not prove necessary, and in order to allow the Department to do the fair and proper thing.\n\nThe Department seemingly has not appreciated this, and unless I hear immediately I shall feel bound to act without further delay.\n\nI asked that a telegram be sent to me today in Toronto or tomorrow in North Bay. Failing this I shall go to Ottawa in a final endeavour to obtain justice, and also to avert a most unpleasant and deplorable situation.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Hingston,\nProvincial of the Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada.\nToronto, Sept.10,1934.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to confirm statements made in telephone conversation from Toronto held with the Department of Indian Affairs this afternoon.\n\nI asked for the Secretary but was directed to ask for Mr. Phelan, the Director of Education, which I did.\n\nI stated to Mr. Phelan that no answer had been received to the letters addressed both to the minister and the Deputy Minister by myself on August 30th, though these letters were by their very nature urgent. However, I added that I should not complain too much of this discourtesy to myself when the Right Reverend the Administrator of the Archdiocese of Toronto had not even been paid the courtesy of an acknowledgment of his letter on the same subject posted to the Deputy Superintendent on August 28th.\n\nNo official reply or even acknowledgment from the Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, or Secretary has reached me in answer to my earlier letters of August 22nd, August 27th, August 29th. I had complained in my letter of August 22nd, that the Department of Indian Affairs had allowed four weeks to pass before replying to my letter of July 26th. Am I to conclude, then, that the affront is deliberate?\n\nOn my part nothing has been left undone that might smooth over difficulties or might expedite matters. When the law allows a school for Catholics as well as for Protestants, all I asked for was that one of the teachers should be a Catholic. Surely this was a very moderate request. Should this not prove acceptable, I tendered the use of the Catholic Church building for a school.\n\nIn my telephone conversation this afternoon I renewed my offer to go from Toronto to Ottawa and lay the matter before the Minister and give whatever additional information would be needed to expedite matters. I had made that offer previously in a long distance telephone call on August 14th.\nSeptember 19, 1934.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDirector of Education\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have received this morning a letter from Honourable T.G. Murphy, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, advising me that instructions have been sent to the Department \"to provide a teacher of the Roman Catholic faith at Christian Island School\".\n\nIn the course of our conversation in the office of the Superintendent General on Wednesday last, September 12th, Mr. Murphy seemed strongly of the opinion that it would be better to separate all the children by religions, placing all the Catholic children under the Catholic teacher and all the Protestant children under the Protestant teacher. He thought this better than separating the children according to their grades; giving the lower grades to one teacher and the upper grades to another.\n\nFather Labelle, our missionary at Christian Island, called to see me this morning and he is very strongly of the same opinion; namely that the children should be separated according to religion rather than to grade. In this way friction will be avoided and both parties will be satisfied. I hope this will be done.\n\nI am sorry to say that the missionary's house which I said we would offer to the teacher will prove too cold for her occupancy, once the cold weather sets in, but Father Labelle says that the teacher will have no difficulty in finding quarters near the school in the house of one of the families. The Department can count upon our fullest cooperation in the matter.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) W.H. Kingston, S.J.\nOctober 1st, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 29th which came today.\n\nIt is gratifying to know that the school for which we have been asking will open on Monday, October 15th.\n\nI am writing to the Indian missionary on Christian Island to inform Miss O'Toole what arrangements will be made for her accommodation.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) W.

I was wondering if you know of any teacher at the present time who would like this appointment.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. J.M.

Indian Day School.\n\nI presume that in the event of their accepting the school two of the Sisters would proceed there. As you are aware we have only provided in our appropriation for the salary of one teacher at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month. This would be supplemented, during the current fiscal year, by the cost-of-living bonus which is being paid at the rate of 11%. However, if the second Sister would be prepared to assist the teaching Sister by giving instructions in sewing, knitting and possibly handicrafts, we would be able to allow her an amount of $50.00 a teaching month. As you are aware, there are very comfortable living quarters provided at this school.\n\nIn the event of the Sisters of Service not being willing to accept this school at the present time, you might let me know the name and address of the unqualified teacher to whom you refer in the latter part of your telegram.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. J.M. Bennett,\nSeparate School Inspector,\n47 Browning Avenue,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nI did much telephoning and am sorry I could get no one to go. The abundant offer position has drained its teaching personnel. No one need go now to a place so concerned (as they say) as education or conduct so many positions around. I don't know what to suggest. I am writing Father McNamara at Woodland asking him if he knows a suitable person qualified or not and to let me know, also if he gets anyone you could decide a person work.\n\nWhat do you think about giving it to the Section of Service? I think they might take it? I spoke unexpectedly to the Superior. But that matter I have no idea, somewhat in the flyer both a statement she had said but she would think... She did fairly labelle try to get someone. I am writing him today just to see what he will say. Sorry I cannot get someone. I shall still keep it in mind until then maybe I you succeed.\n\nBest wishes sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAn advertisement in the Freeman perhaps might help you.\nof the pastors can get one. I have orders from the west to be the companion to the teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nDear Phil,\n\nI've had our kids in work yet there's a possibility that the Sisters' Service may accept that school.

Rev. Sr. Guest, Sister General of the Order saw the Archbishop today and he gave them permission. The Sister General herself in the last week considered the \"candidates\" available. The teacher has her Superior Quebec certificate; taught in the English schools of Montreal and has quite a bit of teaching experience. They have more nuns coming along and an Ontario certificated one will go later. However, I told her what she had was fine. Along with this teacher will go a mother housekeeper and social worker capable in needlework to who will assist in household craft and economics. Consequently, that $20.00 a teaching month will be allowed as you say in addition to the teachers salary, and living bonus $90.00 plus 11%.\n\nIs $90.00 the most you can allow?\n\nI hope no other teacher is engaged, now that all of this is settled. Will you kindly write direct to the Sister General at No. 2 Wellesley Place, Toronto, and let her know when to commence. On account of the last couple of miles of road to Cedar Point, the sooner the better fro auto traffic. I will see that all their bags and baggage are safely on the train for Penetang and we will try and get some one there to take them the twelve miles to Cedar Point. Shall the Indian agent take them across? If so, then if you so instruct him, we could write him from here as to when to expect them.\n\nBy the way, would you want me to go to the Island a few days after they open school in order to get them settled away properly. They may not understand the grading of these children. If so, I send my travelling expenses direct to you at Ottawa! However, this is only a thought of mine. You are the chief.\n\nI will write you later, in case there is need of some necessary blankets etc., for the beds or some supplies. Going there in the bleakness of late November is not at all an attractive proposition.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Fr. Labelle is quite happy about it, so says his letter.\nThe Department is pleased to know that your Order is willing to accept this school and that the teachers can proceed there at an early date.\n\nThe present Indian Agent, Mr. H.S. Rawlings, is being notified of their appointment but he will be replaced shortly. I suggest that you communicate with Dr. G.E. Tanner, Midland, Ont. He is the Medical Officer for the Christian Island Reserve and I am also writing to him as I feel certain that he will do everything possible to facilitate the transportation of the teachers from Midland to Christian Island.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaires which I should appreciate your having the teachers complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 12, 1941.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI understand from Dr. J.M. Bennett, Inspector of Separate Schools, that your Order is willing to take charge of the Christian Island R.C. School. We are prepared to allow a salary of $80.00 a teaching month for the teacher. This is supplemented by a bonus of $15.\n\nThe above makes a total amount of $95.00 a teaching month. From this is deducted National Defence tax of 5%, or $5.00 a month. There is also a deduction of 5% from the basic salary rate of $80.00 a month, or $4.00 a month. This amount is put in the retirement fund and whenever the teacher withdraws from our service the amount is refunded to her, plus interest.\n\nWe would also like to have another Sister to act as assistant in the teaching of sewing, etc. We are prepared to allow her $80.00 a teaching month. In view of the smallness of salary there will be no deduction for National Defence tax but there will be the usual deduction for superannuation purposes and I understand she will be paid the bonus.\n\nThe school at this point was built within the last few years and there are comfortable living quarters in connection with it. Some additional articles of furniture may possibly be necessary but if the teachers advise me after their arrival I will endeavour to meet any reasonable request.\n\nThe Sister General,\nSisters of Service,\n3 Wellesley Place,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 12, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Turner:\n\nThe Department has just completed arrangements with the Sisters of Service to take charge of the Christian Island R.C. School. Two Sisters will proceed to Christian Island at an early date and I have taken the liberty of giving them your name in the hope that you can arrange to get them across from Midland to Christian Island as soon as convenient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. G.E. Turner,\nMidland, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Creer:\n\nAs you are aware, the present arrangement regarding inspection of Indian schools in Ontario by Provincial Inspectors provides for only one inspection each year.\n\nHowever, we would like to have a special inspection, some time in the near future, of the Christian Island P.C. Indian Day School. Inspector J.M. Bennett visits this school and it would be appreciated if you could arrange to have Dr. Bennett make a special inspection of the school mentioned above. The usual charge should be made on your account for his services and payment will be made by this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. V.K. Creer,\nChief Inspector of Public & Separate Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nMines & Resources, Ottawa, stating reasons, will consideration be given. I advised Sister to have Junior return to the School of previous attendance until such time as Application for Transfer was made and approved or disapproved by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI neglected to say that I had previously informed Miss Elford that there might be some non-attendance by Junior in that he might be doing certain chores for his mother. Actually School Regulations do not permit me to give him leave of absence, but I felt it was only being reasonable to allow him a certain amount. His absence apparently was too great.\n\nLast evening I received your note explaining your feelings and I can appreciate the fact of your almost despair. I trust also Leonard, that you too will appreciate the fact of the heaps of extra work which has been thrust upon us as a result of Mr. Hawling's leaving. It has meant about 16 hours hard work every day for me besides the help that my wife is giving me. We are doing this as a favour to the Department and also as our own wish to do the best possible for the Indian people here on Christian Island. If every member here were to speak the truth I am certain that they would have to admit that we have put forth our very best effort to serve your people since our coming to Christian Island. Many times strong rebukes have caused us to gulp down that lump in our throats, say a silent prayer, straighten ourselves away and press forward. Just a week short this ago we were accused falsely, and because it was impossible to reason with the party in question, we were forced to gulp harder and try to forget. We are fortunate of course, in having a person of your intelligence and understanding to deal with. I meant to tell you that last November and December I had two offers to accept other teaching positions, one of them as Principal of a Public School. Although the appeals were strong I refused both offers primarily because of the conditions which would have resulted on Christian Island by two families leaving at once. I can say this to you Leonard, because I know you will give it your earnest thought.\n\nYou have anticipated however, your personal willingness to have your boy attend the R.C.S. School with your little girl. I understand the reason which you have given, but it will be necessary for you to make Application for Transfer with reasons. If you should make Application and it is granted, Junior will be required to change his Religion. Sister Black has intimated this fact to me and it is only reasonable to expect Sister Black to carry out her duty in this respect. Everyone however, in any way of looking at things, is entitled to the Religion of his or her choice. It is therefore not my wish to interfere in either your choice of School or Religion for your boy, but may I suggest that much discipline will be exacted regardless of your choice. To avoid there will be no easy way.\n\nI trust that I have made myself clearly understood, Leonard, and that if a change is made it will be done legally and mutually. If you so desire, Application for Transfer will be made from this Office upon receipt of an order from you. In the meantime I ask that you continue sending Jr. to his usual School. I shall try to find out the reason for the boys' discontentedness in School.\n\nThank you.\n\nDrop me a line soon.\n\nIndian Agency Office,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nChristian Island, Ont.,\nMarch 18, 1942.\n\nDear Leonard:\n\nIt is also with regret that I have received your note of 16-3-42. I have read the contents several times and have endeavored to fathom the perturbed state of your mind.\n\nFirst of all, let me congratulate you on the English you have used in your letter and the courteous manner in which you have expressed your feelings. It is not always that Mrs. Cowan and I have received notes so noticeably courteous.\n\nI shall try to explain on paper the incident in question, as it appeared to me and as it occurred.\n\nIt would seem that this winter most of the irregularity of attendance reported from Miss Elford's room has been in regard to the boys. The girls, as a general, seem to be very anxious to attend. As yet I have not succeeded in discovering altogether just why the boys are not as anxious to attend as the girls.\n\nOn several occasions Miss Elford reported to me certain absence and in most cases I suggested that she herself write a note to the parents.\n\nIt so happened one morning that I was just passing the School on my way to the Office, when Miss Elford shouted to me that two boys were running away from the school through the bush. The children were being called in to school; when I inquired who they were, I was told that Junior and Charlie King had gone. On a previous occasion when I had asked Simply for the reason of absence of his boy, he told me that they should not be absent as they were sent from home. He asked me to bring a little pressure to bear on them for playing truant. With this in mind, I concluded that there was no alternative but to act at this time. Accordingly I sent a bigger boy to bring them back. While waiting I broke a switch from a bush. I did use the switch on them a couple of times as they ran ahead of me to the school. As you have intimated, the boys were more frightened than hurt. I feel quite safe in saying that I am certain your boy would have been dealt with more severely by you as parent had you caught him on a similar occasion.\n\nWe all know of course that reports are somewhat exaggerated and understated at times. However, the very fact that your boy did not report to you seems evident to me that he did not suffer severe punishment. The snow was fairly deep and the boys ran just far enough ahead of me so that I could not have used the switch unduly even if I had desired to do so. It has always been my policy to maintain reasonably strict discipline but I have never been guilty of using severe methods except as a last resort. This incident was not a last resort and the punishment employed was not severe.\n\nI discovered later that one of the older boys had been telling Miss Elford certain untruths concerning Junior. I recommended that boy strongly for his false reports. This was done in Miss Elford's classroom during school hours as a means of letting all children know that such false reports would not be tolerated.\n\nI had not heard anything further concerning the incident and dealings until Sister Black reported to the Agency Office that Junior was in attendance at the R.C. School. She asked me if it was permissible for pupils to transfer at will from one school to the other. I appreciated Sister Black's cooperation in this respect and I wrote a note to her to the effect that such procedure was contrary to School Regulations and Department Rules.\n\nOnly on Application to The Indian Affairs Branch, Department\n\n........ Mines & Resources, Ottawa\nChristian Island\n20-3-42\n\nMr. H.J. Cowan\nSir,\n\nI hereby authorize you to make an application to transfer from my son Leonard, from the U.C. living school to the P.C. school on the Reserve.\n\nI have also written to the school that I give my consent that he attends the new school.\n\nMrs. Macdonald will sign the letter of application if one is needed.\n\nLiveday Cowan\nR.C.A.F.\n\nChristian School\n\n16-3-42\n\nMr. K.D. Brown,\n\nIt is with sincere regret that I am driven by troubled thoughts to write to you regarding Leonard's attendance at school. It is the irregular attendance of school by Leonard that has caused me concern. I hope that he is excused from work so that he can be of some help around the house. Under the present circumstances, he has been told by his mother and myself that he should attend school when his help is not needed. Apparently such methods from both sides have frightened him & almost...\nI feel keenly the loss of my dear friend. I am glad I didn't see him in his last days.\n\nI did not meet anyone who could help me when I was sick. They were all very kind, though.\n\nI had hoped to have this thing cleared up by now. And I am truly sorry that you should have to endure this.\n\nI am very grateful for the R.C.A.F.'s kindness. It has been so thoughtful and considerate.\nR.C.A.F.\n\nthe extent that he dislikes school.\n\nI do hope that began boys up to are certain that you went so far as to use a stick... a punishment... I think I always thought corporal punishment had been abolished. This methods was most reported by himself they were told by several other children who witnessed them. It took a whip from his mother to attend school once until the above mentioned came to me and he was always told to attend school until his own... I believe that such tactics from both sides, I mean it to him a good whipping time...\nR.C.A.F.\n\nThere has always been a desire to attend the R.C.A.F. School. If this is not cleared up please let me know so I can be of assistance. I have told him that I agree to have him in time any time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLeonard\nOttawa,\nApril 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to transferring the son of Leonard Monague from the Christian Island U.C.

Gauthier, Supt., I.A\nExtract from Acting Inspector J.E. Morris' report of his inspection of the Christian Island Agency dated June 23, 1948. Original on file 77-6 Ins.2.\n\nR.C. Day School.\n\nThis school is in good condition. The residence and class room are constructed on a cement foundation. The Superintendent advised that authority has been obtained to purchase storm windows.\n\nThe present enrolment is 22 and is expected to increase to 27 when the school opens in September.\n\nThe desks in this school are also in a poor condition. I would recommend that 28 new type desks be authorized - 10 small, 10 medium and 8 large. The attendance on July 18th showed only that five children were at school - 11 had gone berry picking.\n\nThe annual migration of the Indians from the Reserve during the berry picking time is seriously affecting our school attendance during the last two weeks of June, as noted above. The thought occurred to me why not cut down the Christmas and Easter holidays or possibly start school earlier by opening in the autumn one week sooner. I understand the schools are supposed to commence on September 7th. If they are started one week earlier, then the class work could be arranged so that school would be closed on June 15th, or thereabouts and get in the full school year.\nSisters of Service\n\nAugust 6, 1948\n\nMr. Bernard F.

Sister Donnelly has completed this form and you will find it enclosed.\n\nThe salaries of our teaching Sisters are exempt from Income Tax throughout Canada. When our Sisters first started teaching on Christian Island Mr. Phelan advised them that it would be better for them to pay the Income Tax and receive the Cost of Living Bonus which was being paid at that time. This Bonus has been stopped for some time, and they are still paying Income Tax. We were wondering if you could suggest any way of having this adjusted.\n\nThanking you sincerely for your kind interest, we are,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nThe Sisters of Service\n\n[Signature]\nAugust 10, 1948.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 6 and have discussed this matter with Mr. Phelan. We agree that it will be to your advantage to claim exemption from Income Tax in future as members of a religious Order.\n\nWe have therefore asked our Chief Treasury Officer to so classify both Sister Donnelly and Sister Kelly in future. We have done so in view of the fact that the cost-of-living bonus is no longer being paid to Civil Servants.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard O'Leary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nReverend Sister Carolyn Albury,\nSecretary,\nSisters of Service,\n2 Wellesley Place,\nToronto, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, September 15, 1948.\n\nTO: Sister Florence Helena Kelly,\nSCHOOL: Christian Island R.C.\nADDRESS: Christian Island, Ontario.\n\nAPPLICATION FOR CLASSIFICATION ON REVISED SALARY SCHEDULE.\n\nOur files here indicate that we have not as yet received from you a copy of the form attached to the June 1948 issue of the Bulletin, and entitled, \"APPLICATION FOR CLASSIFICATION ON 1948 REVISED INDIAN SCHOOL TEACHER'S SALARY SCHEDULE\".\n\nIt is essential that we have complete and up to date information on every teacher's qualifications and experience before setting their salary for the 1948-49 academic year. If you have not already completed this form, I would ask that you do so immediately and forward it to the office of your Indian Superintendent. Unless this is done, your salary for September, 1948, will be the same as that salary you received for June, 1948.\n\nIf you have already sent this form in to your Indian Superintendent, check with him to ensure that it has not been mislaid.

Morris is being transferred to the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School. You should give him every possible assistance in carrying out the instructions contained in the enclosed letter.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Indian Day School should be conducted in the Council Hall and the United Church Indian Day School in the present school building. The latter school, of course, will continue in charge of Rev. Fr. Dean and Miss M. M. O'Toole, who has been teaching at the Lower French River Indian Day School in the Barry Sound Agency, is being transferred to Christian Island and will be in charge of the Roman Catholic Indian Day School at a salary of $80 a teaching month.\n\nMiss O'Toole is being instructed to reach Penetanguishene on October 13th. The Department desires you to meet her there and take her to Christian Island. Please write Miss M. M. O'Toole, Lower French River Indian Day School, Pickering, Ont., informing her at what point in Penetanguishene you will meet her on the 13th proxime.\n\nThe children of those Indians who are recognized as Roman Catholics must attend the Roman Catholic Indian Day School, while the children of those Indians who are recognized as Protestants must attend the United Church Indian Day School. Children must not be transferred from one school to the other without first receiving the consent of the Department.\n\nThe Department understands that the Roman Catholic Church authorities will make arrangements to secure suitable boarding accommodation for Miss O'Toole.\n\nThe Department expects you to give every possible assistance to the teachers of both schools in your agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn A.

O'Toole has been transferred to the Christian Island MIKIK Indian Day School from October 15th, 1934, with salary at the rate of $800 a year (See memo to Minister dated September 18th, 1934, on File 6-2-1). Miss O'Toole replaces Mr. Vernon H. Morris.\n\nShe should, therefore, be allowed one-half month's salary at Lower French River and one-half at Christian Island, as follows:\n\n| Location          | Name            | Salary |\n|-------------------|-----------------|--------|\n| Lower French River| Miss M.M. O'Toole| $800 - $40.00 |\n| Christian Island  |                 |        |\n\nCheque in payment of Miss O'Toole's salary should be sent to Miss M. M. O'Toole,\nChristian Island, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.\nFebruary 11th, 1935,\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\n\nThe name of Miss M. M. O'Toole still shows on the pay list as second teacher at Christian Island School No. 364.\n\nThe proper entry should be:\n\n450 - Christian Island R.C., M. M. O'Toole, Christian Island, $800.-$20 Ont.\nMay 11th, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\n\nRe: School No. 450\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General has approved an increase in salary of $100 a year to Miss Margaret M. O'Toole, teacher of the Christian Island R.C. Indian Day School, from April 1st, 1936. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $900 a year.\n\nAs the above increase was not allowed when paying Miss O'Toole's April salary, there is a balance of $10.00 due her for that month and this should be added to her May salary, making the amount payable on the May paylist $100. (May salary $90 plus balance due on April salary $10.)\n\nThe following entry should, therefore, appear on the May paylist:\n\n450 - M. M. O'Toole - Christian Island, - $900 - $100.00\nOnt.\nAugust 8th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nSee official letter of August 5th, 1937, on File 22-6-1, addressed to Indian Agent Daly, approving the transfer of Miss M. M. O'Toole from the Christian Island R. C. Indian Day School to the Lower French River Indian Day School, effective September 1st, 1937.\n\nMiss O'Toole is being allowed salary at the rate of $900 a year at Lower French River and the new appointee at Christian Island should be allowed salary at the rate of $900 a year.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1943.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TRAIQUIX\n\nRe: Christian Island N.C. Indian Day School, No. 600.\n\nReverend Sister Black, who was in charge of the above-mentioned school, will not be returning to duties. To succeed her the Department has appointed Sister Mary Jackson at the same salary. The appointment of the latter is effective September 1, 1943.

As I am relinquishing office within a very few days, I do not wish to make any long-term promise, but I am sure that if the Department does the proper and generous thing, my successor can be relied on to do the proper and generous thing also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.J.H. Hamilton, F.J.\nProvincial, Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada\nHe has a list of the necessary furnishings needed and when advised to go ahead with the repairs he will arrange to have the teacher accompany him to Penetang to select the furniture and kitchen utensils. He has been advised that only good serviceable articles should be purchased and the cost kept as low as possible.\n\nIt might be advisable to have the assurance of the Church authorities that the Priest's Residence will be available for a teacher as long as it is required for this purpose, otherwise it would seem unwise to expend the money on it.\n\nI might say that Miss O'Toole appears to be a very conscientious and efficient teacher. Under very unfavourable circumstances she has entered into the work cheerfully and with determination to make good.\n\n[Signature]\nInspector.\nNovember 7, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McAll\n\nR.C. Indian Day School\nChristian Island,\n\nI was requested by the Schools Branch to look into the question of class room accommodation, equipment and living quarters for the teacher.\n\nThe school has just recently been established and is being conducted in the R.C. Chapel with 28 pupils enrolled and desk accommodation for 18. Additional seats are required as follows -\n\n- 8 for pupils 7 to 10\n- 7 = 10 to 13\n- 3 = 13 to 15 also the following equipment and supplies -\n\nTeacher's desk\nchair\n2' x 6', Blackboard 6\" with frames\n1 School Register\n30 requisition forms\n30 quarterly school returns\n30 Teacher's report to Truant officer\n30 Truant Officer forms.\n\nThe following articles have already been supplied -\n\nStove wood\npipe\nBasin\nPail\nMirror\nCups\nSoap\nTowelling\n Axe and broom\n\nLiving quarters for teacher. A very neat little cottage known as the Priest's Residence is available for use of the teacher just across the road from the chapel. Father Labelle assured me he had the necessary authority to hand it over for this purpose as long as the need existed. Approximately $200.00 would have to be spent to make it comfortable as teacher's residence. The foundation should be banked with earth; windows and doors tightened up, the torn door at the entrance, a bedroom partitioned off, the walls and ceiling painted and floors covered and a chemical closet installed. Agent Allen can arrange for a local Indian to do the carpenter work and painting.\nnot exceed the figure mentioned above.\n\nAfter this work is completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of materials, and a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, for the amount due for labour.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands, to make the best arrangements possible and at the lowest cost, to have the living quarters fitted up for the teacher of the R.C. School.\n\nI may add that an order will be placed here for the supplying of 18 school desks, of the size required, and a teacher's desk and chair for the use of this school. This equipment will be shipped, addressed to you at Penetanguishene, Ont. When the shipment arrives, you should have the articles taken to the school and set up in the classroom. Any expense in connection with the transfer and installing of the desks will be paid upon receipt of a certified voucher, in triplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, November 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGeekin, who recently visited Christian Island, reports regarding the fitting up of living quarters in the Priest's residence for the teacher of the Christian Island R. C. Indian Day School. The church authorities have given assurance that they will place this house at the disposal of the Catholic teacher, without charge.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that the foundation be banked with earth and the windows and doors tightened up. He recommends that a storm door be installed at the entrance, that a bedroom be partitioned off, the walls and ceiling painted and floors covered and also that a chemical closet be installed. He states, further, that you could arrange for a local Indian to do the carpenter work and painting and that you have a list of the furnishings required.\n\nI have therefore requested that you will arrange, at the earliest possible date, to have the work, as mentioned by the Inspector, performed, in order to provide comfortable living quarters for the teacher in the Priest's residence. The Inspector states that you will arrange to accompany her to Penetanguishene, to select the furnishings and kitchen utensils. He states that approximately $200.00 would cover all costs for repairs, etc. It is hoped that you can have the work mentioned performed, employing Indian labour - the materials to be purchased by you.

the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nFORM No. 413\nChristian Island, Ontario\nJuly 10th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find Requisition for School Material which was returned to this office for approximate cost of articles shown on requisition, which I have done.\n\nThe school desks in question are as follows, #5 New Empire school desks, and the manufacturers of these are the E. H. Moyer, Co., York Street, Toronto, Ontario, and the cost of each desk is $7.00 each making a total for the 4 desks asked for $28.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Allan,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 31, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery to the Christian Island Indian Day School of the following supplies: 1 rolling pin, 1 roaster, 1 flour can, 1 mantle and 1 chimney for Aladdin lamp, 1 chair, 1 blanket, 1 bread board, 1 bread knife, 1 rocking chair, 1 cake tin, and oilcloth for kitchen table.\n\nYou may also purchase for the teacher's residence 1 dresser, 1 cupboard, 1 piece of zinc and 1 day couch, and the dishes that are necessary. It is considered that a suitable dresser can be secured at a price less than that quoted in your letter, viz., $23.00. All of the above articles should be purchased at as reasonable a cost as possible. It is understood, of course, that all purchases will be made from firms on the approved list.\n\nAn order will be placed by the Department for the four new desks requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Allan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island,\nOnt.\nSeptember 14, 1935\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI inspected the Christian Island Catholic School this past week. The report will reach you later but there are a few urgent matters.\n\n1. There is no wood at the school yet, nor does it seem to be out. Burning green wood in the cold winter days is a trying situation. There is only 1 cord at the school and none at the teacher's residence. About 1/2 a cord of the Mission Church wood has been used. This must be returned. There is no kindling wood for the teacher's use and she is finding it difficult starting fires with slabs of hardwood.\n\n2. Duncan Copegoz has been caretaker of the School since January. To date, he has received only $7.00. This should be investigated. This man has been most faithful. During last winter he had difficulty keeping this church-school heated. Many times he arose in the middle of the night to make sure the fires were on. He has washed the floors once a month. Mowed church benches and school seats weekly. He should be paid $50.00 yearly.\n\n3. Complaints reached me also that John Sylvester, caretaker for the Fall term of 1934 (October, November, December) was not paid at all. He was officially engaged. Nothing was paid him. It should be investigated and allowance paid him so that there are a lot of hard feelings existing over it.\n\n4. Since the school being held in the church an allowance should be made for rent to the missionary. At least $10.00 a month for the church for school purposes and $5 or $7 a month for the missionary's house used by the teacher since last October 1934 and that is real cheap. I might say that the missionary had to change the windows and add to them five lights for school purposes. Four windows (2 1/2 each) about 4' x 3\" were specially made. Besides one of the stained glass windows was broken and all glass should be made. This is the usual wear and tear where children are, which should be paid for.\n\n5. Kindly hurry along the new school and residence combined.\n\n6. The teacher is without lamp light. She has a fine Aladdin Lamp but she needs mantles. Send 6 mantles for Aladdin lamp and 2 chimneys for this new type No. 12.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

It is very important that the site of the School be close to the Church.\n\nThere is no need of an expensive building. A class room twenty by thirty is large enough and two or three rooms for the teacher\u2014one kitchen, a bedroom and maybe a living room.\n\nI have visited that district this summer and I personally saw the needs that exist and I hope that you will be good enough to attend to this matter without delay.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHBISHOP OF TORONTO.\nArchdiocese of Toronto\nChancery Office\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nGovernment of Canada,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nMay I call your attention to the situation of the Catholic Indian School on Christian Island. I refrained from writing you until the present time, hoping from day to day that the situation would be remedied. I wish to remind you of the following points:\n\n(1) That your department has been using the Church for a School and the Missionary's House as a residence for the School Teacher and no rental has been paid for either.\n\n(2) The continual daily use of the Church by the thirty-two Indian children has caused much unavoidable wear and tear which the Department should pay for; chief of which is a new front door; inside swing door tightened and painted; the broken windows replaced and the woodwork around the lower interior painted; the eighteen benches painted. (The continual moving and piling of the seats and kneeling benches, each week, to make room for the school desks has somewhat damaged them).\n\n(3) The outside toilets were erected by the Missionary at his own expense. He also had extra windows put in the Church to light it better for school purposes, although his revenue is a mere pittance.\n\n(4) The house itself is in need of paint.\n\n(5) I wish to also point out that for two year, the Missionary has been put out of his house and has occupied temporary quarters in a small room at the back of the Church. He never thought that the Church and house would be used by the Department for over two years. Cannot something be done to hurry the building of the School?\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, September 23, 1936.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Christian Island R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nRecently, we received a formal request to pay rent for the use of the Church as a school and the Indian Agent was instructed, in official letter of the 18th instant, to forward a voucher for the period September 1st, 1935, to August 31st, 1936 - 12 months at $10.00 a month. As soon as this voucher is received, a cheque will be issued and sent to Rev. Father O. Labelle, S. J. I regret that it will not be possible to allow payment previous to September 1st, 1935.\n\nWhile the funds for a new building were provided in the current year's Appropriation, several circumstances have combined to make it impossible for the work to proceed. However, we expect to get the building started within the next two weeks. I understand that the site chosen for this school adjoins the church property on the west side.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. H. G. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. J. G. McGuigan,\nArchbishop of Toronto,\n200 Church St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, October 2, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to allow the sum of $10 a month for rent of the priest's house which has been used as a residence for the teacher of the Christian Island R. C. Day School. The voucher should be issued in payment for this service from September 1st to August 31st, a period of twelve months at $10 a month.\n\nThis voucher should be issued in favour of Rev. O. Labelle, S.J., and should be forwarded to the Department at once. You should also forward at once the voucher requested in official letter of the 15th ultimo for rent of the R. C. church which has been used as a school at Christian Island.\n\nRev. O. Labelle, S.J., advises the Department that he expended an amount for the erection of two toilets. Our records do not show that he has been reimbursed for this expenditure. You should, therefore, see Father Labelle at the earliest possible date and obtain receipts from him showing the amount expended for the purpose and forward a voucher in his favour, in order that payment can be made to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McDonald\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to ask if there has been any decision as to the heating system of the new H C School. Is it to be a furnace or just stoves? Would not a wood burning furnace similar to the one at the agency be the more economical? It would heat both residence and school; I would like permission to buy point to drive for water. In the basement of school while digging cellar struck water and have been able to have all needed for building purposes right there but the trouble is it is right in center of floor which would be a very inconvenient place. Can get water at the north west corner leaving the center of floor clear and it would be right under kitchen and if a sink is to be in it could be quite easily piped to it. The point could be driven quite easily clear sand no stones to contend with and the price of same about $4.00 much cheaper than the digging and cementing a well.\n\nWill the Department let me know as soon as possible about heating system and water proposition for the new H C School? As it is getting the time of year when crossing impossible for a few weeks and roads not good for getting to town.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nChristain Island\nJan 8, 1927\n\nDear sir,\n\nWhen sending in Paylist for week ending Dec 19 for work on new school asked for money to keep going but as yet have not received same and they would like their pay.\n\nAlso in letter previous to that asked about heating system and permission to buy pump and sink for well but have received no reply as yet.\n\nVery anxious to have reply over heating system to know where pipe holes etc to be put in walls whether for furnace or stoves.\n\nWould you kindly let me have replies as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n16th January, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letters with regard to the new day school under construction at Christian Island, I beg to say that the department approves of the installation of a wood burning hot air furnace, and you may make immediate arrangements with Mr. A.

Will order wire and posts for fence but same will not be able to put up until frost out of ground. Would it be possible to hold some money for this purpose? Am hoping to get the furnace over while the ice is on but whether will be successful or not cannot say as they are taking so long in shipping same. Mr McDonald is trying hard to rush it as I am anxious to get the pupils into the school.\n\nAm enclosing a few snaps of the school taken a few days before it was finished.

I wrote Dr. Tanner to kindly see to their transportation to the island. I wrote to the Acting Indian Agent that Dr. Tanner had been written to this effect. I also told Rev. Father Lebel in case he wished to be on hand to welcome them. I advised them to get a grocery order from Eaton's etc etc. They will arrive by train at Ponctang on Wednesday November 19th at 1:05 p.m. with two trunks and hand baggage.\n\nI spent about an hour with them today and gave them all the information I could. They are two very admirable ladies in talent and personality. The teacher has had some 12 years teaching experience in the Province of Quebec (holds a Superior certificate). The Indians are going to have the benefit of real inspiration.\n\nI got a reply from Miss O'Connell regarding some matters about the house. There is only one bed upstairs and the couch in the living room. After the Sisters arrive and when I view the situation we will let you know whether or not another bed should be provided.\n\nWill the Dept supply another Alladin Lamp? and a gallon can of oil can't be a two gallon one would be better.\n\nThe Sisters would like to have a sewing machine provided. It would be of great value because already these Sisters have discussed with me the course of study for the older girls and planned covering classes for older girls. I would strongly advise providing them with a sewing machine (second hand if no other could be obtained).\n\nWould you please supply the following for the course in sewing and knitting:\n\n- Spools of thread - a dozen of each of white and black at $40.\n- Sewing needles - assorted packages.\n- Knitting needles - a dozen pair.\n- Crochet needles - six.\n- Cotton wool for mitts, etc for knitting - 2 lbs of Grey, 2 lbs of red and two lbs of blue.\n- Or any factory cotton - 24 yds or so.\n- Ordinary cotton poplin - 24 yds in different colours as follows:\n  - 3 yds red and 3 yds of yellow-blue\n  - 5 yds green\n  - 9 yds rose\n- Cotton flannel - this is sold in skeins they would like:\n  - 6 skeins of each of these colours: red, green, blue, pink, etc.\n- Ordinary gray flannel - could you send them a bolt which is about 24 yds and is cheaper that way.\n- Cotton tape - 12 rolls (3yds to roll) this is cheap.\n\nThey can give a real contribution to the Indian girls life with this sewing course. I don't think the above requisition is excessive. The sister who will do this is expert.\n\nIf your printing office has a text on the household arts sent to other schools, send one here.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 10th, 1941.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nNovember 18, 1941.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF CHRISTIAN ISLAND R.C.

The day was fine, following a snow storm but the water in the channel was running high from the southwest and the spray from the white caps sure did drench me somewhat. It was a rolling trip.\n\nAs I intimated in my letter to you earlier, they will need another bed. There is room in the bed room for a single 3' 3\" bed. They will need a mattress to go with it. They also have need of a few kitchen supplies. There is no wash tub nor is there anything big enough to cook a ham; no bread pan either. Some cooking will be taught these girls. These I am also listing on the enclosed sheet together with the cost as shown in Eaton's Catalogue. Eaton's have evidently trucked some presents with someone in Penetang and orders are delivered direct to the Island, free of transportation charges. So maybe it might be best to deal with them.\n\nThe Sisters attended the Sunday service which the Catholic Indians hold on Sundays when the missionary is not there (which is most of the time). The prayer man attends to this. At his request they held open house in the school in the afternoon and all went pleasantly. From what I learned from Capegog, who took me across, they are quite pleased and happy for the provision your Department has made for them in giving them the Sisters of Service. The House of Arts of Sewing, etc., which the housekeeper will give them will evidently be most welcomed. She is very capable. The sewing machine is not there as yet. But the transportation of it will be the problem of the Indian Agent.\n\nI hope you will be able to supply all of the enclosed.\n\nThe Sisters said that a cheap cot would do them but that is not such a \"hot\" idea to me. What do you think?\n\nI felt that this initial order should be sent you direct rather than through the agency since these have to be decided upon.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. Bennett.\nI understand that you have trucking arrangements with someone in Penetanguishene and that orders are delivered direct to Christian Island. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange to have the above items shipped at once to Sister Ames V. Black, Teacher, Christian Island R.C. Indian Day School, Christian Island, Ont. Your account, in triplicate, should also be forwarded to Sister Black who, on receipt of the goods, will certify the account and forward it to this Department for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

School, please advise them at once to have the carpenter build what they require. If they pay his account they should obtain a receipt from him and forward the account to me and refund will be made to them. The account, of course, should be detailed showing material purchased and this should be on a bill head of the firm supplying the material. The labour should be shown as a separate item on the account and the whole account should be in triplicate.\n\nIf, however, they do not wish to pay the bill, the Sister Superior should prepare the account in the same manner as suggested above and certify it as being correct and a cheque will be issued in favour of the person or persons to whom the amount is due. I believe, if they have the work done under their own supervision, it will be completed in a manner satisfactory to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.

C. School one day this week. I found that the water seeps in through the floor and an inch or so of water lays on the floor nearly all the year, in fact Sister of Service Black, told me that at some time there is considerable water on the floor of the basement.\n\nUpon checking on the situation I am of the opinion that the school is built on the ravine which the seepage follows from Lake Douglas, which is about quarter of a mile from the school itself.\n\nIf my hunch is right then the only solution to the problem is to tile across the North end and down the west side which would require 300 feet of tile.\n\nI did not ascertain the cost of tile, and will await your instructions before doing anything further.\n\nThe labor would cost about 30 to 40 Dollars.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept., Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, the Department approves your action in providing tile to remove the water from the basement of the Christian Island R.C.

Hurl, Acting Indian Agent, Christian Island,\nOnt.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Christian\nIsland R.C. School on May 28, Inspector Bennett writes:\n\n\"Water flooded the cellar to a depth of eight\ninches. A tile drain will no doubt help, but will\nthis not freeze in the winter? The main cause is the\nway water comes up through the thin cellar floor. It\nis such a fine cellar that I would suggest that\nanother concrete floor be made over it. The island\nis full of gravel and they have a mixing machine.\"\n\nThe Department is inclined to feel that the\ntrouble with this school is that no gravel bed was\nprovided under the cement floor to allow water to run\naway. It is possible that in order to make a proper\njob it will be necessary to remove the present cement\nfloor and put in a gravel base and then a new cement\nfloor. I should appreciate it if you would give this\nmatter your immediate consideration and let me know\nthe probable cost.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary Indian Affairs Branch Dept., Mines & Resources\n\nIn reply to yours of June 30th, file no. 6-2-5 regarding report of Inspector Bennett.\n\nYou will recall that we done some work on this school last fall, and completed it this spring, in that we put a tile drain along one end and one side carrying it about one hundred feet beyond the school property towards the Bay, this drain done a very good job in taking the water out of the cellar. I am inclined to believe that this school was built right over the natural outlet or seepage of Lake Douglas, and this I am sure is the cause of the water coming into the cellar in the spring of the year. I have also ascertained from the Indians that there was a foundation of stone laid before the cement was put down.\n\nI know from going to the school several times last spring, that it is anything but a nice situation, having the water in the cellar, and is certainly not healthful, but I am at loss to know what can be done further to overcome the difficulty.\n\nIf you deem it advisable that we should lay another coat of waterproof cement, of perhaps two inches thick, on the floor and carry it up the walls for a height of about 6 or 8', I will have this done, may I suggest that it be left for Mr. Arnall to consider when he comes back this fall, as I understand he is coming then.\n\nActing Indian Agent\nG.

School, this is a problem to know just what to do to make this drain anyway permanent. You will recall that we did this job just about a year ago, Sister Jackson called me over to the School on Sept. 12 there was then a good foot of water in the basement.\n\nThere was nothing to do but to dig it out and see where the drain was plugged, I found that the roots from a tree that stands just near the South corner had penetrated the tile and completely stopping the water from getting away. I hesitate to suggest cutting the tree down as it is a beautiful maple and about 7 inches through at the butt.\n\nThere is no way of knowing, or saying that it will not do so again.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent, G.E.

I had to buy 60 feet more tile, and even yet if I am going to continue the drain down to the drop in the rise of the ground it will be necessary to put in some box drain to do this.\n\nAfter putting a drain all the way around both sides of the foundation, outside, and then filling it in the water still raised on floor of the basement, so there was nothing left to do but to dig a drain right across the floor through the cement floor and lay tile in this, I was then able to overcome the difficulty. Right now the floor is dry, and here is hoping that it will remain that way.\n\nMr. Arneil and I discussed this proposition from every possible angle; he suggested that I should try and get some contractor or builder to come out and give expert advice this I tried to do but could not get a man to come.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No.: dated urgent.\n\nVoucher No.: 75\n\nDate: June 15, 1945\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nWe should do something about the painting of the outside of the two Indian day schools on the Island.\n\nI see no reason why the Indians could not do this work; there are several quite capable of doing the work. May I order the paint, and employ the Indians paying them 35\u00a2 per hour to do the job.\n\nThere is another matter which should be attended to, that is the heating system in the U.C. school. The hot air pipes lead through the wall from the main basement, there being a hole just large enough to allow the pipes to go through. It is here that I feel that the difficulty arises. I am quite sure that it will bind.\n\nI have been called to the school in the winter when the rooms have only been 40 degrees, with a good fire on in the furnace, this means quite a fuel loss.\n\nMay I be permitted to have a plumber come and check on this with the idea in mind of repairing it if possible, or should I have them give us an estimate of the cost?\n\nG. E. Hurl,\nA/Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 12, 1946.\n\nMr. G. R. Hurl, Indian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to painting the outside of the two schools on the Christian Island Reserve. How much paint would be required and what colour do you suggest?\n\nI note that you can secure Indians at $5.00 an hour. What amount would be involved for labour? The Department requires the above information before making a final decision regarding the painting of the buildings.\n\nYou may have a plumber examine the heating system at the United Church School, with a view to remedying the condition which you mention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nReplying to your letter of July 12th file 6-2-5 regarding the painting of the two Island schools.\n\nAs near as I can estimate we will need 10 gallons of (cream) paint for each school, 1 gallon (cream) for each school. Then I believe that 1 gal. of oil, and 1 gal. of turpentine should do both. I will also need some brushes.\n\nI could recommend that we give the work two coats, as they are in very bad shape.\n\nI have arranged with the Indians to do the job, and I estimate that it will take 3 to 4 days to do the U.S. school, and 7 or 8 days should do the M.C. school. In estimating this I have taken into consideration that two men would be employed. This would mean that the U.S. school would cost about $70.00, and the M.C. school $50.00 and $80.00. This being for labour only.\n\nRegarding the heating system at the U.S. school I had a slower time out, and he referred to me that the only sure way of overcoming the difficulty is to put a wall around the building. He is quite sure, as I have already reported, that this is the cause of the air not getting through the registers. This would run into a considerable cost; the kiln wing under which the foundation is needed, is about 4' x 24'.\n\nG. H.

I told them I could not give them any answer, but would refer the matter to you, with this they were satisfied.

[Signature],\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa \u2014 Dear Sir,\n\nOrnaburg has been sadly neglected for a long time. Its only teacher, for young & old being given by an missionary from St. Albert, for two or three weeks each summer, supplemented every third or fourth year by a visit from either the Bishop or Archdeacon. I was there in June 1909 and Archdeacon Remioux last summer. He felt that account of the large numbers of Indians that assemble there in summer, it also visit that Post during its winter, that more should be done for them. I have therefore decided, if possible, secure a missionary as soon as possible, and place him in a permanent charge. This missionary would be the double duty of school teacher and catechist.\n\nI would like to know whether the Indian Department would give a grant towards his salary as teacher, to supplement the diocesean grant for his maintenance. It may be possible to carry out this plan next summer, as I am now in communication with a student of three years' standing, who has applied for Indian missionary work. The H.B.C. Manager at Ornaburg, Mr. Thomas, has offered to board the missionary till we can find a dwelling. We already have a building which will do for school & church. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 17th instant with reference to the establishment of a school at Osnaburgh.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to pay at the rate of $300.00 for the teacher's salary as soon as Your Lordship is able to secure one, on the understanding that the school be conducted in the building which Your Lordship states is available for school and church purposes. Kindly advise the Department of the date on which the teacher assumes his duties at the school. The Department will not bind itself to continue this grant unless results warrant it.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nChapleau, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been sent here recently by the Bishop of Toronto for the purpose of teaching school along with other duties. I understand from him that arrangements would, or had been made for the Agent to bring up a supply of school necessaries when he came recently for treaty. Up to the present these supplies have not arrived. I shall feel obliged if you will give instructions for the same to be sent on at once as convenient, not forgetting one or a couple of registers. I may say there are no school supplies here whatever.\n\nHoping to hear from you at an early date,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO.H. Mason\nunderstanding that the school should be conducted in the building he mentioned and he was asked to advise the Department of the date on which the teacher assumed his duties and told that the Department would not bind itself to continue this grant unless results warranted it. As no reply was ever received to this letter and as the Department has only today received an intimation that a teacher had been obtained no school material was furnished.\n\nYou will see, therefore, from the above correspondence that the Department is in no way responsible for the housing of the teacher. The Department would hardly be justified in going to the expense of erecting a school-house until assured that there is some prospect of results being obtained. The Osnaburg Indians are only at the mission for a short period during the summer and winter months. Mr. Dixon was most likely advised of the conditions by the Bishop before he went in.\n\nA small supply of school material could be sent in, but they should make their own desks and blackboards.\nOttawa, August 2, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nWith reference to the letter from Mr. S. H. Dixon, resident missionary, regarding the opening of a school at Osnaburg I beg to say that in December, 1911, Archdeacon Redden, who called at the Department, stated that the Indians at Osnaburg wanted a summer school established there and that the Bishop of Moose Cree would write in reference to this matter. In the January following a letter was received from the Bishop. He stated that he had an offer from a student of three years standing who was willing to go as a missionary and teacher to Osnaburg and he asked the Department for the usual salary grant of $300.00. He stated that the Hudson's Bay officer had offered to board the missionary till a dwelling could be erected. The Church, he said, had a building which would answer the purpose of a school-house and church. The Department replied to the Bishop that it would be willing to pay a salary of $300.00 as soon as a teacher was secured on the\nAs this stationery has to be ordered from the Government Stationery Office it may be sometime before it reaches you, but that office will be asked to forward it as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo reporting that you had opened the school at Osnaburg for the Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department was not aware that you had been appointed to take charge of this school and was awaiting word from the Bishop of the diocese before sending in any school supplies.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is probable that there will be children to attend this school only for a few months, the supply of school material has been very much cut down. The desks and hyloplate blackboard cannot be sent in at present, but a supply of stationery is being ordered from the Government Stationery Office to be sent to your address via Graham and you may purchase from the Hudson's Bay Co. 2 brooms, 6 combs, 2 cups, 2 looking glasses, 2 pails and 12 yards of towelling and the account should be in duplicate and should be certified to by you and transmitted to the Department for payment.\n\nA return showing the attendance should be sent to the Department at the end of September and supply of blank forms for this purpose is being sent you under separate cover.\n\nS.

I promised to ask you, perhaps you would like to consult your agent.\n\nPerhaps you have heard that Archibald Cook is acting Superintendent of the Indian Affairs Administration office in Ottawa. I hope they will not keep him too long as he is a good man of much promise.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRobert J. Reeves\nBritish Columbia\nJanuary 12, 1948.\n\nDear Bishop Benson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 7. It would now seem evident that all your teachers have been paid, with the exception of Mr. Bridle. Fortunately, Mr. Indian Superintendent Smartt was visiting our office at the time your letter arrived. I therefore had an opportunity to discuss with him the non-payment of Mr. Bridle's salary. He informed me that to the best of his knowledge, he had not yet received an application form from Mr. Bridle.\n\nWith regard to the school at Central Patricia, it would seem from your letter that this school would not be established on an Indian reserve. Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act gives the Governor in Council the authority to establish day schools in any Indian reserve for the children of such reserve. It does not give authority for the establishment of day schools off an Indian reserve. However, I will expect to hear further from you concerning this proposed school.\n\nIncidentally, we have authority by Order-in-Council for the establishment of an Indian day school at the Cat Lake Mission. This authority is dated July 19, 1935.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend R. J.

These were only recently received at this office from the teacher, Reverend T. H. Bridle of Central Patricia, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\nFebruary 14, 1948.\n\nMr. Gifford Swartman, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Sieur Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant enclosing returns showing the attendance of children belonging to the Onanburgh Band at the day school conducted at Pickle Lake during the summer of 1947.\n\nWhile we are prepared to pay Reverend T.H. Bridle for his services, we cannot do so until we receive a staff questionnaire and either a T.D.I or T.D.II form. I enclose staff questionnaire forms and both T.D.I and T.D.II forms and he should complete whichever one of these forms applies in his particular case.\n\nBernard T. Henry\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nfor any length of time on Lake St. Joseph and there would be the problem of a building and teacher's residence.\nFebruary 19, 1948\n\nThe Right Reverend L.J. Henison, D.D.,\nCentral Patricia,\nOntario.\n\nDear Mr. Henison:\n\nA little while ago I received a letter from Mr. Smith, the Indian agent at Sioux Lookout containing the following paragraphs:\n\n\"Before you complete arrangements for a school at Picton Lake next year, I would suggest that you get in touch with our department and ascertain if they will authorize the operation of a school there in 1948. I understand very few Indians are to be employed with the mines and if such is the case, I believe the school would serve more children and be better for the future...I recall of the Osnaburgh Land and if it were located at the reserve (on Lake St. Joseph).\n\nYou will rather from this that he is apparently not in favour of the school at the Landing. Why? I do not know. The above reasons do not seem logical to me. The school is by no means for children of those who work in the mine in particular. From local inquiry I am convinced that the school would not serve more children if it were on Lake St. Joseph. Mr. Swartman sees the Osnaburgh Indians at Treaty Time, when, naturally they are all on deck to receive their four dollars. Normally, I understand that there are not many together in one place on Lake St. Joseph for any length of time during the summer. With regard to his supposition re \"welfare and morals\", I do not know what the inference is. I have heard no complaints.\n\nLast Summer our attendance at the Landing reached twenty-four and there would have been more if transportation could be arranged for those at the Crown. Of those who did attend I am of the opinion that very few were connected with the mines. A number were with Forestry and for this work will be living at the Landing each summer. I doubt if any were with the mine. I understand that it would be difficult to get any number of children\nthree years. Mr. Bridle has every qualification as a teacher. He holds a B.A. degree, and is a qualified school teacher in Ontario. I have received a request from the owner of the building that the Church should buy it. The building is not a church, but a school, and I would be very glad if we could make some arrangement whereby we could pay for the school as soon as possible.\n\nIt may be necessary for me to go to England next summer, and I would like to know what arrangements I could make with regard to the following schools:\n\n1. Mistassini -\n2. Waswanipi\n3. Lansdowne House\n4. Fort Hope\n5. Pickle Crow Landing\n\nI understand that the school and teacher's house for Mistassini and Waswanipi are either finished or will be finished next spring.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on April 14th and 15th, and I would like to talk over the question of our policy with regard to these schools. In the meantime, I want to secure the teachers for next summer. There are one or two other places, besides Pickle Crow, where the question of a school building should be considered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renison\n\nP.S. Since writing this letter I have a note from Mr. Bridle which states that the information which he had heard has been given in error, which I think is not correct - when the time...\nCome, that you are going to erect schools, and assure the attendance of Indians, a strict regulation may be necessary, but I believe that you can get a great deal of money and might mean that families would come to the subscription. The movement in the town has been slow, but I am willing to undertake for the benefit of the Indians, even at the expense of the former owner, who will at a very small cost.\nFebruary 25th, 1946.\n\nColonel Bernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Henry:\n\nI have now received all the returns on behalf of our Indian school teachers for last summer, with the exception of that from Mr. Bridle at Pickle Crow Landing.\n\nIn your last letter to me on January 18th you told me that Superintendent Swartman had seen you, and explained the situation. Mr. Bridle promised to send in his report. It seems that he has not received the proper forms, but I understand that everything has now been settled. If by any chance these returns have not been sent in, will you let me know?\n\nThere is a further matter which is mentioned in your letter to me with regard to the school building at the Landing. You told me that because you did not have the authority for the establishment of day schools off an Indian reserve, you could not either build a school or give a grant.\n\nBut the circumstances are unusual. The Ojibway Indians were the original band, who have an isolated post on a lake about twenty-five miles from the Landing; he has looked after them for more than seventy years. However, since the opening of the mines at Pickle Crow and Central Patricia, there is a community of 1,500 people established there, and the Indians spend a great deal of the summer at that point. It was obvious that something should be done for the children.\n\nA member of Mr. Bridle's congregation bought a building for $400, which is worth very much more, and Mr. Bridle has equipped it for the temporary use of the school. His report will tell you the numbers of the children. As this is distinctly educational work, it should surely be possible, under the circumstances, for the Indian Affairs Branch to either buy the building or pay a rent which would purchase it within two or\n(e) Eastmain Indian Day School\n\nWe have noted your recommendation for the construction of a good log school at this point. We are asking Major Clark to thoroughly investigate the situation at Eastmain when he inspects the area in the near future.\n\n(f) Old Factory River\n\nThat has been said for Eastmain applies here also.\n\n(g) Onanaberg Indian Day School\n\nThis is the one contentious location for the operation of a day school during the next summer. We will endeavour to clarify the situation at Pickle Crow and attempt to work out a solution which will meet our regulations and at the same time provide education for these Indians.\n\nPlease find attached the original of Mr. Bridle's letter with regard to the situation at Pickle Crow. I have also sent Mr. Bourne the income tax forms for completion by the Rev. Mr. Bridle and hope that we will hear from him in the near future, so that we can pay Mr. Bridle for his services last summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 5, 1948.\n\nDear Bishop Benson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 25 and also wish to confirm our conversation of recent date.\n\nMistassini Indian Day School\n\n(a) It is understood that you expect the Reverend Mr. Ellis to be the teacher there and to live in the newly completed teacherage. It is understood that you will nominate an educated Indian girl to handle the junior classes. We will arrange to send in the necessary supplies for this school, in care of Mr. Lariviere, and your teacher should report to him or contact him in some way, so as to ensure the delivery of these school supplies. This will apply to all the other seasonal schools, as I am most anxious that these supplies be sent in care of the Indian agents concerned now. Then we will avoid the confusion of the last few years in having the teachers demanding the supplies and having to wait for long periods before the arrival of these books, etc.\n\n(b) Naskapi Indian Day School\n\nIt is understood that you will also be nominating a teacher for this school.\n\n(c) Fort Hope Indian Day School\n\nIt is understood that a teacher nomination will be forthcoming.\n\n(d) Lansdowne House Indian Day School\n\nIt is understood that you will also nominate a teacher for this position.\nauthority for the establishment of day schools off an Indian Reserve, you could not either build a school or give a grant.\n\n\"But the circumstances are unusual.

However, he would like to have the same arrangement made at Central Patricia as we did at Osnaburgh. There, we could not establish a school, but we compromised by paying the teacher for the tuition of Indian children.\n\nWhat we are actually interested in, of course, is in providing some sort of education for these children, and we would therefore appreciate your views on this proposal of Bishop Benson.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 8, 1948.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nGanaburgh Indian Day School\n\nBishop Remison recently visited the Department and again the operation of the school at Central Patricia was discussed with him. He is very anxious to have this school authorized but we again pointed out to him the difficulties involved. You will find attached a letter which I wrote to him some two months ago after your visit to this office. He points out that the attendance at this school has been good and that the Ganaburgh Indians are evidently moving down to around Pickle Lake (Central Patricia) in the summer. We note that the following attendance was obtained during last summer:\n\n| Month    | Number Enrolled | Average Attendance |\n|----------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| July     | 18              | 14.2               |\n| August   | 24              | 18.4               |\n| September| 21              | 17.2               |\n\nIn addition to his visit, Bishop Remison also has written me a letter which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"There is a further matter which is mentioned in your letter to me with regard to the school building at the Landing.

These will go forward from Winnipeg.\n\nAt the same time Your Lordship mentioned the need of some repairs to the school and if you can give the Department a list of the materials necessary these also can be sent in.\n\nI would draw Your Lordship's attention to the very small average attendance at this school since it was opened. During the September quarter it was only 5.2 and during the December quarter one. In view of this and the possibility that the school may not be continued it is not considered advisable to make any extensive repairs. I shall be pleased to hear from Your Lordship further at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nApril 9th, 1913\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd inst., I have the pleasure to thank you for your kindness in sending me a supply of biscuits for use at the Longbranch school.\n\nRegarding the materials necessary for repairing the school at Longbranch, I cannot give you any definite information. I can only state from the words of the teacher, \"Some arrangement ought to be made as to a building, best summer field school in a small place erected to serve as a playhouse at recess. The roof however has to be taken off the hut during the cold weather. It is not built for cold weather so that it is the worst it is too cold twice at all. Some arrangement ought to be made for heating too.\" This statement further came from another source and something of a plan was worked out by Mr. Smith, who may have some accord. The materials needed for the repairs have been sent by the Diocese of Moosonee. Would you please let me know when they will arrive?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop\n\n[Stamp]\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nBISHOP,\nRIGHT REV JOHN G. ANDERSON\n\nCHAPLEAU, ONT\n\nat Moose, Albany, Stephen's House &c., but it has taken years. We could have done something will plant, has repaid all such efforts. In we have splendid schools at these places now. I hope the Deptt. will be ready to support an effort in this direction at Longueuil &c. If they do so well, especially in the promising experimental stage, we have sent out a missionary to reside there already built him one section of his dwelling house, and hire to complete the building went across to the mission. He had to provide his travelling expenses from this, he had to supply a canoe or two, &c., &c., &c., &c.\n\nI mention these things to show that the have done our part in getting the men there & supporting them, and that therefore we have cause not to expect the Deptt. to largely support us, as far as the educational side. It would be concerned, even though we attendance & other needs may diminish the number of those who go. You can understand that if the Deptt. sent a man there specially on this purpose, & provided for his needs, its cost would be considerable, so that the most economical plan is to continue these.\n\nI enclose a question to Bishop Macdonald at Longueuil. I have added several subjects mentioned in my last letter by Mr. Dunn. As he has subscribed it, there for him.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, April 15th, 1913.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's communication with reference to the repairs of the building used for school purposes at Osnaburg, and in reply I beg to say that in view of the lack of information as to requirements and remoteness of the district, the Department thinks that the only course to pursue is to ask the Paying Officer of Treaty No. 9 to examine the building when at that point, and report upon the material necessary to make it habitable and also as to supplies needed.\n\nWhen the question of establishing this school was under consideration, both Your Lordship and Archdeacon Renison stated that the church had a building that could be used for school purposes; this, however, does not appear to have been used. The Department would like to know whether it might not be occupied, pending necessary repairs to the building now in use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship, the Bishop of Moosonee, has asked the Department to repair the building used for school purposes at Osanburg. He, however, is not able to give any information as to the extent of repairs needed, or, quantity of material. I have to ask you to be good enough when you visit Osanburg to examine this building carefully and make notes of the supplies needed, such as roofing, etc., as well as any furnishings. You can then report to the Department and steps will be taken to make the building habitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. McLean, Esq.,\nPaying Officer Treaty \u00a7,\n276 Furbey St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\n424402\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nApril 18th, 1913\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to be at hand.\n\nThe building which I said could be used for school purposes at Venaburgh was the church, and that could still be true. The difficulty that occurred was that the Hudson's Bay Company notified Rev. Brown that no more buildings were to be erected in the church cemetery side of the lake. Because he was obliged to build his residence across the water on land adjoining the Indian Reserve. I understand also that the Indians are not now allowed to camp on the church & company's side of the water. This arrangement made it very inconvenient to use the church for school purposes and Rev. Brown used your big office. He is however quite willing to hold school there being doing so, in his own residence. This can continue until the other place in big office can be made habitable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. A. Sutton, Asst. Dioc. Moosonee.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter No. 339999-1 of the 25th inst., re building used for school purposes at Osawaburg, and beg to state that the matter referred to therein will receive my close attention when I visit Osawaburg next time, and report to the Department according to my finding as to the condition of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. Maclean\nPay Officer for Treaty No. 9\n\nSec'y Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nOttawa, April 28, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt from Your Lordship of the requisition submitted by Mr. Dixon for supplies for the Osnaburgh.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the articles asked for are being ordered to be sent in with Mr. McLean, Paying Officer for Treaty No. 9, with the exception of the desks, hyloplate board, chair, table, cupboard and clock. Owing to the difficulties of transport the Department has not prepared at the present time to order the furniture asked for. The articles considered necessary which are easy of transport will be forwarded.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, April 28, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a list of school supplies which the Department wishes to have sent in this summer to the teacher of the Osnaburg School, Mr. S. N. Dixon. In order to facilitate the matter the Department would be pleased if you would arrange to have these purchased in Winnipeg and taken in when you leave to pay Treaty. The account should be in duplicate and should be forwarded to the Department with your certificate for payment before you leave Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. McLean, Esq.,\nPaying Officer, Treaty No. 9,\n26 Purby St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI wish to call your attention to the fact that in spite of your assurance in reply to my letter of July 1912, your subordinates seem to be doing practically nothing in regard to school and school supplies for Osnaburg.\n\nI have now been here a year and all the supplies I have received have been a few books and slates; nothing seems to have been done in regard to a building or fuel or even desks to write on, and of course it is impossible to teach children to write unless they are supplied with suitable desks to put their books and slates on.\n\nDuring the warm weather we have been making use of a building belonging to the Chief for school purposes, but the place is in such a filthy condition owing to the Indians using it as a general store place and dancing hall and excreting phlegm and tobacco juice all over the walls and floor that it is a hardship to go into it at all let alone teach in it, not to say anything about the other insanitary conditions that exist.\n\nMr. McLean the agent who was up here this summer\nto convince that both building and site are totally unfit for school purposes.\n\nI understand that a heater and cement is now its way up there but this will be useless unless some provision is made for fuel, as there is no fuel near the building mentioned, besides all the windows are out thus being only clear spaces of glass in windows requiring little two.\n\nIt is unfair work to teach amongst these people with a first class equipment, but with next to no equipment at all it is practically an impossibility.\n\nTrusting that you will give the matter your favourable consideration,\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Dixon.\nOttawa, August 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo in reference to the school at Osnaburg.\n\nIn reply I beg to say your statement that the Department has done practically nothing in regard to this school, is incorrect and uncalled for. With regard to the building the Department was given to understand that the church had a building available and as to stationery and equipment, this was sent on during this summer and no doubt has been delivered by Mr. McLean. Practically the only articles omitted from your requisition were those of furniture which could not be very well transported, and which, it is thought might, so far as desks are concerned, be made on the premises to serve the purpose in the mean time, especially when it is considered that the last return received by the Department showed only an enrolment of 4 with an average attendance of .5. In fact the attendance must materially be increased or the Department will have to withdraw the grant.\n\nWith respect to the wood it seems rather strange that if the Indians are interested in the education of their children they could not supply this, but if necessary\n\nT. L. Dixon,\no/o Hudson Bay Co.,\nOsnaburg, Ont.,\nvia Sioux Lookout.\nDepartment will pay for it if it is decided to keep the school open.\n\nIn regard to the building the Department is not prepared to take any action until Mr. McLean's report is received, which it is expected will be in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson\n\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nAugust 8th, 1813\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose the same circularly stating in the Encouragement Indian School, I believe that the Indians are very keen. I suspect that Mr. Brown has been unable to obtain any of the Indians, who usually keep themselves away from new Indian schools.\n\nRegarding the question in a former letter, I might say, as I explained in another communication some time ago, that it's almost impossible to make any Indians agreeable to school purposes. However, it became impossible when the U.S. Company refused to allow the Indians to come near their offices. Consequently, they decided to build Mr. Brown's house on the other side of town; the Indians were kept away in order that the building on the water belonged to the Department. Mr. Brown has informed me...\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson\n\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nThe plot this building belongs to the Chief, and is not the Paying Office at the Treaty as I supposed. This was the building I called the Department. It cannot be used as a school, and what Mr. Simon offers to do in the enclosed depot. The Chief evidently allows his Division to use the building for school purposes; but he says it is very unsuitable and often needed by the Indians who have dances there and sometimes have dances there and sometimes sleep there. It is puzzling to know what to do. The Church has built the teachers' residence, but we have no funds for a school. I believe it is the duty of the Department to build a school, as the Indians were promised schools in its treaty.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nOttawa, August 19, 1913.\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nI would direct your attention to correspondence on this file in reference to matters in connection with the Osnaburgh School and would ask you to report fully thereon, making any recommendations that you may see fit.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nWith information,\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 15, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to the Department's memorandum of August 19th last, with which was submitted a file containing correspondence in regard to matters in connection with the Osnabuegh School.\n\nThe Department would like to take these matters up with His Lordship the Bishop of Moosonee and Mr. Dixon at the earliest possible date and will be pleased to have your report as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nU. J. McLean, Esq.,\nPaying Officer Treaty No. 9,\n276 Turby St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n246 Burley Street, Winnipeg\n20th Sept., 1913\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Depart's letter No. 99/5 of the 15th inst., re school at Osnaburg, I beg to state that there is no school building at that place to report upon, nor is there any building suitable for the Teacher (Mr. Dixon) who is there to live in.\n\nMr. Dixon at considerable hardship to himself, put up a rude hut last fall, for himself to pass the winter in; and I am not aware of his having any other place to dwell in since. Neither the Department nor the Church of England Mission have any building at Osnaburg suitable for a schoolhouse, and if it is the intention of the Depart. to maintain a school at Osnaburg, buildings for that purpose will have to be erected there and equipped with all requisite requirements. Last June when speaking with Mr. Dixon and the Indians interested in the matter of having a school at Osnaburg, they suggested that the most suitable part of their reserve to place the school in would be on the north side of the lake a\nA short distance east of the Hudson's Bay Company's Post. The reasons given for making that choice were that building material and fuel was conveniently to be had there, and the place being well sheltered, and convenient for good water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. Maclean\n\nAgent Officer for Treaty No. 9, Jan. Bayley\nOttawa, October 2, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to previous communications in regard to the Osnaburg Indian School I beg to say that as conditions exist at present the Department would not be justified in incurring any expenditure on buildings. In fact it is thought that perhaps the best thing to do until the Indians evidence more interest would be to withdraw from the school work. I might point out for Your Lordship's information that the average attendance for the six months ending June 30th, last, was only 1.9.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

ANDERSON\nBISHOP\nWesleyan Church\nCOCHRANE, ONT.\n\nTo Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose several requisitions for the summer schools at Big Fish River and Maclean's Falls.\n\nI need not say anything further in regard to the school at Big Fish River, as it has been fully established, and you were quite satisfied with its success.\n\nRegarding Maclean's Falls, I may say that I have seen applications several times during the past year, and I am sure a school could be started there very easily, even without further information.\n\nHowever, last summer, a school at Big Fish River was successful, and we believe that Maclean's Falls, too, would be suitable for a similar school. This request, which was so kindly made by our missionary, Rev. Edward Hinchliffe, at Big Fish River, under whose supervision the place is, and who gave me the information that at least 20 children of school age are growing up in that district, without any chance for education, surely deserves your attention. Frequently, he asked to build a teacher and was fortunate enough to secure another student from St. Paul's College, Winnipeg, Rev. W. D. Hudson, whom I am sending to Maclean's Falls next summer. He will supervise a school myself, and endeavor to make it a success.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJohn G. Anderson\nDiocese of Moosonee\nA request has been received from His Lordship the Bishop of Moosehead for the opening of a school for the summer months at Harten's Falls. He compares the conditions at this point with those at English River, where a school was open last summer from May 1st to August 31st. The pay list shows that there are 77 children at Harten's Falls and the Bishop states that there are at least 25 of these of school age. He states that he has been fortunate enough to secure the services of a teacher, Mr. A. J. Anderson, a student from St. John's College, Winnipeg, to carry on the work. Mr. Avery informs me that there is a church building at this point and, no doubt, the school would be conducted in that building.\n\nHis Lordship also requests that the school at English River be re-opened next summer. The cost of this school for the past summer was as follows:\n\n- Teacher's salary: 4 months\n- Rent of building: 4 months\n- Stationery and school supplies\n\nThe school at English River, from reports received, seems to have been successful, having had an enrolment of 57 pupils, with an average attendance of 25.\n\nI would be pleased to recommend that the school at English River be re-opened and that a trial be given during next summer to the work of conducting a school at Harten's Falls. The expense of carrying on the work at these points during the summer will be about $250.00 at each point. This is the only opportunity the children have of receiving any education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 10, Volume 6183, File 455-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 3, 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing requisitions for school material for the use of the summer schools at English River and Marten's Falls and requesting that a grant be allowed for the salary of teachers at both these points during the coming summer term.\n\nWith reference to Marten's Falls I beg to say that the Department will provide a grant for salary at the same rate as was allowed the teacher at English River last summer, namely, $50.00 per month for a period of four months. The grant for the teacher at English River will also be continued at the above rate. It is noted that you have secured the services of Mr. A. E. O. Anderson, a student from St. John's College, Winnipeg, to take up duties as teacher at Marten's Falls and have also again secured the services of Mr. Northam for English River.\n\nWith reference to the requisitions which you forwarded today, to say that the stationery and school material considered necessary will be ordered and the Department will endeavour to arrange with Revillon Bros. so that in their supply list their account next spring. The teacher of the English River School has requisitioned for a stove and stove pipe, but as this school is open during the summer months only, the Department cannot supply a stove, neither is it prepared to supply desks, chairs, etc.\n\nIt is presumed that buildings suitable for carrying on the work at both these points can be secured.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. JOHN G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\n5498/15\n\nJOHN G. ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nWingham\nCOCHRANE, ONT.\n\nMay 8th 1921\n\nRe 44-11-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI most thank you for your kind letter of the 3rd inst., in which you state that the Department will provide funds for a summer school at Martin Falls and also for a teacher, in which regard you have been very kind. I am sorry not to be able to reply to your request but the Department feels unable to supply the same. We are very short of money and cannot afford to take care of the school at Martin Falls. We are very short of money and cannot afford to take care of the school at Martin Falls.\n\nIn that district we have a very large number of children who need a school building, and we are very much in need of one. We have several times tried to get one built, but have been unsuccessful. We need one now more than ever before, and I hope you will consider our request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, January 14, 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 8th instant with reference to the summer schools which it is proposed to re-open at English River and Marten's Falls next summer.\n\nWith reference to the furnishing of a stove, stove pipes and desks, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to supply summer schools with equipment of this kind, especially as the buildings in these cases are not the property of the Department and the schools are only in operation a few months each year. The cost of the transport would be excessive and there are so many pending requests before the Department that it will be impossible to provide funds for the purpose. As the buildings are the property of the church authorities and last summer rent was paid at the rate of $10.00 per month for the building at English River, it is considered that stoves, if required, should be supplied by the church authorities.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The delay was caused by the lateness of my getting out and by the fact that no return sheets were sent to me with...\nsupplies. Please see\nthat this is rectified\nnext year.\n\nBy mistake I ended\nthe first quarter at the\nbeginning of June instead of\nthe end. Having no more\nforms I am unable\nto put this right. The\nnumber of days the school\nwas open, however, is correct.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.C. [Last Name]\nOTTAWA, October 26th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing returns of attendance, days taught, etc., at the school which was conducted by you at Marten's Falls during the summer months of 1921.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for the salary due for your services as teacher for four months, at the rate of $30.00 per month, as well as a cheque covering rent and cleaning school, etc., will be sent to Right Rev. John G. Anderson, Bishop of Moosonee, Cochrane, Ontario. A cheque for the four months' bonus to the amount of $60.00 is being sent to your address in Winnipeg.

Post half a mile from their Reserve where they all reside in the summer season in their wigwams, and some families stay there all winter. Several of the families of this Band are anxious to have their children educated, and H.B.C. officers in charge, Mr. Pollock, have been kind enough to furnish them with a small log School House already built also will furnish the Board, the proposed teacher is his daughter educated at St. Joseph's College near here. If this favour is granted the department will be paid enough to let me know what her salary will be; it is a lonely place to live and six days travel by canoe from Lake Superior, also involves acquisition of school material to be mailed to Heron Bay Post Office in P.R., where a canoe will leave from on the 16th next month.

Please allow me to mention them to you. I shall be as brief as possible.\n\nAmong the several bands of Indians whose spiritual welfare had been intrusted to me by due authority, there\nare two of them which have not yet\nany school regularly established\nand recognized by the Department.\nThese are the Michipicoten Indians\nband situated on the shore of Lake\nSuperior and the other one is the\nLong Lake band far away inland.\nBoth of these bands have already a\nschool house built and quite a\nnumber of children who no doubt\nwould attend school hence requi-\nrely established.\n\nTherefore I humbly beg the Depart-\nment\nDesiring to grant to those two Indian bands regular schools with some salary, $250 per dollar, granted to teachers in behalf of our other schools, so that these poor Indians should be able to enjoy as well as others the benefits of education under our supervision.\n\nI beg honorable sir, that these two school requests may be as well as the first; one shall be duly considered or granted.\n\nP. Maclean\nMissionary Priest\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 14th Oct., 1901.\n\nMemorandum for Schools:-\n\nI noticed the following remark in the annual report of Agent Hodder:-\n\nLong Lake Band,\n\nEducation.\n\nThere has never been a school on this reserve, the Indians are anxious that one be established.\n\nH.C. Root\n\nPOOR COPY\nOTTAWA, 23rd October, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your remark in our annual report that there has never been a school for the Indians of the Long Lake Band and that they are anxious for the establishment of one, I beg to say that the Department would like you to report as to the advisability of establishing a school at this place, what the probable attendance would be and any other particulars in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary\n\nJ.F. Honder, P.E.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, 4th, April, 1902.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nRegarding the establishment of a school for the Indians of the Long Lake Band, I beg to report that the probable attendance would be 12 during the winter with a larger attendance during the summer. I enclose a letter from the Rev. L. V. Dugas in which he offers the use of the Church for school purposes but thinks that it would be too cold for winter use. I could probably arrange with the Indians when making payment to make the building warmer. If the Department will stand part of the cost for this work I would like to know what amount would be the limit so that some definite arrangement can be made as I would very much like to see a school established at this place.\n\nI also enclose a requisition from the Chiefs of the Red Rock Band asking that the school on their Reserve be re-opened. The letter of the Rev. L. V. Dugas also treats of the same matter; a list of children who would attend is enclosed. I would recommend that this school be re-opened. Miss Barker who taught at Pays Plat can be secured as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDept of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 9th March, 1903.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Agent Hodder forwards a letter from the Rev. J. W. Davis of Nepigon in which that gentleman offers the use of the church for school purposes at Long Lake, which is situated east of Nepigon and north of Jackfish on the C. & R. Applications have been made for a school at this place since 1894, but as yet no provision has been made. The last census gives the population of the Long Lake Band as 630: 61 Anglicans, 268 Roman Catholics and 1 pagan. The number of children of school age is shown to be 93. Mr. Hodder says that the probable attendance if a school is opened at that point would be 12 during winter with a larger number in the summer, and that he would like very much to see a school established at this place.\n\nIf the Department considers this application it would be necessary to provide an amount for the teacher's salary and also a small sum for making the building warm enough for winter use. I do not say what amount would be required for this purpose, but I think $75.00 or $100.00 would more than cover the necessary outlay.\n\nFormer applications have been endorsed by the Hudson's Bay Company's Officers, the Roman Catholic Missionaries and our Agents.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Burns\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY SUPT. GENERAL\n\nWith reference to the Memorandum hereunder I beg to say that I had the advantage of a visit to Long Lake, and from what I know of the Indians there I would recommend the proposed expenditure. These Indians hunt for a livelihood and are able to provide themselves with the necessaries of life. I observed that the children appear unusually intelligent. I also saw that they were comfortably clothed.\n\nIf the proposition meets with approval the Department would have to obtain a vote covering the teacher's salary and management expenses, say $250.00 & $100.00 = $350.00. The cost of repairing the church, in which it is proposed to hold the school, could, I think, be met from the current appropriations. It is a suitable building for the purpose.\n\nAccountant.\n\n10th March, 1903.\nOTTAWA,\n\nMarch 12th, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., and in reply to your request for proof which refers to the application made by the Indians for the establishment of a school on their Reserve, I have to say that I regret to inform you that no action can be taken to carry out their wishes in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. R. Moller,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, 26th August, 1904.\n\nMemorandum:\u2014\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nWhen at Long Lake recently the Indians brought up the question of the need of having a school established at that place for the benefit of the Indian children.\n\nChief Newatchkijigewabe took a census of the band and reported that there were fifty-six children\u201429 boys and 27 girls\u2014of school age who would attend school during the summer months, and from fifteen to twenty could attend during the winter months.\n\nThe Priest, Rev. Father Dugas, stated that he was of the opinion that he could secure the services as teacher of Miss Finlayson, a daughter of Nicol Finlayson, No. 86 Long Lake Band, whom he considered to be well qualified for the position.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 29th August, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Stewart, Assistant Secretary, reports that the Long Lake Indians wish to have a school established for the education of their children. This question has been before the Department for some time but up to the present no appropriation has been made for the salary of a teacher or for providing school accommodation. You will see, however, from Mr Scott's memorandum of last year that the amount required could be found, and it seems a pity that the number of children shown by Mr Stewart's memo. to be of school age, should be neglected when the services of a teacher could be obtained as he states. Less than $400 for the current year would provide for the necessary outlay for a school at this place.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTE*A, 8th September, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to accede to the wish of the Long Lake Indians to have a school established on their reserve, and is prepared to pay $300.00 per annum for the salary of a teacher, as well as a reasonable amount, say $50.00 for incidental expenses such as fuel, etc.\n\nIt has been represented to the Department that the Indians have a commodious church on the reserve which they are willing should be used for school purposes. If this is the case you may communicate with the Superintendent of Missions at Fort William with a view to obtaining the services of a suitable teacher for this school, and I may inform you that the Department is advised that Miss Finlayson, daughter of the Hudson's Bay factor, would be willing to take the position and that she is well qualified to fill it. School material will be sent when the Department is notified that the school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. Maclean\n\nL.U.

Your Letter\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nWith reference to yours Re Miss Finlayson, I have been informed that Miss Finlayson opened the Long Lake School in January, 1905.\n\nThe reason for which you have not received any returns as yet is; That the mails are very irregular to and from Long Lake, mail sometimes two or three months to reach its destination.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nTo Mr. Secretary,\nDepartment Indians,\n\nOtterwood.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nWhile at Long Lake on the payment trip Miss Elizabeth Finlayson the teacher of Long Lake school verbally notified me that she retires as teacher with June 25th, that she sent in her resignation through Rev Father Dugas. Miss Minnie Watagan a niece of Mr Godchere agrees to take charge of the school on the same terms as formerly, she appears to be a desirable young woman and fitted for the position having been educated in Ottawa. Rev Father Dugas is satisfied so that with the Department's sanction the school will be reopened at the usual time.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 14th., 1907.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant reporting that Miss Elizabeth Finlayson, teacher of the Long Lake school, has tendered her resignation and recommending that Miss Minnie Paterson be appointed in her place; and in reply I beg to say that she may be given charge of this school at a salary of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

I was at Long Lake last summer and spent about a week there.\n\nThis is a nomadic band, almost entirely uncivilized. They are in the forest from October to May. In summer they are about the lake fishing and picking berries. I am certain that they could not be persuaded to send their children to school, if a school and teacher were there. Besides, it would be impossible to get a teacher of any kind of qualification to go and stay there. There are many Indian schools much more accessible and much more congenial for a teacher than Long Lake, which are vacant, because teachers cannot be found who are willing to go to those places.\n\nI am solicitous for the educational and moral welfare of the Indians, but I must in conscience advise the Department against the expenditure of money for schools in places where they would produce little or no good.\n\nYours very devotedly,\n\nD. J. Scollard,\nBishop of S. S. Marie.\nOTTAWA\n\nDecember 31, 1907\n\nRight Rev. Sirs,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 11th inst., and in reply to that portion which refers to the building of a school-house at Long Lake I beg to say that this question has never come before the Department. However, should it do so, note has been made of your recommendations.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev. Sirs,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Rev. D.J.

McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nWESTERN MOOSONEE MISSION\n\nRev. Geo. Prewer\nSPECIAL MISSIONARY\n\nJohn D. Maclean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAugust 2nd, 1924.\n104 Drinkwater Street\nSudbury, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt a point along the Canadian National Railway, east of the town of Hornepayne, about twelve miles, is a settlement of Protestant Indians numbering about 70 souls. It is what was formerly known as the Skunk River, now known as Morrison River.\n\nThese Indians are cross, and formerly belonged to Albany River. I think they are now paid under the Long Lake Band, in the Fort Arthur Indian Agency. They are mostly composed of the families of George Taylor \"A\" and George Taylor \"B\", and others who have married into them.\n\nThere are about twenty children of school age at this place, and the people reside there for the greater part of the year.\n\nAbout a month ago when I was up at that point, George Taylor \"A\" asked that a small school be erected and a teacher supplied. He stated that he could assure an attendance for fully nine months of the year, if the school was kept open during the summer months.\n\nAs you are aware, there is no reserve at this point, but these Indians have been located here, and have had their trapping headquarters here for several generations. The Hudson's Bay Company has a small trading store here, kept by one of the Taylors, and there are three or four fairly good Indian houses.\n\nThe people are very badly in need of instruction in various ways and appear to require the protection that a fair, good teacher might be able to give, against the class of white men who usually infest such localities.\n\nThe place is beautifully situated, and quite easy of access, at all times of the year, being only a short distance down the river from the regular flag station on the C.N. Railway.\n\nI would very strongly recommend that one of your \"Improved Schools\" be erected at this place, where the Indian children would not only be taught to read and write, but other things, which are quite as essential for the welfare of these people.\n\nTrusting that these suggestions may meet with your careful consideration,\n\nBelieve me,\nvery faithfully yours,\n\nRev. Prewer\nOttawa, August 12th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting, on behalf of a number of Indians residing at a point known as Morrison River on the Canadian National Railway, the establishment of a day school for the benefit of their children.\n\nIn reply I am to say that these Indians belong to the Martin's Falls Band Reserve at Long Lake. They are hunting Indians and do not live on their Reserve but wander around the country, hunting, and are never a sufficient length of time in one place to educate their children. The Department cannot establish a school off a Reserve, and, as these Indians do not reside on their Reserve, we are not prepared to consider their request to establish a day school.\n\nAs you state the parents are anxious to have their children educated, a number could no doubt be placed in the Chapleau Indian Residential School. I shall be pleased if you will endeavour to persuade the parents to allow their children to be sent there. The Chapleau School can no doubt accommodate a number of these children. Owing to the nomadic habits of these Indians, it is considered that a day school would not be satisfactory on account of the irregular attendance, and, therefore, the placing of the children in the Chapleau School would be the best means of their obtaining an education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Preser,\n108 Drinkwater St.\nSudbury, Ont.\n104 Drinkwater Street,\nSudbury, Ont., Dec. 8, 1924.\n\nJ.B. Morgan, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wrote the Department, sometime ago, suggesting that a small day school should be carried on at this place for the 20 or more children of school age. The Department did not approve of the plan; stating that it were better, since there was room, to send them to the Chapleau Boarding School. I wonder when the Department and the Church, are going to see the unkindness of such a move. To send children, when we are sure they are affected, into the midst of what ought to be, a bunch of healthy pupils, such as ought to be in our schools, is little short of murder. It is bad enough when they are admitted and develop the disease afterwards, but to take them there to have them die and affect the others is too serious a matter, if it is merely to say we have our schools full.\n\nSurely the Department cannot but view the ravages this disease has made amongst the pupils of the Chapleau School during the past three years without very grave concern. I believe I am right when I state that since I gave up the Principalship at the end of March 1923, no less than 22 who were then on the roll have either died in the School or at their own homes or at some Hospital from this disease. I think I can also safely say there are three or four more that will die. With a knowledge of these conditions, it is small wonder that the authorities find it difficult to persuade the Indians to send their children to the Boarding School.\n\nGeo. Prewer.\nOttawa, January 13, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 8th ultimo in which you recommend that a day school be established for the Indians living at Morrison River. I note that most of the children are tubercular and that it is your opinion they should not be enrolled at a residential school.\n\nIn reply to your request for a day school, I regret to inform you that there are no funds available at the present time for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Frewer,\n104 Drinkwater St.,\nSudbury, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nSept., 14th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the advisibility of opening new schools in this Agency, I would recommend that provision be made in the 1930-31 estimates for additional Day Schools and Residences, viz., Long Lake and Mobert.\n\nAt Long Lake there are approximately 50 children who are not attending any school. The parents of the majority of these children will not send them to the Boarding School. Consequently these children are running wild on the Reserve.\n\nSimilar conditions exist on the Mobert Reserve, where there are at least 50 children of school age.\n\nTo give you an idea as to public opinion, I might also say, that I have received communications from white people at Long Lake and Mobert, asking if it would be possible to open day schools for the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have your 210-D of the 14th ultimo, concerning the advisability of providing day school facilities for Indian children of Long Lake and Hobert. As we have recently authorized the re-opening of the Hobert Indian Day School, I believe it advisable to wait until it is determined what success is meeting our efforts. A note is being made for next year's estimates in connection with the Long Lake request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWhen recently attending the Treaty Payment at Long Lake, Ontario, my attention was drawn to the necessity of a Day School at that Reserve. There must be at least forty (40) children of school age running wild with no instruction or restraint upon them, and the necessity of a School there was apparent.\n\nThese Indians live the year around on their Reserve close to the Canadian National Railway Track at which point the Transcontinental trains stop, and the Indians are much in evidence.\n\nThe School buildings erected at Pic, Sand Point and Gull Bay Reserves are splendid ones, and a credit to all concerned in their construction. At present one is being erected at Hobert, and I hope one for Long Lake will be provided for in next year's Estimates and erected next Summer.\n\nThese school buildings will also afford a comfortable stopping place of the Travelling Nurse. In fact without them there would be no place for her to stop a few days on these Reserves, and with the co-operation of the School Teacher, great benefit will accrue to the Indians as the proper kind of school teacher can help the nurses considerably in seeing that her instructions are carried out when she leaves the reserve. Mr. Burk is endeavouring to secure teachers with this end in view. At Long Lake the School Teacher for the Travelling Nurse in co-operation with the School Teacher., The School Teacher at Gull Bay last Winter and Spring did wonderful work. I hope to see a School building under construction next year at Long Lake.\n\nChief Accountant.\nEstimates 1932-33\n\nPort Arthur Agency\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\n(This estimate covers the construction of a new school at Long Lac, and repairs to other schools in this Agency).\n\nIndian Day School at Long Lake $6500.00\n\nFences for schools at Sand Point, Long Lac, & Fort William Reserves 200.00\n\nWood for schools in Port Arthur Agency, as follows: Ft.

They came there ages ago according to their own story, living in a most isolated place, and remote from civilization dwelling in tents and tipis, and have been following this mode of life for a number of years. Having made some inquiries recently as to their present condition, I am informed that these Indian families are still living in that region with slight improvement since I met them. Two families are living in houses and the rest in tents and tipis. There are 36 people with 17 children of school age, and had never had a days schooling in their lives. They do not till any land for crops. They draw Government allowance each year. This band would improve and do well with some good advice and\nschooling. The nearest Post Office is\nHorsefly, C.M.R., Ont.\n\nLast writing this thanking the Department\nfor awareness of these conditions and\ntheir attention, and that some effort\ncould be made to alleviate their\npresent need condition.\n\nTrusting the Department will graciously\npardon me for availing myself the\nprivilege of writing the above,\nand thanking in advance.\n\nRemain\nyour most humble servant,\n\nAlfred McCull\nCurrie Lake\nOnt.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, in which you drew attention to the condition and mode of life of the Indian families who are residing at Hornepayne, Ont., and recommending that facilities be provided for the education of their children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have had previous reports regarding these Indians. They are Crees, and formerly belonged to the Martin's Falls Band Reserve at Long Lake. They are hunting Indians, and do not live on their Reserve, but wander around the country hunting. We understand that some of the children are tubercular, and, therefore, cannot be enrolled as pupils in a resident school. I regret to inform you that there are no funds available at the present time for the purpose of establishing a day school at which these children could attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlfred McCue, Esq.,\nCurve Lake,\nOnt.\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMarch 31st, 1952.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report on my activities in this agency during the month of February.\n\nThese Indians (Martin Falls Band) also requested that during the summer months a school be constructed on their reserve, also that partitions be made in their homes which were built last summer.\n\nJ. G. Burk.\nIndian Agent.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nApril 29th, 1932.\n\nMr. R. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nOn my recent visit to the Martin Falls Reserve a meeting was held, and the Rev. W. Bradbury spoke on behalf of the Indians of the Martin Falls Band, who are Anglican. The missionary pointed out the Indians have moved back to their Reserve, and 14 houses were constructed for this Band last summer, and there will be between 35 to 40 children running around the Reserve who should be attending school.\n\nThe Band passed a resolution asking the Department to build a school and residence, and I pointed out it was impossible for the Department to do so this year. The Indians said they would be willing to use their own funds if the Department would make a refund when financial conditions are better. The Indians are going to build a church on the Reserve during the summer and are anxious to build a school. This Band have a capital fund of approximately $100,000.00, and are able to provide funds for the construction of a school and residence which could be built for $3000.00 or $4000.00. The work would also provide food supplies for the Indians of the Long Lake and Martin Falls Bands during the summer.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would advise me regarding the above as I just received a second letter from Rev. Bradbury, Indian Missionary, Mornepayne.\n\nI trust this letter finds you all in the very best of health. The family are getting along famously.\n\nI presume Mr. Paget will celebrate on the 1st of June.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 7, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Burk:\n\nI have your 210-L of the 29th ultimo, with reference to a school for the Indian children of the Martin Falls reserve. Nothing can be done this year, unless the Band are willing to give the funds from their Capital Account. It is not the Department's practice to borrow from Band Funds for such a purpose. In the first place, an Order in Council is necessary, and, secondly, no Minister likes to promise what future Parliaments will provide, particularly during these days when financial conditions are so uncertain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nAt a meeting of the Martin Falls Band held at a winter camp at Morrison River the 20th day of May 1935 it was proposed by Chief George Taylor and seconded by Alex Taylor that the Department construct a school and residence from our Band funds on the Martin Falls Reserve during the summer months.\n\nFor the Department's information we wish to state that 14 families moved back to the Reserve last summer and 6 more families will move back this spring. Our children just now been able to attend school and are running around like wild deer. For the Department's information we wish to state that we have 45 children of school age who have never attended school. The approximate cost of constructing the school and residence will amount to $5000.00 which could be deducted from our Capital account, and at a future date if conditions are better the Department could possibly give our Band a refund covering the cost of the school.\n\nAs you will note our missionary, Rev. W. Bradbury, has signed the resolution and has also written regarding the urgent necessity of building a school for our children.\n\nWe trust the resolution will be forwarded to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nSIGNED:\n\nRev. W. Bradbury\n\nChief B. Taylor\n\nGillen Taylor\n\nJim B. Taylor\n\nJames Taylor\n\nJohn Taylor\n\nAlex Taylor\n\nGeo. Wharfman\n\nJoe Waginash\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMay 27th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to enclose herewith resolution signed by the Chief councillors and members of the Martin Falls Band, also the Anglican Missionary, the Rev. W. Bradbury, recommending that the Department build a church and school on the Martin Falls Reserve, at Long Lake, Ontario.\n\nFor the Department's information I may say 14 homes were constructed by the Indians last summer to encourage the Indians to live on their Reserve, cultivate their land, and grow vegetables and root crops, as it is almost impossible for them to maintain themselves living from hunting. There are approximately 45 children who should be attending school, and as the Band are willing to spend the money from their own Band funds for the construction of the school, I would strongly recommend that their request be granted.\n\nIf the Department approves of the enclosed resolution it will encourage the Indians to live on their Reserve and also give employment to the male members of the Band, who will possibly have to be assisted with rations. In this way it will insure employment for the Indians during the summer months.\n\nIn conclusion I may say the 45 children of this Band have never had the privilege of attending school. Under the circumstances I would strongly recommend that a school be built during the summer months. This school has been recommended officially to the Department during the last two years, and I was under the impression the school would be built by the Department this spring.\n\nI trust the Department will give their favourable consideration to the above.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Burk,\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWhat do you think?\nOttawa, June 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 210-L of the 27th ultimo, with enclosure, relative to using Band funds for the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence on the Martin Falls reserve, at Long Lake. I may say that the capital to the credit of this Band at the present time amounts to approximately $57,000, and it is the Department's opinion that this should not be used for the erection of a school. The interest on the amount will be required for the usual purposes. A note will be made for next year's Indian Education Estimates in connection with this need.\n\nI am unable to understand that part of your penultimate paragraph where you state that you have recommended this school for two years. Your 210-L of April 29th, last, is the first correspondence on the Department's file in connection with a Protestant school for the Martin Falls Band at Long Lake. Previous correspondence has been on your file 1200-A and 210-D and refers to a school for the Catholic Indians who, I understand, are on the other side of the lake.\n\nYou might let me know if it is not true that, eventually, two schools will be required. These should be called the Long Lake R.C. and Long Lake C.E. Schools. Please state, also, the number of school age in each Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burki Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that I arrived at Port Arthur on the 4th of July.\n\nThis band (Martin Falls) in Council asked me to present their request to the Department for a school, which I promised to do as I could observe from the number of children of school age that their request was a reasonable one.\n\nF. H. Paget.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJanuary 22nd, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention Educational Branch.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the advisability of opening a school at Long Lac (the Martin Falls Reserve) for the Department's information, I may state that the Martin Falls Band have been living at Morrison River for approximately 50 years. They have constructed a splendid church at this point and have also 18 substantial log homes.\n\nA communication has just been received from the Rev. Mr. Bradbury, Anglican Missionary, for the Martin Falls Band, asking if it would be possible to open a temporary school at Morrison River.\n\nThis Band have also constructed 15 log houses at Long Lac, where their Reserve proper is situated, and where they live during the summer months in order to cultivate the land, and grow vegetables. They return to Morrison River for the winter months, owing to the proximity of their trapping grounds.\n\nMr. Bradbury informs me that the Indians have constructed a temporary log school, and have contributed small sums of money for tarpaper, roofing and windows. Would it be possible for the Department to open a temporary school at this point during the winter months? In the summer months the school could be carried on in one of the buildings at Long Lac.\n\nA good Anglican teacher can be obtained for $40.00 per month. I would consider it in the Department's interests to open a school at this point, as there are over 30 children of school age who are not receiving any education. The Indians on the Martin Falls Reserve are Anglicans, and do not wish to send their children to St. Joseph's Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. O. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, recommending that a temporary day school be established, during the winter months, for the benefit of the Indian children at Long Lac, on the Martin Falls Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is regretted that the Department will have no funds to equip the school and provide the teacher's salary. However, the need at this point has been noted, and consideration will be given to the establishment of a school when it is possible to provide the funds for the purpose in the Appropriation for Indian Education. It is noted that the Indians on the Martin Falls reserve are Anglican and that, if a school is established, it should be conducted under the auspices of that denomination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nJanuary 30, 1934.\n\nMemorandum\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURRAY,\n\nI wish to inform you that Mr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ont., has strongly recommended the providing of school facilities and the appointment of a teacher for the benefit of the Indian children of the Martin Falls band, residing on the Long Lake reserve, No. 77, in the Fort William agency. These Indians reside at Long Lake during the summer months, where they have constructed 15 log houses, and they cultivate land and grow vegetables. In the winter months, they move to Harrison River, to be near their trapping grounds, where they have erected a church and also 15 substantial log houses. Harrison River is not on a reserve but is situated near the line of the Canadian National railway, approximately 150 miles north and west of their reserve.\n\nThe Agent requests that a classroom be fitted up at each of these points, school supplies furnished and a teacher appointed - the school to be conducted at Harrison River during the winter and at Long Lake during the summer. There are 30 children of school age, who are not at present receiving any education. These Indians are Anglican.\n\nMr. Burk has been informed that at the present time there are no funds to equip classrooms and provide teacher's salary but that consideration would be given to the establishment of a school when possible to provide funds for the purpose.\n\nIn submitting the above for your information, I feel assured of your approval for the establishment of a school for these Indian children when funds are available. No provision was made for this school in the Estimates for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year - the request of Agent Burk not having been received previous to the preparation of the Estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN G ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nWickopinno\nCOCHRANE, ONT.\n\nFeb. 27th 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been receiving letters from the Chief and other Indians of the Parry Sound Band and now from our missionary, Rev. W. Balsberg, concerning a need for a school for his many children who have no educational advantages whatever. I know the Band of Indians well and they are very progressive and feel very keenly the want of schooling for their children. As an example of the progressiveness of this band, I mention the fact that they built a church themselves at Morrison River entirely at their own expense. Indians like these should have encouragement; they offer to provide a building for school purposes at Morrison River for the winter months when they reside at that time, because it has been a starting place in their hunting grounds. In many cases and also because there are no fish and they will have to be moved to some place. All they could need would be a supply of school material and, of course, a teacher. A school could be built on the same premises in summer. I believe the matter was brought before the Indian Agent and he promised or stated expected had wished would have been provided this winter at Morrison River, but I am told that nothing has been done so far. I trust you will give this request prompt attention so I consider it a worthy one.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 5th, 1934.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the establishment of a day school for the Martin Falls band.\n\nThis matter has been previously brought to the Department's attention by Mr. Agent Burk. At the present time, there are no funds available to equip a classroom and provide a teacher's salary but consideration will be given to the establishment of a school when funds are available for the purpose.\n\nIt is possible that the erection of a school on this reserve might be included in any building programme that may be undertaken during the coming summer.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRt. Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nBishopthorpe,\nCochrane, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring the Department's attention to a meeting held on the Martin Falls Reserve at Long Lac, Ontario, on June 15th. By a showing of hands the entire Martin Falls Band; also the Rev. Bradbury requested me to communicate with the Department and advise them if a temporary school could be opened on their Reserve during the summer.\n\nThe Indians are willing to supply benches and build temporary desks. There are over 30 children of school age who should attend school.\n\nI may say provisions was mentioned in the estimates to build a school at this point, but owing to financial conditions the school was never built.\n\nMr. Greening, school Inspector and myself believe that $15.00 or $20.00 would equip the school children with sufficient books and we would not be obliged to build a school or residence, as the teacher could live in one of the new homes which were constructed in 1862 on their Reserve.\n\nUnder the circumstances I trust the Department will be able to meet with the Band's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Black,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 10, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the request for a school on the Martin Falls Reserve at Long Lac, Ont.\n\nAs you have previously been informed, no provision was made in our Appropriation for the salary of a teacher at this point. You might, however, let me know on what date you consider this school might be opened and the period for which you would recommend that it be conducted. You might also advise what monthly salary you would consider reasonable for a teacher at this point.\n\nOn receipt of this information, the Department will be able to decide the approximate cost of this school and if funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJuly 13th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., No. 9-18-1, regarding request from the Martin Falls Band to establish a temporary school on their Reserve at Long Lac. In reply I would suggest that a temporary school be opened at once for approximately 3 months.\n\nI would further suggest that Mr. Maines' services be engaged as a temporary teacher for this school, as he has expressed a desire to teach in the temporary school, if one is opened. Mr. Maines is closing the school at McIntyre Bay on the 15th of this month and he could go directly from Lake Nipigon to Long Lac and open the school immediately.\n\nIf this meets with the Department's approval I could notify Mr. Maines by wire and he could open the school at Long Lac. I could borrow sufficient school books from the Boarding School at Fort William to start with, and possibly we could get a small supply from our Department at a later date.\n\nIf the Department decide to open this school, and authorization is received by wire, the school could be opened by July 18th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. O. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with further reference to the proposed establishment of a day school on the Long Lac Reserve.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of January 27th last, no provision was made in our current year's Appropriation for the salary of a teacher at this point. Our funds are completely assigned, and, under these circumstances, it will not be possible to consider opening a school this summer. However, the advisability of starting a school on this Reserve has been noted and will receive consideration when we are preparing the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nApril 13, 1936.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRegarding the erection of a day school building with living accommodation for teacher, on the MARTIN FALLS reserve, at Long Lac, Ont., Mr. Agent Burk, Port Arthur, states that the school should provide accommodation for approximately 30 children.\n\nMr. Burk, during a recent visit to the Department, stated that the best means of having the school erected would be that he arrange for the purchase of all material from firms on the approved list and that the labour be performed by Indians, under the supervision of a competent foreman. The Agent estimated the cost of materials and labour to be approximately $2,800.\n\nNo funds were specially provided to cover the cost, but it is likely that same could be found in either the Appropriation for Indian Education or in the PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION ACT. The building should be erected during the coming summer.\n\nIt would be necessary to obtain the approval of the Minister for the expenditure and secure the name of a competent carpenter to act as supervisor of construction.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMay 2nd, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe authorities of the Church of England have requested that a day school building, with living accommodation for a teacher, be established for the benefit of the Indian children of the Martin Falls band, residing on Long Lac reserve, No. 77, Fort William agency, Ont. Mr. Agent Burk, Port Arthur, states that the school should provide accommodation for approximately 36 children.\n\nThere are no funds specially provided to cover the cost of erecting the building, but there is an amount of $4,000.00 provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, to erect a day school at the Rabbit Island settlement, on the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve. The need for a school at this point is not as pressing as on the Long Lac reserve, and I would recommend that the above amount, provided for the school at Rabbit Island, be utilized in erecting a building for the Martin Falls band.\n\nMr. Agent Burk, during a recent visit to the Department, stated that the best means of having the school erected would be that he arrange for the purchase of all materials, from firms on the approved list; and that the labour be performed by Indians, under the supervision of a competent foreman. The Agent estimated the cost of the materials and labour to be about $3,800.00.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Honourable the Superintendent General for the expenditure and secure the names of the firms from whom the building materials should be purchased and also the name of a competent carpenter to act as supervisor of construction. The church authorities are anxious that the school be completed in time for classroom work to begin September first, next.\n\nI therefore beg to recommend that you approve of utilization of the funds provided for the school at Rabbit Island to cover the cost of the work at Martin Falls and also that you request the Architect to make the necessary arrangements to erect the building at an early date.\nOttawa, May 28, 1935.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend the establishment of an Indian day school, under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, for the benefit of the Indian children of the Martin Falls Band, residing on Long Lake Reserve No. 77, Fort William Agency, Ontario.\n\nThere are 56 children of school age on the reserve, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided.\n\nFunds have been included in the main estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1935-36, to provide the cost in the establishment of a school at Martin Falls.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of\n\nMay 23rd, 1936.\n\nThere are 36 Indian children of school age, members of the Martin Falls Band, residing on Long Lake Reserve, No. 77, Fort William Agency, who have never attended school and for whom no school facilities are provided.

In this connection I submit the following information.\n\nI am a girl 22 yrs. of age and belong to the Anglican Church. I am able to sew and cook and a very good knitter. Graduated from High School in 1933 having obtained my Public and High School education in Fort William, and now taking an extramural course at Queen's University.\n\nI attended North Bay Normal School and obtained my First Class Interim Certificate. I also have a Lord Strathcona\nGrade B Certificate for Physical Training and a Religious Instruction Certificate. I have taken an active part in both Sunday School and Girl Guide work.

T. Wright, are more suited for the position than any of the other applicants. Both these teachers called at the office and were questioned by Mr. Greening.\n\nMay I bring to the Department's attention that the school at Long Lake is the only Protestant School in the entire Agency. The Rev. Mr. Bradbury has requested that an additional teacher be placed for this school. Mr. Greening and myself are of the opinion that Miss McFayen has had more experience, and is possibly better qualified.\n\nIn conclusion I may say the school is now ready for occupation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMorrison River, Feb 1, 1936.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe living at Morrison River have the following offer to make to your department if you could assist us with a school teacher for six months each year and whatever books it would take and etc.\n\nWe will supply the school and wood and etc. There would be about 25 scholars to start the school with and besides, we would be at home and could look after our children which would mean a lot to us.\n\nThere would be accommodation for the teacher at Mr. Sadlo's place. The idea is that most of us have lived here over 35 years and we sure call it our home.\n\nIf the department could give us some kind of idea what could be done, we would be greatly obliged.\nOttawa, February 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. John Sadlo visited the Department recently and, on behalf of the Indians living at Morrison River, requested that the Department provide the services of a teacher for approximately six months each year. Mr. Sadlo stated that the church could be used as a classroom and that the only expense to the Department would be the salary of the teacher and the books, etc., supplied for the children. He further stated that there are, approximately, twenty-five (25) children of school age.\n\nI would appreciate having a full report from you, stating what is your opinion regarding this request. When your reply is received, the application will receive further consideration but it should be distinctly understood that it is very doubtful if the Department will be able to provide the necessary funds during the fiscal year 1936-37.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

At the present time he is doing everything in his power to cause friction amongst the Indians. Especially with the Hudson's Bay Co. at Long Lac, where the Indians have been dealing for years.\n\nFor the Department's information, I may say that Sadlo has sent in a resolution signed by fifteen Indians, suggesting that the Morrison River Indians, deal direct with him, and also open up the Sonocol at this point. I might also add that the majority or the names have been forged.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that the Indians at Morrison River have repeatedly requested that the Sonocol be built at Long Lac. Sadlo has caused considerable friction at Morrison River as he would like the School at Morrison River adjacent to his store as he desires to hold the Indians at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He stated there would be approximately 25 children and that the Indian families resided at Morrison River for a period of six months each year.\n\nThe Department referred this matter to Mr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, and, for your information, I attach hereto a copy of his reply. In view of Mr. Burk's report, Mr. Sadlo is being informed that the department is not prepared to incur the expenditure necessary in opening a school and paying teacher's salary and other incidental expenses. There is no reserve established at Morrison River, and the Agent has been endeavouring to have these Indians move to the Long Lake Reserve, No. 77, where a new school was erected during the past summer.\n\nSgd A.

Please advise the Department the exact date on which she takes charge of the school.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why you consulted Inspector Greening regarding these applications.

Another school of the same name has been in operation for several years in Saskatchewan, and, as a result, there is apt to be considerable confusion in our files with two schools of the same name.\n\nThe Department, therefore, considers that it would be advisable to officially designate this school as the \"Martin's Falls Day School\". Please let me know if there is any objection to doing so. If not, you should, in future correspondence, refer to this school as \"Martin's Falls\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Mr. Bradbury.\n\nYou should also have the usual quarterly returns for the Martin Falls School submitted to the Department at once, and, in regard to the children whose names are shown on the return, you should mark those who are Anglicans and those who are Roman Catholics.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, August 13, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend Mr. Bradbury, Anglican missionary, Homewayne, Ont., visited the Department recently, in connection with school matters at Martin Falls and Morrison River.\n\nHe states that the majority of the Indians whose children the Department considered would attend the Martin Falls School are residing at Morrison River. He further stated that, of the children now attending the Martin Falls School, only a few are Anglican and the majority are Roman Catholic. When he visited the Department, an endeavour was made to check the names of the children attending the school, but it was found that no return has been forwarded to the Department since the school was opened last March. This matter should have received your personal attention.\n\nReverend Mr. Bradbury considers that a school should be conducted at Morrison River, under Anglican auspices.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department understood that, in establishing the school at Martin Falls, we were providing for the needs of the Anglican Indian children living in that vicinity. In view of Mr. Bradbury's\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nHudson's Bay Company.\n\nLonglac, Ont.\nAttn: Mr. Burt.\n\nDear Mr. Burt:\n\nAs you may be aware, the Morrison River Indians have been expected to come and reside on the reserve and send their children to the new school established there. However, they have failed to move here, which has caused some concern among the local residents.\n\nI am writing to inquire about the possibility of having the school relocated closer to Longlac. I believe that if the school were moved here, it would provide an opportunity for the children to attend classes in a more convenient location.\n\nAdditionally, I understand that the Bishop has expressed his support for the establishment of a school here. It seems peculiar that the school was being built without any indication of its purpose or the needs of the community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the school should be relocated to Longlac to provide better access to education for the children. I hope that you will consider this proposal favorably.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nOctober 3rd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the enclosed estimates for the Port Arthur Agency you will note I have included $5500.00 for the construction of a school at Long Lac. There are over 50 school age children on this Reservation. Unfortunately it is impossible to accommodate these children at St. Joseph's Boarding School. Consequently these children are receiving no education, and are running wild on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, June 1, 1932.\n\nI have your 210-L of the 27th ultimo, with enclosure, relative to using land funds for the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence on the Martin Falls reserve at Long Lake. I may say that the capital to the credit of this Band at the present time amounts to approximately $57,000, and it is the Department's opinion that this should not be used for the erection of a school. The interest on the amount will be required for the usual purposes. A note will be made for next year's Indian Education Estimates in connection with this need.\n\nI am unable to understand that part of your penultimate paragraph where you state that you have recommended this school for two years. Your 210-L of April 29th last, in the first correspondence on the Department's file, was in connection with a Protestant school for the Martin Falls Band at Long Lake. Previous correspondence has been on your file 1800-A and 210-D and refers to a school for the Catholic Indians who, I understand, are on the other side of the lake.\n\nYou might let me know if it is not true that, eventually, two schools will be required. These should be called the Long Lake R. C. and Long Lake C. E. Schools. Please state, also, the number of school age in each Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. W. J. Greening, Separate School Inspector, visited the Department yesterday, and recommended that a day school activity be carried on at Long Lac in the Fort William Agency. He states there are sufficient Indian children at that point. It would be necessary to erect a school building, and he estimated that the cost would be approximately $500 for finishing materials and furnishings - the Indians to get out the logs and perform the greater part of the labour in putting up the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, October 20, 1933.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune 8, 1936.\n\nATTENTION - SCHOOL BRANCH\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that the Rev. Father Couturier called today at this office regarding the school situation at Long Lac Reserve. He advises that there are approximately thirty-five or forty-five Roman Catholic school children on the Reserve during the summer months, and he would appreciate very much if the Department would open a summer school in the old Catholic Church on the reserve. He further advises that he can secure the services of Miss Barker at Nipigon, for teacher, for $40.00 per month. The only cost involved by the Department would be a few school books and the teacher's salary for six months during the summer.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say that as the expense will not be very great in operating this temporary summer school I would suggest that it be tried out for a period of six months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. O. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAttention - School Branch\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, file No. 9-12-1, and note that the Reverend Mr. Bradbury, Anglican Missionary at Hornepayne, Ont., visited the Department recently, in connection with several matters, namely; The School at Martin Falls Reserve, and the Indian Settlement at Morrison River, Ont.\n\nIn reply, I may say, that the School question has always been the main topic, during Annuity payments on the Martin Falls Reserve for the past five years. I believe the Reverend Mr. Bradbury also made special visits to the Department, on several occasions, regarding the construction of this school. It was thoroughly understood, when the School was constructed, that the older people would remain on the Reserve, and see that the children attended School. The main reasons for constructing the School were to secure an education for the children, and to encourage the band to grow sufficient vegetables for the entire band. When the hunting season opened, it was clearly understood, that the families could be left on the Reserve, to allow the children to attend School, and further, that all Indians who were unable to trap, would remain on the Reserve and not live at the settlement at Morrison River. The Reverend Mr. Bradbury, Mr. F.H. Paget, Mr. S.A. Taylor, the Hudson's Bay Factor at Long Lac, and myself, considered that if this band made permanent settlement on the Reserve, tilled the land, sent the children to School; and allowed the younger members to hunt and trap; we would be assisting the Indians to live a much healthier life, and also live the life of a civilized man, and an education. I am enclosing\n\nIn conclusion, I wish and, that there are two reserves at Long Lac, Ont., namely, Long Lac Reserve and Martin Falls Reserve. A distance of four miles separates these two factors. It is my honest belief, that the Reverend Mr. Bradbury does not want the Anglican Church to mingle with the members of the Long Lac Reserve, who are Roman Catholic.\n\nWith reference to your last paragraph, I will see that the Quarterly reports for the Martin Falls School are forwarded at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Burt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFort Arthur, Ont.,\nAugust 21, 1930.\n\nAttention\u2014School Branch\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, quarterly school return covering the Martin Falls Indian Day School at Long Lac, Ont.\n\nAs you will note there are fourteen Anglican children and nine Roman Catholic children attending. The Ecnuns and the Chapais were Anglican, but joined the Roman Catholic church last year. This is one of the reasons why the Bishop objects to sending the Anglican children to school on the Martin Falls Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc.\nBradbury's information, we are at a loss to understand why the school was placed at Martin Falls.\n\nI would appreciate your reporting fully regarding the questions raised as a result of our interview with Rev. Mr. Bradbury.\n\nYou should also have the usual quarterly returns for the Martin Falls School submitted to the Department at once, and, in regard to the children whose names are shown on the return, you should mark those who are Anglicans and those who are Roman Catholics.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, August 13, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend Mr. Bradbury, Anglican Missionary, Hornepayne, Ont., visited the Department recently, in connection with school matters at Martin Falls and Morrison River.\n\nHe states that the majority of the Indians whose children the Department considered would attend the Martin Falls School are residing at Morrison River. He further stated that, of the children now attending the Martin Falls School, only a few are Anglican and the majority are Roman Catholic. When he visited the Department, an endeavour was made to check the names of the children attending the school, but it was found that no return has been forwarded to the Department since the school was opened last March. This matter should have received your personal attention.\n\nReverend Mr. Bradbury considers that a school should be conducted at Morrison River, under Anglican auspices.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department understood that, in establishing the school at Martin Falls, we were providing for the needs of the Anglican Indian children living in that vicinity. In view of Mr.\n\n- Bradbury's\n\nJ. G. Birk, Ld.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nShould the Dept. grant us this request I will see that all Class reports will be sent in at the regular time.\n\nI will keep you informed of the work in general.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nRev.

There are 30 children beginning at the age of 5 ready for school now; after the trapping season is over there would be 8 or 10 more.\n\n2nd. We could use the Church for the time for a small rent of 10 or 15 dollars per month.\n\n3rd. The Teacher could board at Mr. Sadlo's.\n\n4th. We could secure a Teacher and have him on duty say Sept. 15th.\n\nWe hope that the Dept. will help us out with this matter temporarily, & agree to put the Dept. toward building a school.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nEXL.\n\nOttawa, September 1, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the school on the Martin Falls Reserve.\n\nThe 1934 census which was, no doubt, prepared in your office shows that on the Long Lac Reserve there are 255 Indians, all of whom are Roman Catholic, and of whom there are 51 children of school age. The same census shows that on the Martin Falls Reserve there are 194 Indians, all Church of England, and of whom 56 are of school age.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate number of children of school age on the Long Lac Reserve who are attending school and state the school which they are attending. Should the Department infer from the third paragraph of your letter that the children from the Long Lac Reserve, who are stated to be Roman Catholic, are coming four miles to the school on the Martin Falls Reserve?\n\nIt is noted that, in placing the school on the Martin Falls Reserve, you were under the impression that the Indians would reside on this Reserve at least during the hunting season. Do you consider that there is any possibility of their doing so, or do you now feel that they will reside the greater part of the time at Morrison River?\n\nThe Department has not yet received the quarterly return mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter. It is expected that, when forwarding these returns, you will follow the instructions given in the last paragraph of official letter of the 17th ultimo.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, September 1, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, requesting the establishment of a school at Harrison River for the Anglican Indians of the Martin Falls Band.\n\nNo provision has been made in the current year's Appropriation for a school at this point and, as our Appropriation will not permit incurring expenditures that have not been specially provided, it is not possible to favourably consider your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nApril 25, 1938\n\nAttention-Training Division\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Miss Ottie M. Wright, teacher at the Martin Falls Indian Day school just called at this office, and advised that owing to the serious illness of her mother she would be pleased to receive authorization for three months leave of absence, as she will be unable to return to her duties after the close of the Easter Holidays April 26th. In view of this I would be pleased if the Department would advise if it will be necessary to re-engage another teacher to complete the term at this school, if it is the Department's wish that leave of absence be given Miss Wright.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nonly operate it as a Seasonal School as it is possible that the Indians may reside at Martin Falls for a period during each year. Please let me have your comments regarding this suggestion.\n\nIf it is not likely that any large number of pupils will be available for this school would it be possible to move it to the Long Lac Reserve where I understand there are a large number of children available and for whom no school facilities are provided at the present time.\n\nIn view of the very small attendance at the Martin Falls School it will be impossible for the Department to consider conducting it as a year round activity. I, therefore, trust that you will report fully on the situation at Martin Falls and at Long Lac and make whatever recommendations you consider advisable in the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant in which you state Miss Ottie M. Wright, teacher of the Martin Falls Indian Day School, found it impossible to re-open the school after the Easter holidays. It is presumed that Miss Wright taught the school to April 13 end at the end of this month she will be paid salary for 13 days.\n\nThis school should remain closed until further notice.\n\nIn reviewing our file I find that you were written on September 1, 1936 in connection with the Martin Falls School but that no reply was received from you to that letter. In this regard I might also refer you to official letter of August 13, 1936 and your reply of August 18, 1936.\n\nThe quarterly returns received from this school show that both enrolment and average attendance have been steadily dropping until during the quarter just closed the enrolment was only 6 and the average 4. The majority of these are stated to be Roman Catholic.\n\nAs you are aware this school was established for the purpose of providing for the needs of the Anglican Indian children living in the vicinity of Martin Falls. Apparently the Indians must not be residing on this reserve as you expected they would. Please let me know if the majority of the Indians are still living at Morrison River possibly the solution of the Martin Falls School is to\n\nJ. G.

It is noted that the old Catholic Church building on the reserve would be suitable for classroom purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of today's date regarding the Martin Falls Indian Day School you should advise Miss Ottie M. Wright that it has been decided to allow her salary for the month of April. She should also be informed that this school will not likely re-open on September 1 and quite possibly, if it is re-opened at any time, it will only be a seasonal school.\n\nIf she wishes to teach for the academic year 1938-39 it would be advisable for her to make application for a white school as we are not aware of any Indian school in your locality requiring a teacher for September 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAn inquiry has reached us recently regarding the possible future of the school erected at Martin Falls. It has been pointed out to us that on the Long Lac Reserve on the opposite side of the lake from Martin Falls there are a large number of children for whom no school facilities have ever been provided and it has been suggested that it might be possible to move the present Martin Falls school to that point.\n\nIt has also been suggested that a summer school operated at Martin Falls would be well attended.\n\nBoth of the above suggestions were submitted to you in my letter of April 27, 1938, and on reviewing our file I am very surprised to note that you did not reply to that letter.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate receiving an immediate reply from you stating fully your views on what action should be taken. The school on the Martin Falls Reserve is a substantial building and it is very unfortunate that some good use cannot be made of it.\n\nWhen replying you should let me know what provision you have made for protecting the building and its contents while it is not in use.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, file 9-18-1, regarding further prospects of the re-opening of the Martin Falls Indian Day school.\n\nIn reply I may say that the reason I did not answer your letter was that this same question was taken up with Mr. P. Phelan on one of my visits to Ottawa, and I pointed out that it would be necessary to wait until the summer of 1939, in order to ascertain if the pulpwood company at Little Long Lao are going to give the Indians pulpwood concessions at the South end of the lake. If these concessions are given to our Indians, it will mean that the two reservations situated at Long Lao will be able to receive continuous work. The Long Lao #53 reserve is situated on the Canadian National Railway. The reserve where the school is situated is approximately four miles from this station. If both of these bands could obtain work away from the railway, they would be far better off.\n\nFor the Department's information, I may say that it is very difficult for the Indians to secure work in the vicinity of the town of Little Long Lao, consequently it is hoped that final arrangements can be made this summer to secure work for both of these bands. In the meantime I would strongly recommend that settlement of this question be left until after treaty payment.\n\nWith reference to establishing a school during the summer at the Martin Falls school I may say that this question was taken up with the Indians and owing to survey work which was going on last summer, a large percentage of the male members were on survey parties and their families moved with them to the opposite end of the Lake.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say that I consider it advisable to go into this question very thoroughly before any definite decision is made. I will be very pleased to report on the above, directly after treaty payments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 14th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the prospects for reopening the Martin Falls Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that you will be unable to report definitely on this matter until the coming summer. Please let me hear from you as soon as you have definite information.\n\nIn the meantime, I would refer you to the last paragraph of my letter of the 2nd instant.

Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 6, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Burk:\n\nThe Department has received a request for the establishment of a day school on the Long Lac Reserve. It is stated that there is a large number of Catholic Indian children for whom no school facilities are available.\n\nI have recently reviewed your letter of March 11, 1939. From that letter and previous correspondence it would appear that no use is being made of the Martin Falls School. As a school is needed on the Long Lac Reserve, would it be possible to move the school from Martin Falls to Long Lac, a distance of approximately four miles?\n\nHow many Indian children of school age are there at Long Lac? If it is not possible to move the Martin Falls School, is there any building available at Long Lac which could be secured for school purposes? No special funds have been provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school at Long Lac, but, if a building were available, we might be able to consider the appointment of a teacher and the operation of a school.

Hatters,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 28, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nRE: Family of Fred Wesley - Constance Lake Band No. 43,\n(formerly Albert Band No. 159).\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter dated September 25th, referring to the ages of Fred Wesley's children now resident at Longlac; but in view of all the circumstances, it is felt that these children, since they are all of school age, should be admitted to the Chapleau Indian Residential School. This action should, of course, be carried out only if their X-ray reports indicate they are in good health - and providing also, as assumed, they are members of the Church of England.\n\nThe paragraph of your letter dealing with school arrangements at Longlac has been noted and I might state this question is receiving attention - considerable correspondence already having passed between this office and the office of Mr. Indian Agent Burke at Fort Arthur.\n\nYour remarks regarding another trip to Longlac have also been noted and this action is approved insofar as your relationship to members of the Constance Lake Band is concerned. The Reserve at Longlac, as you are no doubt aware, is part of the Fort Arthur Agency and the general administration of same comes under the Fort Arthur Agency office.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 29, 1944.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 28 and previous correspondence in connection with the opening of a day school at Longlac. When you last visited the settlement I understood you were going to write a full report regarding this matter. Recently we received a letter from another party who had been at Longlac and in this letter the statement is made that there are a large number of children there and that none of them appear to be attending school. Evidently there is considerable need for a school at this point. I wish you would let me know at once what could be done.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMontreal,\n\nment to assist by special grants in such circumstances.\n\nMay I hope that you pay: a) the salary of our two teachers; b) the salary of our registered nurse; c) a rent to help heat the building, during the long, long winter.\n\nFor us all, our desire is to serve a noble cause, and we would welcome any of your suggestions to help us so that the work is well done and complies with your wishes.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n+Joseph Cardinal\n\nArchbishop of Montreal.\nMontreal, October 20, 1945.\n\nDr. Hoey,\nThe Director of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\n165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nA bad cold has prevented me from sooner complying with your desires of summing up the case of our day school for our Indians living at Longlac, Ontario.\n\nI insist first on thanking you for your great courtesy when you received me at your office in Ottawa.\n\nAs Bishop of Hearst, I became aware that more and more Indian families were settling at the northern head of Longlac. There was no school available for their children. The residing missionary, Reverend Father Couture, of the Society of Jesus, told me of his keen desire to do something to assimilate those Indians to our ways of life, to our civilization.\n\nFrom that time on, I have adopted his mission and I supplied the funds to erect a good and modern building, including two classrooms, a hall for household science, a well lit and clean basement to allow the boys to get useful and healthy distractions.\n\nThe school, the property of the Episcopal Corporation of the diocese of Hearst, has cost to date $13,500 and will be directed by four nuns: two of whom are regular teachers, one a nurse, the fourth a teacher of household science. The four are now in Toronto.\n\nOn the first of November, the staff will be on the spot and we expect to start at once with our educational work among the Indians.\n\nI know that it is customary for your depart-\nresponsibilities. Doctor Moore assures me, however, that he will be able to discuss this appointment with the officials now responsible for such matters and he will communicate with you just as soon as a final decision is reached.\n\nIt is unnecessary to add that the personal interest you have taken in the establishment of this school and the provision you appear to have made for the education of the children is deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, October 26, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Charbonneau:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 20th and have noted with interest the proposals submitted by you for our consideration with respect to the operation of the two-room Indian Day School at Longino.\n\nI have this morning discussed the subject matter of your letter with Mr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, and with Doctor Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services. The Department will be prepared to pay from the outset the salaries of the teachers and we shall also be glad to purchase from year to year the wood or coal necessary for heating the building, and the costs of caretaking that may be involved. In view of the fact that this school is the property of the Episcopal Corporation in the Diocese of Hearst and that it has cost to date the sum of approximately $13,500, we shall be able to allow a monthly rental of $45.00 for the period during which the school is in operation; or in other words, a period of ten months during each calendar year.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the Government should purchase this building from the Episcopal Corporation; but we have no item in our regular or supplementary estimates now before Parliament which would enable us to do so. The desirability of purchasing this building is a matter that can be reviewed by the Minister at a later date.\n\nIt so happens that the Medical Services of the Indian Affairs Branch are about to be transferred to the Department of National Health and Welfare. The employment of a nurse, therefore, at the school or on this particular reserve is not now a matter that comes within the scope of my duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe Most Reverend J. Charbonneau, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Montreal,\nArchbishop's Palace,\nMONTREAL, Quebec.\nOttawa, October 30, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to recognize the new two-room Indian Day School which has recently been erected for the Martin Falls Band located near Longlac.\n\nWe will allow a monthly rental of $45.00 a teaching month, effective from November 1, 1945. We intend to allow salary for two teachers and also the cost of the winter's supply of coal necessary for heating the building and the cost of caretaking.\n\nPlease consult those in charge and have the enclosed forms completed and returned.\n\nYou should let me know whether the building is being heated by wood or coal and what arrangements have been made to secure the fuel required for the coming winter.\n\nAs stated above, we are willing to allow payment for caretaking services. However, without establishing a position through the Civil Service Commission, we would not be able to allow salary over $15.00 a teaching month.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

PHILAN\n\nRe: Inspection of North Bay, Spanish, Manitoulin Island, Shingwauk Home and Longlac.\n\nLONGLAC\n\nThe Longlac new school is a substantial building. Unfortunately, the plan for partitioning could have been greatly improved. It was too late, however, to do anything about the classroom divisions.\n\nThe Domestic Science room is a little room, 11' x 18'. As will be noticed it is too small. I have suggested that a partition separating this room from the dispensary be removed which would leave a room 13' x 24'.\n\nThere is a good basement but it is too low, the ceiling being only 6\u00bd feet high. The lighting is, consequently, poor.\n\nThis school is not yet completed. Material and labor has been a serious handicap. Only one classroom is in operation. This produces crowding and interference as the teachers are working together. This is only a temporary arrangement and by the end of January should be remedied.\n\nThere were forty-one pupils enrolled. A number were absent due to sickness. Reverend Father Couture expects an enrolment of about sixty.\n\nMaterial to teach domestic science has been sent so that this activity may be undertaken without delay. Gardening will be introduced this summer and as the teachers remain there the whole year, I have great hopes that this activity will be a success.\n\nThere is a registered nurse who is checking the children very carefully. I understand that she also visits the people on the Reserve.\n\nI have explained to the teachers, the method of the integrated program of study and have asked them to study this system and to endeavour to introduce it gradually. The introduction must necessarily be gradual in order that the teachers themselves may learn this line of work. I am sending them a few reference books which, I believe, will prove helpful.\n\nA.J.

Last year the Indians were extremely disappointed that a school was not built.\n\nThe Chief has just called at this office and informed me that a meeting was recently held and he was sent up as their representative to go there and provide funds for the purpose of building this school. I may say I have also received a communication from Rev. W. Bradbury, Anglican Missionary, also urging that the school be built. Mr. Bradbury mentioned as the Martin Falls Reserve is the only Protestant one in the Agency he considers they should receive some consideration, as the 7 other schools are Catholic. Mr. Bradbury states there are 35 children of school age on the Reserve. I regret I overlooked including this item in the estimates sent to the Department.\n\nI am also including $400.00 for the construction of a basement and $250.00 for a hot air furnace and cement reservoir for the McIntyre School. On a recent visit to this school I noticed that the school is sagging in 2 different points. There is only a temporary wooden foundation. I regret I overlooked forwarding these items at an earlier date. I trust the Department will recommend same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. C. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nHORNEPAYNE, Ontario, Feb. 16th. 1935.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nMay I draw your attention to the fact, that the Indians of Martin Falls Reserve, were promised a school. I certainly expected that a school would be built on the Reserve last year, but such was not the case.\n\nI understand, that there are six or seven Indian Catholic Schools, in Port Arthur Agency, and I cannot see, for the life of me, why the only Protestant Reserve cannot have a school.\n\nI may add, that the Chief and Councillors, requested me to write to you on this matter.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Bradbery B.P.\nRector.\nOttawa, February 27, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the establishment of a day school on the Martin Falls reserve at Long Lac, Ont.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it was hoped to have obtained an appropriation to provide for the erection of a suitable building for classroom purposes during the coming summer. However, there were so many demands that it was not possible to obtain funds for the purpose. The Department is well aware of the need for a school for the Indian children on the Martin Falls reserve. The matter will not be lost sight of, and school facilities will be provided as soon as funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. W. Bradbury, B.D.,\nHornepayne,\nOnt.\nHomepayne Ont March 31st/1935\n\nTo Deputy Minister,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nHon.Sir,\n\nI just heard from Mr.J.G.Burke Indian Agent Port Arthur, who informed me that the Department was going to build a School on the Martin Falls Reserve this year.\n\nI wish to thank the Department very kindly.\n\nI appreciate your action very much indeed, because the School should have been built on this Reserve several years ago.\n\nThere are 30 or 40 children running around the reserve who should be going to School.\n\nI cannot understand why the Roman Catholic should be considered above us, The Church of England has spent thousands of dollars on this very work.\n\nTime will not permit me to give a full account of this.\n\nI am very thankful indeed to know that this Reserve will have a School.\n\nBest Wishes,\nYours Very Truly,\n\nW. Bradbury B.C.\n\nRector,\nSt Luke's Church of England,\nHomepayne Ont.,\nApril 13, 1935.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRegarding the erection of a day school building, with living accommodation for teacher, on the LARTIN FALLS reserve, at Long Lac, Ont., Mr. Agent Burk, Port Arthur, states that the school should provide accommodation for approximately 36 children.\n\nMr. Burk, during a recent visit to the Department, stated that the best means of having the school erected would be that he arrange for the purchase of all material from firms on the approved list and that the labour be performed by Indians, under the supervision of a competent foreman. The Agent estimated the cost of materials and labour to be approximately $3,800.\n\nNo funds were specially provided to cover the cost, but it is likely that same could be found in either the Appropriation for Indian Education or in the PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION ACT. The building should be erected during the coming summer.\n\nIt would be necessary to obtain the approval of the Minister for the expenditure and secure the name of a competent carpenter to act as supervisor of construction.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nMay 2nd, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe authorities of the Church of England have requested that a day school building, with living accommodation for a teacher, be established for the benefit of the Indian children of the Martin Falls band, residing on Long Lac reserve, No. 77, Fort William agency, Ont. Mr. Agent Burk, Port Arthur, states that the school should provide accommodation for approximately 36 children.\n\nThere are no funds specially provided to cover the cost of erecting the building, but there is an amount of $4,000.00 provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, to erect a day school at the Rabbit Island settlement, the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve. The need for a school at this point is not as pressing as on the Long Lac reserve, and I would recommend that the above amount provided for the school at Rabbit Island be utilized in erecting a building for the Martin Falls band.\n\nMr. Agent Burk, during a recent visit to the Department, stated that the best means of having the school erected would be that he arrange for the purchase of all materials, from firms on the approved list, and that the labour be performed by Indians, under the supervision of a competent foreman. The Agent estimated the cost of the materials and labour to be about $3,800.00.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Honourable the Superintendent General for the expenditure and secure the names of the firms from whom the building materials should be purchased and also the name of a competent carpenter to act as supervisor of construction. The church authorities are anxious that the school be completed in time for classroom work to begin September first, next.\n\nI therefore beg to recommend that you approve of utilization of the funds provided for the school at Rabbit Island to cover the cost of the work at Martin Falls and also that you request the Architect to make the necessary arrangements to erect the building at an early date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMay 27th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to our verbal conversation during my visit to Ottawa, I would be very pleased if authority could be obtained as soon as possible to start constructing the combination day school and residence on the Martin Falls Reserve. The approximate cost would not exceed $6000.00.\n\nOn my recent visit to this Reserve, Mr. Bradbury and myself picked out a suitable location on which to build the school and residence.\n\nI presume it will be in order to build this school similarly to other Indian day schools constructed in this Agency\u2014that is, under the supervision of a carpenter-foreman and Indian labour.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, regarding the erection of a combined school building and teacher's residence for the benefit of the Indian children of the Martin Falls Band residing on Long Lac Reserve, No. 77, Fort William Agency.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that this matter is now before His Excellency in Council, so we have the establishment of the school authorized.\n\nI note you state the approximate cost of the building would not exceed $6,000. The Department understood, during your visit, when the matter was discussed, that the cost of this building would not exceed, approximately, $4,000. You will be advised in due course regarding the arrangements for material and labour in the construction of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, No. 9-8-5, regarding the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence on the Martin Falls Reserve, Band No. 77.\n\nIn reply I would refer you to your 3rd paragraph regarding the cost of the building. I was under the impression I informed the Deputy Minister the cost of the school would be approximately $5000.00. I mentioned $6000.00 in my last letter as the freight rate is exceptionally high from Port Arthur to Long Lac and at Long Lac all the material, including the lumber, cement, etc., will have to be loaded on a scow and towed down to the Reservation, a distance of 4 miles. Consequently I mentioned $6000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

I understand that a suitable site has been selected. It will be necessary to provide classroom accommodation for 36 children and living accommodation for a teacher. The sum of $4,000.00 is available in the Appropriation for Indian Education to erect the building.\n\nAs the Indian Agent and the Anglican Church authorities, under whose auspices the school will be conducted, are anxious to have the building completed in order that teaching services can begin early next fall, I would request that you give the erection of the building early attention.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nJune 10, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: The Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nFunds are available and it is proposed to establish an Indian Day School for the children of the Martin Falls band on Long Lake Reserve No 77, Fort William Agency, Ont.\n\nThe Indian Agent has stated that the best means of erecting this building would be by day labour utilizing Indian labour under the supervision of a competent foreman.\n\nIf you approve of the erection of this building will you please advise me as to the party who may be employed as foreman.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 26, 1935\n\nYour memorandum of the 10th instant, your file 9-18-5.\n\nThe Minister approves of the erection of an Indian Day School for the children of the Martin Falls band on Long Lac Reserve No. 77, Fort William Agency, and authorizes the engagement of Mrs. R.

He has communicated with me regarding the advisability of putting in a furnace.\n\nI may say the cost of 2 large heaters, one for the residence and one for the schoolroom, including pipes, would not exceed approximately $75.00. The cost of heating the schoolroom and residence each year would amount to approximately $50.00, as invariably the smoke from the stove darkens the walls.\n\nThe cost of the furnace would not exceed $300.00. Under the circumstances would it be possible to install a new furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the installing of heating equipment in the new school building and teacher's residence now under construction on the Long Lac Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of the installation of a furnace to heat the building, at a cost which, it is noted, will not exceed the sum of $300. You should arrange for the purchase of a furnace, of a size and type that would be suitable to heat this building, and have same forwarded to the school and set satisfactorily installed. Purchase should be made from the best available source of supply. If possible, the cost of the furnace and the installation should be kept within your estimate.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is noted that the work of erecting the building is progressing very favourably. You should see that all accounts for material, labour, etc., are forwarded as promptly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. G.

Under the existing circumstances, the teacher advises that she is obliged to pay an Indian for transportation every time she visits the school at Long Lac. A boat can be purchased for this purpose for approximately $75.00. As previously mentioned, owing to the isolation of this school, I would strongly recommend the purchase of a boat for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, requesting that a boat be supplied for the use of the teacher of the Martin's Falls School. It is noted that the school is located approximately 4 miles across a small lake from the C. N. R. station, post office and stores.\n\nIt is not the practice of the Department to supply boats for teachers' use. Would the teacher have to row a distance of 4 miles? If so, there is an element of danger in her rowing that distance, in the event of sudden storms on the lake. The school will soon be closed for summer holidays, and, as it is presumed the teacher will not be staying there during the vacation period, there does not appear to be any immediate necessity for supplying a boat. Besides, it is considered that, if a boat is supplied, one could be obtained, satisfactory for the purpose, at a lower cost than $75.00.\n\nThe Department would like information regarding the distance across the lake; whether the teacher remains at the school during the holiday period and, also, what arrangements could be made for the proper care and storage of the boat. When we have further information, as requested, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be authorized. I may add that we have no special provision for supplying boats for teachers' use.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G.

Oil Cloth for Kitchen table\n6 Yds. Mosquito netting\nScreening for windows.\n1 - Screen door for residence.\nSchool flag.\n\nI would appreciate the necessary authority to make the above mentioned purchases, the approximate cost will be $10.00 excluding the School flag.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. [signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune 25, 1936.\n\nAttention - School Branch\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the Martin Falls Indian Day School at Long Lac, Ont., I beg to advise that a school desk and chair was not ordered; consequently the teacher has been using the kitchen table for a desk. I would appreciate if authorization could be obtained for these purchases; the approximate cost would be $30.00 for the desk and $10.00 for the chair making a total of $40.00 delivered at Long Lac, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 29, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your two letters of the 28th instant, regarding the supplies, including teacher's desk and chair, required at the Martin Falls Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 4 inexpensive pillow cases.\n- 3 yards oil cloth.\n- 6 yards mosquito netting.\n- 1 screen door for residence.\n- Screening required for windows.\n\nYou may arrange, also, for the purchase of an inexpensive type of teacher's desk and a teacher's chair. It is considered that both the desk and chair could be obtained at a price lower than the quotation furnished by you. The chair should be plain and substantial, to match desk, and should be of a non-tipping type.\n\nAfter you have purchased the above equipment, please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Receipts for any transportation charges should be attached to the vouchers.\n\nA 6-foot flag is being sent you for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune 25, 1936.\n\nAttention - School Branch\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant relative to previous correspondence regarding the purchase of a boat for the teacher of the Martin Falls Indian Day School at Long Lac, Ont.\n\nThe distance from the School to the station at Long Lac is approximately four miles. The teacher, when rowing to and from the Post Office and Store in the village, would always be able to keep within a short distance from the shore.\n\nAs this Reserve is isolated and the teacher is the only white person on the Reserve, I would strongly recommend the purchase of a boat to enable the teacher to make contact with the white people in the village at Long Lac, and to enable her to go and come when she so desires. At the present time she is obliged to pay the Indians to convey her to the store and Post Office and to and from the Reserve.\n\nThe price of $75.00 includes the freight, and a good substantial boat.\n\nWith reference to the teacher taking holidays, I believe she intends spending part of them at Long Lac, but the boat can be stored in the School basement, when she is away.\n\nI trust the Department will see fit to authorize this purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. J. Clark\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n210-2.\n\nOttawa, June 30, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in further reference to the request for the supplying of a boat, for the use of the teacher of the Martin Falls Indian Day School, at Long Lac, Ont.\n\nIn view of your report regarding the need of the teacher being furnished with a boat, the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $700.00, in the supplying of a good, substantial boat, with oars, etc., and including freight. You should inform the teacher that this boat will be placed in her charge and she should see that, during her absence or in the winter season, it is properly stored and cared for.\n\nYou should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the boat, attach same to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The receipt for any freight charges on the shipping of the boat to the school should be attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G.

The school house on the Reserve was closely inspected and found in order. Within a radius of twenty-five yards and almost encircling the school is a pile of brush. This appears to be a distinct fire hazard and I respectfully suggest that the Indians be employed in the near future to clean this up.\n\nT. A. Waugh (Ost.)\n(Signed)\n\n(#10845, - I/e Detachment)\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the fire hazard in connection with the Martin Falls Indian Day School. It is stated that there are piles of brush within a radius of 25 yards and almost encircling the school.\n\nI would request that you arrange for Indian labour to clean up and remove any brush, trees, etc., for a distance around the school building, in order to overcome any danger of fire. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and it is thought the Indians should carry out this work without expense for their services. If not, you should forward vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. The number of hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated. The Department will expect you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in cleaning up the grounds at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. G.

Mr. Burdick asked for itemization of our charges, and we thought our charge $15 was too much. We have now calculated the amount we really should get for repairing our equipment, which account came to about $56.80.\n\nUntil this time we have had no payment whatever from your department, not even for the empty sacks supplied to the Indians. We are enclosing herewith copies of the two accounts rendered and wish you will let us have some sort of payment or at least good reasons for not making the payment. While working at Longlac we tried to help these Indians as much as possible. Our work, for instance, was given for their use without rent, but surely we cannot bear the loss of damaging same.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor [signature] Nelson\nOttawa, March 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter dated March 13th, 1936, and the Department's reply thereto of the 20th of the same month, regarding an account in favour of Kallio and Kauppi for repairs to snow which was used in freighting materials for the construction of the Martin Falls Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has received a letter from this firm, together with an account which is enclosed herewith, requesting payment for work and material in repairing the damaged snow, and also for 150 sacks supplied the Indians on the building job. No reply appears to have been received to our letter of March 20th, 1936, referred to above. If you consider that the account of Kallio and Kauppi is a fair charge against the Department, you should prepare a voucher, in triplicate, for the amount due.\n\nRegarding the work and material, full details should be given as to the number of hours employed and the rate paid, and the material used and the price charged. Receipts should also be obtained from the Company covering payment of wages paid, and particulars given regarding the empty sacks supplied the Indians.\n\nI would request that you give this matter your prompt attention, and have the voucher, together with accounts attached, forwarded to the Department in time to make payment before our books close for the present fiscal year.\n\nFurther, you should inform the above Company that we have received their letter, together with their account, and that the matter has been referred to you for adjustment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

At the time I mentioned that the Reverence Father J. Couture said he would go into the matter very carefully and advise me at some future date. During my absence from the office, Father Couture called and stated there was no temporary building available at Longlac suitable for a school and has recommended that the school now situated on the Long Lake #77 (Martin Falls) reserve, across the bay, could be moved across the ice (a distance of approx. 4 miles), to the Long Lake #58 reserve, during the winter months.\n\nI have written to Longlac to make enquiries as to the cost of building a basement at L. Lake #58 reserve and moving the building during the winter months, from the M. Falls reserve. When the figures have been obtained I will be very pleased to notify you immediately.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nOctober 28, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence in connection with a school at the Long Lake #58 reserve, I am taking a contractor down to Longlac, Ont. in order to make arrangements to move the Long Lake #77 school across the ice of Longlac this coming winter and also to construct a concrete foundation for same.\n\nWould you kindly advise if funds will be available for this work. The approximate cost would be in the neighbourhood of $2,000.00.\n\nI have interviewed several contractors but up to the present time I have only been able to get one contractor, who is interested. The firm I mention is Hacquill Brothers of Fort William, who do work of this nature.\n\nJ. C. Burk, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 1, 1944.\n\nMr. J.G.

I note that you are obtaining a definite quotation from a firm in Fort William. This quotation will no doubt give full details regarding the manner in which the amount of $3000 is estimated.\n\nYou should have all this information available as soon as possible, as Inspector Arnell hopes to visit your agency in the near future, at which time you should discuss the matter with him.\n\nR.A.

In that letter you stated that you would forward a detailed report as to the cost of building a basement and moving the school. Up to the present we have not received this information and an immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, January 4, 1945.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of the 18th ultimo, to which no reply has been received, with regard to the possibility of moving the school from Martin Falls Reserve No. 77 to the Long Lake Reserve No. 53. As the season is advancing, the officials would like to have the information necessary on which to base a decision. Consequently, I have been directed to request that you reply to my letter of the 18th ultimo. Your reply should reach here not later than Wednesday January 10.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDecember 27, 1944.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nFort William, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nEnclosed find our price to move school at Long Lake from present site and across Lake to new location near Catholic Church. To place building on basement with 7\" walls 10\" thick and 4\" cement floor. To take out present furnace from original building and install in basement at new location.\n\nIt is understood we are to excavate only to rock base. Our total price for this work will be $5,045.00 complete.\n\nWe are sorry that we have withheld our tender to so late a date but owing to labour shortage we were not in a position to quote until now and we are prepared to proceed with this work immediately.\n\nHope we can be of service to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHACQUOIL'S.\n\nNote: It is understood that the basement is to be excavated and poured after the frost is out of the ground in the Spring of 1945.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJan. 3, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Nov. 1st, file 9-13-5, relative to previous correspondence regarding the moving of the Martin Falls school from the Martin Falls (L. Lake #77) reserve to the Long Lake No. 58 reservation, a distance of approximately 6 miles.\n\nAs you will note, I am enclosing herewith a quotation from Mr. Haquqoil, of Fort William, Ont. His price includes the moving of the school from one reserve to the other; building a basement and installing the furnace. His price, as you will note is $3,045.00 complete.\n\nMr. Haquqoil informed me, in my office today that the building would be moved when the ice is strong enough to carry the school, which will no doubt be, at the end of this month. Owing to the fact that gravel is impossible to secure in the winter months, he will not be able to complete the basement until early next Spring.\n\nI have endeavoured to secure competitive prices but have not been able to secure a second bid.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1945.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, in connection with moving the school from the Martin Falls Reserve, No. 77, to the Long Lake Reserve, No. 88, a distance of approximately 6 miles. I may say, quite frankly, that at first glance the price quoted appears rather high. However, it is possible that this is not the case. We do not appear to have any definite information on our file regarding the length, width and height of this building. I should appreciate receiving this information by return mail. You might also state the material of which it is constructed and if the building is in good condition at the present time. Is it possible to secure a competitive bid from some other contractor? If it is, you should do so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJan. 8, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept.

Unfortunately, I was unable to reply to your letter at an earlier date. As a matter of fact, I called at Haquocil's office, a great number of times, and was informed at each visit, that he would mail me an estimate for the cost of moving the school, as soon as possible.\n\nI trust, by this time, that you have received my reply.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th inst., file 9-18-5 with regard to information concerning the Long Lake #77 (Martin Falls) Indian day school, I wish to advise the length of the school is 40 ft., width 36 ft. and height 20 ft.\n\nThe school is of frame construction, two-storey, combination school and residence, built according to a blueprint and plan received from our Department and designated as \"Plan No. 552 Oka Indian day school\", from which you could obtain full information.\n\nThe building is at present in good condition.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, January 16, 1945.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Fort Arthur, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, in further reference to the Long Lake Indian Day School.\n\nYou will note, in the last part of my letter of the 6th instant, that you were requested to state if it was possible to secure a competitive bid from some other contractor and if so, you were directed to do so. In your letter of the 10th instant you make no reference to this request. I would therefore appreciate hearing further from you at once.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th inst., file 9-18-5 and my reply of January 10th regarding the moving of the Long Lake #77 (Martin Falls) school, I wish to advise that I have just returned from the Barnett-McQueen Co. of Fort William, Ont., to ascertain if they would be interested in quoting a price on the moving of the school.

G. Burk, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nMr. J. C. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, in further reference to previous correspondence regarding the moving of the Long Lake No. 77 School. It is noted that to move the school and place it on a basement would involve an expenditure in excess of $3,000.00. No provision was made for this expenditure in our current year's appropriation, and the funds at our disposal at the present time are too limited for us to expend this amount. We are including an item in our post-war building program for the removal of this building.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOffice of the\nMOTOR VEHICLE CONTROLLER\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MUNITIONS AND SUPPLY\nOTTAWA, CANADA\n\nJuly 31, 1945\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached application for permit to purchase a new truck submitted by Longlee Indian Mission, Longlee, Ontario.\n\nWe would appreciate your recommendation as to the essentiality of the proposed purchase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.T.

This Department is not erecting a school at Longlac.\n\nWe have a vacant school on another reserve near Longlac and it is our intention to endeavour to move this school to the Longlac Reserve. If this can be done the work will be carried out under our direction.\n\nUnder the circumstances I am returning the correspondence which you forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.T. Martin,\nAsst. Chief Permit Analyst,\nDepartment of Munitions and Supply,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 18, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ARNELL,\n\nAs I will be absent from the office until August 26, I thought it advisable to again bring to your attention the situation at Long Lac. In this connection I would refer you to Indian Agent Burk's letters of January 18, 1945, and our reply of January 25. When we wrote him at that time we were approaching the end of the fiscal year and funds were not available. Very strong pressure has been brought to bear on us to transfer this school, as it appears that there are a number of children who require education on the Long Lake Reserve. Now, if you go to Fort Arthur before I return, I hope you will find it possible to give this matter every possible consideration, and, if you can arrange for moving the school, you could send us a telegram, giving an estimate of the cost, in order that I can obtain Mr. Hoey's approval.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nNoted\nWTA\n29 Aug 45.\nOttawa, 15th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J.G.

When Father Couture visited the office he stated that approximately 60 desks would be required. Desks are manufactured at the present time in three sizes, large, medium and small. If an additional 20 desks are needed, please let me know the sizes which should be ordered.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you at an early date regarding action you have taken in moving the desks and other equipment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources Ott.\n\nReferring to your letter of October 27th, I have the honour to inform you that the new school building has been completed and is now ready for occupancy. In reply to your request that I make arrangements for the delivery of desks, I have directed Father Couture to advise you if there are any more desks required.\n\nI have also requested Father Couture to advise you if there are any more desks required.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPort Arthur, October 27th.\nOttawa, October 30, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to recognize the new two-room Indian Day School which has recently been erected for the Martin Falls Band located near Longlac.\n\nWe will allow a monthly rental of $45.00 a teaching month, effective from November 1, 1945. We intend to allow salary for two teachers and also the cost of the winter's supply of coal necessary for heating the building and the cost of caretaking.\n\nPlease consult those in charge and have the enclosed forms completed and returned.\n\nYou should let me know whether the building is being heated by wood or coal and what arrangements have been made to secure the fuel required for the coming winter.\n\nAs stated above, we are willing to allow payment for caretaking services. However, without establishing a position through the Civil Service Commission, we would not be able to allow salary over $15.00 a teaching month.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

PHELAN\n\nRe: Inspection of North Bay, Spanish, Manitoulin Island, Shingwauk Home and Longlac.\n\nThe Longlac new school is a substantial building. Unfortunately, the plan for partitioning could have been greatly improved. It was too late, however, to do anything about the classroom divisions.\n\nThe Domestic Science room is a little room, 11' x 12'. As will be noticed it is too small. I have suggested that a partition separating this room from the dispensary be removed which would leave a room 12' x 24'.\n\nThere is a good basement but it is too low, the ceiling being only 6\u00bd feet high. The lighting is, consequently, poor.\n\nThis school is not yet completed. Material and labor has been a serious handicap. Only one classroom is in operation. This produces crowding and interference as the teachers are working together. This is only a temporary arrangement and by the end of January should be remedied.\n\nThere were forty-one pupils enrolled. A number were absent due to sickness. Reverend Father Couture expects an enrolment of about sixty.\n\nMaterial to teach domestic science has been sent so that this activity may be undertaken without delay. Gardening will be introduced this summer and as the teachers remain there the whole year, I have great hopes that this activity will be a success.\n\nThere is a registered nurse who is checking the children very carefully. I understand that she also visits the people on the Reserve.\n\nI have explained to the teachers, the method of the integrated program of study and have asked them to study this system and to endeavour to introduce it gradually. The introduction must, necessarily be gradual in order that the teachers themselves may learn this line of work. I am sending them a few reference books which, I believe, will prove helpful.\n\nA.J.

Father J. Couture of Long Lac was in the office today and advised that the Long Lac Indian Day School was in real need of numerous kitchen utensils. The sister in charge gave him a list of what is required and we have made a copy of this, which you will find attached hereto. Also included in the copy is a list of items required for sewing classes and housekeeping generally. The prices indicated on the list are taken from Eaton's catalogue, enumerated from one coffee pot to four vegetable peelers, and the remainder of the list shows prices as given in Simpson's catalogue. All the items shown for sewing material are extracted from Eaton's catalogue.\n\nFather Couture has pressed upon me the necessity of having these items at the school and is quite anxious that authority for their purchase come to hand at an early date. Therefore, your attention at your earliest convenience will be greatly appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nPost Arthur, Ontario,\n15th August, 1946.\nOttawa, August 27, 1946.\n\nMr. J.U.

G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur dear pupils are working very hard in class this year. We would like to reward them at Christmas in preparing for them all a nice Christmas tree with gifts. We see in the catalogue that with $29.72, we will be able to give them that pleasure, and also $10.00 worth of candies at Longlac Store. In all, $39.72.\n\nWill you please see that we have it.\n\nI thank you in advance for the pleasure you will give to our dear Indians.\n\nYours truly,\nPORT ARTHUR, Ont.,\nOctober 9th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\nFor Welfare and Training Branch.\nLong Lake #58 I.D. School.\n\nAttached you will find two letters with lists of items requested by the above school.\n\nList marked \"#1\", showing items amounting to $29.72 is requested by the teachers as a \"reward\" for their pupils for their scholastic efforts. In addition it will be noted that authority is asked to purchase $10.00 worth of candies. Similar requests for other schools, for past years have been turned down by you, but with war restrictions relaxed, I would like to hear if such requests will now be favourably received, and in the present instance, if you approve of an expenditure of $39.72.\n\nAlso attached is a list, indicated as #2, for authority to spend $61.00 on plates, cups and utensils for the pupils' noon-day lunches. List #3, asking for authority to purchase from Eaton's various items apparently required to complete the school's kitchen's supplies. Your advice, as to authority, for these last two items will be appreciated.\n\nOwing to pressure of work here lately, it has not been possible to make copies of these lists and letters, so would you kindly return same to this office with your reply.\n\nJ.G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\nOttawa, 16 October 1946.\n\nMr. J.G. Purk, Indian Agent,\nPORT ARTHUR, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the Longlac School.\n\nWith regard to the amount requested for the proposed Christmas entertainment, you will remember that we discontinued the practice of providing funds for this purpose several years ago. While the individual amounts requested for each school might be considered, by some, as small, the total expenditure for all our schools involved a considerable amount.\n\nIn the present instance an expenditure of $39.72 is requested. If you multiply this amount by approximately 300 schools, you will readily realize that it means a heavy expenditure. However, we are in favour of having a Christmas entertainment for the pupils and it has been decided to allow an amount of $20.00 for this school provided the Indians provide a similar amount for their own children. This could be raised by having some type of entertainment in the school for which a small admission would be charged. Please discuss this suggestion with the reverend Sisters and let us hear from you again.\n\nBefore considering the amount requested for plates etc., for the pupils noon-day lunch, we would like to know what is being served. While we are willing to assist in supplying some funds for a light lunch at noon, it is felt that owing to payment of family allowances, the children should be in a better position to bring some lunch to school. Besides we do not wish the noon-day lunch to become too elaborate as it involves considerable weaning of dishes and in many cases this means a loss of time from the regular classroom work. We will wait for a further communication from you.\n\nBernard F.

We will have the permission of the Schools Branch of Indian Affairs to do this.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would find out what it will cost to move this building during the coming winter over the ice. It is noted that a previous estimate was $305.00. This estimate was given in 1945 and circumstances may have changed so that it would be of no value at this time.\n\nMay we have a report by next fall on this matter and your recommendation so if anything is to be done, arrangements can be made in plenty of time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nV.L.

Toilet Soap\n- 5 cases Paper Towels\n- 2 Paper Towel Cabinets\n- 5,000 Victor Drinking Cups\n- 1 Holder for Victor Cups\n- 2 Floor Brushes\n\nWith reference to the desks, there are three sizes, large, medium and small. Please let me know which size is required.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nReferring to your letter of 31st July, on the subject of school desks at the Long Lake Indian Day School, we were informed by the Principal that 12 large and 6 medium size desks will meet their requirements.\n\nThe Principal has also drawn my attention to the fact that last school term they were not in receipt of any neatly biscuits. We understand these biscuits were in short supply last year, but it is expected that a surplus will be made available this year for this school inasmuch as they received none last year. The estimated number of pupils to be in attendance this coming term is 50.\n\nWe were in receipt of a monthly authorization to spend \u00a39.00 on supplies for the children's noon-day lunch for this school during the last term. The Principal has asked that this be increased, as the attendance will be larger, and the items cost more. We have told the Principal that there is doubt that there will be any increase over the \u00a39.00 in view of the fact that parents can supplement this amount through their family allowance benefits, but would welcome having your views on this matter.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Departmental Purchasing Agent will be requested to secure the desks for the Long Lac School.\n\nNine hundred pounds of vitaminized biscuits have been ordered for this school. They will probably be delivered during the month of September.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it is considered that the amount previously allowed, namely $8.00 a month for the noon-day lunch should be sufficient. As you state, Family Allowances are being paid for the children attending this school and it is reasonable to suppose that the parents will be financially able to supply some lunch for their children.\n\nLast May we forwarded you an accountable cheque for $500.00 to be spent on road repairs leading from the Long Lac School to the highway. Has this work been done and if so, is it satisfactory?\n\nBernard T.

Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 17, 1947.\n\nMr. J.C. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing an account from Moyer School Supplies for desks shipped to the Longlac Indian Day School.\n\nIn your letter you referred to P.O. 22252. In this case, I would point out that the purchase order number was issued to Vilas Furniture Company, Cowansville, Quebec. Evidently, they delivered the eighteen desks as you forwarded voucher No. 1059 dated October 19, 1947 and a cheque for $274.50 has been forwarded to the company. We have no record of having issued a Purchase Order for desks to the Moyer School Supply Company.\n\nBernard P.J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nColonel Murray:\n\nLonglac (R.C.) Day School:\n\nThis school was visited by me on Nov. 10, the Monday preceding the Remembrance Day holiday. The teachers stated that Monday was usually a day of low attendance and, coming between holidays, Monday, Nov. 10 achieved a new low - 28 out of the enrollment of 50.\n\nThe principal emphasized that the allowance of $8 a month lunch money was inadequate. I suggest that it be raised to $10 effective Nov. 47.\n\nShe also expressed disappointment at the curtailing of requisitions.\n\nTime permitted only a superficial inspection, but I got the impression that it was a creditable school. It is easily accessible to visitors, being close to the main line of the C.N.R. and to Highway No. 11 from Toronto.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\n\nWT8\n\n1.

I inquired from Mr. Allan whether there was any report, but Mr. Allan did not know.\n\nDr. Moore said he had Bishop Landry, Monseigneur Lambert and Father Couture in his office, speaking on behalf of Mr. Burk, stating what a good job he was doing and what a vast territory he had to cover with so little assistance in his office. They were most anxious to know whether something was being done to improve things at this agency.\n\nI phoned Mr. Orr and told him I was inquiring in your absence. He informed me that he had not yet come to any definite conclusions in regard to the Port Arthur Agency, as he had been working on the western agencies, but that the matter would receive consideration in due course. He intimated that it would be decided either to take some of Mr. Burk's Agency away from him and put it into another agency, or give him additional help. I gave this information to Dr. Moore.\n\nWhile in his office these gentlemen mentioned that there was a school at Martin's Falls (Anglican) which was closed and they wished to have the school transported across the river to Long Lac Reserve to be used as a Clinic and an old people's home. Dr. Moore informed them that he would do whatever work was required to alter the school for the purpose and operate it as a clinic, but that the maintenance of old people was a Welfare matter which would have to be taken up with the Indian Affairs. Dr. Moore asked me to bring this to your attention. I believe that you already have been approached in regard to having the school used as a Clinic.\n\nM. Walton.\nFebruary 12, 1948.\n\nMr. J.O. Burk, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nHis Excellency, Bishop Landry and Father Couture recently discussed with Dr. Moore the possibility of moving the school at Martins Falls to the vicinity of the Long Lac School to be used as a clinic and old peoples' home at the latter place.\n\nIn the event of our approving the removing of this school, the Department of National Health and Welfare is prepared to provide the funds for moving it.\n\nPlease advise me at once if you consider that such action is desirable and you might comment on the suggestion that the building be used partly as an old people's home. I may say that I have not yet discussed this phase of the proposition with the Welfare Division.\n\nIs there any likelihood that Martins Falls school will be required for school purposes in the immediate future?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nPP/IVCD\nPort Arthur Indian Agency.\n\nFebruary 23, 1948.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Superintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant,\nfile 9-18-5 (L.l), I do not see any possibility of using\nthe school at Martine Falls for the purpose for which\nit was originally intended and I think it would be ad-\nvisable to move it to Long Lac to be used as a clinic.\n\nJ.G. Burk,\nSuperintendent of Indian Agency.\nLonglac, Feb. 25, 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe old school will start moving across the ice of Long Lake on Monday the first day of March. I suppose that you know already that the contract for pulling that school across the lake has been given for $1,500.00 fifteen hundred dollars, and so the contract will be fulfilled before the end of next week. That is before Saturday the 6th of March.\n\nSo we would need the money to pay that contractor at that date Saturday the 6th of March.\n\nNow why is it that Mr. Burk instead of getting a contract for himself, came to Longlac and took my contract as his own and then raised the price? I do not know, I was not here yet at the moment. I did not intend to give so much myself on account of this, that I had good friends here who would furnish the contractor with big tractors and men and drivers, cables and tools, etc. So now the transportation of that building costs me $1,500.00 which is supposed to be paid by the Department.\n\nI have paid already $450.00 to the contractor to help him pay 15 men.\n\nYour very gratefully,\n\n(Signed) J.M. Couture, S.J.\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 8, 1948\n\nDear Father Couture:\n\nWe have been asked by Mr. Philip Phelan to answer your letter dated February 25 regarding the moving of the school across the Lake.\n\nThe Minister has approved the project provided it be limited to providing the building free, plus the money to cover its removal not to exceed $2500.\n\nIt is therefore in order to move the building. All accounts should be forwarded to Mr. Burk, the Superintendent of Indian Agency at Port Arthur, as quickly as possible so that payment may be made promptly.\n\nI do hope the removal of this building will help you in your work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nO.

However, the carpenters who are building the church are ready to make three of the sizes we need, that is:\n\n1. 10 ft x 6 ft in length\n   7\" x 6\" in height\n   24 inches in width\n\n2. 4 ft. in length\n   10 feet in height\n   24 inches in width\n\n3. 5 feet in length\n   7 feet in height\n   24 inches in width.\n\nTheir charge would be \u00a3300. Will you kindly grant us the authorization to have this work started as soon as possible as we would like to have these cupboards finished by the month of September.\n\nWill you also be kind enough to buy a sewing machine for the school as one is not enough to teach all our big girls. Another reason for making this request is that many young women on the reserve very often come to make their trousseau dresses, etc., and they are sorry they cannot sew two together as they very seldom come alone.\n\nAwaiting a favourable reply and thanking you for your kind attention to these request, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Sister Mary Saint Martha\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from the Missionary Sister at Longlao Indian Day School, which is self-explanatory.\n\nWe pay a monthly rental at this school, and I am not familiar with the regulations concerning the teacher's requisition regarding the building of permanent cupboards, and the purchase of a sewing machine for the class room.\n\nWould you kindly advise if authorization can be obtained to carry out this work.\n\nJ.G.

It is not a Departmentally owned school but was erected and is owned by the Bishop of Hearst. It was built in 1945 and it is unfortunate that a proper plan was not followed. Both the classrooms are on the ground floor and are poorly lighted. Each has four windows on the outside facing with all placed high in the wall. There are four electric light fixtures in the ceiling and these provide at least a little light. The rooms are wider than longer in relation to the blackboards.\n\nThere is a teacher's residence for the Sisters on the second floor of the school. Photographs are attached to this report. We pay a rental of $45 a month for the building.\n\nTeachers\n\n(a) Junior Room - Sister Mary of the Redemption has a first class teaching certificate from the Province of Quebec and has eleven years experience. I observed a handicap less on and noted an air of mild confusion with pupils wandering rather freely around the classroom. The teacher's language is fairly good but the French accent is decided.\n\n(b) Senior Room - There are only 13 children in this room whereas there are 18 children in the junior room. In fact there are hardly enough children to operate two classrooms.\n\nSister St. Martha is not a qualified teacher but has natural ability and experience to handle this class well. They treated quite highly; her discipline and control are good; her manner is pleasant and the class obviously likes her and were\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Rev.

I did not consider it necessary to make any special arrangements sufficiently to enable me to bring correctly the bishop's letter and to be able to do so without any delay or expense.\n\nI am obliged to teach Catholicism at the same time. Can the school be occupied as a church for three or four days at a time, when no school can be held? In whom is authority regarding this matter vested? I am unable to do so without the teacher's assistance.\nI would respectfully ask for instructions as to what reply to make hereinafter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nAt the request of Rev. Mr. Jennings, Pastor of the St. Joseph's Indian School, I have the honor to forward herewith a communication just received from him, regarding the instructions of the Fathers, which state that it is their intention to teach the Indian children the Catholic religion and prayers of the Roman Catholic Church in the Indian language during school hours, contrary to the Bishop's directions and wishes, and in opposition to the Inspector's instructions that the children were to be taught English only.\n\nRev. Jennings also objects to the school being confined to the Church for three or four days at a time, when he considers it should be held.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 16th March, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a letter from Mr. Benjamin Sweeney, school teacher, in which he complains of the influence of Rev. Father Pierson that the catechism and prayers of the Roman Catholic Church shall be taught the children in the English language, and also objecting to the use of the church for two or three days at a time for church purposes. In reply I beg to say that the council would like you to communicate with Father Richard and obtain a report from him in regard to the matters referred to by Mr. Sweeney. I will forward this report as soon as received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nH. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTantawaning, Ont.\nWawomihowg, April 28th 1856\n\n198017\n\nM. H. Ross, J. S. [signature]\n\nWawomihowg, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour two letters, 214 1/2 and 162 1/2, remained in the post office at Little Current till last Monday, and reached me only yesterday. In reply to 162 1/2, dated March 24th, re the Supanack School, I beg to say that if Mr. Benjamin Sheezy would teach the children the catechism in English, I would join no fault with his teaching; but the fact is that the gentleman had been abroad over a year in the Supanack school, and had not\nI thought yet a word of catechism. All he had done for the religious training of the children was to make them say a very few short prayers in English at the opening and at the closing of the day's school work. He acknowledged that he could not teach the children catechism in English, for they do not know English. Then I insisted that he should make them repeat morning and evening prayer in English and in Indian, or in Indian only, if he chose, one chapter only of a short English-Catechism Catechism, of which I will give you a copy by to-day's mail.\n\nIf you refer to the other which Mr. Sweeney wrote to...\nover a year ago applying for the Sagamook School, and which I sent you at that time, you will notice that the gentleman states that some knowledge which he has of the Indian language might make him the more competent to teach an Indian school. I have taught Mr. [illegible] read sufficiently well the Indian translation of the English Catechism, and I surely ask no more of him than what he can do.\n\nMoreover I do not remember having ever interfered with Mr. [illegible] school, when attending to the spiritual wants of the Indians. I do not consider that I have done anything out of\nout of the way, when on a few weekdays I have used early in the morning and late in the evening for Church purposes in a Catholic village, a schoolhouse that was in great part, if I am well informed, paid off by the Indians among that race. Surely Mr. Swezey, the teacher, did not object, but on the contrary courteously offered the schoolhouse and kindly helped.\n\nHoping that the above explanations will prove satisfactory,\n\nYours very truly,\nJ.R. Richard\n15-1723\n\n198017\n\nMr. O'Keefe, Penetanguishene,\n\n4th June, 1896.\n\n---\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nP. M.

O'Keefe\nOttawa, 25th May, 1891.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 162-6 of the 4th instant, enclosing one from the Rev. Father Richard replying to the complaint of Mr. Benjamin Sweezy, teacher of the Saginaw School, that the reverend gentleman has been insisting on him teaching a catechism of the Roman Catholic Church in the Indian language and at times using the school building for religious services.\n\nAfter considering the matter the Department has come to the conclusion that the Rev. Father Richard has no right to use any compulsion to enforce religious teaching. No provision is made in the program of studies for such teaching and therefore it is a matter which must be arranged between the priest and the teacher.\n\nI am good enough to inform Mr. Sweezy and Father Richard accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The reason\nfor this is due to my current responsibilities. I am engaged in\nteaching at the school, which requires my full attention.\n\nI believe that teaching is an important aspect of my life,\nand I am committed to fulfilling my duties. Despite the\nchallenges, I am confident that I am doing my best to\nmake a positive impact on the students.\n\nI hope that you understand my situation and\nappreciate my dedication to my work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs & School Files\nVol. 10, File 654-1, Part 1\nI have written that I am...

Having Sagamok on Fridays about noon, and some times coming back only to teach on Monday afternoon; they say also \"often becomes late only to teach three or four days in the week,\" and... he refuses to teach children of 7 years.\n\nAnd they say that they wish to have another teacher.\n\nKnowing the Indians as you may, dear sir, you surely understand that now it would be useless for you to remain. Consequently I will inform the Department and appoint somebody else for the reopening of school.\n\nHoping that you will find some other suitable situation. Remain, Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord.\n\nJ.-A. Miller\nThe Indian Department\n\nTo the proper official in charge of Indian Affairs\n\nI have been informed by the latest circular from the Secretary of State that the teaching of the Indian Language will be discontinued after the present school year. I am therefore writing to express my concern regarding this decision.\n\nI believe that the teaching of the Indian Language is an important aspect of our education system and should not be discontinued. I urge you to reconsider this decision and to continue the teaching of the Indian Language.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSchools\n\nJuly 13, 1898\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that the schoolteacher of Sagamingo, Mr. Smith, wishes to resign saying that he has engaged with a certain woman for a year and that he is leaving the school. He further says that there is another competent teacher teaching to the end of this month, or until you can send a suitable teacher to replace her.\n\nKindly let me know whether you would approve of giving Mr. Smith every chance of showing what she can do, avoiding by that means the inconvenience of a vacancy, or whether I have to find out a new teacher which is always very difficult in this time of the year.\n\nFor the School of Portage Bay, a certain Mr. Smith was recommended by one of the inspectors will likely be ready for the first of June, although he does not yet give me his last word.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

G. R. Atkin, Superior of Missions in Algoma. His name is Peter Taylor. He is a married man.\n\nIt is hard to get teachers to stay at Sahgamook; it is about 10 miles from any white people. I find a great difference between teachers who are taught to teach and those who are not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Hagan, Indian agent\nSherralon\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indians Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 27th August, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nIn my letter of the 23rd instant I beg you to consider circumstances described therein in connection with the temporary appointment of Mr. [Name], teacher of the Indian school at [Place].\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThessalon, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI will have good competent teachers ready for Sagamore for the next school year. But it will be only on the condition that the necessary articles of furniture will be bought there before the end of July. The house may want some repairs (which you may ascertain by visiting the place at your earliest opportunity), and there should be a good cooking-stove large enough to warm the place in the winter, a bed, book-shelf, armchair, and a fan-chair.\n\nPlease interest yourself in the matter, to have all things ready on time. If the building is made comfortable enough, I made such arrangements with a society of teachers, so to be sure of continuous teaching in our missions.\n\nYour servant in the Lord,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman of Missions and Principal of Sagamore School\nIndian Office\n\nAugust 17th, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Smith, Superintendent of Missions, and Principal of Indian School at Athabasca, which letter I enclose and you can see what that gentleman proposes for the advancement of Indian schools.\n\nOf course I could not promise the Hon. Gentleman anything but to lay the matter before the Department which I now take the liberty of doing.\n\nI also am informed that there are teachers who are speaking in the New Guinea, and a Society of Ladies who are raising money for them. If they are not British subjects, I do not wish to hire them, as we have enough teachers who are loyal Canadians.\n\nI have written to the gentlemen in regard to the nationality of his candidates.\n\nI hope I have not been out of place in addressing you.\n\nSamuel Hagen\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary to the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nReceived yesterday a letter from Mr. John Hagen of Hamilton asking me whether the ladies appointed to teach the schools at Elliot and Seguin are British subjects. It happens that one is, and another one is not.\n\nI wish to explain to you Department how I am obliged to be sure and have always competent teachers for all our Indian Schools. Many years ago my predecessor engaged the services of a Society of teaching ladies for the Industrial School at Wiikumikong (name of the girls). This was the same society that now agreed to take care of our Indian day schools. Last year they took Wiikumikong and Smith Bay, and this year they take also Mat. Bay and Seguin, with the intention of taking the other ones following.\n\nThis Society has members and houses in England, in Ireland, in France, in the United States, in Quebec etc., etc. Its members belong to all nationalities. They are sent by their presidents to the different places according to the needs of such places and the abilities of the subjects.\n\nHere at Wiikumikong they give good satisfaction very early, and they are well liked by the Indians. The experience...\nof last year at Wikwemikong and South Bay prove that their manner of teaching and of dealing with the Indians is doing an immense good to these people. They go two by two, and the one who is not in charge of the school visits the families, particularly the sick, and spreads gently among them the benefits of a true Christian civilization.\n\nWith them there is no danger of seeing any more long interruptions caused by the departure of one teacher and the difficulty of finding another one. Should one be obliged to retire, another one shall be sent at once to take his place.\n\nYour Department is aware of the extreme difficulty, if not the total impossibility of finding competent teachers and study for these missions. The history of the past shows that other teachers, if coming at all, do not remain; and often it becomes necessary to take young novices with no real competency to fill the position rather than to give any proper teaching. It was so much the fact that before the... of the new arrangement I was of opinion that the day-schools were a failure, and that all the money spent for them was lost.\n\nConsequently, for the benefit of the Indians I ask you, dear Sir, to approve officially my doing... grant me the liberty to appoint any lady of this Society, no matter what may be her nationality. I may add that, if it was necessary for these ladies to be British subjects, they are ready...\nTo undergo all required formalities to become such and be able to devote themselves to the education of the Indians.\n\nPlease, dear Sir, answer with no delay, as it is time to start teaching at once.\n\nYour servant in the Lord,\n\nG. A. Oertel\n\nSignature of R. C. Moirano.\nI have a lady teacher at Sackville who I think would be very good. She is well recommended by Rev. Mr. Wilson. Furthermore, she also has a good command of the language and her methods, which I know are very good. She is recommended by Rev. Mr. Wilson. Miss Morgan again teaching at Spanish River and Miss Hammond in Leechville at Leechville also have no teachers yet at Cullitton, we could not get a teacher there for a teacher to come but Miss Morgan is doing very well. I think when our new school house is finished, we will have less trouble. The coming of the teacher at Sackville is Elizabeth A. Smith.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\n[Signature]\n\nHarriet Wagan\nOTTAWA, 27th September, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss Elizabeth A. Lonsdale to take charge of the school and Miss Markle to be teacher of the school at Kiarissouka.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nActing Secretary\n\nSamuel Hage, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon,\nOnt.\nOTTAWA, 27th September, 1873\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th ultimo I have to say that in view of your explanations the Department approves of the appointment of sisters belonging to the Society of Teaching Ladies to take charge for this year of the schools at Fort Bay and Sagamook but it could always prefer, where possible, that such appointments should be British subjects.\n\nSince the receipt of your letter above referred to Mr. A. Smith reports that Miss Eliza Lomach is the lady teacher recommended by you and that Miss Erskine recommended by Mr. Smith is in charge of the school at Inissauagamish that Miss Morley is again teaching at Lamoreaux, Spanish River and Miss Macdonald at Thessalon and that no teacher has as yet been furnished for Cutler on account of the difficulty in obtaining suitable accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I may say I have had no communication with her since she did not answer my letter and finally I heard of the lady quitting here to take up elsewhere and if so I send her everything school books and any school material she may ask for.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOctober 24, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is advised that Miss Rose Fagan, formerly teacher of the Wikwemikonging school, has been transferred to the Sagamook school. From a requisition recently received it would appear that there has been an exchange of positions between Miss Fagan and Miss Francis.\n\nThere is nothing on the file pertaining to either of these schools to show that this exchange was authorized by the Department, and I would like to know whether you have reported the transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

She has also bought cotton and the ladies make clothes for themselves. I might also add that she has the largest school in my agency.

It is now called St. Joseph's Cathedral.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSamuel Hagan,\nIndian Agent.\nMiss Fagan was given a salary of $400.00 on the 1st of April, 1911, and I would recommend that she be granted an increase to $450.00 from the 1st of April, next.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Agent Hagan in his monthly report on the Sagamook Indian Day School states that he does not think that we can retain the services of the teacher, Miss Fagan, unless we grant her an increase of $50.00 in salary.\n\nMiss Fagan is one of our best Indian teachers and has had eight years' experience. She is a graduate of a Roman Catholic institution in Buffalo and there are other members of this Order teaching in our Indian schools on the North Shore and Manitoulin Island. They are most enthusiastic and devoted teachers.\n\nThe reports on Miss Fagan's work are highly commendatory, not only is her class-room work efficient but she teaches domestic science, including sewing and cooking, to the girls. Samples of the sewing done by the children of this school were lately submitted to the Department and were very creditable. I may here mention that at several of these schools there are two Sisters engaged, although the Department only pays a salary for one, and this is one of those schools.\nOttawa, February 28, 1912.\n\nMadam\u2014\n\nAs a recognition of your services as teacher of the Sagamook Indian School the Department has decided to grant you an increase in salary of $50.00 from the first of April, next.\n\nThe reports upon your work received from the Public School Inspector and from the Agent, Mr. Hagan, are most satisfactory.\n\nIn July, 1910, you submitted to the Department a most interesting report upon your work at this school and I may say that general reports on your work at intervals will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Rose A.

There are some of the people who live near the school are telling of sending their children to the school at Marquis Station, which if they do it will almost close the present school.

If all the children could be accommodated then the question of closing the Sagamook School could be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, November 26, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to the requisition for school supplies sent in by Miss Rose Pagan, teacher of the Sagamook Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department is in communication with the Principal of the Spanish River Industrial School with a view to having the Sagamook children placed there, if there is room. As soon as a reply is received from him the Department will be in a position to know whether this school is to be continued or not.

She also mentions that there are only two pupils registered at the school.\n\nWe do not want our school closed or to lose our teacher. There are at present 14 pupils registered.\n\nWe have heard that the school will be closed regularly and that some have been sick. We hope that the school will remain open and that the children will be able to attend regularly.\n\nWe do not understand why this school should be closed and we urge that it be kept open, where there has been but two children attending, and there are at least six or seven here every day.\nThe reason we have for not sending our children to the Industrial School is that we wish to keep our school open, since the school here was built for the education of the children.\n\nIn another year or two there will be several more here, old enough to attend.\n\nKindly let us have an answer to this letter as soon as possible.

You will remember that that for the Sagamoose school I understand was given the Inspector who was doing excellent work there. But the difficulty is part of the twenty-two children the Indians promised to send live three miles away.\n\nThe children from Salomea I will take to here well as I am along from Monday morning till Friday night.\nI think I can board them for a week though I can't board them for a week. I hope you will allow me to try for a short time. I do still make a success.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSubject: 73761\n\nThe Innu Nation has requested us to assist them in the re-opening of their school.

The school itself is in perfect order, and is fully capable of accommodating this number. Further than this, every arrangement is on hand for the reception of a teacher, including housekeeping requirements and wood for heating purposes. There is a strong feeling on the reserve that a teacher should, if possible, be supplied.\n\nI also learned that the school situated on the bank of the Spanish River was seldom open for scholars, there being only two who occasionally attend. The Anglican Church minister at Mawney is, I believe, being paid the sum of $450 per annum for teaching this school, and in my opinion it would seem advisable to either have the school regularly open or completely closed, in view of the above circumstances.\n\nThe local Indians have a rooted objection to sending their children to the Catholic College at Spanish, claiming that the young boys and girls return from there with very little education, having been for the most of the time occupied while there\nat school in the uplifting process of sawing wood\nand doing chores.\n\nHenry J. Bury\nOttawa, October 14, 1915.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter asking for the re-opening of the Sagamook Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is making inquiries in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Joe Bob,\nSagamook Indian Reserve,\nMassey Station, Ont.\nOttawa, November 30, 1915.\n\nMr. Benson:\n\nWith reference to the question of re-opening the school at Sagamook, I beg to say that I made inquiries when in that vicinity on my recent trip and do not consider that the Department would be warranted in opening the school this year.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were quite a number of Indian families resident on the reserve but their permanency is problematical. Some of them will leave for shanties or hunting during the winter. I saw Father Ren\u00e9aud their parish priest and he thought that it would be better if they would send their children to the Industrial school at Spanish. For the present I would recommend that the school remain closed and that Agent Hagan be advised that the parents should send their children to Spanish.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, December 2, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter asking for the re-opening of the Sagamook Indian school I beg to say that as a result of the inquiries made it has been decided not to re-open this school at present and any children of school age on the reserve might be sent to the Spanish River Industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I found about 14 children there, but there is not more than 8 who would attend. Some of the children live 10 miles from the school. The reserve is very large and the people are scattered all over it.

They are very happy there. Miss Anna is teaching at Whitefish Lake because the school is burnt and the head department seems not proper. It is winter now and I am sure she does not teach at Whitefish Lake.

I would recommend that the teacher of Sagamook Indian School should have more salary in fact she deserves the highest salary of any teacher among agency all the other schools are more civilized country but this teacher as her salary is not enough person is very handsome, and it takes a girl of striking stuff to stand it.

The teacher is certainly doing her best but the parents of the children do not assist her as they should.\n\nNumber that should attend 28\nNumber on roll 12\nAverage attendance 5\nOttawa, July 6, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Sagamook Indian school for the month of June, last, in which you state that the teacher is certainly doing her best, but the parents of the children do not assist her as they should, I have to ask you to be good enough to state in what way the parents fail to assist the teacher.\n\nIn your report you state that the number of pupils that should attend this school is 25 and the number on the roll 12, with an average attendance of 8.\n\nThe Department considers that there should be a larger enrolment and average attendance at this school and I have to ask you to be good enough to state the name of a suitable Indian to act as truant officer and also what salary he would expect for this work. His duties would commence after the summer holidays. I am sending you herewith a copy of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children, in sections 5, 6 and 7 of which the duties of truant officers are set forth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I was on my way to Sagamook to pay the school a visit, and at Brantford met the chief of the Spanish Band, and he told me the school was not open, of course, I met Mr. Father Papeau, and he told me this teacher was sick and would have to undergo an operation and so could not take the school. But he had an excellent teacher in view and if he could get him, he would let me know at once. This is about 8 days ago and I have had no report from his Rev. but\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hogan\nIndian Agent\nThornbury\n\nThe Secretary Department\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSeptember 20, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, in which you state that the Sagamook school is not open yet and that Father Papineau told you that Mrs. Teshen, who was appointed to take charge of this school, was sick and would have to undergo an operation and so could not take the school and that he had an excellent teacher in view and, if he could get her, would let you know.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if Mrs. Teshen is unable to take charge of this school, another teacher should be secured as soon as possible.

The influence is still prevalent in this vicinity and think that probably is the reason I have not heard from him. If all is well I will be going down to Spanish Reserve in a few days and I will try and get his advice and will be back again in the matter. I may see him when I am at Massapeag as I understand he is often there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hogan\nIndian Agent\nTheresalon\n\nFebruary 7th, 1919\nMarch 12, 1919\n\nMr. Samuel Hogan,\nDwelling: [illegible]\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA few days ago, you told me on the train that the Injunook school could be opened if a teacher could be found.\n\nI received yesterday an application.

I went there today to see what was going on.\n\nThere are about eleven children there that are large enough to come to school and the rest of them are too small.\n\nWhen we knew that the school was going to start here this summer, I took 20 men with me from here to make a road close along the shore to Toulouse's Bay, to be used by the school children from here, which is about a mile and half distance from this school house, and when the Toulouses done, not one of the men help us to make this road.\n\nI heard just today that they want a school to be started at their place.\n\nI don't want another school house a mile and half from the other.\nThe Indians here are determined that there won't be no school at Sourlouk Bay. They got to send their children to school here. Some of the children that are attending school here every day they come over a mile and half and they get before nine. Why can't Sourlouk do the same? There are 16 children attending school now. They will be eight tomorrow.

The Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Rothera in the matter and requesting him to enforce the compulsory regulations regarding the attendance of these children.\n\nIt is not the intention to conduct a school at Toulouse Bay, as it is considered that all the children from that point are near enough to the present day school to attend. The Department is pleased to note that there is such a good attendance of children at the day school, and I have to thank you for the interest you are taking in the education of the Indian children on your reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAsst.

He states that there are about eleven children who are old enough to attend school. The Chief further states that he had a road made along the shore to Toulouse Bay, to be used by the school children from that point, which is about one and a half miles distant from the school. He states that the reason that these children do not attend is that their parents want another school house opened for them.\n\nIt is not the intention of the Department to conduct another school as it is considered that the children at this point are near enough to the Sagamook Day School to attend regularly. I have to request that you will see these Indians and inform them that it is imperative that their children of school age and in good health will attend school every day it is open. If they refuse, the Department will have to consider the enforcing of the compulsory regulations and place their children in a residential school.\n\nI will be pleased, after you have had an opportunity to investigate the matter, if you will furnish a full report stating your views as to whether you would advise that the children be placed in a residential school or whether the parents will see that they attend the day school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

Rothera\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Chief of Spanish River Band (no. 2) came over to see me yesterday and report that Louie Assenabe went over to see you at Thessalon, so there would be a school house at Touleme Bay, and he is being paid by the Indians to do this work.\n\nWhat right has he got about this, and the two chiefs not knowing it?\n\nChief Louis Solomon\n\nI gave this to the Indian Agent when she was here today.\nSpanish River Band Sagamook March 28/22\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\n\nI beg leave to say about the matter of the school.\n\nThat the Touleuses don't want to send their children to school. I have seen their children way out on the ice fishing, six or seven miles from their home, and some times the Touleuses take their boys along trapping way up north thirty or forty miles up.\n\nI have told them many times that they should send their children to school, they live only one mile and three quarters from the school house.\n\nI wrote to the Indian Agent many times about this, and when he comes here he stays about half an hour, he is in a hurry to get back though he would help me so all should send their children to school.\n\nI have heard that the Touleuses offered money to those that will assist them, so they will be given a school house.\n\nWhy they are some children at Touleuse Bay that a man lives there that has many children.\nand he don't belong to this reserve, if he wants his children educated he's got to take them to the reserve where he belongs.\n\nSome of the children that are attending school now they live over two and half miles from the school house. This school house is right in the middle of the Touloures' town on the east side and the old... on the west side. I will give you the drawing of it.\n\n[Handwritten diagram with labels such as \"school house,\" \"Touloures' village,\" \"children attending school,\" etc.]\nAnd Mr. the two Chiefs of this reserve determined not to have another school house at Coulson Bay. It's enough there two school houses going on the Reserve. And there are many children at the boarding school, at the Industrial School at Spanish. Clearly all the money that belongs to this reserve would be spent only for school houses. This school house is large enough for all these children.\n\nX Chief Louis Solomon of Spanish River Band No. 1.\nX Chief John Pah'twe'witing of Spanish River Band No. 2.\n\nSir,\n\nSome of the children that are attending at Spanish River day school lives over three miles; I don't see why can the Coulson's do the same to attend school.\n\nChief John Pah'twe'witing\nOTTAWA, April 4th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Rose Chaput, teacher of the Sagamook Indian Day School, and from Chief Louis Solomen and John Pahtwewitung, regarding the agitation which is being carried on by certain of the Indians of the Spanish River Band who reside at Toulouse Bay for the establishment of a school at that point on the grounds that they reside too far away for their children to attend the Sagamook school.\n\nWe are informing the teacher that it is not the intention of the Department to provide school facilities at Toulouse Bay, as it is considered that the children from this point can attend Sagamook school.\n\nThe teacher is also being informed that she should intimate to all concerned that, if the children do not attend regularly, the question of having them sent to residential schools will have to be considered. The children residing at Toulouse Bay have no further distance to travel than some of the other children residing in the opposite direction from the school.\n\nIt is stated that an Indian of the name of Louis Assenabe is the main agitator, acting on behalf of the Indians residing at Toulouse Bay.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit, you should definitely inform the Indians residing at Toulouse Bay that it is not the intention to establish a school for the benefit of their children, and also that it is expected they will see that their children of school age attend the Sagamook school, and if they refuse to send them steps will be taken to have the children placed in residential schools of the denomination to which they belong.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is considered that the children can attend Sagamook school, and the parents should understand, if the children do not so attend, that steps will be taken to place them in residential schools.\n\nIt is hoped that, through the efforts of Chief Louis Solomen and yourself, these Indians will see that their children attend regularly.\n\nYou may inform Chief Louis Solomen and the Indians accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Fortrose Bay question in a school, by date, but on the 25th March visited the school at Sagamok or near Chapel. The teacher told me of the report of Louis Cook. I drove over to the Bay and saw one of the Indians there, the other was away. I told him that the children need not attend at Sagamok & that if not, I would punish them for not doing so.\n\nI am convinced now of these men, but he did not mention the school question & I think maybe the Chiefs thought he had been too nice in this matter.\n\nShould endeavor to have these people attend, just now the roads are very bad.

Mclean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Potton,\nIndian Agent,\nTheesalon, Ont.\nI'm writing this letter to you because I want you to know how I feel about making all the parents send their children to school. Last year I couldn't make them all come.\n\nI wrote many times to the Indian Agent about it, but he never showed up, and then I wrote to Dept. and then he got a letter from there and he was told to force the children to attend school, and then he never did anything.\n\nThe Toultoures didn't want to send their children to school, some of them said, \"I'll do with my children as I like.\" I went to Massay many times to see Edward Besaw the constable for this reserve to help me to make the Toultoures send their children to school, he never did anything. He gets paid from the funds of this reserve, he ought to do something if there was trouble, he wouldn't know it he lives so far and no telephone here.\n\nBesaw only comes here when he brings the Indian Agent. The last time he was here when the Indian Agent was distributing the annuity... may be it would be better a constable to live right on the reserve.\nIt's about a mile and half from this school house to Toulouse Bay along the shore. Last summer I took men from here to make a little road to Toulouse Bay close along the shore to make it shorter. I only did this for the Toulouse children to use it when they come to school. We didn't finish it through we went over halfway. I told the Toulouses to start from their place to make this little road on that same day we work and they didn't want to do that. and it goes as far as we made it. It's the Toulouses that should have work here.\n\nAn early answer to this letter will greatly oblige.\n\nChief Louis Solomon\nMassey, P.O.,\nSagamok,\nOntario\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, regarding the alleged failure of the Indians at Toulouse Bay to send their children to school and to assist in the road-making.\n\nThis matter is being referred to Mr. Agent Rothera, and it is hoped that in the future better cooperation will result, not only in school matters but in general conditions on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Louis Solomon,\nMassey P. O.,\nSagamok, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the department is in receipt of a communication from Chief Louis Solomon of Massay, complaining that the Toulouse Bay Indians are not causing their children to attend school regularly and that Edward Beaw, the Constable and Trust Officer, is not assisting any in this connection. The Chief also reports that the Toulouse Bay Indians failed to assist in some road-making. The Department has acknowledged his letter and is referring the matter to you for a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nO. P. Mothers, Sec.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn regard to the children of Fortescue Bay attending school regularly at Sagamook, I beg to report that I have travelled over the road from Fortescue Bay to the school which is a distance of over 5 miles by the summer road, and over 3 miles across the bay in the winter time.\n\nI spoke to Rev. Father Dugas missionary to the Indians in this matter, and he has been able to use his influence to have the children attend the school, but he is of the opinion that Sagamook is too far from the schoolhouse, especially during the winter when the ice has broken, it is a bleak, cold journey across the bay.\n\nThe Indians are not working on the land doing athletic labor. The chief & committee at their meeting made a resolution that all Indians living on the Reserve, except do athletic labor or those not doing it would be charged $2 per day the same to be taken from their annuity money. The chief gave me a list of those who did not work, and deducted that amount from their annuity.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nThessalon\n\nSept 21, 1922\nIndian Affairs, School Files\nRG 10, Volume 6183, File 454-L, part 1\n\n[Handwritten text not legible]\nOttawa, April 4th, 1923.\n\nMiss L.

There is a school on the Reserve and recommend the placing of a teacher at this point and find out whether it would be profitable for the children to go. Building a school Sagamore is at the expense and if the Reserve or there are only a few families residing in that vicinity, the distance is too far for children to attend during the winter - spring months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.B.

Mr. C. F. Rothery, Indian Agent, Thessalon, Ont., in August last, recommended that the Department purchase the old school building from the Spanish River Company, Outler, who had lumber and other material therein in the erection of the school and teacher's residence on the Serpent River Reserve. A new school building at Sagamook on the Spanish River Reserve, he stated there was sufficient material in this building still lying for the purpose, and he was requested to endeavor to arrange with the above Company for the purchase of the building. If he is able to secure this building, steps will be taken early next Spring to have it taken down and the lumber used in the erection of the schools above mentioned.\n\nThe sketch which you enclosed showing the location of the present school and where you would recommend the new school erected has been noted. Before the new school building at Sagamook is erected next Spring, every consideration will be given to seeing that it is built on a site central to meet the needs of the children on the Reserve.

As appropriations being so greatly reduced, instructions have been issued to not re-open any schools this year.

The Priest has asked Mrs Southwind to start the new comers at her home.\n\nThe school has been closed for over three years on account of the children not attending; of course they will be a number ready to go now, but the school is situated at a point where there are very few Indians living. If the school is reopened would you recommend that it be opened in the summer months only, it being too far for the little ones to walk in the autumn and winter.\n\nAt present the river is not opened to launch the snow and the roads are not fit to drive or over the reserve, but as soon as they are will go to Sagamok and look into the matter and make a report of the feasibility of starting the school again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 10th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the request of the Spanish River Band for the reopening of the Sagamook Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department hopes to be able to build a new school this summer.

Wallace, M.A., Principal.\n\nMiss M.D. Finlay, Secretary.\n\nNorth Bay, Ontario,\nJune 23, 1934.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to certify that Laurence J. Downey attended the North Bay Collegiate Institute and Vocational School from September 1926, until June 1932. After completing the Pass Matriculation Course, and obtaining standing on several Upper School Subjects Laurence transferred to the Commercial Department and completed the Special One Year Commercial Course. This Special One Year Commercial Course is designed for students who have completed the Matriculation Course before entering the Commercial Department, and for this reason, the whole time is devoted entirely to Commercial Subjects, such as Stenography, Typewriting, Office Practice, etc.\n\nAs a student especially while enrolled in the Commercial Department, Laurence Downey displayed ability and application considerably above the average. Since his graduation, he has attended the North Bay Normal School where he obtained his Public School Teacher's Certificate.\n\nI do not hesitate to recommend this young man for any position for which he may make application. I am confident that his work will prove satisfactory to any employer. He is a young man of good moral character and high ideals.\n\nSgd. Frank D.

Under these circumstances, the Department will not give any consideration to the appointment of a teacher for some time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMiss M. A. McDermott,\nBox 410,\nCopper Cliff,\nOnt.\nSpanish, Ontario\n1st July, 1935\n\nI declare\nDept. Indian Affairs.\n\nI have been informed that\nschool has been built on the\nSpanish Indian Reserve. I am\ntherefore making application\nfor the position of teacher. To\nthis effect I submit the following\ninformation:\n\nAcademic Qualifications:\n- Entrance Certificate (College)\n  obtained in 1929\n- Obtained various other certificates\n  in 1930 and 1931\n- Received various training courses\n  in 1932 and 1933\n- Completed the Teacher's School\n  course at Ojibwa Band in 1934\nProfessional Qualifications\n\nI attended North Bay Normal School last year and now have a Grade B Certificate in Physical Training.\n\nI can speak French and have taken a course in recreation.\n\nI believe I am well fitted for any position of trust, having been capable of hard work and good service.\n\nI will meet with your favour and consideration and shall strive to do my duty to the best of my ability.\nfrom the school at Mississauga for bad behaviour. Having inquired into the matter and having ascertained that she was even watched by the police I find that her type would be absolutely impossible as teacher for Ojibway.\n\nI just returned from Ojibway yesterday. The new school is well under construction. The foundations and basement are completed and they are beginning the frame work. This is a great opportunity for the Indians who are doing most of the work, to get some experience in building and besides that, it helps them out during these hard times. Most of them were in great need before this work started and would have had to have relief if they did not get this work.\n\nThe contractor you choose is very honest and an excellent job.\n\nThanking you very much,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.J. [Last Name]\nDear Mr. Thelen,\n\nI am recommending Miss Honorine Felly of Spanish as teacher of the new Saramo school when it opens.\n\nFrom her enclosed application you will see her qualifications. She does not live far from where the new school is located and therefore it will be very convenient for her. She is an excellent type of girl and I am sure will get along well with the Indians. Her father, whom I understand you know, keeps a store near the Spanish schools and he has had much to do with the Indians in the past. In that way his daughter has come to know many of the Indians of Saramo. So it will not be entirely new for her to go among them.\n\nMiss Felly, her father, has always been very fair to the Spanish people, but through a misunderstanding, he lost the head contract of the boys' school. Therefore it is only fair to help him out as he is in great need at present.\n\nI would ask a personal favour to myself that Miss Honorine Felly obtain the school.\n\nMany have applied to me for the school but I have directed them all to you telling them that the appointing of teachers for the Indian schools was in the hands of the department, so I guess you have had many applications. Among those who applied and tried to get the school was Miss MacFermott who, a couple of years ago was dismissed.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 31, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR.

There are forty Indian children of school age, for whom it is necessary to provide school facilities.\n\nProvision has been made in the main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37, to cover the cost in the establishment of this school.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of January 11th, 1936.\n\nOn the Spanish River No. 5 Indian Reserve, Thessalon Indian Agency, Province of Ontario, there are forty Indian children of school age, whose parents are members of the Roman Catholic Church and who do not attend any school. A school was conducted for these children previous to June 30, 1930, when the Indians removed to a settlement at Sagamook, 5 miles south. Since that date, no facilities have been available for the Indian children in the settlement where the Indians now reside.\n\nThe local Indian Agent, the church authorities and officers of this Department who visited the reserve and also the Indian parents strongly urged the establishment of day school facilities. The erection of the building has been completed, at a cost of approximately $5,000, funds for the purpose having been provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, and the authority to proceed with the work and erect the building by day labour, under the charge of a competent foreman - the local Indian Agent to arrange the purchase of materials - was approved by the former Superintendent General.\n\nThe yearly cost of conducting the school will be approximately $1,500.00, which includes teacher's salary, fuel, janitor services, supplies and incidental expenses.\n\nIt is necessary, under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, that authority be obtained from His Excellency in Council for the establishment of the school, and the attached Memorandum to Council is for that purpose only.\nJanuary 11, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Indian Day School, Spanish River Reserve No. 5, Theesalon Indian Agency, I attach to this memorandum to Council a new synopsis, setting forth the cost of construction, maintenance costs, etc. It is not necessary to include these costs in the Memorandum to Council, as the building is already erected and we are only requesting authority to establish the school, as required by Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act. This procedure is similar to that in the case of other day schools established by C.C.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 15th January 1936.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 11th January, 1936, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, recommending the establishment of an Indian day school, under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, to provide educational facilities for the benefit of the Roman Catholic Indian children residing on the Spanish River Reserve, No. 5, Thessalon Indian Agency, Province of Ontario - the school to be known as the Sagamock Indian Day School.\n\nThe Minister states that there are forty Indian children of school age, for whom it is necessary to provide school facilities and that provision has been made in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1935-36, to cover the cost in the establishment of this school.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nHonourable Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs.\nJanuary 25, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIt will be necessary to establish the position of teacher and the salary rating for the teacher of the Sagamook Indian Day School.
