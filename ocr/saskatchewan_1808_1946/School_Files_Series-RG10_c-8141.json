O. Stapleton, M. Sc., Inspector of Schools for Colchester and Hants E., whose home address is Dartmouth, N. S., will be pleased to undertake the work of inspection of the Indian Schools in Shubenacadie and Millbrook. This office has written Mr. Stapleton, but I presume you also wish to correspond with him direct.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHRS/JM\nAsst. Superintendent of Education.\nOttawa, December 10th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department is informed by the Assistant Superintendent of Education for the Province of Nova Scotia that he has communicated with you in connection with the inspection of the Shubenacadie and Millbrook Indian Day Schools. The former is 5 miles from Shubenacadie and the latter 8\u00bd miles from Truro.\n\nBy arrangement with the Provincial Department of Education, we allow $7.50 for each inspection plus actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip to the Indian school visited. Two inspections are made yearly \u2014 one in the spring and the other in the fall. Forms for making your report are enclosed; when forwarding reports you should also enclose an account in duplicate covering the cost of the inspection and your expenses.\n\nIn visiting Indian schools, you should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications of the teacher; the progress of the pupils, and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teacher of an Indian day school is not directly responsible to the Public School Inspector, as Indian day schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department. However, a teacher is expected to carry out the instructions of the inspector in regard to the work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of the teacher to carry out any suggestions made by you.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of teachers rests solely with the Department of Indian Affairs. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will receive consideration. The course of study prescribed by the Nova Scotia Department of Education should be followed as far as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW.C.

Stephenson\nInspector of Schools\nDartmouth\nN.S.\nNovember 20, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McNeil\n\nIt is desired that you have general supervision over the Department's educational work in your Inspectorate. You have already been given a list of the day schools in your Inspectorate, showing locality, names of teachers, salaries, etc. There was attached a statement, showing where Indian children are receiving tuition in white schools.\n\nThe Department is not satisfied that the Indian day schools are giving the best possible service. They have been under the supervision of the local Indian agents and are inspected semi-annually by provincial school inspectors. The provincial officers give advice to the teachers and make an independent report to the Department concerning their academic progress. It is your duty and that of the Indian agents to see that buildings and equipment are satisfactory and to improve the attendance and the general efficiency. Whenever you find that a teacher is not making the most of his or her opportunity, you should report to the Department.\n\nIt is particularly desired that you cooperate with the Indian agent in the matter of attendance. In the past, irregular schooling has militated against the success of our work. In this connection, you should give attention to the Indian children who are attending white schools as well as to our own institutions.\n\nThere is, at Shubenacadie, N.S., an Indian Residential School, recently established and about to be opened, for the benefit of the orphaned and neglected children of Nova Scotia and the Maritimes generally. You should visit this school from time to time, so that you will become acquainted with the work there and so that you will be able to assist our agents, at the outset with recruiting and later in the determination of those that should be granted admission. Preference will be given to those applicants for this school who are clearly wards of the Department and who are orphan or neglected. Favorable consideration will be given also to those applicants who live too far from any day school to attend regularly.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMR.

Will you kindly send same?\n\nI may say that I have had no authority from you concerning the visiting of the Indian school at Shubenacadie. I paid it one visit but not officially. Will you kindly advise whether I am expected to visit it?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nM. G. Stapleton\nOttawa, January 8th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThrough agreement with the Government of the Province of New Scotia, this Department secures the same system of inspection at Indian schools as at the white schools in the province. I understand that the Shubenacadie Residential School is in the inspectorate of Mr. W. C. Stapleton and he is being authorized to visit Shubenacadie regularly and report to the Department on the classroom work. It is hoped that his visits will be helpful to the Reverend Sisters in charge of the classrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J.

Payment will be allowed at the rate of $7.50 a classroom, plus travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection route. You will note that I am forwarding you a supply of forms to be specially used in the case of residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F.

S.\nAntigonish, Nova Scotia.\nJune 20th, 1932.\n\nSir:\nI am enclosing herewith the Public School Inspector's report on the Indian Day school, along with his account for inspection and mileage.\n\nInspector McDonald of Antigonish is the only public inspector in my district who sends a report to me. He usually visits the schools twice a year. This expenditure amounts to $25.00 per year for one school. In this district there are eight Indian day schools and if the other schools are visited regularly by the Inspector, this would mean an expenditure of approximately $300.00 or over, for the year.\n\nMay I suggest that in future, the Inspector of Indian Agencies could do this work and send in a similar report without any extra charge to the Department. This is merely a suggestion and if you consider the saving worthwhile, I should think the experiment might be tried out for a year or two.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 17, 1935.\n\nMemo: Schools Branch,\n\nThe undersigned expects to make an inspection of all the Maritime Agencies and those in the Gaspe peninsula early in the Spring.\n\nIn order that the greatest possible benefit may result it is desirable that all matters requiring attention should be noted between now and the time of my departure, shortly after the 15th of April.\n\nI will be pleased to gather any information, undertake any inquiry, or issue any instruction or advice that your branch may see fit to request of me.\n\nUnless I am advised of specific cases requiring special attention an inspection is, per force, of a routine nature and I feel that the work of the inspection branch can be made of more value to the Department if the branches co-operate to this end by submitting memoranda on such matters as can be given personal attention by the inspecting officer.\n\nI may add that I will be pleased to report, enroute, on any matter of urgent importance if so requested.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nMarch 30, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Parker,\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 17th instant, regarding your proposed inspection of the Maritime Agencies, I have to say there are no special matters requiring attention in connection with schools. During your visit, however, should you note any cases requiring special attention at any of the schools, I shall be pleased to have your report and recommendation.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nNo. 150-41.\n\nHalifax, N. S.\nJan. 6, 1933.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 3rd, I have sent under separate cover a copy of the October, 1932, Journal of Education, in which you will find the complete course of study for the public schools of Nova Scotia, Grades I to XII inclusive.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH. R. Shinner,\nAsst. Supt. of Education.\nOttawa, October 6, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMany thanks for your kind letter of the 30th ultimo, explaining the licensing and scholarship system in Nova Scotia. The information given in your letter is exactly what I require.\n\nWill look forward to meeting you at some time in the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. M. Phelan, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nNorth Sydney, C.B.,\nN.S.\nIn cases where grade and rank do not correspond the lower whichever it may be is followed in determining license. Thus an applicant with second rank diploma and grade A1 or even grade XII scholarship would get only a second class license and the same license would be granted to one who has a grade I scholarship and a high rank diploma. The latter case is rare but the former is common enough.\nNorth Sydney, N.S.,\nSept. 30, 1933.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am pleased to have your letter of the 21st inst. and shall endeavour to make clear to you the licensing and scholarship system of this province. One must bear in mind first that the term grade is used for scholarship, class for license and rank for professional training or its equivalent. In a few cases yet a teacher may obtain a license without attendance at the normal College. These cases are in regard to persons who are actually teaching or who have obtained degrees from colleges and make courses in education there. The table following will indicate the chief points of our system at a glance, corresponding values being opposite each other, the highest being academic and the lowest a grade IX scholarship and D license:\n\n| Scholarship | License | Professional Training |\n|-------------|---------|------------------------|\n| Grade Academic | Class Academic or A | Rank Academic |\n| \" XII\" | \" Superior First or A\" | \" Superior First\" |\n| \" XI\" | \" First or B\" | \" First\" |\n| \" X\" | \" Second or C\" | \" Second\" |\n| \" IX\" | \" Third or D\" | \" Third\" |\n\nThe grade B certificate mentioned in your letter is a misuse of terms. It should be grade XI certificate. B and other letters refer properly to licenses and to nothing else. A second class license used to be obtainable by the holder of a grade A scholarship and second rank normal diploma but for one who did not hold a normal diploma a grade XI scholarship was necessary. Accordingly in your question the second class license and normal diploma would rank the same as a class C license and grade XI certificate. The latter would mean that the person concerned had not completed the regular course in training. An attempt is being made now to reduce the regular licenses henceforth to be granted to three classes, academic, Superior First and First or as they are often called, A, B, and C. For a long time of course we shall have teachers with both C and D licenses even though no new ones of these classes are issued. If this does not render the situation clear for you kindly let me know and I will make a further attempt at it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I should be very pleased to meet you if you happen to be down in these parts at any time. My brother, Maurice Phelan, has long been a resident of Ottawa. His home is 72 Driveway and he is employed as an engineer in the Department of Militia and Defence.\nDeft. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nKindly send me a copy of Form No.142 (School Statistics Report).\n\nSent 15th June.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools\nNOVA SCOTIA\nCOUNCIL OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.\n\nHon.

He has done so since that time and his last visit was made on September 19th, 1935.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from D. C. Fraser, Port Hood, N.S., requesting authority to visit the Whyccomagh School. Has Mr. Fraser succeeded Mr. Benoit?

Mr. D. C. Fraser, Fort Hood, Nova Scotia, was appointed Inspector of Schools for Inverness County, in September 1935. Mr. J. A. Benoit is now Inspector for Richmond County. Hereafter, Mr. D. C. Fraser may cooperate with your department in the visitation of Whyccomagh Indian Day School.\n\nI know that Mr. Fraser would readily understand that it had been customary for Mr. Benoit to visit this special school and indeed may continue to do so to the mutual satisfaction of himself and Inspector Fraser. Mr. Fraser may think it more convenient to have this school visited by Inspector Benoit, and the Department will raise no objection.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter both to Mr. Fraser and to Mr. Benoit, for their information. The Department suggests that Mr. Fraser, the Inspector for Inverness County, visit the Whyccomagh Indian Day School on behalf of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH. R. Shinner,\nAsst. Supt. of Education.\nOttawa, December 5, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your recent letter in connection with the inspection of the Whyceosagh Indian Day School, the Department wrote the Superintendent of Education, Halifax. In his reply, he states that he has written both to you and to Mr. Benoit, who has been inspecting this school for the past nine years. His last inspection was on September 19th, last.\n\nI understand that you have also received a copy of Mr. Shinner's letter dated the 2nd instant. Please let me know whether Mr. Benoit or yourself will inspect the Whyceosagh School in future.\n\nThis Department allows $7.50 for each inspection, plus travelling expenses, from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip. Accounts, covering the cost of the inspection and expenses, should be forwarded in triplicate. One inspection should be made during the Fall and the other in the Spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

Since then there has been a gradual increase until male teachers now constitute only 14% of the profession. In 1936 the male teachers numbering 11,676 Nova Scotia was lowest on the list among the provinces, the highest in this respect being British Columbia with over 31%. It may be added that the men engaged in teaching are not giving up their taking it up as a permanent profession and are qualifying themselves on both the academic and professional sides.\n\nWith respect to length of service nearly one half the professionals have been teaching over five years, while approximately seven hundred have been in service only one year or under.

The variations in average salaries for the past five years may be seen from the following table:\n\n| Class            | 1935 | 1934 | 1933 | 1932 | 1931 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| All Teachers     | $724 | $721 | $742 | $787 | $754 |\n| All Men          | 981  | 1018 | 1057 | 1194 | 1165 |\n| All Women        | 692  | 729  | 739  | 790  | 709  |\n| Rural and Village Men | 581 | 581 | 546 | 552 | 586 |\n| Urban Men        | 1048 | 1062 | 1071 | 1104 | 1086 |\n| Rural and Village Women | 606 | 626 | 626 | 689 | 664 |\n| Urban Women      | 619  | 518  | 586  | 545  | 549 |\n| Urban Men        | 1060 | 1071 | 1101 | 1101 | 1056 |\n| Urban Women      | 961  | 941  | 976  | 1003 | 986  |\n\nVariations in salaries of male and female teachers according to class of license held, comparing them with those of the previous year, are as follows:\n\n| Class | Ac's | A's | B's | C's | D's |\n|-------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| All   | 1935 | 1934 | 1933 | 1932 | 1931 |\n| Male  | 1801 | 1817 | 1824 | 1835 | 1846 |\n| Female| 1481 | 1497 | 1504 | 1515 | 1526 |\n| Rural | 1481 | 1497 | 1504 | 1515 | 1526 |\n| Urban | 1481 | 1497 | 1504 | 1515 | 1526 |\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nAPRIL\u2014MAY, 1936\n\ntends to decrease, but in 1934-35 five quarterly payments were made, due to the change in the financial year.

Father,\n\nWe, the undersigned teachers of the Indian Day Schools of Inverness County, Nova Scotia, beg to ask if it is possible to have our schools visited and inspected by the newly appointed Inspector D.C. Fraser instead of Inspector J.A. Benoit. In asking this we assure you that we have no feelings of any kind against Inspector Benoit and give the following reasons for our request;\n\nInspector Fraser lives in Inverness County and much nearer to us than Inspector Benoit who lives in Richmond County. On his regular inspection tours of \"white\" schools he is often in the near vicinity of our schools and we feel that frequent and easy communication with him would be of much assistance to us and our school work. It is about impossible for us to have Inspector Benoit visit our schools oftener than twice a year on account of his regular district of inspection being in another county. Since his appointment a few years ago, Inspector Fraser has organized many new clubs, teachers' meetings etc., and we do not feel like taking part as we are not of \"his flock\". Last year he visited our schools and asked if we would wish to contribute to the school exhibits we were sending to the Provincial Exhibition at Halifax. We agreed and the result was that the exhibits of basketry and school work sent by your pupils were awarded First and Second prizes and that from ALL schools in the county who took part. We think Fraser to direct and instruct us we can take a still more active part this year and we would feel bolder in asking for his assistance and taking part in the many new and beneficial undertakings he is so successfully carrying out in the schools he supervises.\n\nAs previously stated, we have no ill feelings against Inspector Benoit and know that he is equally active in his own county but it is impossible for either he or us to carry out matters as above on account of the distance which separates us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlexander MacDonald, Teacher,\nWhydooomagh Indian Day School.\n\nColin Kennedy, Teacher,\nMalagawatch Indian Day School.\nOttawa, January 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter that has just been received from the teachers of the Whyocomagh and Malagwatch Indian Day Schools.\n\nIf you have no objections, I would appreciate your arranging to have Mr. Fraser inspect these two Indian schools in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHenry F.

I am now leaving the county. The new inspector is Mr. D.T. Robertson, Port Hood, Nova Scotia. He is willing to undertake the inspection of the Indian schools if you so wish and direct. Will you very kindly write him in this regard?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nD.C. Fraser  \nInspector of Schools\nOttawa, August 25, 1938.\n\nDear Dr. Munro:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Department from Mr. D. C. Fraser, one of your school inspectors.\n\nMr. Fraser's suggestion, that Mr. B. T. Robertson undertake the inspection of certain Indian schools, is acceptable to us. I am of the opinion, however, that Inspector Robertson should be requested to undertake this task by your Department.\n\nThe usual remuneration provided by this Department for such work will be allowed Inspector Robertson.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHenry F. Munro, Esq., M.A., LL.D.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nHalifax, N. S.\nT. M. PHELAN, A.M., LL.B.,\nBARRISTER AND SOLICITOR,\nNORTH SYDNEY, N.S.\n\nNov. 23, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nThe purpose of this note is to let you know that I am no longer acting as Inspector of Schools. However, if it be desired I can for some time at any rate continue to inspect the two Indian Schools in Cape Breton, namely Sydney and Eskasoni. If you will let me know what are the wishes of the Department with regard to the matter I shall be obliged. So far no official information has been given me in respect to who is to be my successor as public school inspector for the County of Cape Breton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. M. Phelan\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department understands that Mr. T.M. Phelan, who has been inspecting the Sydney and Eskasoni Indian day schools for some time, has retired.\n\nAs both these schools are in Cape Breton County I should appreciate your advising me by whom they will be inspected in the future. I may say that neither of these schools has been visited by one of your Inspectors since the start of the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H. F. Munro, M.A., LL.D.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nHalifax, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to inspection of the Sydney and Eskasoni Indian day schools.\n\nIt has always been the practice of the Department to have the Indian schools inspected by the same Inspector who is visiting the white schools in the vicinity. I note that you have retired as Inspector of Schools and consequently I am writing to the Superintendent of Education at Halifax with a view to ascertaining by whom these schools will be inspected in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T. M. Phelan,\nNorth Sydney, N.S.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been directed by Dr. H. F. Munro, Superintendent of Education, to acknowledge your letter of November 29, concerning the inspection of the Sydney and Eskasoni day schools by our departmental inspector.\n\nThis is to inform you that Mr. T. M. Phelan, the Inspector of Schools for Cape Breton County, resigned at the end of last school year, and that Mr. T. L. Sullivan is the present school inspector in that county.\n\nThe Department of Education will communicate with Mr. Sullivan requesting him to follow the same procedure carried out by Mr. Phelan. Mr. Sullivan will be requested to communicate with you direct.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nGerald J. Redmond\n\nG. J. Redmond,\nRegistrar.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been advised by the Dept. of Education, Halifax, that you have suggested that I might take over the inspection of the Indian Day Schools at Sydney and Eskaton. I shall be pleased to do this work for you upon the receipt of a communication from you advising me to take over the inspection of the two schools. I shall be pleased to follow your instructions for carrying out of the inspection.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. L. Sullivan\nInspector of Schools\n\nFlorence, C.B.\nNova Scotia.\nOttawa,\nDecember 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 6th instant that you are prepared to inspect the Sydney and Eskasoni Indian day schools in future.\n\nTwo inspections may be made each year, one in the spring and the other in the fall, and a supply of report forms will be forwarded to you under separate cover.\n\nBy arrangement with the Provincial Department of Education I allow $7.50 for each inspection plus actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip to the Indian School visited. When forwarding reports you should also enclose an account in triplicate covering your inspection fee and your expenses. Receipts should be attached for the latter.\n\nIn visiting Indian Schools you should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications of the teachers, the progress of the pupils and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. Special attention should be given to vocational training as we wish to make the instruction in Indian Schools as practical as possible.\n\nIt should be remembered that the teacher of an Indian Day School is not directly responsible to the public school Inspector as Indian Day Schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department. However, a teacher is expected to carry out the instructions of the Inspector in\n\nMr. T. L. Sullivan,\nInspector of Schools,\nFlorence, C.B., N.S.\nregard to her work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of the teacher to carry out any suggestions made by you. The appointment and dismissal of teachers rests solely with the Indian Affairs Branch. Recommendations from you in this connection will, however, receive consideration.\n\nIn the case of the two Indian schools mentioned in the first part of this letter it will only be necessary to inspect them once during the current academic year; namely, at some time between January 1 and June 30. In the academic year 1940-41 you can inspect them twice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, May 14, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Munro:\n\nThe records here indicate that by an agreement reached between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Department of Education of Nova Scotia, the Indian schools of Nova Scotia have been inspected twice annually by our inspectors from year to year. This arrangement has always been satisfactory to the officials charged with the administration of Indian day and residential schools.\n\nI regret to state, however, that in the preparation of our estimates this year it was not possible to include an appropriation greater than the amount necessary to provide for one inspection per classroom per annum of our Indian schools throughout the Dominion. This decision was reached in an attempt to conserve public funds in this period of national crisis and to keep our expenditures down to the lowest possible figure. The amount involved in the inspection of our schools in the province of Nova Scotia, of course, is comparatively small and I am hoping that you can make the necessary adjustment without inconvenience to your inspectors. It is very desirable, in my judgment, that our policy should be uniform throughout the Dominion.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nHenry F. Munro, Esq., M.A., LL.D.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nProvince of Nova Scotia,\nHalifax, N.S.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n1-1-6 N.S.\n\nHalifax, N.S.\nMay 18, 1940\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been directed by the Superintendent to answer your letter of May 14th, in which you advise us that it will only be possible to pay our Inspectors for one inspection per year of the Indian schools. I do not think that our Inspectors will take any exception to this change, and I am sure that they will be glad to continue inspecting the schools. It is possible that some of the Inspectors at any rate will be glad to continue the two inspections even though they are only being paid for one.\n\nWe are assuming that you will get in touch with the Inspectors directly and advise them as to the change.\n\nFor our information could you let us know in which counties in the province Indian schools are located, so that we may know which of our Inspectors are doing this work for you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH.P. Moffett,\nAsst. Supt. of Education.\n| SCHOOL          | INSPECTOR               | ADDRESS            |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Afton           | Mr. H.

All Inspectors were notified last May that the Department would only have funds available for one inspection of Indian day schools during the academic year 1940-41. Consequently there will be no funds available for the inspection of the Afton School between September 1, 1940, and March 31, 1941.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nIn accordance with your letter of August 24th to him, I have been requested by Mr. H. P. Moffatt of the Nova Scotia Department of Education, to inspect the Indian day schools at Middle River, Victoria County, and Salmon River, Richmond County. This, I hope to do in the near future.\n\nOwing to the absence of railways and the inadequacy of transportation by other means, school inspection in this part of the Country is done with privately owned automobiles, payment of transportation being on a mileage basis.\n\nIn accordance with instructions on your \"Travelling Expenses Account\", mileage charges for privately owned automobiles can be allowed only when authorized by the Deputy Head.\n\nBefore proceeding with the inspection of these schools, I should like to have this particular matter straightened out.\n\nJM/PM\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools.\nNovember 9, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. MacKinnon:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, it will be in order for you to use your own car in inspecting Indian Day Schools and you will be allowed mileage at the same rate as you are allowed by the Department of Education for the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nMr. James MacKinnon,\nInspector of Schools,\nBaddeck, Nova Scotia.\n\nPP/HM.\nDecember 9, 1948.\n\nMr. H. F. Moffat, B.A., Ed.M.,\nAssistant Superintendent of Education\nand Director of Research,\nDepartment of Education,\nH. A. L. F. A., Nova Scotia.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall our discussion with regard to the amounts paid to Provincial Inspectors in Nova Scotia for carrying out inspections of teachers employed in Indian Schools.\n\nWe are prepared to meet the following expenses:\n\n(1) An amount of $7.50 per inspection report submitted on each teacher.\n\n(2) Mileage at the same rate as you are allowed by the Department of Education for the Province of Nova Scotia.\n\nNormally we require one inspection per year, but if the teacher is new or untrained, we might ask for a second inspection report.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nEDUCATION OFFICE\n\nFile 1-1-6 N.S.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHalifax, N.S.\nDec. 10, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThis is to acknowledge your letter of December 9th, with respect to the remuneration of our Inspectors for carrying out inspection of Indian schools in this province.\n\nI suppose that one should not be too critical, but it seems to me that the amount of $7.50 that you propose for each inspection report is an exceedingly low sum for professional work of this type. I would say that the amount should be at least double the $7.50. Ordinarily, it would take one of our Inspectors one full day to inspect the Indian School and prepare a report. You surely do not think that our Inspectors work for $7.50 a day. It is quite true they will be paid by us for this time, but as a matter of principle I think the professional fee should at least approximate the salary of the person doing the work for the time spent.\n\nI appreciate your difficulties and I am not asking for a revision, but simply I am expressing my personal view.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH.P. Morissette\nAsst. Supt. of Education.\nCounty Court House,\nSydney, Nova Scotia\nOctober 11, 1949\n\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nMany thanks for your honorarium covering my inspection of the Indian Day School at Sydney and Eskasoni.\n\nI shall be visiting these schools in the near future, and I shall send you along a report covering my inspection.\n\nI trust that you arrived home from Fredericton in good mood and with high hopes.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nT.L.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast school year, at the request of your Department, I visited the Indian schools at Salmon River, on Chapel Island, Barra Head, and at Middle River, near Nyanza, both in Nova Scotia, and sent reports on both inspections to your Department.\n\nI am wondering whether you wish me to repeat the inspections this year.\n\nWill you be good enough to let me know as soon as convenient what your wish is in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 1-1-6-N.S.

In addition to this fee actual travelling expenses from the nearest point where there is a white school are allowed. One of these schools is in Maniwaki and there will not, therefore, be any expenses of this nature incurred, but the other school is situated some distance from the village and Mr. Fillion will, when visiting it, be allowed his expenses.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with the Department of Public Instruction for the Province of Quebec and advise them of the wish of this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Parent, Member for Montmorency, communicated to you one of my letters relative to the inspection of the Maniwaki Indian schools. At that time you appeared to be disposed to accept the offer that I made you of visiting regularly these schools and sending you a report of these visits; in return you offered to pay my fee of $5.00 a visit for each school and travelling expenses.\n\nI have the honour to say, Sir, that I accept those conditions and I will visit these schools on Wednesday and Thursday, Feb. 8 and 9, if you so desire. I shall await your decision at Maniwaki, where I shall be from Feb. 2 until the 9th on a tour of inspection. After the visit I shall send you a copy of the inspection report that I send to the Department of Public Instruction of Quebec.\n\nI am the inspector of French, bi-lingual and English schools of the county of Ottawa. The teachers of Indian schools of Maniwaki have already attended pedagogical conferences that I have given at Maniwaki, and I paid them their ordinary travelling expenses.\n\nHoping for a favourable reply, I remain, Sir,\n\nYour devoted servant,\n\nA.M. Filteau\nOttawa, February 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to have you inspect the Maniwaki Indian schools on Wednesday and Thursday, the 8th and 9th instant. I am sending you herewith copies of the forms on which the Department wishes to have its reports made.\n\nIn regard to the remuneration for your services I may say that the rate is $5.00 for each inspection with travelling expenses from the nearest white school on your route, which in this case will be the Maniwaki school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Matheson\nJuly 3, 1916\n\nE. X.\n\nSir,\n\nAn agreement was entered into about thirty-five years ago with the Government of the Province of Quebec with reference to the subject of securing to the Indian schools in that province the same system of inspection at the hands of the government officers as the public schools there enjoy, and this arrangement is still in existence and working satisfactorily, except in the case of the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve, where all the teaching is given in English. The present public school inspector who visits these schools is not conversant with the English language and his inspection reports are, therefore, merely speculative.\n\nThere are five schools on the reserve, four of which are conducted as Roman Catholic schools and one as Protestant, and to meet the requirements of this Department the pupils should be examined by an inspector who is thoroughly competent to make the examination in English.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough to place the inspection of these schools in the hands of an inspector who is familiar with English.\n\nHon.

Gilman of Cowansville, Que., is willing to assume this duty. They are situated within his district of inspection, and as you are doubtless aware he has already had experience in this work, having charge of similar schools at Oka.\n\nIn his letter to me on the subject, Inspector Gilman refers to the amount of remuneration accorded for this service, which he considers very inadequate in view of the costs of living and travel today. I recognize the fact, of course, that this inspection is a purely federal affair, and that the question of increased remuneration is one that would necessarily have to be of general application, but at his request I bring the matter to your attention for consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nAugust 15, 1918.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant. It will be quite satisfactory to the Department to have Mr. A. L. Gilman, of Cowansville, undertake the inspection of the Caughnawaga school. With reference to the terms, as you are aware, these were mutually agreed upon by the two Departments. We pay travelling and living expenses while inspectors are performing this duty for us, and, when it is taken into consideration that there are three schools in the village of Caughnawaga with a total of nine rooms and two other schools some distance from the village, I think you will agree with me that the remuneration under the circumstances is fair. The inspection of these schools will take up a week of Mr. Gilman's time, for which he will receive the sum of $57.00, together with his living and travelling expenses during that time. Taking it for granted that Mr. Gilman will make his first inspection during the approaching fall term, I propose to communicate direct with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, August 19, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that there are five Indian schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve, three in the village of Caughnawaga and two about two and a half miles distant. As all the teaching in these is given in English, the Department requested the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Province of Quebec to be good enough to place the inspection of them in the hands of an English Inspector and in reply to this request the Department is advised that you were communicated with and have expressed your willingness to assume this duty.\n\nThe Superintendent states that you have informed him that you consider the amount of remuneration accorded for this service very inadequate in view of the costs of living and travel today.\n\nThere are, as before stated, five schools on the reserve and the two Roman Catholic schools in the village have four rooms each, which will give you eleven class-rooms for each inspection, amounting in all to $55.00, in addition to which the Department will pay the actual cost of travel and maintenance while you are making the inspections.\n\nThe Department considers that a week's time should be devoted to the inspection of the schools on this reserve.\n\nA. L. Gilman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nCowansville, Que.\nand will be pleased to have a separate and full report from you on each of the schools after each inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nAugust 22nd, 1918\n\nMr Duncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with regard to the appointment of Mr Gilman as inspector of the Indian schools at Caughnawaga.\n\nWith reference to the amount of remuneration it should be satisfactory. I imagine that when Mr Gilman wrote to me he had not understood the conditions. It was a less sum that he mentioned.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nDear Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nWe, the undersigned Teachers, have received the amount opposite our respective names, from Inspector\n\nfor expenses to the Annual Conference held in\n\non\n\n| $ | cts | $ | cts |\n|---|-----|---|-----|\n| Forward |\n\nCarried forward\nGENERAL REPORT\n\nOF\n\nINSPECTOR A. LUTHER GILMAN\n\nFOR THE\n\nSCHOOL YEAR 1916-1917\nCOWANNSVILLE, Que., 30th June, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit my annual report for the year just closed, 1916-17.\n\nTerritory.\u2014My district of inspection extends over the counties of Huntingdon, Beauharnois, Chateauguay, Soulanges, Vaudreuil, Napierville, Laprairie, Richelieu, Chambly and part of St. Johns and Missisquoi.\n\nBuildings.\u2014The buildings and outhouses are good and in a good state of repair.\n\nThe schoolhouses are all equipped with modern furniture. The school grounds are fairly well kept but more should be done to make them more attractive and the walks and approaches more like those of our homes. Generally, school grounds in this province are neglected. Not alone in my district but in every district.\n\nVisits and examinations.\u2014All the schools of my district were visited during the autumn months and again during the second half year.\n\nOral and written examinations were conducted and the standing of each school noted and reported to this school board.\n\nSome of the school boards met at the time of my visits and matters of importance were discussed and settled.\n\nNature study.\u2014Nature study now forms part of the authorized course and is not being neglected by the teachers. In fact it is becoming quite popular in all the schools.\n\nAgriculture is also taught in all the schools of my district; owing to a crowded curriculum, time does not permit of more than two or three\nlessons per week in this important subject. However progress is being made and very careful work is being done and especially by the recent graduates of Macdonald college.\n\nThe salaries.\u2014No very marked change has taken place during the year in the salaries paid to teachers, as last year, they range from $30 to $50 per month.\n\nFrench in schools.\u2014Special attention is being given to the teaching of French, about half of the teachers are employing the natural method and much better progress is manifest in such schools.\u2014Recent graduates find no difficulty in teaching by this method, but such teachers as have not had the opportunity of Normal training find it difficult and pursue the old method. Consequently theory and not practice follows; pupils do not speak any French in such schools.\n\nClassification.\u2014I have followed closely the regulations, in making the following classification.\n\nExcellent.\u2014Howick, St. Malachie d'Ornstown, Beauharnois, Godmanchester, Hinchinbrooke, Nelson Junction, Franklin, Greenfield Park, Montreal South, Elgin, St. Lazare, Dundee, Havelock, and the Indian Schools at St. R\u00e9gis Reserve.\n\nGood.\u2014Henningford, St. Louis de Gonzague, Lacolle, St. George, St. Thomas, St. Hubert, St. Regis, Como, St. Anleet.\n\nMedium.\u2014St. Justine de Newton, Richelieu, St. Chrysostome, Chamby Canton, Laprairie, St. Margaret de Blairfindie, St. T\u00e9l\u00e9phore, Pinehurst, Coteau Junction.\n\nUnsatisfactory.\u2014St. Constant, St. Urbain.\n\nConferences.\u2014The regular annual conferences were held during the month of September. Inspector General Sutherland assisted me at Huntingdon, forty-three teachers were present at this meeting; all the\nteachers of my district attend the conferences. Some of the local clergymen also attend and a few of the commissioners make an effort to do so. Usually the principals of the academies and model schools take part in the meetings.\n\nBonuses.\u2014Bonuses for distinguished service were awarded to the following teachers:\n\n| Name               | School                | Number |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Mina Robson        | Havelock              | No. 5  |\n| Gertrude Dunn      | Havelock              | No. 2  |\n| Faith Watt         | Elgin                 | No. 2  |\n| Ir\u00e8ne Morrison     | Dundee                | No. 5  |\n| Gertrude Hampson   | Godmanchester         | No. 4  |\n| Christina Curran   | Saint Malachie        | No. 9  |\n| Rubena McNaughton  | Howick                | No. 4  |\n| Margaret Hooker    | Saint Malachie        | No. 4  |\n| Charlotte Goodfellow| Godmanchester        | No. 5  |\n| Inez Donnelly      | Hinchinbrooke         | No. 3  |\n| Loretta Welch      | Dundee                | No. 1  |\n| Grace McNaughton   | Hinchinbrooke         | No. 9  |\n| Elsie Biggar       | Godmanchester         | No. 6  |\n| Ethel McKell       | Saint Malachie        | No. 1  |\n| Jessie Grant       | Beauharnois village   |        |\n\nThe following teachers' names are submitted for honor cards, being debarred from bonuses.\n\n| Name               | School                | Number |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Frances Boomhour   | Saint Georges         | No. 2  |\n| Jennie Graham      | Elgin                 | No. 3  |\n| Letitia Ferns      | Godmanchester         | No. 11 |\n| Lillie Murdock     | Elgin                 | No. 5  |\n\nThe following teachers are recommended for prizes for physical culture.\n\nMiss A.-G.

St. Malachie d'Ormstown ........................................ $60.00\n2. Godmanchester .................................................. 50.00\n3. Hinchinbrooke .................................................... 45.00\n4. Delson Junction ................................................... 35.00\n5. Howick ................................................................. 30.00\n\nSpecial meeting.\u2014One special meeting was held at the village of Ormstown for the purpose of organizing a Commissioners' Convention. The meeting was called by order of the Protestant Committee and was addressed by Dean Laird of Macdonald College, James Robb, M.P., J.C., Sutherland B. A., Inspector General, Quebec, Dr. McLaren, the editor of the Bulletin and others. A fairly representative number of commissioners and school secretaries were present.\n\nThe course of study is closely followed in all the schools of my districts. Drawing is fairly well taught but only one lesson a week is all we find time to devote to the subject. During the second half year, two lessons per week are allowed. Some model work and a little sand moulding and relief work are attempted.\n\nMusic is neglected in nearly all the elementary rural schools. Singing hymns and national songs form part of our opening exercises, but the theory of elementary music is not generally taught.\n\nLoyalty.\u2014Before I close my annual report I desire to call your attention to the fact that the elementary schools of this district, from the teachers to oldest and youngest pupils, from the sturdy youth, longing to reach the required military age to the little tots, just able to wave the Union Jack, are at war with the Empire against Prussianism and frightfulness. Every school has contributed to the Red Cross fund; teachers and pupils are knitting for the soldiers, the girls and boys are sending boxes to their brothers at the front, nearly every teacher and pupil is directly interested. We were never more loyal to our King and Empire.\nThis report, together with the bulletins of inspection, pensioners, lists, and special reports previously forwarded to your office, is respectfully submitted.\n\nADDITIONAL REPORT.\n\nIn addition to my regular duties I visited and reported to the Department during the year, the schools of the following municipalities: St. Paul de Chester West and Tingwick, of the county of Arthabaska; Drummondville, Durham Township, South Durham, Kingsey Falls and St. Pierre de Durham, of the county of Drummond; Shipton and Asbestos county of Richmond.\n\nDuring the time of my visits and since, I have sent complete reports of my visits of inspection to the commissioners and trustees of the several municipalities, bulletins and statistical reports to the Department of Public Instruction and reports of the standing of the several schools to the teachers. I was pleased with the cooperation of the commissioners and secretaries of the different municipalities, all of whom received my recommendations in the most friendly manner. The chairman, secretary and some of the commissioners of the municipality of Shipton, accompanied me to the several schools of the municipality, besides furnishing prizes for the leaders of the different classes. They manifested a lively interest in the competition which the pupils offered in the several subjects of the course of study. Although the English schools are gradually becoming more and more sparsely attended in this inspectorate, it is apparent that the interest is not diminishing. The pupils and teachers are healthy and strong, physically and mentally. I noticed that excellent progress is being made in the different grades and especially in mental arithmetic. Other school boards should follow the example of the commissioners of Shipton and make the annual visit and examination of the inspector more prominent. It would pay.\n\nThe buildings of this inspectorate as far as I saw them are only medium in comparison with those of other inspectorates which I have visited, but they are neatly kept and are fairly warmed and lighted. But they are not modern in appearance. The course of study is followed rigidly in all the schools.\nThere is no change in the ranking of the municipalities since last year. In my quarter of the inspectorate there is only one modern school house, viz Drummondville, which may be ranked as excellent.\n\nGood.\u2014Shipton, Tingwick, South Durham;\n\nMedium.\u2014The remainder of the municipalities.\n\nBonuses were awarded the following teachers for excellence and for progress.\n\nMiss Grace Barton, Durham Township;\nMiss Elsie Hyde, South Durham;\nMr. Douglas Silver, Shipton No. 6;\nMiss Ada Wilson, Shipton No. 1;\nMiss Edna McLaren, Durham Township.\n\nPhysical Culture Prize is recommended for Miss Florence Findlay, Shipton No. 10.\n\nThis report, together with the bulletins of inspection, pension list and special reports, is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\n\nA. LUTHER GILMAN,\nSchool Inspector.\nGowanville Aug 26th 1918\n\nMr. J.W. McLean.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 19th inst., I have the honor to say that I will undertake the inspection of the schools at Caughnawaga for the consideration stipulated viz $5 per visit and actual cost of quarters and travelling expenses. It is less than I should receive, but owing to high cost of living, I need the money. Since taking charge of the schools in my present district, I am doing from Montreal & Fort Complex N.Y. & have introduced Physical C.T. and School Gardening generally.\nThroughout the whole district an excellent work is being done in these important branches.\n\nI hold pedagogical conferences in the local centres, like New Longton, Ormstown, Montreal So., Clarenceville etc., giving model lessons and lectures on school methods, discipline, management and organization. The Educational Department of this Province has undertaken to defray the teachers' actual expenses incurred in attending these meetings which are held during the months of September and October of each year. Each teacher is expected to attend one day at her nearest centre.\nThe teachers of Campbell's Bay will attend the one held at Montreal in the New High School on or about the 11th of October, notice of which is given ten days before the meeting.\n\nIf the Indian Department would be willing to pay the travelling expenses and dinner for one day for the teachers under its control I shall be pleased to notify them to attend with my other teachers. It will cost about $2.00 each for the actual expenses of each teacher for the day. See enclosed form which I return at the end of the year, you can consider the matter and give me instructions.\n\nI have the honor to\n\nA. L. [signature]\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you will undertake the inspection of the Caughnawaga schools on the terms as set forth in official letter of the 19th ultimo.\n\nThe Department will take up the question of allowing the teachers of the Indian schools in your inspectorate to attend the pedagogical conferences and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Luther Gilman, Esq., B.A.,\nInspector of Schools,\nCowansville, Que.\nMy dear Mr. Deputy,\n\nIt gives me pleasure to inform you that the Schools, which had been closed since October 10th on account of Spanish Influenza, reopened on November 12th with a fairly good attendance, considering the conditions which exist here at this season. A number of families have moved to Lachine, others have gone to Toronto, and some children are still at home on account of illness. It is, however, impossible to state just yet how many children will remain on the Reserve during the winter.\n\nEarly in September we were informed that a change had been under consideration regarding the inspection of the Reserve Schools, and we subsequently learned that an English speaking Inspector had been appointed. Judging from a conversation with Mr. Benson, as well as from other information, I am inclined to think the Inspector in question, while meeting all the educational requirements, is not a Roman Catholic, and I am told that it is the policy of the Department to give to each denomination, Teachers and Inspectors of their own faith. Not being familiar with the system of education in this country, I consulted His Grace, the Archbishop of Montreal, on this matter, and he advised me to call your kind attention to the fact, stating that the selection had probably been made without taking this point into consideration. It may be too, that the scarcity of English speaking Inspectors in the Province of Quebec, would have also been a determining factor, but if you would allow me to suggest the name of Mr. Thomas Gudhiy of 1850 Delormier Ave., Montreal, Inspector of the Montreal Schools, you would secure the service of a gentleman\nhighly qualified and who would submit a report which would be\nthe result of his own personal investigation, and unbiased in\nevery respect.\n\nI would suggest, Mr. Deputy, that owing to the distur-\nbance due to the closing of the schools, that the visit of the\nInspector be delayed for some little while. The interval would\nallow you to take up the question I have submitted to your kind\nconsideration.\n\nWith sentiments of profound respect,\n\nI am, my dear Mr. Deputy,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n21st November, 1918.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in reference to the inspection of the Caughnawaga schools.\n\nIn reply I would state that Mr. Gilman was appointed to undertake this work by the Department of Public Instruction for the Province of Quebec within whose present district the reserve is situated. In view of the fact that Mr. Gilman has had long experience with Indian schools and has given satisfaction to this Department his appointment, which meant simply the extending of his work in his own immediate district, received our approval. I am quite confident that you will find Mr. Gilman's work satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal of the Caughnawaga School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour very kind letter of recent date was thankfully received, and in reply I would say that the information you gave me has thrown a new light on the subject.\n\nOn Nov. 19th our schools were officially visited by Mr. Gilman, and the report must have reached the Department before this. He was very kind and seemed to understand the conditions existing here.\n\nEnclosed you will find a schedule of Teachers' Conferences being held in Montreal for the Teachers of the Primary and Intermediate Grades of the city. These are given in English and free to all teachers whether under the Montreal School Board or not. A casual glance will at once convince you of the very great benefit to be derived from attending these conferences, and I am especially anxious that our teachers here should profit of this exceptional advantage. I am therefore applying to you to ask that the Department defray the travelling expenses of the teachers to and from Montreal. It might be asking too much to have all of the nine teachers attend each time, but if you allowed for the Principal and two teachers from each school, it would be satisfactory.\n\nI trust, dear Mr. Scott, that I am not asking anything which would be considered unreasonable. The School Boards defray the travelling expenses of teachers who attend conferences, and I know you would not hesitate to grant the privilege to the teachers of the Reserve if it lies in your power to do so.\n\nThe work on the little office in Boye's school is about complete and I thank you sincerely. It will be such a boon for the Principal to have some little space where she may devote a few hours each day to the individual work of the school.\nThe prospects for attendance during the winter are better, as the closing of the Munition Shops have forced some families to remain, yet the scarcity of wood and coal here, will, I fear cause some suffering to the people.\n\nWith sentiments of profound respect,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Deputy,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Duncan C.

I have tried to do my work faithfully and well for small remuneration. I have the honor also to remind you of the fact that while other servants\nIf your Department have received war bonuses & the teachers under any inspection receive from $150 up annually - Your inspectors have been overlooked and neglected.

As you are not an employee of this Department you are not entitled to receive the bonus paid to teachers of Indian schools and other employees of the Department.\n\nI beg to inform you that it will not be necessary, in future, for you to inspect the Methodist Mission Day School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, as this school has been closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Do you think it preferable for me to make two visits before end of June?\n\nNow I would like you to give me the new conditions of payment for such visits. You are aware that this is very high.

The inspectors are required to furnish a report after each inspection, which report should, besides describing the condition of the school and the progress made by the pupils, contain suggestions and recommendations relative to the future management of the school which may seem to the Inspector advisable and proper to make.\n\nWith reference to the inspection of the Restigouche Indian school, I beg to say that it is considered that one inspection will be sufficient between this date and the end of June next when the school closes for the summer holidays.\n\nThe inspectors are allowed a fixed rate of $5.00 for each inspection with actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular inspection trip. A supply of blank report forms are being enclosed herewith for your use.\n\nI may say for your information that the curriculum to be followed in our Indian schools should, as near as possible, conform to the course of studies in the provincial rural schools.\n\nWith\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry Lane, Esq.,\nSchool Inspector,\nRestigouche,\nQue.\nWith reference to the prizes I beg to say that the Department has, in the past, allowed a small grant for prizes for this school which were given previous to the closing of the school before the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

Luther Edmonson\nOttawa, December 1, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, regarding the amount paid you for the inspection of the Indian schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the present rate of payment is made under an arrangement with the Department of Education for the Province of Quebec for the utilization of its inspectors in the inspection of Indian schools, and you have been receiving the same rate per class-room as is allowed to other inspectors in the Province of Quebec. I may say, however, that the Department is considering the matter of granting an increase in the fees allowed for the inspection of the schools in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. It is hoped to be able to pay an increased remuneration to inspectors in the near future and you will be further informed as soon as the matter is finally decided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. L. Gilman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nCowansville, Que.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, December 6, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nSeveral of the Public School Inspectors in Quebec and the Eastern Provinces have recently made protests against the amount of fees allowed them for their inspection of the Indian day schools.\n\nIn the Province of Nova Scotia by Order in Council dated the 23rd of November, 1882, the remuneration allowed the inspectors for this work was fixed at $5.00 per visit, with actual travelling expenses from the nearest point of their regular route of inspection.\n\nIn Quebec an agreement was entered into about thirty-five years ago with the government of the province with reference to the subject of securing to the Indian schools of that province the same system of inspection at the hands of the government officers as the public schools there enjoyed and this arrangement is still in existence. The fee allowed is $5.00 for each classroom visited, together with the actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular route of inspection.\n\nIn Prince Edward Island the same fee is allowed the public school inspector as in the case of the two above named provinces. I have been unable to find the agreement made with the Department of Education for that province for the utilization of the services of its inspectors in the inspection of the Indian school at Lennox Island.\n\nIn the Province of New Brunswick we have our own inspector.\n\nAs the fees allowed the inspectors have remained at the same rate for the past thirty-five years and the inspectors receive a higher rate for the inspection of the white schools in their\ntheir inspectorates, I consider that the time has arrived when we should increase the fees which pay them. I, therefore, beg to recommend that a 50% increase, at least, be granted from the first of the new year, namely, January 1st, 1921. This would allow a fee of $7.50 for the inspection of each class-room and the expenses of the inspectors should also be paid, as at present. The cost of this increase, taking into account that two inspections are made each year, would be as follows:\n\nNova Scotia, 11 schools, increase for 2 inspections at $2.50 each would be $55.00\nPrince Edward Island, 2 schools, increase for 2 inspections at $2.50 each would be $10.00\nQuebec, 24 schools with a total of 32 class-rooms, increase for 2 inspections at $2.50 each would be $160.00\n\nThis would make a total increase for the three provinces of $225.00 per annum.\n\nI consider that we receive good value from these inspections and from the reports received from the inspectors and I would beg to place before you for your consideration the granting of an increase in the fees allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI consider that we receive good value from these inspections and from the reports received from the inspectors and I would beg to place before you for your consideration the granting of an increase in the fees allowed.\nDecember 8, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nUnder the agreement entered into with the Government of the Province of Quebec for the securing to the Indian schools in that province the same system of inspection at the hands of the government officers as the public schools there enjoy, and which agreement is still in existence and working satisfactorily, the fee allowed to each inspector was at the rate of $5.00 per class-room inspected, together with actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on the inspector's regular route of inspection.\n\nAs the fees allowed have remained at the same rate during the past thirty-five years, it is considered that the time has arrived when an increase should be granted for the work performed by the inspectors, which has been invariably satisfactory. I have, therefore, to inform you that, from January 1st, next, the fee allowed will be at the rate of $7.50 for the inspection of each class-room, as well as the payment of the actual travelling expenses of the inspectors from the nearest point on their regular route; schools to be inspected semi-annually as in the past; such fees and expenses to be paid, as in the past, upon the receipt of accounts for the amount due at the above rate.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform your inspectors in whose districts Indian schools are located of the increase in the fees allowed and that they should render their accounts accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHon. Cyrille F. Delage, LL.D.,\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction,\nQuebec, Que.\nOttawa, December 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to official letter of the last instant regarding the fees allowed you for the inspection of Indian schools I beg to say that it has been decided that, from the first of January next, the fees allowed will be at the rate of $7.50 for the inspection of each class-room, as well as the payment of the actual travelling expenses of the inspectors to the nearest point on their regular route, schools to be inspected semi-annually as in the past; payment of fees and expenses to be made upon receipt of accounts for the amount due at the above rate.\n\nI may say that the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Province of Quebec has been informed of the increase granted in the fees for the inspection of the Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAg L. Gilman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nCowansville, Que.\nCowansville, Que., Dec. 13th 1920\n\nMr. D. M. Lean\nAssistant Deputy Commissioner\nIndian Department\n\nMy dear Mr. M. Lean,\n\nI beg to thank you for your interest in securing the increase in my allowance for instructing the Indian schools. It will certainly be a great help to my income and I hope to be able to give good service for the recognition.\n\nI beg to remain yours,\nyour very obedient servant,\n\nA. Luther Gilman\nA. L. GILMAN\nInspector of Schools\n\nrequired in each school to agree with the ages of the pupils.\n\nI have no way of ascertaining the ages of the Indian children\u2014they are not registered at the schools as the teachers journals of attendance do not require the information. In all the public schools, the ages are registered in the journals of attendance and are reported to the inspector at the date of his visit.\n\nWould it not be well to have a form for the ages placed in the Indian school registers similar to the above, also in my bulletin? In this way I could secure and report the ages to the Department of Education at Quebec.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA.

L. GILMAN\nInspector of Schools\n\nCOWAN'SVILLE, QUE., May 4th, 1921\n\nTo the Commissioner\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I did not make any visit of inspection to the Indian schools of the Cowansville Reserve last week as I intended and expected to do, having received notice from the agent Mr. Brown and also from the Superintendent that owing to an epidemic of measles, the schools were in no condition for inspection. Consequently I have postponed my visit to the 26th inst.\n\nI am being asked by the Educational Department of Quebec, for the number of pupils in its different grades or standards.\nOttawa, March 10, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to your inspection of the Indian schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that, owing to an epidemic of mumps, you have postponed your visit to the 21st instant.\n\nWith reference to the number of pupils in the different grades or standards in each school and their ages, I beg to say that it is considered that the teachers should be able to supply you with the information desired. The quarterly returns received show the age of each pupil and the daily register contains a column for this information.\n\nThe Department will await with interest your reports on your inspection of these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Clerk in charge of Schools Branch.\n\nA. L. Gilman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nCowansville, Que.\nOttawa, April 21, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nAbout 1885 an arrangement was made with the Ontario Department of Education for the inspection of the Indian schools. It was agreed that the remuneration paid to the inspectors would be at the rate of $6.00 per room, plus the actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular route. This arrangement obtains today. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nIn Quebec and the Maritime Provinces an arrangement was made in 1888 with the Departments of Education on similar lines as for Ontario. The rate of remuneration was $6.00 per room plus expenses. Since January 1, 1921, in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces the inspectors have received $7.50 per room plus expenses. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nArrangements have been concluded this year with the Prairie Provinces. In Manitoba we have agreed to pay the inspectors at the rate of $15.00 per classroom plus expenses. In Saskatchewan and Alberta a flat rate of $20.00 per school is being charged for one inspection per year. In the case of the last two provinces, no allowances are made in connection with expenses.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nOttawa, Jan. 16, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, and I note your request for a report on the Indian schools of Canada.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Annual Report of this Department is now in the hands of the printers and if you will requisition in a few weeks, I am hopeful that a copy can be directed to you. In the interim, if you have any suggestion to make regarding the inspection of Indian schools in Quebec, this Department would be pleased to hear further from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

About the suggestions I mentioned in my first\nletter of recent date, I come to the conclusion that they are\ncontrary to what is going on now in this province and in a few\nothers. I thought it was advisable for the benefit of the Indian\nschools, that there should be one or two Federal Inspectors to\nsupervise the work done in the Day Schools. Should you think\na change would be profitable, I give in my name.\n\nNow would you please have a number of blanks for report\non visits to Indian schools sent me in an early date? I have\ninspected the Restigouche Reserve and I have not enough blanks\nto make my report.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSchool Insp.\nOttawa, March 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the inspection of Indian day schools. I note that, in your opinion, there should be one or two Federal inspectors to supervise the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department desires to continue the arrangement with the Provincial Public School Inspectors, for the time being. A number of blank forms will be sent you, under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.

It is not yet decided whether for the half year to January next a temporary or a permanent successor will be appointed, and indeed in any case I can not say yet who the permanent successor is most likely to be. As soon as a decision is reached I shall be pleased to inform you.\n\nHowever, if there is special need of inspection at once (I do not know whether your schools open with ours in September or are open in the summer months) I could suggest a temporary inspector.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nOttawa, July 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1326-23 of the 24th instant, with reference to the inspection of Indian schools at St. Regis and Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that there is no immediate need of inspection, and I shall be pleased to learn, in due course, the name of the temporary or permanent incumbent you appoint to the position formerly held by Mr. Gilman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

For some years he has been a principal under the Protestant school board of Montreal, and retired in June. I am certain that he will carry out the instructions of your Department with thoroughness and full satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.W. Parmelee  \nSecretary\nOttawa, Sept. 6, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that this Department has been advised by Dr. Parmelee, of the Quebec Department of Public Instruction, that you are taking over the duties of Mr. Inspector Gilman. As you are no doubt aware, Mr. Gilman has inspected the Indian schools at Caughnawaga and St. Regis for some years, and I should be pleased if you would undertake this work while he is unable to perform his duties. Mr. Gilman's reports have been of much assistance to this Department, and I know that he has been, also, a great help to the teachers on the reserves.\n\nThe fee allowed for the inspection and report on each room is $7.50, in addition to the actual cost of travel and maintenance while you are making inspections. At Caughnawaga there are 13 classrooms, as follows: Girls' School 4, Boys' School 4, Junior School 1, Continuation School 2, St. Isidore Road School 1, Bush School 1; and at St. Regis, 6 classrooms, as follows: Village School 2, and one room at each of the Chetlain, Chenail, St. Regis Island and Cormier Island Schools. At Caughnawaga it will be necessary to get in touch with the Principal, the Rev. Sister Mary Rose Alma, who supervises the activity in 5 of the Caughnawaga schools. The Indian Agent, Mr. L. Letourneau, will also assist you in any way he can. At St. Regis you should report to Mr. Indian Agent Taillon, who will direct you as to the best method of reaching each of the schools, and who also will bend every energy towards making your visits a success.\n\nThe schools should be inspected twice during each academic year and reports directed to the Department as soon after each inspection as possible.\n\nI shall be grateful if you can make arrangements to visit the Indian schools at Caughnawaga and St. Regis in the near future. Several new teachers are at work in these schools and they would, no doubt, be very pleased to have an early visit from you. Any help that you can give to our instructors will be greatly appreciated by this Department. Upon receipt of an answering communication from you, I shall direct to your address a supply of the report forms which are used in connection with the inspection of Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

A few suggestions were made to the teachers and the superior, and on my second visit just completed a very decided improvement is shown in the work of the scholars in that subject. Now to see how the experiment will work out I would like to hold the appointment of the inspectorship for another year.\n\nMy relations with the sisters has been most friendly, and yesterday on saying goodbye to the superior she expressed the wish that I might be back to them next autumn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames Macdonald\nInspector.\n409 Burnside Place, Montreal, May 24th, 1934.\n\nMell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving completed my inspection of the Caughnawaga schools there are a few matters to which I desire to draw your attention.\n\nAlthough never notified by the Department of the opening of the Prot. Separate school I visited it. Miss Martin, the teacher, has had no experience with Indians, and feels rather discouraged about the work.\n\nThe sisters are not satisfied with their salaries. They think they are too low as compared with the lay teachers.\n\nThe cubic air space in the Delormier school is not sufficient for the pupils attending. During the winter months the health of both teachers and pupils is menaced.\n\nIn the Primary departments some devices such as numerical frames, etc., are required to help in the teaching.\n\nIn the winter months a school nurse to show the mothers when the children are sick what to do, and to see that the remedies prescribed are used, would be a great help.\n\nThe reports of each school will follow in the course of a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames Malow\nInspector\nOttawa, May 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to your recent inspection of the Caughnawaga schools. I am pleased to note that you visited the Protestant School in the village and I regret that a formal request was not made to you at the time of the opening. You might add this school to the list which I sent to you on September 5th, last.\n\nThe question of an increased stipend for the Sisters at Caughnawaga is at present under consideration. I also intend to move the classes at present in the Delormier building to a house opposite the Sisters' residence, which will be more suitable. I am pleased to have your other suggestions and will see that your recommendations in the detailed reports are given favourable consideration.\n\nI have also your letter of the 24th, with reference to the retention of your services as inspector. You will understand that this is a matter which is left largely with the Department of Public Instruction for the province.

Mr. Inspector Mabon has been forced to tender his resignation, because of ill health.\n\nThe fee allowed for the inspection and report on each room is $7.50, in addition to the actual cost of travel and maintenance while you are making inspections. At Caughnawaga there is the Roman Catholic School of 11 classrooms, as follows: Girls' School - 4; Boys' School - 4; Junior School - 1; Continuation School - 2. In addition there is the St. Ignatius Roman School, the Bush School and the Caughnawaga Protestant School, each having one classroom. At St. Regis across the river from Cornwall, there are five classrooms, as follows: Village School - 2; and one room at each of the Chatlain, Chenail and St. Regis Island Schools. At Caughnawaga the Indian Agent, Mr. L. Letourneau, of St. Constant, will assist you in any way he can. The Rev. Sister Mary Rose Alma supervises the activity in five of the seven Caughnawaga schools. At St. Regis the inspector reports to Mr. Indian Agent Taillon, who will direct as to the best method of reaching each of the schools and who will also bend every energy towards making the inspection a success.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will inform me without delay concerning your willingness to accept the position of inspector of these schools. Several new teachers are engaged at St. Regis and they would be very pleased to have an early visit from you. Any help that you can give to our instructors will be greatly appreciated by this Department.

For the past few years, Mr. J. B. Prinsau, of St. Jerome, has visited these two schools and has been of considerable assistance to our workers there. It has been suggested, however, that the services of the Inspector for the Hudson and Como Schools be secured. I may say that English is the language of instruction at the Oka Indian Schools. Please inform me if the suggested change can be effected without difficulty. With your permission, I am prepared to write to Mr. Prinsau, informing him that a change is being made, and also to the other Inspector, if you will let me have his name and address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

He has recommended you for the position of Inspector of these schools and I should be grateful if you would arrange to visit them twice each year \u2014 once in the Spring term and once in the Fall.

Ed Bolly,\nInspecteur d'Ecoles\nOttawa, October 21, 1929.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nThis Department has decided that it would be better if a Protestant, English speaking inspector visit the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School. During the past few years, Mr. Cuddihy has inspected this school along with the Roman Catholic schools of this reserve. The United Church has recently been offered part responsibility for the Protestant school in Caughnawaga, and it is therefore desirable that a Protestant Inspector be appointed. If this school can be considered in the territory of Mr. J. W. McCourt, of Lacute, his services will be entirely satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

H. Brady, B.A., whose address is 536 Old Orchard Avenue, Montreal.\n\nHowever, it rests with you to choose the inspector, and either Mr Brady or Mr McQuat would do the work satisfactorily.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. W. Parmelee\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, October 26, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Honourable Cyrille F. Delage, of the Department of Public Instruction, has given me your name as a suitable inspector for the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School. This school is the only Protestant one in the village of Caughnawaga, which is opposite Leckie. I should be grateful if you would arrange to visit this class twice each academic year and submit a report, using one of the enclosed forms. The Department allows a fee of $7.50, plus actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular route. This will be paid upon receipt of each report. The account for expenses should be forwarded in duplicate.\n\nWhen an inspector visits an Indian school, he should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications of the teacher and the progress of the pupils and should offer recommendations as to how the service can be improved. As this Department wishes the instruction in Indian schools to be as attractive as possible, the inspectors should make recommendations regarding the physical equipment.\n\nThe teacher of an Indian day school is not directly responsible to the school inspector, as Indian schools are controlled and managed by this Department. However, the teacher is expected to follow the advice of the inspector, who should feel free to report to the Department any lack of cooperation on the part of a teacher.\n\nI should be grateful if you would inform the Department if you can undertake the duties of inspecting the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School. It will not be necessary to visit the school for a few weeks, as a new teacher is commencing duties on the 4th proxime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It\nis the desire of the teacher, Miss Honan, that the\nInspector of the Public Schools of the Province of\nQuebec be asked to make the examination of the Indian\nSchool as well and she also pretends that he is\nentitled to a pay for this work. The Inspector, M.\nRoyer, was invited by the teacher to visit her school.\nI would have been glad to accompany him to school if\nI had been informed of his visit.\nOttawa, February 20th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nIt is noted from your December report on the Temiskaming Indian Day School that the teacher desires the school regularly inspected by the provincial inspector.\n\nThe Department is prepared to consider this request favourably, provided the cost would not be too great. Please let me have an estimate of the expenses that would be incurred for transportation by Inspector M. Royer if arrangements were made to have him visit the Temiskaming Indian Day School.

Mr Royer is willing to make the inspection of this school twice a year, when he comes for the other schools, for a fee of $7.50 for each time, that is $15.00 per year. Mr Royer tells me there are special forms supplied by the Department for these reports.

Consequently, I hereby resign my position as School Inspector for the Indian Schools of Caughnawaga and St. Regis.\n\nBefore severing my connection with the Department of Indian Affairs, I wish to express my sincere thanks for the hearty co-operation I received on all occasions from the Department and from the teachers in the various Schools.\n\nVery Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO THE GENERAL CHAIRMAN.\nOttawa, June 28th, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, tendering your resignation as Inspector of the Indian schools on the Caughnawaga and St. Regis Reserves.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your resignation is accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. F. Cuddihy, Esq.,\n117 St. Catherine Street West,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, June 28th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department is in receipt of the resignation of Mr. T. F. Guddily as Inspector of the Indian schools on the Caughnawaga and St. Regis Indian Reserves.\n\nI should be pleased if you would indicate the name and address of an English-speaking Catholic inspector to whom I may offer the work.\n\nI may add that the Department has recently been informed that Mr. Edson Westcott, School Inspector, Montreal, Que., would be very suitable for the inspection of the Indian schools on the reserves mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. A. Cuthbert,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Education,\nQuebec, P. Q.\nI do agree with you that it is a lot of money for a few days in Caughnawaga, but Mr. Ferrier knew that and made no complaint. Often I took three times the time mentioned in my report, to correct the work I brought back with me to Montreal. Often times to add variety to the exams I brought a stranger.\n\nFor instance, this May 29th I brought the Provincial Government Inspector Mr. Edson Westcott, Miss Jane Sturzaker from St. Ann's School, Liverpool, England, and Miss Weahen from East Ealing London, England. On June 2nd I again brought the Provincial Government Inspector Mr. Edson Westcott. On June the 5th and 6th, and June 21st I brought Rev. Brother Gregory O'Neill, Principal of D'Arcy McGee High School. On June 9th I brought a lady well versed in all the angles of Domestic Science. These facts remained unmentioned in my reports, and gave you ample reason to complain.\n\nFinally if you look through the files of your department, you will not find during the past ten years, a single complaint forwarded to me from your department.\n\nAdmitting readily your complaint of the shortness of my visits to Caughnawaga, I do think that a letter of such importance should have borne a signature and not rubber-stamp.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO THE GENERAL CHAIRMAN.\nMontreal, June 29, 1933.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy answer to your suggestion that I request to be relieved from inspecting the Indian Schools was retarded owing to my absence in Europe. On my return the 15th of May, it was, I thought, too short notice to send out a new Inspector and furthermore, I thought it was due to me and to the teachers in both Reservations to wish them goodbye and to thank them in person for the co-operation they gave me - many of them during ten years. And I did wish them all goodbye during my recent visits.\n\nMay I add, some four years ago while inspecting the Caughnawaga schools with the late Superintendent Mr. Ferrier, I spoke to him of my intention of resigning and he asked me not to think of it. During the two days he spent with me he found I gave ample time owing to my methods and system.\n\nWithout boasting I think that there must have been something in my methods and system when for fourteen years I was the Provincial Government Inspector for Montreal, where the vast majority of my schools were French, and the Government and the School Board were perfectly satisfied. This is a legitimate boast for an Irishman. You know that they would never have created the present position of Superintendent for me unless I met all their requirements.\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO THE GENERAL CHAIRMAN.\nDepartment of Education\nQuebec, P.

F. Cuddihy.\n\nThe address of Mr. Wescott is as follows: 7160\nDrolet Street, Montreal.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nDANS VOTRE R\u00c9PONSE INDIQUEZ LE NUMERO ET LA DATE DE CETTE LETTRE.\nOttawa, July 5th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Hon. Cyrille F. Delage has recommended you for the position of Inspector of the Indian schools on the Caughnawaga and St. Regis Indian Reserves. The former Inspector of these schools has recently resigned.\n\nAt Caughnawaga, there are the Roman Catholic schools, which comprise fifteen classrooms, also the St. Isidore Road School and the Bush School, in each of which there is one classroom.\n\nAt St. Regis Reserve across the river from Cornwall, Ont., there are five classrooms, as follows:\n\n- Village School - two rooms;\n- and one room at each of the Chetlain, Chenail and St. Regis Island Schools.\n\nThe Indian Agent is W. A. MacGibbon and his post office address is St. Regis, Que. If you wish any further information regarding the best way to reach the St. Regis Schools, you might communicate with Mr. MacGibbon.\n\nOwing to lack of funds this year, this Department does not desire any fall inspection of the above schools but I would appreciate your arranging to visit all of the schools mentioned above between March 15th and May 15th, 1934.\n\nThe fee allowed for the inspection and report on each room is $7.50 and, in addition, you are allowed actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip to the Indian school visited. If you use your own car, mileage at the rate of 8\u00a2 a mile is allowed. No allowance is made for ferry or bridge charges.\n\nIt is considered that, when inspecting schools, you should spend at least half a day in each classroom in order that your visit may prove useful to the teacher.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will inform the Department, without delay, concerning your willingness to accept the position of Inspector of these schools and, if you accept, I will direct to your address a supply of report and voucher forms. I may add that, when preparing accounts covering the cost of inspection, you are required to forward same in triplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Edson Westcott, Esq.,\n7160 Drouet Street,\nMontreal, Que.\n\nD. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, No. 1-1-6 Que., dated July 5th, 1933, over the signature of the Acting Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nI am both pleased and honoured to accept the appointment as inspector of the Indian schools of the Caughnawaga and St. Regis Reserves, as enumerated in your letter. Since I have been recommended to you by my Superintendent, the Honourable Cyrille F. Delage, there can be no impediment to my assuming these duties for your Department.\n\nI have carefully noted the names of the schools to be visited, the period of the year in which you desire to have the inspection take place, and the time to be devoted to this task. I beg to assure you that I will endeavour, at all times, to discharge these duties to the best of my ability, in accordance with the instructions of your Department, and in the best interests of the pupils under your jurisdiction.\n\nBelieve me to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSchool Inspector.\nQuebec, January 15th 1934.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou shall oblige me very much in sending at my address Inspector's Report, Form No.142.\n\nI remain yours respectfully\n\nA.A.

Please let me know if you have yet visited these schools, and, if so, you should forward your report. If not, you might let me know when you expect to be able to visit them.\n\nWith regard to the sixth paragraph of official letter of July 5th, I may say that recent regulations only permit us to allow mileage for your own car at the rate of seven cents a mile. The fee allowed for inspection and report on each school remains the same as mentioned in our previous letter, viz., $7.50 for each classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

I am continuing the examination of these classes until May 1st, when I intend to go to St. Regis. I will continue and complete the examination of the Caughnawaga classes after my return from St. Regis.\n\nFollowing the suggestion of the Department, I have written to the Indian Agent, Mr. W. A. MacGibbon, to ask for information regarding the most convenient way of going to St. Regis.\n\nI had intended to begin the inspection of your schools somewhat earlier, but, in view of the severe winter, and the condition of the roads, I thought it advisable to wait a little longer. However, I trust that I shall be able to devote the time required and to complete the examination of all your classes, on or before May 15th, according to the instructions contained in your letter of July 5th, 1933.\n\nI trust that the above arrangements may be considered as satisfactory to the Department.\n\nPlease note new address as found at the head of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You should make two inspections each academic year. I would suggest that the first inspection be made previous to the Christmas holidays and the second, in May or early June.

With your approval, I intend to spend two days\nper week in visiting the schools of this reserve until the\nexamination of the classes has been completed.\n\nThe beginning of May should be a good time for\nthe visit to St. Regis. In this way, it should be possible\nfor me to complete the examination of all the classes which\nyou have assigned to me for inspection early in May, and to\nforward the Report to your office by the middle of that month.\n\nI should be grateful to you for any particular\nrecommendations or instructions which you may deem necessary\nfor the inspection of the schools.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

These dates are satisfactory to the Department.\n\nThere is a new Indian Agent at St. Regis. His name is Dr. W. R. W. Haight.\n\nWhen visiting the Chetlain Indian Day School, the Department would appreciate if you would give special consideration to the work that is being done by the teacher. From certain matters that have occurred during the past year we are inclined to feel that she is losing interest in the work. In addition to your usual report on this school, you should submit a confidential report, stating whether or not you consider it advisable for the Department to dispense with Miss Lagarde's services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. Edson Westcott, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\n5463 Trans Island Avenue,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, May 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of March 20th, requesting a special report regarding the work of the teacher of the Chetlain Indian Day School. As your reports regarding the St. Regis schools have not been received, it is presumed that you have not yet visited these schools. I would appreciate your advising me when you expect to inspect the Chetlain School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. Edson Westcott, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\n5463 Trans Island Avenue,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 1-1-6 Que., dated May 2nd, I beg to state that I intend to visit the schools of the St. Regis Reserve on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week, May 8th, 9th, and 10th.\n\nTo comply with the instructions contained in your letter of March 20th, I will write you a special report on the Chetlain School. I expect to visit this school on Thursday, May 9th. I had the good fortune to have a talk with your Mr. Phelan regarding this matter on the occasion of his visit to the Caughnawaga Reserve to-day.\n\nThe report on the above-mentioned school and on the other schools of the St. Regis and Caughnawaga Reserves should be in your office before the 15th of May.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E. Wescott\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, May 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn the Indian day school at Oka, P.Q., there is a teacher by the name of A. E. Smith. He taught for eight years in public schools in northern Ontario, and in 1926-27 he attended the normal school in North Bay, Ont. He obtained his second class certificate at that time, and subsequently taught for two more years in a public school near North Bay.\n\nFive years ago he entered our employment and has been teaching since that time in the Oka Country Indian Day School. For the last year or so he has been writing off his Ontario Upper School examinations. An officer of the Department visited the Oka School last week, and Mr. Smith stated that he wishes to get away for the latter week in June in order that he could write some examinations this year. This would necessitate closing the school about ten days previous to the regular closing date.\n\nMr. Smith stated that Upper School examinations are also being held at North Bay during the month of August, but I understand that only Ontario teachers are allowed to write at that time. If it is at all possible, this Department would appreciate very much if you would arrange to have permission secured for Mr. Smith to write his Upper School examinations at the time they are held in August at North Bay, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge your letter of the 7th instant addressed to the Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools, and in reply to state that Mr. A. E. Smith holds a Permanent Second Class certificate, valid in this province. Accordingly he is eligible to write the Departmental examinations provided in August for teachers. If Mr. Smith wishes to write the August examinations he should ask for a form of application early in July. The dates of the August examinations have not yet been fixed. There will be centres at Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, London, Windsor, North Bay and Fort William.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRegistrar.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nOn his return to the Department, Mr. Phelan stated that you desired to write the Ontario upper school examinations this year, and, in order that the Oka Country School may be kept open until the regular closing date, the Department of Education, Toronto, was written with a view to securing permission for you to write the examinations in August.\n\nThe following reply has been received from Mr. J. P. Cowles, Registrar, Department of Education, Toronto:\n\n\"I beg leave to acknowledge your letter of the 7th instant addressed to the Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools, and in reply to state that Mr. A.

However, I would appreciate an extension of time for this year.\n\nThe Department of Education of Quebec has recently assigned some special work which has retarded my schedule by at least fifteen days. If, without inconvenience to your Department, you can permit me to postpone the visit to St. Regis to May 27th, it will accommodate me, and I do not think that it will inconvenience the teachers or the pupils.\n\nI have visited all the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve with the exception of the Bush School. As soon as the road to this school is passable, I will visit it and forward the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E. Wessott,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, May 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, I have to say that the Department will have no objection to you postponing your visit of inspection of the St. Regis Indian Day Schools until the 27th instant. I note that you have completed the inspection of all the schools on the Caughnawaga reserve, with the exception of the Bush School, which you will visit as soon as the road is passable. After you have completed your inspections, the Department will be pleased to have your report on each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. E.

Indian Day School is located. The Department would appreciate it if you would inspect this school in future. Only one inspection is made each year by the Inspector and the school is usually visited in either May or June. An amount of $7.50 is allowed for each classroom, plus travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip. Under separate cover you will be forwarded a supply of report forms, one of which should be forwarded to the Department after each inspection.

If a suitable site can be secured with at least 5 acres of good soil for agricultural purposes. I would suggest that the Senior pupils, and preferably Grades IX and X as well from the whole Island should attend this Central School, where Shop Work and Agriculture might form a more vital place in the education of many children. At the present time, comparatively few pupils reach the Sr. Grades and even fewer are interested in proceeding to High School at the Cornwall Collegiate.\n\nI shall be glad to be of any further assistance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Separate Schools.\nOttawa,\nJune 5, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Matthews:\n\nI have your kind letter of the 31st ultimo and appreciate your prompt reply to my previous communication.

I feel certain that these particular children will benefit by attending high school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.P.

As Inspector A.A. Letarte is being replaced by Inspector Felix Poulin, Inspector Letarte's duties will be assumed by his successor. All that Indian Affairs require is notification of this change.\n\nInspector Poulin will be notified by this Branch and will also be sent the necessary forms.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. Wilfrid LaCroix, M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n1-1-6 Quebec.\n\nOttawa, November 30, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has been notified that you have assumed the duties of Inspector Lorette. The Lorette Indian Day School (Village des Hurons) will therefore be in your Inspectorate and you are hereby authorized to make inspection of this school once a year. The usual fee is $7.50 per classroom.\n\nUnder separate cover you will receive a dozen forms for Inspector's report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nInspector Felix Poulin,\nSte.

He would like to have you with him for a day or so, if you felt that you could spare the time. He would prefer to be at Caughnawaga the week starting March 18. However, if this week is not entirely satisfactory to you, he is willing to postpone his visit to the week of March 25. Please let me hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. E.

My understanding is that the Inspector for the district in which the Lorette Indian Day School is located is Mr. Felix Poulin, Ste. Famille, Island of Orleans, Que. In future, he will inspect the Lorette School and it will not be necessary for you to visit it.\n\nWe are allowing you the $15.00 for the inspection you made on April 1, and cheque in payment will go forward in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

E. Wescott,\nInspector of schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, QUEBEC\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS\n\n5851 Clanranald Avenue,\nMontreal 29\nJune 13, 1947.\n\nTHE DIRECTOR,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the report of my annual inspection visit to the schools of the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nAs you may see by the accompanying reports on the individual classes, I found the general progress very satisfactory.\n\nThe Principal, Sister M. Albertus, seems to be very active in the administration of the schools and in the supervision of the classes. She spends half of each school day in the Eastern School and the other half in the Kateri School. That her supervision of the teaching is constant and vigilant is evident from her knowledge of the progress of the classes and of the individual pupils.\n\nThe general behaviour of the pupils seems to be very good. I believe that there are few cases of bad conduct. The pupils are polite and friendly in their attitude towards a visitor. Their oral language shows constant improvement.\n\nThe schoolrooms are clean and orderly. They have been made as attractive and as comfortable as possible. There is no point in mentioning the lack of blackboard space in some of the temporary rooms, or the lack of light in some of the others. This will be remedied by the building of a new schoolhouse, which, I understand, will be undertaken in the near future.\n\nDuring my visit, I inspected the woodworking shop and the household science room. Some interesting and useful articles have been made. The pupils' interest in the activities of these departments is even greater than in previous years.\n\nInspector of schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, QUEBEC\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS\nCLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS ACCORDING TO AGE AND GRADE\nSaint Regis Reserve\nVILLAGE SCHOOL\n\n| Grades | Ages: | Boys | Total |\n|--------|-------|------|-------|\n|        | 6     | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   |       |\n| I      | 2     | 2    | 2    | 1    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 5     |\n| II     | 2     | 2    | 2    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 4     |\n| III    | 1     | 1    | 2    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 5     |\n| IV     | 1     | 2    | 5    | 2    | 1    |      |      |      |      |      |      | 10    |\n| V      | 1     | 1    | 1    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 3     |\n| VI     |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | -     |\n| VII    |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 3     |\n| Total  | 2     | 5    | 5    | 3    | 6    | 4    | 2    | 1    |      |      |      | 30    |\n\n| Grades | Ages: | Girls | Total |\n|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n|        | 6     | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   |       |\n| I      | 1     | 3    | 2    | 2    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 8     |\n| II     | 3     | 1    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 4     |\n| III    | 1     | 2    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 3     |\n| IV     | 1     | 2    | 1    | 1    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 5     |\n| V      |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1     |\n| VI     |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | -     |\n| VII    |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 4     |\n| Total  | 1     | 3    | 5    | 4    | 3    | 2    | 1    | 3    | 3    |      |      | 25    |\n\nISLAND SCHOOL\n\n| Grades | Ages: | Boys | Total |\n|--------|-------|------|-------|\n|        | 6     | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   |      |      |      |      |       |\n| I      | 2     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 2     |\n| II     | 1     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1     |\n| III    | 1     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1     |\n| Total  | 2     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 4     |\n\n| Grades | Ages: | Girls | Total |\n|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n|        | 6     | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   |      |      |      |      |       |\n| I      | 2     | 1    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 3     |\n| II     | 1     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1     |\n| III    | 1     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1     |\n| V      | 1     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1     |\n| VI     | 1     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 2     |\n| Total  | 2     | 1    | 1    | 2    | 1    | 2    |      |      |      |      |      | 9     |\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, QUEBEC\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS\nSt. Regis Reserve (cont'd)\n\nCHETLAIN SCHOOL\n\n|       | Boys | Girls |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| I     | 2    | 1     |\n| II    | 1    |       |\n| III   |      | 1     |\n| IV    | 1    | 1     |\n| V     | 1    | 1     |\n| VI    |      | 2     |\n| Total | 3    | 4     |\n\nNote: A study of these statistics makes it evident that there are many retarded pupils in these schools.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the classification given in these tables is that of the teachers.

I regret to say, however, that there is not sufficient progress in the Chetlain School.\n\nIt was very gratifying to learn that the boys of the Village School are being initiated into the art of woodworking and the girls, into elementary household science. It was also a pleasure to see that a piano has been added to the equipment of this same school. This instrument has been used to advantage. The pupils sing very well to the accompaniment of one of the teachers.\n\nI was greatly impressed by the improved attendance. The officers of the Welfare and Training Division, the local Indian Agent, and the teachers all deserve praise for their share in this improvement.\n\nI was very pleased to learn that four of the girls who graduated from the Village School last year were successful in obtaining high school entrance. This and the fact that some of these girls are now studying in high school with a grant from your Division may be responsible for the revived interest in the Senior Class of the Village School.\n\nThe Indian Agent, Mr. T. L. Bonnah, takes an active interest in the welfare of the pupils. His help is greatly appreciated by the teachers.\n\nI wish to thank Mr. Bonnah, the teachers, as well as the R.C.M.P. constables for their kindness and courtesy to me during my inspection visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit my report on my visit to the schools of the St. Regis Agency.\n\nAs will be seen by the individual reports, the general progress is satisfactory.\n\nI made two visits to the St. Regis schools in the school year 1947-48. My first visit took place on November 13th. My principal purpose was to visit the Chetlain School, in order to stimulate and encourage the teacher and pupils. It will be remembered that the progress of the pupils of the Chetlain School was unsatisfactory in the year 1946-47. I also made short visits to the Chenail and Village schools. I did not visit the St. Regis Island School at this time.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nVillage School: The progress of the two rooms of this school is worthy of special mention. The teachers' lessons are well planned. The pupils are active and orderly. The pupils' progress is particularly noticeable in oral English.\n\nSt. Regis Island School: Good work is being done by the teachers of this school. Her pupils are making progress in all subjects.\n\nChenail School: The teacher of this school deserves praise for her earnestness and enthusiasm. She is doing good work and her pupils are making progress. If she had the opportunity of teaching side by side with an experienced and sympathetic teacher, she would, I believe, become a very skilful teacher.\n\nChetlain School: I must regretfully state that the pupils of this school have not made satisfactory progress.\nThe teacher seems to lack enthusiasm and she has not been able to gain the interest and attention of her pupils.\n\nThe new schoolhouse which has been built to replace the Chatelain and Chenail schools is, if I may judge by the exterior, a model rural school. It should be a great boon to the people of this district.\n\nIt may be presumed that you are already considering the building of a new schoolhouse to replace the present village school. The present building is not adequate for the excellent school program, including the manual arts, which you are trying to implement in your schools.\n\nI respectfully suggest that, when you plan a new building for St. Regis Village, you study the possibility of transporting the children of St. Regis Island to and from the future Village School. The children of the Island could be transported by boat in the autumn and in the spring, by sleigh in winter. There would be only a few days at the beginning and at the end of winter when one or the other of these means of transportation could not be used.\n\nThis suggestion, of course, is based on my own opinion. The feasibility of such a project would have to be studied by the local superintendent and others who know the situation at first hand.\n\nThe cost of transporting the pupils would be offset by many advantages, both educational and financial. The pupils would have all the benefits of the educational activities that you are endeavouring to provide for the Indian children. It would no longer be necessary to provide a teacher and a teacher's living quarters and a schoolhouse for an average enrolment of twelve pupils. It may be noted that the present schoolhouse on the Island is in need of repair or replacement.\n\nDuring my visit to St. Regis Village, I examined the woodwork done by the boys under the direction of Mr. Chisholm. I was very favourably impressed. The boys were proud to show me their work, which gave evidence of ingenuity and originality. Mr. Chisholm deserves praise for his initiative and for his enthusiastic guidance.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, QUEBEC\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS\n\nI was also pleased with the sewing done by the girls. I am told that cooking lessons are given to the girls in the kitchen of the teachers' residence. The teachers are worthy of high praise for their efforts to encourage homemaking activities.\n\nThe Agent, Mr. T. L. Bonnah, the R.C.M.P. Constable, and all the teachers are to be congratulated for their success in obtaining regular attendance in the schools of this agency.\n\nA. E.

In most of the classes, I found interesting projects. In all, there is evidence of increased pupil-activity.\n\nThe pupils are neat and clean. The schoolrooms are tidy and orderly. As I have remarked in previous reports, every effort is made to have pleasant and livable rooms.\n\nThe samples of sewing and knitting, as well as the preserved fruits and vegetables which I examined show that the teacher and her pupils have continued the good work in household science that has been a feature of these schools for many years.\n\nThe teacher in charge of the boys' woodworking classes, Mr. R. Viau, seems to be doing good work. The boys whom I saw at work seemed to be eager and interested. Mr. Viau seems to plan his work well. He seems to have tact in managing boys.\n\nLast September, at the request of the Superintendent of Education of Quebec, the inspectors organized two-day conferences for the teachers in their respective districts. With your permission, the teachers of Caughnawaga attended the conference which I organized in Montreal. Similar meetings will be held in September 1948. If it is your wish, I will invite the teachers of Caughnawaga.\n\nInspector of Schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, QUEBEC\nINSPECTION OF SCHOOLS\n\n5851 Glenranald Avenue,\nMontreal 29,\nMay 10, 1949.\n\n1-1-6 Que.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMining Division,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Stationery\n\nPlease send to the undersigned Inspector of schools at the above address:\n\n50 copies INSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nThese forms are to be used for the report on inspection of Indian day schools of the Caughnawaga and St. Regis Reserves.\n\nA. E. Wescott,\nInspector of schools.\nThis will advise you that School Inspector, A.M. Wescott, visited the agency yesterday to inspect our schools on the Quebec side. He finished one room in the Village school and in the afternoon left by boat for the St. Regis Island school. During the inspector's visit, he generally likes to get to the St. Regis Island school if the weather is permissible and, of course, he can visit the other schools by car irregardless of weather conditions. During the morning, the wind was too high to cross him to St. Regis Island and our access to the school is around the west end of the Island and on the north shore. As the wind had died down during the noon hour, he decided to leave in the afternoon for St. Regis Island since the weather was fine. However, while nearing the landing on the Island, a rain and wind storm of intense velocity came up and the inspector received a soaking. When he arrived back at the agency, he thought it better to return to Montreal that night as he did not have a sufficient supply of dry clothing with him to complete the inspection of the remaining schools. Accordingly, he will return to the Agency on the 27th to complete his work, which is quite satisfactory insofar as I am concerned as I am anxious that Mr. Wescott give us a little extra time if possible at the Chamil School this year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the report on my visit to the schools of the Saint Regis Agency.\n\nAs may be seen by the reports on the individual classroom teachers, the good work reported last year has been continued and improved.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nVillage School\nThe progress of the pupils in this school continues to be very satisfactory. I noted even greater improvement in the Senior Room during the current year.\n\nThe pupils of this school have broadened much during the past few years. They are much freer and much more friendly. They are eager to answer and they express themselves in good, simple English. It is a pleasure, not a task, to get them to render an account of what they have learned.\n\nI was particularly pleased to hear the pupils of this school render several songs. Their rendition was very good. Such activities are a very useful part of training.\n\nSaint Regis Island School\nIn my report of last year, I suggested that, whenever the present village school should be replaced by a new schoolhouse, a study should be made of the feasibility of transporting the children from the Island to the Village School. I need not repeat this suggestion. I only wish to say that the benefits already derived from the central Chenail School seem to show the desirability of further centralization.\n\nChenail School\nI wish to congratulate the Department of Mines and Resources for providing this new schoolhouse for the children.\nof this district. The building of this school has already improved the attitude of the pupils. These children no longer appear backward, as they did in previous years. I was particularly pleased to see the spacious playground behind the schoolhouse and to observe the boys playing lacrosse during recess. This school will be of benefit to the entire community.\n\nMr. Colin Chisholm has continued his good work in initiating the boys in manual training. He has also done much to encourage them in sports.\n\nThe Superintendent of the Saint Regis Agency, Mr. T. L. Bonnah, deserves praise for the active interest that he takes in the welfare of the schoolchildren and in the progress of their education. His successful campaign for regular school attendance is worthy of special mention.\n\nA. E. Wescott,\nInspector of schools.\nJuly 11, 1949.\n\nMr. A. E. Wescott,\nInspector of Schools,\n5851 Glenranald Avenue,\nMontreal, P. Q.\n\nDear Mr. Wescott:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 30. The information contained therein about the schools at Cornwall Island has already proved of help to me. I hope to have an opportunity one day of discussing with you the plans for the Island school and also the Village school.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 3, asking our school inspectors to carry out the inspection of the Maria and Restigouche schools, Province of Quebec.\n\nThe following are the names and addresses of our officers for those districts:\n\nMaria - Mr. J.A. Leblanc, Bonaventure, Cit\u00e9 Bonaventure;\nRestigouche - Mr. Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Raby, Lac-au-Saumon, Cit\u00e9 Matap\u00e9dia.\n\nI am sure that these inspectors will give you their entire cooperation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector General of Catholic Primary Schools.\n\nMS/fm\nMay 1, 1950.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nIn regard to the inspection of certain Day schools I expect to arrive in Regina on Sunday evening next, and as you know, I should like to visit these schools as early in the month as possible.\n\nIt is, unfortunately, the season at which your field officials will have more than ever to do in connection with farming and other activities and they may be a little impatient at having to spend most of a day at an isolated school. In all fairness to some of these teachers I ought to give plenty of time to the appraisal of their work. As I have no automobile of my own I have been wondering whether you might give consideration to permitting me to operate Departmentally owned vehicles within your territory. I have a license in Ontario.\n\nI note your remarks regarding the difficulty and expense of visiting Red Earth and Shoal Lake. Perhaps by next Sunday you may have heard of some Government Department that would share the expense of a visit to those places.\n\nIn addition to the schools listed in memorandum 1-1-1-Sask of April 18, 1950, there are some points to be discussed with Moosemin, Witchekan, Mistawasis and Muscowpetung.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

Dept.\n\nPublic School Inspectors etc.\nJanuary 21st, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. McWhinney -\n\nI have your letter of the 15th inst., in reference to the inspection of Indian schools in the western provinces. The system suggested by you has been followed in the east, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, for a number of years, and it has been my intention to have it applied, if possible, to Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. In fact I had gone so far as to prepare a memorandum on the subject for submission to the Hon. the Superintendent General, which I hope to present to him before long.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nKamsack, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nI am of opinion that the time has arrived when the inspection of the Indian schools in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta should, if possible, be placed in the hands of the public school inspectors of these provinces, as it is the aim of the Department to have the teachers in our Indian schools conform with the public school curriculum. I consider that the public school inspectors are better fitted to see that the wishes of the Department in this direction are carried out than our agency inspectors, who have neither the requisite time nor the pedagogical training to properly conduct this work.\n\nI would, therefore, respectfully suggest that I be authorized to open up negotiations with the local governments of these provinces with the object of securing to the Indian schools the same system of inspection by the hands of local officers as the public schools in the provinces undergo, and to make the most economical arrangements possible in regard to the compensation to be made to the local officials for their services in that behalf.\nMemorandum - Mr. Scott.\n\nIn connection with the memorandum of the 10th instant in regard to the proposed inspection of Indian schools in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta I beg to say that the inspection of the Indian schools in Ontario Quebec and the Maritime Provinces was, by mutual arrangement entered into between the Dominion and provincial governments about thirty-five years ago, placed in the hands of the provincial inspectors, who were authorized to make semi-annual visits of inspection to Indian schools within or near their districts. The inspectors were to furnish a report after every inspection, which should, besides describing the condition of the school and the progress made by the pupils, contain suggestions and recommendations relative to the future management of the school which may seem to the inspector advisable and proper to make.\n\nAs the curriculum followed in our Indian schools should, as nearly as possible, conform to the course of studies in the public schools, the provincial inspectors are the proper persons to perform this duty.\n\nAs the majority of the Indian schools in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are denominational the different churches engaged in missionary and educational work have been allowed the privilege of nominating teachers, many of whom have not the required professional qualifications. If the schools are placed under the provincial inspectors, the Department would be in a position to consult them regarding future appointments.\n\nThe inspectors in the older provinces are allowed a fixed rate for each inspection of $6.00 in Ontario and $5.00 in the other provinces, with actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular inspection trip. As these fees were fixed so many years ago it may be necessary to increase them. This would be a matter of adjustment with the different provincial educational departments.\n\nMartin Benson.\nMemorandum,-\n\nJune 1, 1920.\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen,\n\nSome 35 years ago the inspection of the Indian schools, both day and industrial, in Ontario and Quebec and the Maritime Provinces was placed in the hands of the Provincial school inspectors, pursuant to an agreement entered into by the Department of Indian Affairs with the respective local Governments. This arrangement is still in effect, except in the province of New Brunswick, where, as in the case of British Columbia, we have an Inspector appointed by the Department.\n\nIn the Western Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta the inspection of the schools is made by our departmental inspectors who, as you may be aware, have no pedagogical qualifications, and whose examination of the classroom work is, of necessity, very perfunctory.\n\nI am of opinion, and in this I am supported by some of the more prominent people engaged in the Indian educational work, that the time is opportune to place the inspection in these three provinces also in the hands of the Provincial Inspectors. There have been complaints from many sources that the classroom work in some of our schools is neglected. There are frequent changes of teachers, and a consequent lack of uniformity in teaching methods. Our aim is to have the course in our Indian schools conform as closely as possible to the curriculum in the public schools of the districts in which they are situated, and the only means of attaining this end is by\nhaving the work under the supervision, and, to some extent, the direction of the Provincial Inspectors.\n\nI would, therefore, respectfully suggest that I be authorized to open up negotiations with the local Governments of the provinces just referred to, with a view to securing for the Indian schools the same system of inspection as the public schools in the province, and to make the most economical arrangements possible in regard to the compensation to be made.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWhat are the limits in our Will extra cost be entailed to what extent? (a) - A.M.\nMemorandum.\n\nHon. Mr. Neighen,\n\nWith reference to your inquiry on the memorandum, herewith, regarding the inspection of schools, I beg to state that the fee allowed in Ontario is $6.00 for each classroom, and in Quebec $5.00, with travelling expenses in each case from the nearest white school. Inspectors are required to make their inspection of Indian schools while on their regular rounds, thus reducing their travelling expenses to a minimum. I may state, however, that I have had representations recently, asking for an increase in these fees in both provinces. This is a matter that I will take up with you when I have received a reply to a letter recently addressed to the Deputy Minister of Education, Toronto.\n\nIt is difficult for me to give a close estimate of the expenditure that would be entailed in the three Western Provinces. Including day, boarding and industrial schools, there are approximately ninety rooms in schools situated in the settled districts. We allowed a fee of $8.00 for each room to be inspected twice a year; the cost, including travelling expenses, would be, approximately, nearly $2,500.00.\n\nI feel that this is an expenditure in connection with Indian education which we would be justified in undertaking, more especially now that our amendments to the Act, providing for compulsory attendance at residential schools.\n\nI think it might be preferable if you would correspond with the local governments and obtain\ninformation, after which I could again report to you,\nand, if you concur, I shall take this action.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nJune 1, 1920.\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon.

This arrangement is still in effect, except in the Province of New Brunswick, where, as in the case of British Columbia, we have a special Inspector of Indian Schools appointed by the Department.\n\nIn the Western Provinces our inspection of Indian schools is made by our Inspectors of Indian Agencies. It is the aim of the Department to have the courses in our Indian schools conform as closely as possible to the curriculum of the public schools of the districts in which they are situated, and it is considered that possibly that end might be more completely attained, were the class-room work under the inspection of the Provincial Inspectors.\n\nI should be glad if you would give this suggestion your consideration. I may add that in the Eastern Provinces we have paid a fee for inspection and travelling expenses. Would it be possible for you to let me know what the probable approximate costs would be to this Department, if such an arrangement were put into effect in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHon.

I am enclosing a list of those which can be handled on this basis. The others would require a special trip and we shall be glad to provide a man for an annual inspection of them if you wish on a basis of salary and expenses for the time taken, the amount of salary to be mutually agreed upon with your Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Hickey\nDeputy Minister\nNovember 24, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 16th instant, in which you cite the terms upon which Indian schools in the province of Manitoba might be inspected and reported upon by the Provincial Inspectors.\n\nWe will give this matter further consideration and I will communicate with you in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. Fletcher, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nRe. inspection of Indian schools in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nWith a view to utilizing the services of the provincial school inspectors in each of the above provinces the respective Ministers of Education for each was written to in July, last, to obtain their co-operation and in order to ascertain the probable approximate cost, if such an arrangement were put into effect. The object of such a visitation is to have the course of study in our Indian schools conform as closely as possible to the curriculum of the white schools of the districts in which they are situated. Lists of the schools in each province (day, boarding and industrial) showing agency and reserve on which located and nearest post office address and distance from school were requested and sent. Replies have now been received from the Deputy Minister of Education for each province, which, briefly summarized, are as follows,-\n\nMANITOBA\n\nMr. R. Fletcher, Deputy Minister, states that they will be willing to undertake the inspection of the Indian schools which are readily accessible on the basis of $15.00 for each visit, together with the expenses incurred in travelling to and from the schools, the understanding that the schools will be inspected then their inspectors are in the neighbourhood on their usual visit of inspection. Regarding the schools in the remote districts, he states that they will provide men to make an annual inspection on a basis of salary and expenses for the time taken, the amount to be mutually agreed upon. There are 20 day schools, 5 boarding and 1 industrial which can be classed as accessible. The cost of their inspection, one inspection per year only, which does not include travelling expenses, is approximately...\nmately as follows:\n\n20 day schools, 1 class-room each, @ $15.00 = $300.00\n6 boarding schools, 2 class-rooms each, @ $15.00 = $180.00\n1 industrial school, 2 class-rooms, @ $15.00 = $30.00\n\nThis does not provide for two boarding schools (Norway House and Cross Lake) and 16 day schools which are located in northern Manitoba and for which special terms would have to be agreed upon. It is not possible to estimate the travelling expenses that would be required, as until one visit is made in each case the time taken will not be known.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nMr. Augustus H. Ball, Deputy Minister, took up the matter of the inspection of our schools with the provincial inspectors in whose inspectorates the schools are located and forwards a memorandum from the replies received by him. There is considerable variation in the method of arriving at the remuneration and travelling allowances by the different inspectors. The majority of the inspectors, however, will do the work at the regular departmental rate allowed for travelling of $6.00 per day and $10.00 per class-room for inspection and report. In the outlying districts, north of Township 55, it will be necessary to arrange with the individual inspectors as to travelling allowances. There are 19 day schools, 15 of which can be termed as accessible, 11 boarding (9 accessible) and 1 industrial in the province. The cost of inspection of the basis of the terms submitted, one inspection each year, would be approximately as follows:\n\n15 day schools, 1 room each, at $10.00 each = $150.00\n9 boarding schools, 2 rooms each, at $10.00 each = $180.00\n1 industrial school, 4 class-rooms, at $10.00 = $40.00\n\nBesides, the time occupied in travelling, including living expenses, would be $6.00 per day. I do not think it is possible to estimate the time that would be taken nor to make an approximation of the expenditure required for this purpose until after the inspectors have made their first visits.\n\nALBERTA.\n\nMr. J. T. Ross, Deputy Minister, states that the inspectors will undertake the inspection of the one-roomed schools once each year for $25.00 each and the two-roomed schools (residential) for $40.00 per year each and furnish reports on the work.\nwork being done in the class-rooms. This would include travelling expenses. There are 4 day schools, 10 boarding and 1 industrial in the settled districts, while 9 boarding schools are in the northern part of Alberta, in what is known as Treaty 8. The Deputy does not make any distinction as to the inspection of the schools in the outlying districts, and, on the basis submitted by him, the cost of the inspection of the schools in Alberta would be approximately as follows:\n\n| Description                  | Cost   |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| 4 day schools at $25.00 each | $100.00|\n| 19 boarding schools at $40.00 each | $760.00|\n| 1 industrial school at $40.00 | $40.00 |\n| **Total**                    | **$900.00** |\n\nAs there is a difference in the amounts asked by the different provinces, I would suggest that a flat rate covering the cost of inspection and travelling expenses be offered by this Department, a larger sum being offered in the case of the residential schools than in that of the day schools. It appears to me that the offer submitted by the Province of Alberta is the most reasonable, namely, $25.00 for each day school and $40.00 for each residential school. One inspection a year should be sufficient and only the schools situated in what is termed accessible localities should be inspected. Later on terms could be arranged for the inspection of the outlying schools. If the provinces would agree to the above terms the cost of the inspection of all the Indian schools therein in the readily accessible class would be approximately $2,500.00 per year. At the present time we have no regular inspection of these schools; the Agents and inspectors of agencies visit the schools occasionally, and some of our residential schools do not receive any inspection. I shall be glad to receive your further instructions in this matter. The correspondence from the Deputy Ministers of the Provinces is herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, February 15, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is desirous, at this time, of completing arrangements for the inspection of the Indian schools in Manitoba. I have examined the correspondence with your office, of more than a year ago, referring to this matter, and I beg to state that, as soon as a definite agreement has been made, this Department is prepared to ask the Minister to authorize the expenditure that will be incurred.\n\nUnder date of the 16th of November, 1920, you forwarded to this Department a list of the Indian day and residential schools in Manitoba, which you were prepared to have inspected. One school has been closed since that time and another opened, and I am enclosing an up to date list for your attention. I beg to state that the appointment of an inspector for those schools in Manitoba which are not readily accessible will have to be left in abeyance for the time being.\n\nYou will remember that your Department was willing to undertake the inspection of Indian schools which are readily accessible to your inspectors, on the basis of $15 for each visit to a school, together with the travelling expenses. It was understood that the Indian schools would be inspected when your men were in the neighborhood and that the expense item would be kept at a minimum.\n\nIs it your wish that the Department of Indian Affairs negotiate direct with the inspectors? If so, we would be grateful for a map of Manitoba, roughly showing the inspectorates and a list of your staff and their addresses. If the Department of Indian Affairs is to deal with you only in this connection, such information is not needed.\n\nIt is desired that the Indian schools be visited once a year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Ferrier Esq\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre your file No. 24949-3\n\nI am in receipt of your favor of February 15th, which will have my attention at an early date.\n\nI have been exceedingly busy with certain matters arising out of the Session and with the convention of trustees this week but hope to deal with your letter shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher\nDeputy Minister.\nKamsack, Jan. 15th 1919.\n\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor a number of years it has been evident to those giving close attention to Indian education, that the class rooms of Indian schools did not receive proper inspection. You will agree with me I am sure that this is a very necessary matter in order that the teachers in the schools receive that sympathetic guidance and incentive that they need in order that the best work be done. At present, as you are aware the Indian Agents are instructed to visit the schools once a month and the Inspectors of Schools about once a week. To many of them this is not previous experience or training which fits them to do this work in a way that is of much value. Several of these men have expressed great dislike for this part of their work, simply because they felt they were not qualified to do what should be done. Most of them regard it as a somewhat unimportant side line of their many duties and it is passed over in a merely perfunctory manner. Do not think I am finding any fault with any of these officials, for I regard this condition as a natural result of men being asked to perform duties for which they are not qualified.\n\nThe time has come when Indians on many reserves are taking much more interest in the education of their children and will demand better work in the schools. This attitude will be much accentuated by the return of large numbers of the younger men from the battlefields of France. They will come back with new and wider ideas of the world and the schools will have to move forward to meet their ideas of what is fitting.\n\nIn view of the foregoing conditions, at the recent meeting of the Presbyterian Synod of Saskatchewan, held in the city of Moose Jaw I introduced and secured the unanimous passing of a resolution asking the Department of Education of Saskatchewan to confer with the Department of Indian Affairs with a view to having the class rooms of our Indian Schools inspected by the Public School Inspectors of the Province, in whose districts these schools happen to be. This would tend to bring the Indian children under the same system as the other children of the Province, and would be a force working for the ultimate good of the Indians. This would be by far the best substitute for the present system but if this could, for any reason not be carried out then I suggested as an alternative that a suitable number of inspectors specially fitted for the work be appointed by the Indian Department. These changes should of course apply to all Indian schools receiving Government support.\n\nKnow that you are especially interested in this branch of Indian work I commend this question to your consideration. I should be pleased to hear from you at your convenience as to what you think of the proposition.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n16th March, 1922\n\nRussell T.

I am writing each Inspector concerned setting forth the conditions under which he will render the service and pointing out that his inspections are to be made in such a way as to entail the least expense for travel, etc.\n\nI enclose herewith a list showing the allocation of the schools among the Inspectors. This is based upon the revised list which you forwarded with your favor of February 15th.\n\nIf we can serve you any further in this matter at any time do not hesitate to write us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Ferrier Esq\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nWith reference to your favor of February 15th, I am unable to arrange at present for the inspection of the Boarding School at Portage la Prairie, as our Inspector at that point is on leave of absence, but I presume it will be quite satisfactory to you if the school is inspected during the Fall term. We may have some adjustments to make in the meantime in connection with that division but there will be an Inspector located at Portage la Prairie who can undertake the work after mid-summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, March 22, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Fletcher:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letters of the 16th instant, referring to the inspection of certain Indian schools by the Manitoba Department of Education staff of inspectors. I have noted your permission to communicate direct with the inspector in each case, and that you have intimated to the officers concerned that they will hear from us in this connection.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department of Indian Affairs is grateful for the interest that you have taken in this matter and for the information concerning the inspectors, that you have offered. In September, next, I will communicate with you again concerning the name and address of the Portage la Prairie Inspector.\n\nI might inform you that it is our aim to maintain in Indian schools the same standards that obtain in the public schools of the Province. The services of your staff of inspectors will be of real value to us in this connection.\n\nDefinite arrangements have been made with Saskatchewan and Alberta, and we are now ready to secure the necessary authority for the scheme from the Minister.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. Fletcher, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, March 22, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nRe: Inspection of Indian Schools in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nWith a view to maintaining public school standards in the classrooms of our Indian schools of the Prairie Provinces, this Department has had further correspondence with the Deputy Ministers of Education for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. A list of the schools, the inspection of which is desired, was submitted to each Provincial Department and the cost of securing the services of the staffs of inspectors was inquired into. Replies have now been received from the Deputy Ministers of Education, and bases have been prepared, upon which definite arrangements can be made when the necessary authority has been obtained from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn Manitoba we are to make arrangements direct with the staff of inspectors. They have been approached and are willing to inspect 19 day and 7 residential schools for a remuneration of $15.00 and expenses for each visit to a school. My estimate for the Manitoba expenditure is $700.00. I have the addresses of the inspectors and a list of the schools each will inspect.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Department of Education have offered to supervise for us the inspection of the Indian schools in that Province. They will add to their present list of public schools, the Indian schools the inspection of which is desired. Inspectors' reports will be made in duplicate and one copy forwarded by the Regina office to Ottawa with the comments of their Chief Inspector. One payment per annum would be made to the Saskatchewan Department of Education, on the basis of a flat rate of $20.00 for day schools and $35.00 for residential schools. The cost for such inspection would be $710.00.\n\nThe proposed arrangement with the Alberta Department of Education is identical with that mentioned above for the Province of Saskatchewan, with the exception that we have not been offered any comments on the inspectors' reports. The expenditure involved at the flat rate of $20.00 for each day and $35.00 for each residential school would be $530.00.\n\n- It will be noted -\nIt will be noted that the total expenditure for the inspection of 46 day and 27 residential schools in the three provinces will be slightly less than $2,000. An item has been placed in the 1922-23 Estimates to cover this expenditure. In each province, certain schools that are remote from the lines of communication have been omitted from the lists offered to the Provincial Departments.\n\nAt present, agents and inspectors of agencies visit the Indian schools at more or less regular intervals. There is a real need for an academic supervision that our staff in the field are unable to offer.\n\nThe proposed arrangement is that the public school inspectors will visit the Indian schools mentioned once a year when they are in the vicinity, and the expenses for which we are responsible (Manitoba) will be kept at a minimum. Inspectors will be informed that it is our aim to maintain public school standards in the classrooms of Indian schools and we will ask them to supervise classroom activities and related matters only. The confidential report of outside-trained public school inspectors will be of infinite value to this Department in our effort to make successful our educational work among the Prairie Province Indian children.\n\nIn June 1920, the Honorable the Superintendent General approved of a similar scheme but requested that you did not commit the Department of Indian Affairs in the matter for the time being.\n\nI beg to recommend that the Superintendent General be approached with a view to having this proposed plan put into effect in the immediate future.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nHon. Charles Stewart.\n\nSupervision of the classroom activities in Indian schools in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces was placed, nearly 40 years ago, in the hands of the provincial public school inspectors, following agreements entered into by this Department with the Provincial Governments. The arrangement still obtains, except in the Province of New Brunswick, where we have a Department inspector possessing the necessary academic qualifications. In British Columbia, also, we have an Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nIn the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta our Indian schools are visited by our agents and by the inspectors of agencies, who are, of course, not specifically qualified to make other than perfunctory inspections of the academic activities. It is desired that the pedagogy of our teachers in the Prairie Provinces be supervised, and only the confidential report of trained inspectors will enable us to maintain public school standards in the classrooms of Indian schools.\n\nTo this end, a list of schools, the inspection of which is desired, was submitted to the Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta Departments of Education; and inquiries were made concerning the expense connected with utilizing the services of public school inspectors. Certain schools that are remote from the lines of communication have been omitted. I wish to have the courses of studies in Indian schools conform to the curricula for the public schools in the various provinces. To attain this end, and to ensure uniformity in teaching methods, our schools should be inspected at least once a year by the provincial inspectors.\n\nThe cost of this supervision in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta will be about $2,000.00 per annum, and an item has been placed in the 1922-23 Main Estimates to cover this expenditure. The proposed arrangement with each of the Prairie Provinces is outlined in the attached memorandum to me from the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nIn June, 1920, the Hon. Mr. Meighen, then Superintendent General, approved of a similar scheme, but requested me not to commit the Department for the time being.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that I be authorized to complete arrangements with the Provincial Departments of Education in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, so that our educational work among the Indian children in these provinces will receive the proper supervision without delay.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 22\n\nWrite Fletcher Manitoba\n\nfor Cottage Inspector\n\nname & address later\n\nArrangement with man is made direct at $15 per school + expenses\n25th March, 1922\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nReferring to my letter of 16th instant, enclosing a list of the Inspectors and Indian Schools in their divisions, I wish to correct the statement regarding the Oak River Sioux at Griswold. This school is in Inspector W.R. Beveridge's division. His post office address is Virden, Manitoba.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Fletcher]\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, March 31, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Fletcher:\n\nI have yours of the 25th instant, referring to the list of inspectors for the Province of Manitoba. I have noted the correction regarding the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School, i.e., that it is in Inspector W. R. Beveridge's division. I have to thank you for this information.\n\nThe authority for the proposed inspection of our schools in the Prairie Provinces has been requested, and I expect to have another communication for you in a few days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. Fletcher, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, April 21, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nAbout 1885 an arrangement was made with the Ontario Department of Education for the inspection of the Indian schools. It was agreed that the remuneration paid to the inspectors would be at the rate of $6.00 per room, plus the actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular route. This arrangement obtains today. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nIn Quebec and the Maritime Provinces an arrangement was made in 1888 with the Departments of Education on similar lines as for Ontario. The rate of remuneration was $5.00 per room plus expenses. Since January 1, 1921, in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces the inspectors have received $7.50 per room plus expenses. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nArrangements have been concluded this year with the Prairie Provinces. In Manitoba we have agreed to pay the inspectors at the rate of $15.00 per classroom plus expenses. In Saskatchewan and Alberta a flat rate of $20.00 per school is being charged for one inspection per year. In the case of the last two provinces, no allowances are made in connection with expenses.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nR. Fletcher Esq.,\nDeputy minister of Education,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly let me know when we are to take over the inspection of these schools, and when we may expect the forms for such reports.\n\nI am planning a trip into the north for sometime before midsummer, and would like to know if possible whether I should plan to include these schools on this trip.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.W. Bartlett\n6th May, 1922\n\n567036\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed enquiry from Inspector G.W.

Lewis\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n567008 Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur Deputy Minister of Education Mr. R. Fletcher has notified me that your department are asking the Public School Department to visit & report on your schools once a year.\n\nIf I am expected to do this in my division this year, I may mention that I shall be in their vicinity about June 1st and as if you supply me with forms therefrom I could do the work then.\n\nOtherwise I must leave it till fall.\nSchools at Black River & Fort Alexander are in my Inspectorate.\n\nPlease let me know you will in this matter and if forms are used let me have the same before May 25th.\n\nI am sir,\n\nYour truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools\nManitoba\nOttawa, May 17, 1922.\n\nTo Indian Agents and Teachers of Indian Schools:\n\nI have to inform you that arrangements have been completed with the Department of Education for your Province for the inspection of Indian schools by the staff of public school inspectors. This action has been taken with a view to standardizing the instruction offered and making it as bright and attractive as possible. Although the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, yet teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and general management of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, the course of studies prescribed by the Provincial Department should be used by each Indian school. Every assistance should be given to the public school inspectors in the discharge of their duties. This inspection by professionally qualified educationists is being done at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAddressed to all Agents and teachers in the Southern parts of the Prairie Provinces and to the Inspectors of Agencies & the Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, May 17th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith, for your information, copy of a circular which is being addressed to all Indian agents and to all teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nSent to:\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq., I. of I. A., Winnipeg, Man.,\nW. Murison, Esq., \" Calgary, Alta.,\nM. Christianson, Esq., \" Regina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 17, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that this Department has completed arrangements with the Manitoba Department of Education for the inspection of the Indian schools that are not remote from the lines of communication. Mr. Fletcher has suggested that we communicate direct with you and offer you information regarding the work to be undertaken and the remuneration.\n\nIt is our wish that you inspect the Indian schools in your inspectorate once during the academic year. You should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications and the pedagogy of our teachers; the progress of the pupils; and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment, with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, as these schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department; however, teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of a teacher, or principal, to carry out any reasonable suggestions made by yourself.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the Department of Indian Affairs. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will be welcomed by us\u2014but the final decision rests with Ottawa.\n\nThe course of studies prescribed by the Manitoba Department of Education should be followed by the classes in Indian schools, but it is desirable to find teachers following a curriculum printed on the back of our school register; but this practice should be discontinued, as all teachers have been instructed that the principal course is to be followed. The registers for Indian schools that have lately come from the press contain more up-to-date instructions. Generally speaking, Indian day schools are closed during the months of July and August.\n\nThe remuneration is at the rate of $15.00 per school, plus your expenses from the nearest point on your regular route of inspection. Your account should be sent in duplicate and should embody not only your fee for the inspection but the travelling expenses. This account, in duplicate, should be supported by receipts for disbursements. These receipts should be taken for all payments over $1.00, whenever possible, except for railway fares, meals\u2014on trains\u2014\non trains, cabs to and from railway stations and other payments at tariff rates.\n\nEnclosed you will find forms for the returns and for your accounts. When these are completed, they should be mailed to W. M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Regina, Sask.\n\nI am of the opinion that you will find the work in our Indian day schools not yet up to the standard as set by the public schools of the province. It is our wish to remedy this condition as soon as possible. It may be necessary, in many instances, to hire teachers with better qualifications. This will, of necessity, mean an increased salary item, and the change will have to be made slowly with the consent of Parliament, which votes the funds for Indian education.\n\nYour inspection reports and expense accounts should be, as stated above, directed to Regina, but any questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAt the present writing, the following Indian schools in your inspectorate are in operation:\n\nLetter Sent to the following Inspectors:-\n\nA. C.

You will remember that, in your communication of the 16th of March, you suggested that I communicate direct with the inspectors, sending them such forms and instructions as were necessary.\n\nAttached you will find a copy of my letter to the inspectors in Manitoba and a circular letter addressed to all Indian agents and to teachers and principals of Indian schools.\n\nI have to thank you for your cooperation and help in our effort to make the instruction offered to our Indian wards more attractive and efficient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Perrier, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just returned from spending the day at the Brandon Indian Industrial School, and I have a certain matter that I desire to take up with you before making my report.\n\nNo doubt you are already aware that this school, owing to its industrial side, operates on what is called the half day plan\u2014that is, a certain number of pupils in the morning and the balance for the afternoon, with some taking both sessions; also that there are two rooms being operated in the school. Now, it is impossible to make a real inspection of the school so as to see the work of all the pupils under two days. Ordinarily we inspect what is called a school under our Provincial Law\u2014a room\u2014in half a day, and I do not feel that I can give this extra time without your authority for the additional expense.\n\nIf it is your desire that I should give the two days my account will be $30.00 instead of $15.00. I am entirely in your hands because I will do what I can in the one day with a bill of $15.00 or the two days with the bill of $30.00. Kindly let me hear from you by return of mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, January 27th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nUpon my return to my desk, your letter of January 15th was brought to my attention. I have noted your request that a two day inspection be allowed in the case of the Brandon Industrial School, in order that a thorough enquiry may be made into the progress of the pupils and the teaching methods in use.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department is aware there are four classes at this institution, and when you forward your report after you have spent two days at the school payment will be allowed at the rate of $15.00 per day.\n\nI regret the delay in answering your communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon Thomas, the General Missionary of the Church of England for Rupert's Land Diocese, asked me to secure for him a copy of the reports submitted to the Department by the Inspectors of Indian Day Schools, that are under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nHe intimated to me that this information is sought, so that they might know just what the Inspector's opinion is as to the efficiency of the teachers, and this would enable the authorities of the Church in rendering this service to a level that would be satisfactory, and to cut out any material that was not satisfactory. In fact the desire is to enable them to co-operate to the best advantage of the schools and pupils and the work of Day School education in general.\n\nThe idea seems to a worthy one, and if it is possible, I intimated to Archdeacon Thomas, that I was certain that the Department would be pleased to comply with this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, April 4, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am instructed by the Deputy Superintendent General to acknowledge your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you refer to the request of Archdeacon Thomas, of the Church of England, for copies of the public school inspectors' reports on the Indian day schools under Anglican auspices.\n\nI have to state that it is not our intention to send copies of the reports received from the local Departments of Education to either church, or our representatives. Whenever there is any action arising out of the reports of the public school inspectors, communications will be addressed to those interested.

Peach.\nEriksdale, Oct 8/23\n\nRussell Ferrier Esq\nDept. Indian Education\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere has been a readjustment of Inspectorial Divisions throughout this province; with the result, among others, of placing all the Indian schools of my former division within the limits of Inspector Wood, with the exception of Lake Manitoba Reserve (Dog Creek) on the other hand, all of Mr. Wood's former Indian schools are within the bounds of my new division. Suppose we will automatically change Indian schools with the readjustment, but I would like specific advice.\n\nI regret that this change will leave me unable to follow up the plans of auspiciously begun early last summer for the improvement of educational and health conditions, and to establish Boys' and Girls' Clubs at Fisher River and Big River Reserve. I will however, explain fully the work planned, to Inspector Wood. I take it that I may rely on the same cooperation along these lines, if I find such projects practicable in any of the schools of the new Division.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.M. Battlott\nOttawa, Oct. 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, in which you inform me of a re-adjustment of Inspectorial Divisions in Manitoba. I have learned, with regret, that you will no longer have the oversight of the Indian schools in the Fisher River Agency, but I trust that Mr. Inspector Tod will carry on with the Boys' and Girls' Clubs, which you have inaugurated. I agree that it will be best for the Inspectors to automatically change Indian schools with the re-adjustment, and I am corresponding with Dr. Fletcher, with a view to ascertaining what other Inspectors are affected.\n\nThis Department will be very grateful if you can arrange for special activity among the Fairford, Lake St. Martin and Little Saskatchewan Day Schools. The Fairford School is by far the best cause and I think you will find splendid work being carried on at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. W. Bartlett, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nEriksdale, Man.\nOttawa, Oct. 15, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nI have learned that there has been a re-adjustment of Public School Inspectorial Divisions in Manitoba. I should be pleased if you would indicate any changes that affect the Indian Schools in the Province, so that I can amend the list which you forwarded under cover of your letter of March 16th, 1922.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n3rd November, 1923\n\nRussell T. Ferrer Esq\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrer,\n\nWe have re-constructed the boundaries of our Inspectorial Divisions and it has just come to my notice that the following transfers should be made in connection with the inspection of schools under your supervision:\n\n(a) The school at Sandy Bay from Inspector A.A. Herrick to Inspector A.B. Fallis, Portage la Prairie;\n\n(b) The school at Portage la Prairie from Inspector Maguire to Inspector A.B. Fallis.\n\nInspector Maguire has been superannuated. If you will send the necessary instructions to Inspector Fallis he will look after these two schools for you.\n\nThere may be other changes due to the change in divisional boundaries. I shall look into this and report to you as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, Nov. 6, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. R. Fletcher has informed this Department that the Indian Residential Schools at Portage la Prairie and Marius are now in your Inspectorial Division. These two institutions have in the past been inspected by Messrs. Maguire and Herrriot, respectively, and I shall be pleased if you will take over the duties which they performed at these schools for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt is our wish that you inspect these residential schools once during each school year. You should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications and the pedagogy of our teachers; the progress of the pupils; and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment with a view to making the institutions more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, as these schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department; however, teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of a teacher, or principal, to carry out any reasonable suggestions made by yourself.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the Department of Indian Affairs and the Church Authorities. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will be welcomed.\n\nThe course of studies prescribed by the Manitoba Department of Education should be followed by the classes in Indian schools. You may find teachers following a curriculum printed on the back of our old school register; but this practice should be discontinued, as all teachers have been instructed that the Provincial course is to be followed. The registers for Indian schools that have lately come from the press contain more up to date instructions. Generally speaking, Indian day schools are closed during the months of July and August.\n\nThe remuneration is at the rate of $15.00 per school, plus your expenses from the nearest point on your regular route of inspection. Your account should be sent in duplicate and should embody not only your fee for the\n\nEncl - inspection -\n\nA. B. Fallis, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\ninspection but the travelling expenses. This account, in duplicate, should be supported by receipts for disbursements. These receipts should be taken for all payments over $1.00, whenever possible, except for railway fares, meals on trains, cabs to and from railway stations and other payments at tariff rates.\n\nEnclosed you will find forms for the returns and for your accounts. When these are completed, they should be mailed to W. M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Regina, Sask.\n\nI am of the opinion that you will find the work in our Indian day schools not yet up to the standard as set by the Public Schools of the Province. It is our wish to remedy this condition as soon as possible. It may be necessary, in many instances, to hire teachers with better qualifications.\n\nYour inspection reports and expense accounts should be, as stated above, directed to Regina, but any questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Nov. 6, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the re-adjustment of Public School Inspectorial Divisions in Manitoba. This Department is pleased to have permission to send the necessary instructions to Mr. Inspector Fallis, in connection with the Sandy Bay and Forteau la Prairie Indian Residential Schools. I shall be pleased to learn, in due course, if there are any other changes, due to your reconstruction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

I shall be pleased to have the name and address of the Inspector for this district, so that I may correspond with him, relative to a supervision of the classroom activities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nFr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, Oct. 16, 1923.\n\nTo Principals of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nThe Department wishes to arrange for a careful and accurate keeping of classroom daily registers. It has been found that many Indian residential schools do not observe this practice; and still others, in the classrooms of which the registers are carefully kept, make no reference to them when the quarterly return is being compiled. In this return there is a column for the purpose of showing the total number of days the pupils attended the classroom during the quarter, and this should be carefully filled in, after reference to the classroom daily register.\n\nThe Department considers that every pupil in a residential school should attend classroom, no matter how pressing the work may be in other departments, at least five half days per week, except in the case of illness or absence from the school. In a quarter of, say 91 days there are approximately 65 school days. Junior pupils, who may be in the classroom both morning and afternoon, will attend a total of 65 days during the quarter; older boys and girls, who have regular duties on the farm or in one of the departments, will attend classroom perhaps only 32\u00bd days; other pupils will show 35, 38\u00bd, 43, 49\u00bd, etc. A separate register must be kept for each classroom and both morning and afternoon an accurate tally should be made.\n\nIt is extremely desirable that the Department have this record; and the column in the quarterly report, showing classroom attendance, should receive meticulous care in the preparation thereof, after careful reference to the classroom registers.\n\nThe column, showing the total number of days pupils were in residence during the quarter, should be made out as heretofore, and the per capita earnings will be determined solely by the figures shown. The classroom attendance column should be prepared just as carefully, so that a discontented parent, or any other interested correspondent can be given correct information without delay.\n\nIf you have not on hand a daily register for each classroom, please make immediate application to the Secretary for copies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Forrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Nov. 22, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of circular letter which has been directed to Principals of all Indian Residential Schools.

Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Nov. 16, 1922 I received a letter from our Deputy Minister of Education to the effect that an agreement had been made between Dominion & Provincial authorities by which two Public School Inspectors would inspect the Indian schools in this province, and that later I would secure from you the necessary forms, etc., etc.\n\nAt that time and up to Aug. 1, 1926 there were no Indian schools in my division, but I have heard from you regarding them.\n\nNow my Division has been changed and I believe there is an Indian school in Lake Winnipeg north of Thompson in the B.M.R.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you at an early date so as to arrange to visit these schools when in the vicinity otherwise it will entail extra cost by having to make a special trip.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector\nOttawa, October 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the inspection of Indian schools.\n\nThe Rosseau Rapids Indian Day School was closed on September 30, 1920, and the Lower Rosseau River School, on June 30, 1921, and consequently you were not requested to visit either of these schools. The following table shows the Indian schools in the vicinity of Hodgson:\n\n1. Fisher River - 27 miles.\n2. Peguis Centre - 8 \"\n3. Peguis South - 3 \"\n4. Peguis North - 16 \"\n\nThese four schools were visited during the month of February and March, last, by Mr. Inspector Tod; but I note from your letter that your division has recently been changed and possibly the above schools are now in your inspectorate. If so, the Department will be pleased to have you visit them next year.\n\nThere is also an Indian school at Jackhead, which has not yet been inspected by any of the provincial inspectors. The Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure in having this school inspected if a special trip is required for the purpose. As you are no doubt aware, the most convenient method of reaching this school is by boat from Selkirk, and, if the Jackhead School happens to be in your inspectorate, you may also visit it.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear further from you if the above schools are in your division.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. Hall-Jones, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\n284 Yale Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\nMANITOBA\n\n284 Yale Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man., Jan. 26/26\n\nSec. Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe your 1-1-6, Oct. 26/25\n\nThe schools of Fisher River,\nPeguis Centre\nPeguis South\nPeguis North\n\nare now in my Inspector's division which includes all six schools in ranges 1, 2, and 3 west of the first meridian. I do not know the location of Jackhead school but I presume it is east of the 1st meridian and not in my territory.\n\nHowever, I should not be able to inspect it at all events for if the Dominion Government cannot afford the expense, certainly a civil servant of a Provincial Govt. could hardly be expected to do so, at his own expense.\n\nI shall be pleased to Inspect the four schools noted above in the course of a few weeks and report same to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nLIST OF MANITOBA SCHOOLS WHICH ARE INSPECTED.\n\n| School                        | Inspector                      |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Brokenhead                   | J.E.S.

Harriott's Inspectorate? We have not received a report from him on this School since 1923.\n\n(b) Should we look to Mr. Fallis to inspect the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School? There was no inspection last year.\n\n(c) With what Inspector may I now correspond regarding Indian Schools in the Fort Alexander district?\n\n(d) Does any Inspector visit the Norway House district in the course of his regular duties? There are four Indian Schools in this vicinity, two of which have never been inspected and the other two were last visited in 1922, by the late A.C. West.\n\nThanking you again for your co-operation and assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Merrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. R.

Indian Education\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of 4th inst. I beg to state that my instructions were to inspect each Indian School every year. This I assumed to mean school year, from September to June.\n\nI inspected the Lake Manitoba Reserve school in the year 1924-25 and expect to do so before the close of the school year 1925-26. If you prefer the inspections by the calendar year or oftener, please advise me accordingly.\n\nI may add that I have been to this school twice in 1925; but sent no report nor even expense sheet. On one occasion the school was full of building material; and on the other there were only two pupils present.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.W. Bartlett\n10th March, 1926\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq  \nSuperintendent of Indian Education  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nIn reply to your favor of 5th instant, I beg to say that Mr. C.K.Rogers, B.A., Gladstone, is now in charge of the territory which includes the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIf you wish the Indian Residential School at Portage la Prairie inspected you should take this up with Inspector A.B.Fallis at Portage la Prairie.\n\nMr. J.E.S.Dunlop, B.A., is now in charge of the territory which includes Indian schools in the Fort Alexander district. He replaces the late Inspector Willows. You may address him in care of this Department for the present.\n\nWe have no inspector making regular visits to Norway House and adjacent territory. It might be possible for me to arrange for one of our men to visit the Indian Schools in that neighborhood for you during the vacation, though it is possible that the schools are closed in July and August which is the time that he could be free for the visit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher  \nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. Fletcher has informed this Department that the Indian Residential School at Marius is now in your inspectorial division. This school was formerly inspected by Mr. A. A. Harriott, and I shall be pleased if you will take over the duties which he performed at this school for the department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt is our wish that you inspect these residential schools once during each school year. You should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications and the pedagogy of our teachers; the progress of the pupils; and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment, with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, as these schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department. However, teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of a teacher, or principal, to carry out any reasonable suggestions made by yourself.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the Department of Indian Affairs and the Church Authorities. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will be welcomed.\n\nThe course of studies prescribed by the Manitoba Department of Education should be followed by the classes in Indian schools.\n\nThe remuneration is at the rate of $15.00 per school, plus your expenses from the nearest point on your regular route of inspection. Your account should be sent in duplicate and should embody not only your fee for the inspection but the travelling expenses. This account, in duplicate, should be supported by receipts for disbursements. These receipts should be taken for all payments over $1.00, whenever possible, except for railway fares, meals on trains, cabs to and from railway stations and other payments at tariff rates.\n\nEnclosed you will find forms for the returns and for your accounts. When these are completed, they should be mailed to W. M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Regina, Sask.\n\nYour inspection reports and expense accounts should be, as stated above, directed to Regina, but any questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nC. K. Rogers, Esq., B.A.,\nSchool Inspector,\nGladstone, Man.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the inspection of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School. I note that you visited this school during the school year. This is quite satisfactory to us.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I may say that, if you visit the school, but owing to certain reasons, you find no merit in making an inspection, this department will be quite prepared to pay any expenses occasioned you on receipt of a certified account in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. Bartlett, Esq.,\nSchool Inspector,\nEriksdale, Man.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in connection with the inspection of Indian schools in Manitoba.\n\nI am communicating with Messrs. Rogers, Fallis and Dunlop regarding the Indian schools in their inspectorates.\n\nAs our schools in the Norway House district are closed for the greater part of July and August, we do not feel that there would be any merit in having one of your inspectors visit them at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. R. Fletcher has informed this Department that the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, also the Fort Alexander and Brokenhead Indian Day Schools, are now in your inspectorate. These schools were formerly inspected by the late Inspector Willows, and I shall be pleased if you will take over the duties which he performed at these schools for the Department of Indian Affairs. A supply of forms for this purpose is enclosed.\n\nThe post office address of both the Fort Alexander Residential and Day Schools is Fort Alexander, Man. The post office address of the Brokenhead School is Scantebury.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. E. S.

The Waterhen Indian Day school is situated about 30 miles by land from Winnipegosis railway station. Please advise how far this school is from the nearest point on your regular inspection route and the probable expense you would incur in visiting the school. On receipt of this information, I will be in a position to decide if we desire this school regularly inspected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRossell T.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th in reference to the inspection of the Waterhen Indian Day School. There is a public school situated across the river from this. I reach this school by boat from Winnipegosis. To inspect the school on the reserve I would have to stay over night there. It would probably cost five dollars extra to do this.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.M. Stevenson\nOttawa, August 26th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, in further reference to the inspection of the Waterhen River Indian Day School.\n\nThis Department will be pleased to have you inspect this school regularly in future. You should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications of the teacher; the progress of the pupils and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teacher of an Indian day school is not directly responsible to the public school inspector, as Indian schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department. However, teacher is expected to carry out the instructions of the Inspector in regard to their work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of the teacher to carry out any favourable suggestions made by yourself.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of teachers rests solely with the Department of Indian Affairs and the church authorities. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will be welcomed.\n\nThe course of study prescribed by the Manitoba Department of Education should be followed, as far as possible, by the classes in the Waterhen school.\n\nI note from your letter of the 19th instant, that your expenses in connection with the inspection of this school will be approximately $5.00. As you were informed in official letter of the 12th instant, we allow $15.00 for inspection plus expenses. Your account should be sent, in duplicate, and should include not only your fee for the inspection, but your travelling expenses. This account should be supported by receipts for disbursements.\n\nEnclosed you will find forms for your report and for your account. When these are completed, they should be mailed to W.M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Regina, Sask. Any questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.M.

Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa-Man.\n\nDear Sir - I do not know yet just where the Swan Lake Indian Day School is located, as I do not motor that road, the better road going north of the reserve. But I have Maraipolis about 5 miles west and Swan Lake about 5 mls. east, both of which I have done this year. I make Somerset my headquarters for that part of my district and it is about 10 mls. from Somerset. Kindly send any forms you require soon as possible as I have completed most of my work on that corner of my field, but will have another trip to make to Somerset this fall. Give me the location of the school in your reply.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n422-6th St., Brandon Oct. 18th-26\nOttawa, October 21, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with further reference to the inspection of the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThis Department will be pleased to have you inspect this school regularly in future.

As I shall be down in that end of my field finishing up my work for this year, I wondered if you wished me to visit the Swan Lake Indian school this year. If so send the forms for the report soon as possible. If you prefer that the inspection wait till the spring it will suit me. Has this school been inspected this year and if so by whom?\n\nI shall be making my last trip down there the week of Dec 13 to 17th. In your last letter you asked the distance from my nearest point. I replied that the Swan Lake school was about 5 mls. from Mariapolis and about 5 mls. from Swan Lake and about 10 mls. from Somerset, which is my centre for that part of my district.\n\nSo if you would let me know your wishes before Dec. 12th I shall be able to plan accordingly.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1926.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, I beg to say that the following letter was sent to you on October 31st.\n\nThis Department will be pleased to have you inspect this school regularly in future.

Morrison of this town, who is going to Brandon.\n\nLooking over the map of my Division, I find only two reserves; but am informed that there is a two-room Indian School at Birdle. I do not know whether there are pupils on the Reserve near Kildonan and at River Point, or whether the Birdle School takes their children. Mr. J.H. Plaice took over by Special Resolution all the Inspectors of Birdle; and will be looked after by the Indian Schools there also.\n\nThere is a few days to get at the detail of my report on Intelligence Tests. I intend to carry on the same work here without charge to the Department, if they will allow the cost of stationery - about four cents per pupil.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 20th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Bartlett:\n\nWhen signing correspondence to the Public School Inspectors of Manitoba, I have often wondered whether I am omitting to mention degrees.

O.) - 30 miles from Mafeking.\n\nI would appreciate your advising if one of your inspectors visits any of the white schools in the vicinity of the Indian schools mentioned and whether or not these Indian schools could be inspected without incurring too large an expenditure for travelling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nIn reply to your favor of 18th instant I beg to say that we very seldom have an Inspector at Grand Rapids and we never have one nearer Chippewa than that place. Our Inspector goes to Safeking and it would be possible for him to inspect Shoal River School at Falcon Rapids without undue expense. If you wish I shall be glad to insist on our Inspector in this area to inspect the Shoal River School the next time he is in Safeking.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, January 27th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, advising that you will arrange to have the Shoal River Indian Day School visited by one of your inspectors.\n\nI note that it is not practicable to make arrangements for the inspection of the Grand Rapids and Chemahawin Indian Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI would like to go up to inspect our school at Norway House early in June if I can arrange it. I can get to Warren's Landing on the Bradbury leaving here about June 1st, but I would still have to get on up from there some way. Perhaps you could meet me at Norway House and meet me.\n\nBut Col. H. J. Stevenson, who is in the Forestry Service made a suggestion to me. He said that if you would like to have some of those schools inspected from Bireau River, so that you might secure a R.C.A.F. plane to take me to them. He said he thought they would be willing to do that.\nIf this could be arranged I could inspect our own school while at Norway House. This suggestion was made only today so I am writing at once. I should be glad to hear from you as soon as possible for I need to know definitely before the Bradbury leave on the 1st. Any suggestion from you would be welcome. If you felt it better to wire do so collect and I shall appreciate it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.E.D. Dunlop\nOttawa, May 23, 1931.\n\nJ. E. S.

Plews, B. A., who has recently advised us that, from the first of the current year, you are taking charge of the district in which these schools are located.\n\nIn visiting these schools, you should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications and methods of the teacher; the progress of the pupils and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment, with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teachers of Indian day schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspector, as Indian schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department. However, a teacher is expected to carry out the instructions of the inspector in regard to the work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of any teacher to carry out your suggestions.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of teachers rests solely with the Department of Indian Affairs and the church authorities. However, recommendations from you in this connection will receive consideration.\n\nThe Department allows the sum of $15.00 a classroom for inspection once a year, plus expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip. Your account should be forwarded in triplicate and should include, not only your fee for the inspection, but a statement of your travelling expenses, together with receipts for all disbursements over $1.00. If you use your own car, you should show the mileage travelled and request payment at the rate of eight cents (8\u00a2) a mile, which is the amount allowed by the Government.\n\nEnclosed are copies of the report form which you should use when visiting the schools mentioned. Following each inspection, one copy of this form should be forwarded direct to this office.\n\nAny questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to The Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Now that I have taken over Inspector Dunlop's former division lying east of Lake Winnipeg I wish to know whether it is the wish of your department that I visit the Indian schools in this area. Will you kindly indicate the names of the schools to be visited. Some, I believe, lie along the shores of Lake Winnipeg as far north as Norway House.\n\nHave you special report forms for this type of school?\n\nI am,\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Jas. H. Illeves\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Jas. H. Plewe, Provincial School Inspector, asking for instructions as to what Indian schools the Department wish him to visit.\n\nI might just add that I do not think it has been the policy of the Department to have the Provincial School Inspectors inspect the schools north on the shores of Lake Winnipeg, and would suggest that Mr. Plewe confine his work only to the Brokenhead Bay School at Scantebury, Fort Alexander Day School and R.C. Residential School at Pine Falls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

Phelan  \nChief of Training Division  \nDept. of Indian Affairs - Ottawa\n\nDear Mr. Phelan - Re- Indian Residential School - Brandon - Man.\n\nI have taken over the inspectorial division of Inspector J.B. Morrison and have been informed by my department that this school comes under my supervision for promotion purposes. In my previous field, I inspected the Swan Lake Indian Reserve Day School. As this is a Residential School, you may have different report forms etc. and I would be pleased to have instructions.\n\nI understand that there are several teachers at this Brandon school and that classes are held in the mornings only, with industrial work in the afternoons. In Manitoba, there are no departmental exams in grades 8-9 and 10 - (grade XI here is matriulation) and standing can be obtained only on standing obtained on the work of the year and on the recommendation of the inspector. If there are any of these grades at the Brandon school, it would be necessary to have some check-up on the work during the year.\n\nDo you wish inspections made in the autumn term or in the spring term or both?\n\nTo whom do you wish reports sent and might I have supply of report forms for the residential schools?\n\nWhat is the rate of allowance for inspection of this school? Any instructions or suggestions will be gladly received. Thanks.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]: 1/1/67\nOttawa,\nNovember 25, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Rogers:\n\nIn the list forwarded to you in my letter of the 22nd instant it was noted that Mr. W. S. Lockhart would inspect the Brandon Residential School.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Inspector G. H. Robertson in which he states that the Brandon School is in his inspectorate.\n\nThe list forwarded with my letter of November 22 should, therefore, be changed to read as follows:\n\nMr. W. S. Lockhart to inspect Swan Lake Indian Day School\nMr. G. H. Robertson to inspect Brandon Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. K.

This inspection should be made during the spring term.\n\nThe former inspector, Mr. Morrison, was allowed $15.00 for each inspection of the Brandon School. The necessary report forms will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nGrades 6, 9 and 10 are taught in the Brandon School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H.

You should also report fully regarding the vocational training that is given both boys and girls. You should encourage the Principal to give serious consideration to increasing the vocational training facilities as it is our desire to have the training at Indian residential schools as practical as possible in order to equip the pupils for life on the Reserve.\n\nWhile Indian residential schools are controlled solely by this Department at the same time teachers and other members of the staff are expected to carry out any instructions given by the inspector in connection with the training that the pupils receive.

Hatcher\nDear Mr. Hatcher:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant I may say that due to their isolated location it has not been the practice to have all Indian schools in Manitoba regularly inspected by the Provincial Inspector. I believe the only two schools that we have had regularly inspected, and which lie within your district, are the Big Eddy Day School and The Pas Day School. The Big Eddy Day School is located near The Pas, Man.\n\nAn amount of $15.00 a school is allowed for inspection plus expenses from the nearest point on the regular inspection trip of the Inspector. Following the inspection an account in triplicate should be forwarded for payment and should include not only the inspection fee but a statement of travelling expenses together with receipts for all disbursements over $1.00.

I called at the other school but the teacher was sick and I was unable to make an inspection.\n\nOwing to the very bad condition of the roads since the snowfall it was very difficult to reach the two schools near Gypsumville. I planned to visit both in one day but was unable to do so.\n\nYou will notice an item for $1.45 which I paid to one of the Indians for showing me the road to Lake St. Martin School. Without his assistance in getting through several very bad places in the road I would have been unable to make the inspection.\n\nSince there were insufficient copies of the expense sheet sent me I have made a third copy. I also made copies of the bill for board and room.\n\nI trust that you will find this satisfactory. If possible I will try to visit the other school before the end of the term.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJohn M. Brown\n\nP.S.

Inspection No. 76952 came to hand yesterday to cover the expenses. I am sending herewith a triplicate statement for the inspection of four Indian schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.O. Bartlett\nInspector of Schools\n\n770 McMillan Ave\nJanuary 29, 1945.\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe Provincial Inspector's Reports\n\nAbout a year ago I was favoured with a copy of the report which the Manitoba Provincial Inspector supplied to the Department after his inspection of the Elkhorn School. It was very encouraging for us to note his commendation of the work being done by the three teachers, and I was glad to be able to pass on some of his comments for their encouragement.\n\nThis is the only occasion on which I seem to have seen anything of the kind in this office, and I wonder if it would not be a good thing if a copy of all such reports could be supplied to us. We are most anxious to maintain the educational standards of the schools administered by this Commission at the highest possible point and we have been very much encouraged by the type of teacher we have been able to secure. It would assist us greatly if we had the verdict of a competent inspector in regard to the quality of the work being done in each case. The Principal reports to us as to matters concerning the general spirit of the teacher and the class, but the Inspectors' Reports would be exceedingly valuable.\n\nIs it possible for such an arrangement to be made?\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, February 5, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to forwarding to your office copies of the inspectors' reports on schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C.\n\nIt has never been our practice to send out these reports in a general way. Our usual custom is to write to the Principal or the Agent regarding any adverse remarks made by an inspector. However, if there is any of your schools in which you are particularly interested and desire to watch the teacher's work, I will be glad to hear from you and will endeavour to supply you with any information from the inspector's report that we feel would meet your requirements.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been advised by the Department of Education of Manitoba to get in touch with you with respect to inspection of Indian Schools in my territory. The Department of Education have suggested to me that they would like me to co-operate with you in any way possible, and I would like to express my personal desire to see a large measure of sympathy and understanding between our two Departments in handling Indian and related problems.\n\nIf there is any work in my line in which I may be of service to you, I trust you will advise me of it, and send the required information and forms, etc. I can maintain personal contact with your Mr. S. Lovell and Dr. R. F. Yule of The Pas if you desire. My territory covers all provincial schools in the territory north of Township 44.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB. Scott Bateman,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, November 8, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nI have a letter from Mr. B. Scott Bateman, Inspector of Schools, The Pas, Man., informing the Department of his willingness to assist us with respect to inspection of Indian schools in his territory. His territory covers all provincial schools north of Township 44. Please let me know what Indian schools are in Mr. Bateman's territory, and, if they have not been previously inspected by a provincial inspector, you should state if you consider that such arrangement should be made for the future. An immediate reply will be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nNovember 16th, 1946.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 2, I beg to advise that I have been speaking to Mr. Scott Bateman, and would appreciate having the Indian Schools inspected when Mr. Bateman is in the vicinity.\n\nI would not propose that we go to a lot of expense in taking Mr. Bateman around, as our schools in this North country are scattered, and it would cost a considerable amount of money, but as I told Mr. Bateman, in our conversation, any time that I am travelling north, and he has Provincial work to do, I would be very glad to have him accompany me, providing he pays his own proportion of the expenses. In doing this, there is a possibility that it will cut my expenses, also his, in half, on some of these trips.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

It appears that the account is in error of $2.50; therefore, this amount is being deducted from $82.12. A cheque for $79.62 will be forwarded at the beginning of next week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.F. Kerr,\nInspector of Indian Day Schools,\n375 Beaverbrook St.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\n\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nJune 25th, 1946.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 22, with forms required in connection with inspection of Indian Schools. It is noted that the list of your schools in my territory does not include Split Lake, Nelson House (Roman Catholic and United Church Schools), Cross Lake (Roman Catholic and United Church Schools), York Factory, Shamattawa, and perhaps some schools in your Norway House Agency. Did you wish me to skip these schools, or is their exclusion from the list an oversight?\n\nEnclosed herewith are reports on two of the schools which you listed, Big Eddy and The Pas Day Schools. It will not be possible for me to visit any others this term, but I will do what I can in the fall.\n\nDuring the year I made informal inspections of the Boarding School at Norway House, the Day School at Nelson House, the Day School at Cross Lake, and inspection of the property at Cedar Lake (Chemawawin School). Since I did not have your report forms I have not all the required facts, but for your information I can say that all were functioning normally, with signs of overcrowding at Nelson House where the enrollment was 49. At Cedar Lake the building is in poor condition, and though normally locked I believe it is being used for community activities at times, as the seats are all stored in the attic.\n\nIncidentally, if this school at Cedar Lake is not going to be reopened in the near future, it might be advantageous to move the desks away to some place where they are urgently needed. There are 30 of them, of modern design, chairs with arms and drawers, and hardly used. However I have a list of over 40 children in the Chemawawin school constituency who are at present without school facilities; four of these are Half Breeds, the remainder Treaty.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Scott Bateman,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, July 9, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Bateman:\n\nYour letter of June 25, with attached Inspector's Reports, has been received.\n\nWe will give further consideration to your inspecting our other schools in Northern Manitoba.\n\nThe reports on Big Eddy and The Pas Day Schools have been read with interest. Remarks have been made and drawn to the attention of Indian Agent Lovell. It is hoped that conditions in both of these schools can be improved thereby. There is no excuse whatsoever for the condition of the toilets. Pails, disinfectant, soap, mops and scrubbing brushes are all available if the teacher will only requisition for them. This requisition form is passed to this office by the agent concerned and is always approved for expenditure. I am letting you know this, so that in future you will be in a position to remind teachers that a lack of such sanitary supplies is entirely their own fault.\n\nAs far as the Chassawin Indian Day School at Cedar Lake is concerned, I am not in a position to state whether it will be re-opened this fall term. I have written to the Bishop of Brandon, who nominates the teacher for this school, to enquire if he has anyone in mind for the position of teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. Scott Bateman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR HAMILTON\nOttawa, July 9, 1946.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nInspection of Indian Schools in Northern Manitoba\n\nRef. your 205-11 of 13 May, 1946.\n\nWe have received from Mr. Batesman his Inspector's Reports on The Pas Day School and on Big Eddy Day School. Our comments on his reports have been passed to Indian Agent Lovell at The Pas.\n\nIn his accompanying letter Mr. Batesman raises the point of inspecting other Indian schools in Northern Manitoba. His letter reads:\n\n\"It is noted that the list of your schools in my territory does not include Split Lake, Nelson House (Roman Catholic and United Church Schools), Cross Lake (Roman Catholic and United Church Schools), York Factory, Shamattawa, and perhaps some schools in your Norway House Agency. Did you wish me to skip these schools, or is their exclusion from the list an oversight?\"\n\nWould you kindly make a check with the Department of Education of the Province as to the extent of Mr. Batesman's territory. Realizing travelling expenses in Northern Manitoba are very high, it is hardly feasible to have him inspect those Indian schools which are at some considerable distance from his Provincial Schools.\n\nYour comments on having Mr. Batesman inspect these other schools would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Mr. Bateman's Inspection Work\nThe Bas Agency - Your file 1-1-6,\nMan., July 9th, 1946.\n\nI was at Split Lake, Nelson House, Cross Lake, York Factory and Shamattawa last year and do not recall a white school at any of these points. In fact there is neither a white nor an Indian School operating at York or Shamattawa.\n\nThe expense involved in travelling to any of these points, either by canoe or plane, is high. The Indian Agents (Mr. Lovell and Mr. Goodman) visit and inspect the schools once or twice a year, consequently I do not think it necessary to send Mr. Bateman and so incur this added heavy expense.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nOttawa, July 22, 1946.\n\nB. Scott Bateman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nManitoba.\n\nInspection of Indian Schools in Northern Manitoba.\n\nFurther to our letter of July 9th.\n\nIt is considered that the expenses involved in your inspecting, by canoe or plane, the schools at Split Lake, York Factory and Shamattawa, would be very high. It is understood that there are no Provincial schools near any of these points. However, if you are in Winnipeg, you might further discuss this matter with Mr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public Building.\n\nThe Chumawewin Indian Day School at Cedar Lake will probably be reopened this September as a teacher has just been nominated for this position.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJuly 26, 1946\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nChief, of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThanks for calling my attention to the discrepancy in my expense account. On the provincial form daily totals are extended on horizontal rather than vertical lines. I note that after following the C.T. 110 for the first portion I lapsed into the error which resulted in duplication. The incident indicates, of course, inability to adapt oneself to a new situation - probably one of the first symptoms of senility!!!\n\nI have enjoyed my brief association with Indian Education. I have been assigned a new field and am not sure whether there is a classroom from your Branch included therein. I presume that my good friend Dr. Moore is working with you this summer. I am looking forward to seeing his report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. Kerr\nInspector of Schools\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Meeting with Manitoba Provincial School Inspectors.\n\nIn a short address, I explained to the Provincial Inspectors our aims of education and briefly outlined the methods by which the Department expects to achieve these aims. This short talk was followed by questions. The Inspectors showed a very keen interest in the welfare of the Indian but were at a loss to know what was required of them in the line of inspection.\n\nThe question of the metis was discussed. Some thought that it was inhuman the way these people were treated. The attention of these gentlemen was drawn to the fact that these people were the responsibility of the Province and not the responsibility of the Federal Government.\n\nCertain questions were asked about Treaty Indians. This question was answered by Inspector Hamilton who had accompanied me at this meeting.\n\nQuestions were asked about Indians who were attending white schools. I presumed that reference was made to the Indians working off the Reserves. I explained that the Department was prepared to pay the Per Capita Cost for these students. Explanation of the manner of establishing the amount of Per Capita Cost followed. The method as well as the system seemed to meet their approval.\n\nI further explained that in cases where schools for the Metis were established the Department was ready to follow the same system of payment for the Indians attending, were there no Indian school available.\n\nI returned the following day to meet the Inspectors who inspect our schools. The questions were mostly on what schools they should visit and what kind of reports they should make. I outlined that these schools should be treated as any other schools in their Inspectorate. Reference was made to conventions; would the Department allow some of our teachers to illustrate the work they were doing and demonstrate their methods of teaching. I informed the Inspectors that the Department did not object to this, on the contrary, we were anxious to have our teachers attend teacher meetings whenever possible.\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE.\n\nI found the school neat and well-ordered; the children showed evidence of good spirit. I believe that Mr. Huston has tackled his work in an intelligent and progressive manner. My special aim was to study the conditions that would facilitate the introduction of Manual Training and have it integrated with the academic work. They have near the school a well-finished garage. It was decided that a few changes should be undertaken before September. The Principal is to submit an estimate of the cost of these changes, at his earliest convenience. I have sent a special form for the Manual Training teacher to complete and to be returned to this office for consideration.\n\nCOWESSESS.\n\nI have already reported last year on the crowded condition and the machinery at this school. They have no work-shop suitable for Manual Training instruction. The appointed Instructor is carrying on as best as he can under the present circumstances. It is, therefore, imperative that a small shop be provided to carry on the work. I suggested that it would be advantageous for the Instructor to follow the general shop course given this summer in Brandon or Winnipeg. I doubt, however, that this man will prove unsatisfactory. The fact that he is an Indian should possibly be given consideration, but the welfare of the class should not be sacrificed. His case should be carefully reviewed.\n\nQU'APPELLE.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Qu'Appelle School was authorized to make improvements to the shop. I wish to state here that they have at present a splendid shop. It will, however, require interior decorating which they hope to be able to do before the opening of the school next September. There are three Manual Training Instructors at this school. The problem of integration is rather different when the Instructors have not been trained for this work, (one of the Instructors followed the course given by the Department last November).\n\nThis school has a good start and I hope that by my next visit the improvements will be more prominent. It must be kept in mind that the shop was repaired by the pupils themselves. Greater benefits would have been obtained from this work if the mathematics, etc., had been integrated to a greater extent. It was, however, as far as it went very good training for the young people and I wish to state again that they have made a good job of their shop. I have encouraged a qualified teacher at this school to attend the general shop course to be given in Brandon or Winnipeg this summer.\nThe Manual Training students deserve commendation for the work done on their shop. This was good training for them. More planning, however, should have been done by the pupils themselves. In fact, a class discussion followed by a sketch competition would have brought into play many educational factors. The pupils plan to paint the interior of their shop this fall.\n\nThere are three Instructors employed at this school. One of these assisted at the short course given by the Department last November. The problem of integration is rather difficult when the Instructors have no training for this work.\n\nMUSCOGEEUAN.\n\nThe Instructor, Mr. Lefleur, was sick in the hospital at the time of my visit. The Assistant Principal was in charge of the Manual Training, in the meantime.\n\nThe shop, which is in an old building is not satisfactory. A shop will have to be built, if this work is to receive satisfactory attention.\n\nIt will be recalled that this school has been connected with the Saskatchewan Power Commission for electric service. It is a one phase. The extractor sent by the Beaver Company is run by a three phase motor. After studying local conditions, I believe that the best method is to have the three phase motor changed to a single phase, as all the other motors are single phase.\n\nSANDY BAY.\n\nThe remodeling of the shop has been carried out according to instructions given last November. The work has been done by the pupils and they have done a good job.\n\nThe pupils have done splendid work. Ship ladders, wash stands, etc., were very well done. The pupils show a great deal of interest and enthusiasm for their work.\nKENORA.\n\nA very small attempt has been made at teaching Manual Training at this school. The pupils are endeavouring to make space in the basement which might prove satisfactory as a temporary arrangement. A shop, preferably separated from the school, will have to be provided if satisfactory progress is to be expected in the teaching of Manual Training. The instructor, Mr. Potvin was absent in Winnipeg when I visited this school. I have since been informed that he has left the Indian service to take a position in Winnipeg.\n\nCECILIA JEFFREY.\n\nManual Training is being taught at this school in the Senior class. This arrangement is very unsatisfactory. Here again a shop will have to be provided if satisfactory progress is to be expected in teaching Manual Training. The Principal informed me that that he has put an advertisement in the paper for a Manual Training teacher, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Presbyterian Indian Residential School requires for September last a Manual Training Teacher. Emphasis on practical application. Some extra-curricular activities. Strong character, good health and interest in boys essential. Salary $1,000 per year and board, room, laundry, etc. Also, one Lady Teacher for Primary Classroom (emphasis on teaching English). Good character, health, etc. Certificate desirable but not essential. Salary $650.00 per year plus room, board, laundry etc. A married couple (without children) would be considered for above two positions.\"\n\nI doubt that under the conditions of the advertisement a satisfactory Instructor will be obtained.\n\nFORT FRANCES.\n\nManual Training activities are carried on in the boy's playroom, as they have no adequate shop. I would make the same remark as I made for Cecilia Jeffrey and Kenora. Some work has been done such as cut-outs, etc., They kept the pupils usefully occupied and interested. However, very little organized training is taking place. It will be recalled that Mr. Allard was obtained temporarily as Instructor and I feel that unless he takes some training in this line he will prove unsatisfactory. I intend to take this up again with Reverend Provincial Father Lavigne, the question of Instructors, when I meet him at the beginning of August.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[A.J. Boucet]\n\nOttawa, July 3, 1946.\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\n\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nJanuary 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe Inspection of Indian Schools.\n\nMy itinerary for the next two months will require visits at a number of isolated points where you may have schools. When time permits I propose to visit these schools for purposes of inspection. Since the trip is primarily for performance of my regular duties no transportation or other expense except that of inspection would be involved for your Department.\n\nPoints to be visited are:\n\n- Oxford House, Feb. 10 - 11\n- Shamattawa, Feb. 11 - 12\n- York Factory Feb. 13 - 14\n- Split Lake Feb. 15\n- Nelson House Feb. 16 - 21\n- Scotch Indian Feb. 22 - 23\n- Duck Lake Feb. 24 - 25\n- Brochet Feb. 26 - 27\n- Pukatawagan Feb. 28 - 29\n- Cross Lake\n- Island Lake Some time in March.\n\nVisits of inspection will be made at points like Norway House, Cross Lake and Grand Rapids where there are Provincial Schools, as time permits, and at no transportation expense to your Department as I have to visit them regularly anyway.\n\nIf this arrangement does not meet with your approval, please so inform me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB. Scott Bateman,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, February 3, 1947.\n\nInspection of Schools\n\nDear Mr. Bateman:\n\nI have just received your letter of January 30 and wish to inform you that your schedule will certainly be satisfactory for our Indian schools. I am writing immediately to Mr. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, requesting that he inform the agents and teachers of your proposed visits.\n\nI would particularly like you to check with the teachers to ensure that they have ordered adequate supplies of the textbooks listed in volume one of our Indian School Bulletin. In some instances these texts may not have reached them yet - but this is entirely due to a publisher shortage of the Curriculum Foundation Readers and the Jolly Number Series. As soon as these are received we will send them out.\n\nAnother item I particularly wish stressed with our teachers is that their classrooms be as attractive and colourful as possible. We are endeavouring to make available to them posters and other illustrative material which will do much to provide an educational stimulus for a broadening outlook on the part of our Indian children.\n\nI will look forward in anticipation of the arrival of your inspector's reports - realizing that in many cases conditions will be far from perfect.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. Scott Bateman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, February 3, 1947.\n\nMr. A. G.

Scott Bateman,\nInspector of Schools.\n\nEncl. 2\nOttawa, February 27, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Bateman:\n\nI have received and carefully read your reports on school inspections at Oxford House and Split Lake. I hope to be writing to you in the near future concerning the new schools we intend building in your inspectorate this year.\n\nBy now the school supplies ordered for Oxford House should have reached there. We arranged for the books to reach Ilford by January first. The Northern Transportation Company was requested to handle them by tractor train from there. The Basic Readers of the Curriculum Foundation Series were being supplied to these schools. Thirty-six books were ordered from Moyer's in Winnipeg and our records show that these were delivered to Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg on January 4 and that they too were shipped to Ilford for onward routing by tractor train. It is unfortunate that all these supplies have not yet arrived to alleviate conditions at these schools.\n\nWe are writing to Dr. Dorey of the United Church concerning Mr. Loesen and to Bishop Lorthouse about Reverend Mr. Cowley. You will be receiving notification in the near future of the new teachers' salary scales which we intend taking into effect on the first of September, 1947, and which it is hoped will attract a better class of teacher into our day schools.\n\nI appreciate your frankness in submitting these reports and feel that they will do much to bring about a needed improvement in the education of the Indians of your inspectorate.\n\nB. Scott Bateman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\nWe will arrange to have forwarded to you cheque covering your inspection expenses.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Rev. Cowley is doubtless working hard in the community, but conducting a school properly calls for the expenditure of much time and the application of considerable professional skill. He obviously lacks either the time or the skill, or both. I do not know the amount of your annual investment in education at Split Lake, but I am sure that you are not getting value for it, so far as the school is concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB.

The understanding which we reached on that occasion was to combine the educational work for the Indian and Half-Breed children in the one unit. Progress along this line appeared to be satisfactory and while we chose to regard this move at Big Eddy as being experimental, the practical advantage of following this plan at other points is evident.\n\nThe case of South Indian Lake, a settlement about 150 miles North of Wabodeen, is being brought to our attention quite frequently. The school population within a mile and a half radius of the central point is reported as being 61 Indian children and 25 Half-Breed children.\n\nIt is an isolated community and if a building is to be erected, supplies would have to go in by winter freight within the next six weeks.\n\nI would be pleased to have the views of your Department on the advisability of providing the people there with a school. We are ready to co-operate in sharing in the costs of operating the school and to render such assistance as we can in its administration.\n\nTrusting you will let us have the benefit of the opinion of your officials on this proposal at an early date, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) J.C. Dryden,\nMinister of Education.\nOttawa, February 23, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Moffat:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 17th.\n\nWe are very pleased to receive reports of these schools and are hastening to send you a large supply of inspection forms. There is no change with regard to the policy of inspecting these schools and I am arranging to have your expense account passed for payment.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your comments with regard to these schools and will do everything possible to remedy the defects which you have found.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am enclosing reports on seven six rooms recently inspected at Cross Lake and Norway House. I do not expect to be able to do many more Indian schools this year due to pressure of other work. However, I may be able to do the Ross Lake Mission school at Norway House on my next visit to that point.\n\nIf possible, I would like to have a more adequate supply of forms for reporting Indian schools. The six forms recently sent me are exhausted and one room remains unreported for lack of the necessary forms.\n\nShould there be any change in policy with regard to the inspection of schools at any time, I would like to be informed of it. I have been going forward with the inspections wherever it has been possible on the assumption that the policy of your Department is the same as last year. I note from your correspondence with Mr. Bateman that it was then your wish that Indian schools should be inspected whenever it could be done without incurring undue expense in travel.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nGimli, Man.,\nApril 6, 1948.\n\nMr. H.A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was appointed an Inspector of Schools for Manitoba in May, 1948. The list of schools that I was given did not include any of the Indian Schools in my area. On June 17-19 last year I visited Berens River to inspect the Provincial school there and also inspected the two Indian Schools - the Roman Catholic Mission School and the United Church Mission Mission School.\n\nI have good reason to believe that there are Indian schools at Hole River and at Bloodvein. I am planning to visit the schools along the Lake Winnipeg starting the first part of June and I would appreciate any further information you may have regarding the inspection of these Indian schools. Dr. Ahoore has sent me a number of tests to be administered by me on my first visit to these schools.\n\nIs there also an Indian school at Poplar River?\n\nI was given to understand that the Dominion government does pay us a set fee for inspecting these schools. I suppose that I am too late in being able to get this for the two schools I inspected last summer, but I would like to know what procedure should be followed.\n\nI would very much appreciate any information that you can give me.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn H. Maclean\nApril 29, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Menzies:\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the inspection of Indian schools. If the under mentioned schools are in your district, we have an arrangement with the Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba by which you can inspect each of the following schools once a year:\n\nBerens River R.C.; Berens River U.C.; Hollowater River; Bloodvein and Poplar River.\n\nAll these schools are in the Clandeboye Agency and before visiting them, it would be advisable to ascertain from Mr. R.E. Olson, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Selkirk, Manitoba., if they are in operation.\n\nSome of our schools are closed occasionally owing to our inability to secure teachers and, therefore, it is always advisable to check with the Superintendent before making an unnecessary trip.\n\nPayment is allowed you at the rate of $15.00 for each inspection, plus actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your inspection trip to the Indian school visited. Your account should be submitted in duplicate.\n\nUnder separate cover we will forward you a supply of report forms; one of these forms should be forwarded to us after each inspection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nJohn H.

I was particularly with the equipment for the playground, which is a very important phase of school activity.\n\nSr. Vigoureux is in charge of this room; there are 25 children enrolled and there were 6 present. This poor attendance was due to parents away fishing and to an outbreak of chicken pox (three families). The children do very fine work in printing, drawing and writing. Their reading lacks expression and this is one part of their training that is so valuable; the sisters have used school concerts as a means of stimulating pupil interest in reading. There has been some improvement in this but much still remains to be done.\n\nI was impressed by the work these Sisters are doing, not only for the children but also for the adults. Sewing is taught to the girls and some fine exhibits are to be seen. The women are taught to use the loom and some of them are making their own patterns; they have been taught to re-model clothing and have a good supply of Army clothing on hand.\n\nThere is a school garden, and the basic idea is to interest the children in this activity. The Mission has as well a few cows, tractor equipment for their small farm, sawing mill and icehouse.\n\nSr. Vigoureux aided by the Sisters and Fathers of this Mission have worked very hard to improve the lot of these people, and also in getting these people to send the children to school. A sound projector has been obtained and films both sound and silent can be shown.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLee Owen\nI have no doubt that there are many times when the Sisters have been discouraged by the responses that they get, but they have persevered and have done very fine work in their efforts to help these less fortunate people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn H.

I was more than surprised with the very fine school at this point; it is one of the best schools I have visited during the past winter.\n\nThe toilets are too far from the school building. Would it be possible to consider installing indoor toilets? The rock and soil formation would have to be examined carefully to use a Field System; and the same is true for the Flush Type System, the river is quite close and could be utilized in this connection.\n\nMr. Street has just completed his eighteenth year in this school district. He is very sincere in his work and is also a very good organizer. The work in Nature Study is definitely good, and the pupils have made their own designs. The children were able to draw a map free-hand very quickly and accurately. Generally the drawing, printing and writing are exceptionally good.\n\nI was able to hear Mr. Street conduct lessons in all the Grades during my visit. The children are very shy, and they read in such a low voice that it is very hard to follow them. Their reading generally does lack expression.\n\nTwo children in this school\u2014Wilson Goosehead and Harriet Berens\u2014have only one good eye. Would it not be possible for these two children to have a thorough medical examination and ascertain, if possible what the trouble is? There appears to be a film over the eye of one of these children, and they may also suffer to some extent from malnutrition.\n\nThe work that is being done here is exceptionally good. Since there is such a fine basement would it be possible to use it for instructional\n\nSee over\nwork in manual training and elementary wood work? These children are very adept in using their hands, and Mr. Street and I discussed this feature and think it might be well to place considerable emphasis on work of this type.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.H.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe: Indian Schools in the Fisher River Agency\n\nI have your letter of June 24 in which reference is made to proposed administrative changes in the above schools.\n\nIt is gratifying to learn that the matter of the education of Indian children is receiving careful consideration, and that plans for improvement are being formulated.\n\nThe suggestion regarding a supervising principal would appear to be a forward step. Such a plan would provide advice and guidance of a professional nature to teachers, and would be of special benefit to those teachers who lack experience, or who, having teaching experience, are unfamiliar with conditions in Indian Schools. It would have the effect of giving direction to the teachers regarding courses of study, thus eliminating much of the wasted effort that is now prevalent. As outlined in your letter, the plan, presumably would give to the supervising principal some authority in the matter of ordering supplies and would expedite their delivery to the classrooms. This would result in increased efficiency.\n\nI believe that Mr. T. W. Emerson would do good work in the position mentioned. He has had considerable experience in school administration and is familiar with classroom problems. His limited experience in Indian Schools would be a disadvantage in his dealings with teachers who have had considerable experience in Indian Schools. However, his genial nature would enable him\nto secure effective co-operation without antagonizing these teachers. His interest and enthusiasm would have a salutary effect on all teachers.\n\nUnder separate cover, I am forwarding reports on Indian Schools visited during the month of June. I am of the opinion that the appointment of a supervising principal would eliminate many of the weaknesses referred to in these reports.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nInspector of Schools.\n**TRAVELLING EXPENSES**\n\n(For instructions, see reverse side)\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF** Mines and Resources  \n**CLAIMANT** W.

Friesen, Inspector of Schools, Briksdale, Manitoba.\n\nIt is with some regret that I leave this area, as I feel that, under your direction, a greater interest is being taken in the education of the Indian children than has previously been the case.\n\nI am sure that Mr. Friesen will be glad to render any assistance possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Patterson\nDear Mr. Patterson:\n\nI am very sorry to hear that you are relinquishing your duties as Inspector of Schools at Briksdale, Manitoba.\n\nI hope that Mr. Friesen will continue the keen interest in our Indian schools which has always been evident by you.\n\nWe hope to continue the progress made in the last few years to follow a sound system of education for these Indian children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. W. Patterson,\n122 Blythwood Road,\nToronto 12, Ont.,\n\nBPS/EM\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nDecember 29, 1949\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn August, 1949, I succeeded Mr. W.S. Patterson as inspector of schools in Inspectorial Division No. 27, with headquarters at Erickdale. Mr. Patterson informed me that in addition to inspecting the public schools of this division I would also be expected to inspect the Indian schools adjacent to the area included in my division. He further informed me that this inspection was carried out in spring and once a year only. I note from Mr. Patterson's records that most of the Indian school were inspected in May and June.\n\nI am writing to find out what would be the earliest date that you would want the inspection of Indian schools started. Because of the poor condition of the roads through the Reserves in spring it is possible that some of the schools could be reached more easily in January and February than in May or June. We had a very wet fall this year and the road through the Peguis Reserve will probably take long time to dry next spring. Of course it is also possible that the roads to these schools could become completely blocked and remain so throughout the winter.\n\nIs there any information that you think I should have regarding the Indian schools, or are there any special instructions that you would like to give? I have, naturally, had access to the inspection files left by Mr. Patterson and from them have obtained some understanding of what is expected.\n\nHoping to hear from you shortly, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nInspector of Schools\n3 January, 1950.\n\nMr. W. Friesen,\nInspector of Schools,\nEriksdale, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Friesen:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 29 and was pleased to note that you will be prepared to inspect our Indian schools in your superintendency.\n\nIt is quite acceptable if you inspect our schools in January and February as I am only too well aware of the condition of the roads at other times.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to our Indian Superintendent of the Fisher River agency at Hodgson, Manitoba, so that he can expect you to be doing these schools at some date within the next two months.\n\nYou will find the new schools at Peguis to provide a good classroom but to be deficient in the matter of running water for the toilets. I would have preferred a furnace-heated school also but we had to go in for quantity rather than quality this year.\n\nYou will find that with the concurrence of Mr. Patterson we appointed Mr. T. W. Emerson as supervising principal. He will, I hope, be of help to you in getting around the reserve. He is at the Peguis No. 2 School. Our library stock has been rather poor and I know you will be disappointed in the quantity and quality of the books made available. However, we\nhave been fortunate in securing a much better type of book this winter and these should be in the schools by April and May. Other than that, I want you to report on the schools as you would for provincial schools - do not hesitate to be frank in your expression of opinions either about the teacher, the school or conditions generally.\n\nWe are anxious to improve our Indian schools and this goal can only be achieved by the co-operation of all concerned - and you can best help us by comparing our schools with the provincial ones you inspect.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I had also inspected one of the Provincial Schools at Berens River and I split the expenses of my trip between the two Departments. My actual expense borne by your Department is $15.00. This is made up as follows:\n\nTransportation by C.S.R. train one-way $11.50\nthree meals $3.50\n\nI am not greatly concerned about the fees that usually accompany these visits. I do enjoy my visits to these schools and picked up some excellent note books on health.\n\nIf my letter of July 1942 has gone astray I will be glad to send you a duplicate copy, but I will have to try to get a statement from the Company regarding the fare by boat to Berens River.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn H.

This arrangement is still in effect, except in the province of New Brunswick, where, as in the case of British Columbia, we have a special Inspector of Indian Schools appointed by the Department.\n\nIn the Western Provinces our inspection of Indian schools is made by our Inspectors of Indian Agencies. It is the aim of the Department to have the courses in our Indian schools conform as closely as possible to the curriculum of the public schools of the districts in which they are situated, and it is considered that possibly that end might be more completely attained, were the class-room work under the inspection of the Provincial Inspectors.\n\nI should be glad if you would give this suggestion your consideration. I may add that in the Eastern Provinces we have paid a fee for inspection and travelling expenses. Would it be possible for you to let me know what the probable approximate costs would be to this Department, if such an arrangement were put into effect in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe memoranda and other correspondence being the initial action relative to the inspection by Public School Inspectors of Indian Schools in the Prairie Provinces, are on the 24949 MAN. file.\nRegina, July 19, 1920\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Minister to acknowledge your letter of the 7th instant and to request you to furnish this Department with information as to the location of the Indian Schools in Saskatchewan.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister\n\nDuncan C.

To inspect each would require an entire day and cost $6.00 regular allowance and $10.00 for inspection and report for each day or a total of $32.00.\n\nW. H. Magee.\n\nThe Indian Head inspectorate contains the Assiniboine Day school, 15 miles from Indian Head, and would require a whole day for inspection. A fair cost would be $6.00 regular allowance and $4.00 for inspection and report, a total of $10.00.\n\nJ. Marshall.\n\nThe Weyburn inspectorate contains the White Bear's day school and an estimated charge for inspection would be $10.00 for inspection and report and $6.00 for travelling, a total of $16.00.\n\nA. Kennedy.\n\nThe Balcarres inspectorate contains the File Hills and Muscowequans boarding schools and an estimated charge for inspection would be as follows:\n\nInspection and report (per room) $15.00\nTravelling expenses -- 15\u00a2 per mile each way\nHotel expenses per day $4.00\n\nW. E. Stevenson.\nInspection of Indian Schools continued.\n\nThe Last Mountain inspectorate contains the Gordon's boarding school and an estimated charge for inspection would be $6.00 for travelling and $10.00 for inspection and report, a total of $16.00.\n\nJ. G. Macleanie.\n\nThe Moosomin inspectorate contains the Round Lake boarding school and an estimated charge for inspection would be $10.00 and in addition any extra conveyance or mileage incurred at the rate of 15\u00a2 per mile, school to be inspected on day of inspection of an adjoining school.\n\nG. D. Halton.\n\nThe Wascana inspectorate contains the Cowessess boarding school and an estimated charge for inspection would be as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Amount |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Salary at $10.00 per day    | $20.00 |\n| Expenses, travelling        | $12.00 |\n| Reports $2 each (day)       | $4.00  |\n| **Total**                   | $36.00 |\n\nJ. M. Little.\n\nThe Regina inspectorate contains the Qu'Appelle Industrial school at Lebret and an estimated charge for inspection would be as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Amount |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 4 depts. at $10.00 each     | $40.00 |\n| Reports on same             | $10.00 |\n| Travelling & living expenses| $10.00 |\n| **Total**                   | $60.00 |\n\nN. MacMurchy.\n\nThe Carman inspectorate contains the Key's and Keeseekoose day schools and an estimated charge for inspection would be $30.00.\n\nA. L. Merrill.\nInspection of Indian Schools continued.\n\nThe Lloydminster inspectorate contains the Little Pines and Poundmaker's day schools. \"As I have never crossed from Jet Knife by direct route, I am not conversant with the distances. I am sure that any agreement that is satisfactory to the department will be satisfactory to me. I will gladly assume the duty.\"\n\nW. N. Veazey.\n\nThe Turtleford inspectorate contains the Onion Lake R. C. and the Onion Lake J. R. boarding schools. The territory is rough and conveyance will have to be hired locally if car cannot be used. An allowance of $20.00 per room should cover all expenses and report making.\n\nChas. Kivins.\n\nThe Saskatoon inspectorate contains the White Cap Sioux day school and will require a day for inspection. An estimated charge for inspection would be as follows:\n\n| Item          | Amount |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Travelling expenses | $8.50  |\n| Inspection    | $14.00 |\n| Report        | $2.50  |\n| **Total**     | $25.00 |\n\nThe Yorkton inspectorate contains Cote's day school six miles from Kamsack and sixty miles from Yorkton. To inspect this school would require two day's work and a drive of 120 miles. An estimated charge for inspection and report would be $35.00.\n\nB. W. Wallace.\n\nThe Wynyard inspectorate contains Day Star's day school. The time required to inspect and report on this school would be 1\u00bd days and an estimated charge would be $25.00.\n\nB. Hjalmarson.\nInspection of Indian Schools continued.\n\nThe Prince Albert inspectorate contains the Montreal Lake, Stanley and Sturgeon Lake day schools and Lac la Ronge boarding school. Sturgeon Lake day school is more convenient and a minimum charge for inspection and report would be $25.00.\n\nTo inspect the other three schools it would take from 24 to 30 days (inspection included) to make the round trip during the summer. The mode of conveyance is as follows: team to Montreal Lake, canoe (two men required) to Lac la Ronge, thence canoe to Stanley. Provisions have to be stocked at Prince Albert, Lac la Ronge or Montreal Lake. Estimates of the expense of the trip vary from $200 to $400; the inspector's time would be worth from $200 to $250; the cost of a camping outfit varies from $100 to $125. Thus the total cost of the trip would be between $500 and $775. Possibly the best method would be to pay actual expenses of this trip.\n\nThe total estimated cost of inspection of the schools in the Prince Albert inspectorate would be between $525 and $600.\n\nJ. T. Tomlinson.\nRegina, Sask.,\nMarch 17, 1921.\n\nRe: Inspection of Indian Schools.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of November 25, 1920, I am directed to state that I have been in communication with all the inspectors of schools in whose inspectorates Indian schools are situated. I am enclosing herewith a memorandum prepared from this correspondence by my secretary. You will observe that there is considerable variation in the method of arriving at the remuneration and travelling allowances in connection with the inspection of these schools by the different inspectors. I gather from this memorandum that in the majority of cases the inspectors would be satisfied with the regular departmental rate for travelling of $6.00 per day together with an allowance of $10.00 per room for inspection and report.\n\nIn the case of schools situated north of township fifty-five it would be necessary for your department to make special arrangements with individual inspectors for a fair travelling allowance. The names of these inspectors will be given to you on request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 13, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is desirous, at this time, of completing arrangements for the inspection of the Indian schools in Saskatchewan. I have examined the correspondence with your office, of a year ago, referring to this matter, and have paid particular attention to your communication of March 17, 1921.\n\nIn the letter above referred to, you intimated that it would be necessary for us to make special arrangements with individual inspectors for a fair travelling allowance in the case of schools situated north of Township 55. This suggests to me that it may be your wish that we deal direct with the inspectors for the whole province. This arrangement would be, I believe, quite satisfactory to the Department of Indian affairs. Certain information is required in this connection.\n\nWould you be good enough to have a map of Saskatchewan prepared, showing roughly the inspectorates north of a line joining Alameda, Regina and Lloydminster. As you are aware, this Department has few activities in the southwestern portion of the province, and no schools whatever.\n\nIt is felt that the benefits accruing from an inspection of Indian schools north of Township 55 would not be commensurate with the expenditure involved.\n\nI am enclosing copies of a list of our schools, opposite which you will notice the names of the officers in whose inspectorates the schools are located. This list includes all day and residential schools, the inspection of which is desired. Would you make any changes and additions to bring the list up to date and return a copy to Ottawa.\n\nWith your permission and concurrence, we will ask the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for authority to enter into negotiations with the public school inspectors of Saskatchewan. The remuneration suggested by your officers in letter of March 17th, last, appears in every case to be fair and reasonable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

It is just possible however that this department could be of some service without in any way interfering with your jurisdiction, more in the capacity of offering suggestions to you which would result in maintaining the same standards in your schools as we have in our own. After all, the Indian boys and girls are just boys and girls and naturally our interest in their welfare is not less than in the white children under our care.\n\nWith this in mind, would it be better for you to deal directly with this department? Our department could add the Indian schools to the present lists of schools given our inspectors, with instructions to inspect and report to you along whatever lines you may wish. These reports might first be sent to Regina for our perusal and afterwards sent on to you. By keeping a small file here we could record any information from these reports which might be of interest later. Or the inspectors might make the reports in duplicate, one copy to be retained here.\n\nYou probably are aware that the boundaries of the inspectorates may change from time to time, owing to organization of new school districts. This circumstance\nmight have its disadvantages in case you were dealing direct with field men.\n\nAs to remuneration, your department could pay this department one lump sum on the basis of the letter to you of March 17 with memorandum attached.\n\nI am writing you with the concurrence of Mr. Hall and I shall be glad to refer your views on the matter to him, upon receipt of your reply.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, B.A.C.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWrite a brief flat rate\n#20 Boy Schools (angle rooms)\n#35 Big Schools (down & upstairs)\nOttawa, March 22, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. McKechnie:\n\nI have yours of the 9th instant, referring to the proposed inspection of certain Indian schools in Saskatchewan by the inspectors of the provincial Department of Education. I have noted that your Department volunteers to relieve Indian Affairs of the task of corresponding direct with the staff of inspectors and that we could make one payment per annum to your Department for services rendered.\n\nIn reply to your kind offer, I beg to state that there is no doubt that the Department of Education for Saskatchewan can be of real service to us, and we are pleased that you have taken an interest in our efforts to prepare the Indian people, eventually, for full citizenship.\n\nFurther, as you state, you are in a unique position to offer suggestions which would result in maintaining the same standards in Indian schools as obtain in the public schools of the Province. At present, the Indian schools on the prairies are somewhat below the standard set for white schools, both in the matter of teachers and in the work that is being done. It is our aim to not only use the same texts as are studied in public schools of the Province but to conform as nearly as possible to the general regulations.\n\nDefinite arrangements have been made with Manitoba and Alberta, and the Department of Indian Affairs is now ready to secure the necessary authority for the scheme from the Minister. At a later date, another communication will be addressed to you in this connection.\n\nI have to thank you for your interest and cooperation in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. H. McKechnie, Esq., B.A.,\nChief Inspector,\nDepartment of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 22, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nRe: Inspection of Indian Schools in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nWith a view to maintaining public school standards in the classrooms of our Indian schools of the Prairie Provinces, this Department has had further correspondence with the Deputy Ministers of Education for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. A list of the schools, the inspection of which is desired, was submitted to each Provincial Department and the cost of securing the services of the staffs of inspectors was discussed. Replies have now been received from the Deputy Ministers of Education and bases have been prepared upon which definite arrangements can be made when the necessary authority has been obtained from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn Manitoba we are to make arrangements direct with the staff of inspectors. They have been approached and are willing to inspect 19 day and 7 residential schools for a remuneration of $15.00 and expenses for each visit to a school. My estimate for the Manitoba expenditure is $700.00. I have the addresses of the inspectors and a list of the schools each will inspect.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Department of Education have offered to supervise for us the inspection of the Indian schools in that Province. They will add to their present list of public schools, the Indian schools the inspection of which is desired. Inspectors' reports will be made in duplicate and one copy forwarded by the Regina office to Ottawa with the comments of their Chief Inspector. One payment per annum would be made to the Saskatchewan Department of Education, on the basis of a flat rate of $20.00 for day schools and $35.00 for residential schools. The cost for such inspection would be $710.00.\n\nThe proposed arrangement with the Alberta Department of Education is identical with that mentioned above for the Province of Saskatchewan, with the exception that we have not been offered any comments on the inspectors' reports. The expenditure involved at the flat rate of $20.00 for each day and $35.00 for each residential school would be $530.00.\n\nIt will be noted that the total expenditure for the inspection of the 46 day and 27 residential schools in the three provinces will be slightly less than $2,000.00. An item has been placed in the 1922-23 Estimates to cover this expenditure.\n\n- In each -\nIn each province, certain schools that are remote from the lines of communication have been omitted from the lists offered to the Provincial Departments.\n\nAt present, agents and inspectors of the agencies visit the Indian schools at more or less regular intervals. There is a real need for an academic supervision that our staff in the field are unable to offer.\n\nThe proposed arrangement is that the public school inspectors will visit the Indian schools mentioned once a year when they are in the vicinity, and the expenses for which we are responsible (Manitoba) will be kept at a minimum. Inspectors will be informed that it is our aim to maintain public school standards in the classrooms of Indian schools and we will ask them to supervise class-room activities and related matters only. The confidential report of outside trained public school inspectors will be of infinite value to this Department in our effort to make successful our educational work among the Prairie Province Indian children.\n\nIn June 1920, the Honorable the Superintendent General approved of a similar scheme but requested that you did not commit the Department of Indian affairs in the matter for the time being.\n\nI beg to recommend that the Superintendent General be approached with a view to having this proposed plan put into effect in the immediate future.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThrough Commissioner's office?\n\nTell Minister as precedent\n\nOwn Acad Inspector\n\nOntario\nQuebec\nP.E.I.\n\nB.C.\nN.B.\nOttawa, March 24, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:-\n\nHon. Charles Stewart.\n\nSupervision of the classroom activities in Indian schools in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces was placed, nearly 40 years ago, in the hands of the provincial public school inspectors, following agreements entered into by this Department with the Provincial Governments. This arrangement still obtains, except in the Province of New Brunswick, where we have a department inspector possessing the necessary academic qualifications. In British Columbia, also, we have an Inspector of Indian schools.\n\nIn the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta our Indian schools are visited by our agents and by the inspectors of agencies, who are, of course, not specifically qualified to make other than perfunctory inspections of the academic activities. It is desired that the pedagogy of our teachers in the Prairie Provinces be supervised, and only the confidential report of trained inspectors will enable us to maintain public school standards in the classrooms of Indian schools.\n\nTo this end, a list of schools the inspection of which is desired, was submitted to the Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta Departments of Education; and inquiries were made concerning the expense connected with utilizing the services of public school inspectors. Certain schools that are remote from the lines of communication have been omitted. I wish to have the courses of studies in Indian schools conform to the curricula for the public schools in the various provinces. To attain this end, and to ensure uniformity in teaching methods, our schools should be inspected at least once a year by the provincial inspectors.\n\nThe cost of this supervision in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta will be about $2,000.00 per annum, and an item has been placed in the 1922-23 Main Estimates to cover this expenditure. The proposed arrangement with each of the Prairie Provinces is outlined in the attached memorandum to me from the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nIn June, 1920, the Hon. Mr. Meighen, then Superintendent General, approved of a similar scheme, but requested that we not commit the Department for the time being.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that I be authorized to complete arrangements with the provincial Departments of Education in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, so that our educational work among the Indian children in these provinces will receive the proper supervision without delay.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Perrier:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 22 in further reference to the inspection of Indian schools in Saskatchewan and I note that the matter is to stand in abeyance until we are in receipt of a further communication from you. In the meantime I am referring your letter to Mr. Ball.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\n\nRussell T. Perrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 21, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nAbout 1885 an arrangement was made with the Ontario Department of Education for the inspection of the Indian schools. It was agreed that the remuneration paid to the inspectors would be at the rate of $6.00 per room, plus the actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular route. This arrangement obtains today. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nIn Quebec and the Maritime Provinces an arrangement was made in 1888 with the Departments of Education on similar lines as for Ontario. The rate of remuneration was $5.00 per room plus expenses. Since January 1, 1921, in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces the inspectors have received $7.50 per room plus expenses. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nArrangements have been concluded this year with the Prairie Provinces. In Manitoba we have agreed to pay the inspectors at the rate of $15.00 per classroom plus expenses. In Saskatchewan and Alberta a flat rate of $20.00 per school is being charged for one inspection per year. In the case of the last two provinces, no allowances are made in connection with expenses.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nOTTAWA, May 17, 1928.\n\nTo Indian Agents and Teachers of Indian Schools:\n\nI have to inform you that arrangements have been completed with the Department of Education for your Province for the inspection of Indian schools by the staff of public school inspectors. This action has been taken with a view to standardizing the instruction offered and making it as bright and attractive as possible. Although the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, yet teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and general management of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, the course of studies prescribed by the Provincial Department should be used by each Indian school. Every assistance should be given to the public school inspectors in the discharge of their duties. This inspection by professionally qualified educationists is being done at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferriss,\nSept. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 18, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Macleod:\n\nI have to inform you that the minister has authorized the inspection of the Indian schools in Saskatchewan by the staff of public school inspectors and a payment to your Department at the flat rate of $20.00 per day and $35.00 per residential school.\n\nThis Department would be grateful if you would add the Indian schools to the present lists given your inspectors. Their reports on our forms - copies of which are enclosed - should be forwarded from your office to W. M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, of your city.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs would prefer to send you one cheque per annum for the services of your inspectors. When requisition is made for this payment, it might be well to attach a memorandum showing the schools that have been inspected during the calendar, fiscal or academic year, whichever you prefer. The month for this payment may be selected by your Department.\n\nIt is our wish that the schools on the list forwarded to your Department under cover of February 13th, last, (with the exception of the little Pines and Roundmaker's Bay schools which are at present closed) be inspected once during the academic year. From time to time we will keep you informed concerning the opening or closing of the Indian schools in the province. The inspectors of your Department should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications and the pedagogy of our teachers; the progress of the pupils; and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment, with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient.\n\nIt should be remembered that the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, as these schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department. However, teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and the general management of the school. The inspectors should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure of a teacher, or principal, to carry out any reasonable suggestions made by them.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the Department of Indian Affairs. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will be welcomed by us; but the final decision rests with Ottawa.\n\nJ. H. Macleod, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nDepartment of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\n\n- The course -\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nThe course of studies prescribed by the Saskatchewan Department of Education should be followed by the classes in Indian schools. Your inspectors will likely find teachers following a curriculum stated on the back of our school register; but this practice should be discontinued, as all teachers have been or should have been instructed that the provincial course is to be followed. The registers for Indian schools that have lately come from the press contain more up-to-date instructions. Generally speaking, Indian day schools are closed during the months of July and August.\n\nI am of the opinion that you will find the work in our Indian day schools not yet up to the standard as set by the public schools of the province. It is our wish to remedy this condition as soon as possible. It may be necessary in many instances, to hire teachers with better qualifications. This will, of necessity, mean an increased salary item, and the change will have to be made slowly with the consent of parliament, which votes the funds for Indian education.\n\nThe inspection reports, as stated above, should be directed to Mr. Commissioner Graham; the requisition for annual payment and any questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nThis Department is grateful to you and to Mr. Ball for your interest and cooperation in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 18, 1922.\n\nPrairie Province Indian schools.\n\nThe following day and residential Indian schools are to be inspected by the public school inspectors of the three provinces from this date.

W. Atwater,\nPrincipal.\nRegina, Sask.,\nJune 10, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier:\n\nThis department is making plans to carry out the suggestions contained in your letter of May 18. In the meantime we are sending a copy of our course of studies to each of the principals of the Indian Schools. Commissioner Graham kindly furnished us with the names and addresses.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\n\nRussell T. Perrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM FOR INSPECTORS OF SCHOOLS.\n\nInspectors of schools have been advised that final arrangements have been completed between the Chief Inspector of Schools for Saskatchewan and the Superintendent of Indian Education for the inspection of Indian schools in this province by our inspectors of schools. Fifteen of the inspectorates contain Indian schools and I am taking this opportunity of sending a memorandum to the inspectors concerned to point out a few general considerations for their guidance.\n\nIt should be observed that as far as the knowledge of the department goes such schools have not been subjected hitherto to a rigid system of inspection based on a uniform course of study nor have they been governed by such definite provisions as are contained in the school law and regulations. There will, therefore, be found a lack of uniformity and, as compared with the schools organised under The School Act evidences perhaps of inefficiency. Further, considerable retardation may be expected for the reason that the conditions surrounding the rearing and education of the Indian children are generally opposed to satisfactory and uniform progress.\n\nIt must be remembered that in general the teachers who have been engaged at the Indian schools are chosen by the various churches and both from the religious and secular point of view their work may be different from the work of\nthe regular teacher, though not less valuable from the point of view of general education. As a rule these are people of proved devotion to the cause of the Indian races, in fact missionaries, interested alike in education and religion.\n\nIn connection with your inspection of these schools it would be advisable to encourage every kind of co-operation and the department would recommend that you notify the teacher or the person in charge of the school and the Indian Agent of the reserve upon which the school is located of the time and date of the inspection. It will probably take several years to bring these schools to a condition of average efficiency as judged by an inspector's usual standards but there is no doubt that with full co-operation and concerted effort the education of the Indian children of this province can advance to a much higher level and perhaps such children, or in any event a substantial number of them, will ultimately be enabled to compete on equal terms in many of the walks of life with the white children of the province.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information copy of a memorandum going forward to each inspector who will be concerned in the inspection of Indian schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nRussell Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, June 26th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, who is at present in British Columbia, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing a copy of a memorandum which you forwarded to each of the Public School Inspectors in the Province of Saskatchewan who will be concerned in the inspection of Indian schools.\n\nYour communication will be drawn to the attention of Mr. Ferrier upon his return to the Department, which will likely be about the end of August, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The voucher, which I beg to recommend for payment, is accompanied by a statement furnished by the Department of Education, and a list of the schools inspected.\n\nIn explanation of the reduction of $20.00 for the visit of an Inspector to the White Cap Sioux reserve, I have to state that I have been in communication with the Chief Inspector, and it was agreed that no charge should be made in view of the fact that a week or two prior to the date on which their Inspector visited the reserve in question the Department of Education had written to me to inquire whether the school was open, and I had replied that I was not in a position to state when operations at that reserve commenced. In view of this the Department of Education have consented not to make a charge in this case. With a view to avoiding a recurrence of a similar nature, I am addressing a circular to all Indian Agents in the Province of Saskatchewan directing them to advise me immediately when, for any reason,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nreason, a school in their Agency has been, or is about to be closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Feb. 24, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nThere has been directed to your Department, under separate cover, a cheque for $610.00 in payment of your account for the inspection of Indian schools in Saskatchewan. This Department is grateful for the cooperation of yourself and your staff of inspectors, and I wish to inform you that, already, much good has come from the criticism of your officers. We are making improvements at this school and that, every few days, and the reports of your inspectors have assisted us greatly in our efforts to provide better educational facilities for our Indian wards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Education.\n\nA. H. Ball, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI should be glad to be advised if it is the intention of the department to supply Indian Agents with a copy of the reports of the Public School Inspector as to the schools within their Agency.\n\nIf such is the case I should be glad to receive the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Feb. 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 40 of the 20th instant, with reference to the Department's intention, following the report of a public school inspector.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, in view of the amount of correspondence that would be involved, it is not our purpose to send a copy of the public school inspector's reports to the Indian agents interested. If there is any action arising out of the inspector's report, or any criticism that should be known to our local representatives, communications will, of course, be directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I enclose a sample of the form, herewith.\n\nIn my letter to the Department of the 19th inst., under cover of which I forwarded Provincial School Inspector Hutchinson's report on the Sacred Heart Indian Boarding School, Regina Agency, I drew attention to Mr. Hutchinson's remarks in his report that the inspection forms issued by this Department are not adapted to reporting upon Boarding Schools. I suggested that the Inspectors be allowed to use the forms issued by their Departments so far as the inspection of Boarding Schools is concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, Mar. 29, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100-7 of the 21st instant, in which you requisition for a supply of Inspector's Report forms.\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is sending a supply to the Departments of Education in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and I am requesting that your stock be used only in the case of special requests directed to you. I am hopeful that the Manitoba Department of Education will make the same arrangements as the two more westerly provinces have done, and this will obviate considerable correspondence with the individual inspectors. A supply of forms is being directed to you under separate cover. These officers of the Department of Education may, of course, use their own forms in the case of boarding schools. It is admitted that our report forms are not adapted to the inspection of residential schools. At a later date, I hope to have a form for boarding schools prepared and printed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nDated March 19, 1923.\n\nI would like to say that I was under the impression when the system of inspection of Indian schools by provincial school inspectors was inaugurated that these gentlemen were to confine their reports to the class room work. I find, however, that in most cases, they also report upon school buildings, farm work and so forth, which I do not think fall within the scope of their inspection duties, and which I am of the opinion should be reported upon by the Department's Inspectors, who are more competent to deal with matters of that nature. I think that an understanding should be arrived at with the educational authorities in regard to this point so that an overlapping in the work of the two branches of inspection may be avoided.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nOttawa, April 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your No. 406-11 of the 19th ultimo, relative to the specific duties of the Provincial Public School Inspectors upon the occasion of their visits to Indian schools. I am of the opinion that, upon subsequent inspections, these provincial officers will more or less confine their attention to classroom activities. In no case will their remarks concerning plant, farm or general management supersede the reports of our own inspectors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReferring to Department No. 24949-4 of the 10th instant, I note that the opinion is expressed that upon subsequent inspections Provincial Inspecting Officers will more or less confine their attention to class room activities, and I was wondering whether the Department had made any representations to the Provincial Inspectors which has led it to the opinion that in future their comments will be confined to educational matters only.\n\nWill you please advise me if the subject has been taken up with the Provincial authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your No. 100-11 of the 14th instant, I beg to state that the specific duties of the provincial public school inspectors have not been the subject of special communications to provincial authorities. The Department's general letter of instruction to the Departments of Education in Saskatchewan and Alberta was fairly definite in this connection.\n\nThe reports of public school inspectors are being closely studied and examined and, if it is found that any provincial officer is exceeding his authority, a communication will be addressed to the proper Department of Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 3, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the absence of the Chief Inspector, I am directed to ask you to forward a quantity of blank forms for use when reporting on Indian schools.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated as our supply of the form is entirely depleted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR.

H. GRAHAM,\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs - Indian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Oct. 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100-7B of the 10th instant, with reference to the report forms for the School Inspectors.\n\nI have to inform you, in reply, that on the 8th instant 100 forms were directed to the Department of Education in Regina. I have placed an order with the Government Stationery Office for more copies of this form, and I regret that I am able to send to your office a limited supply. These are going forward under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 13, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the absence of the Chief Inspector, I wish to thank you for the supply of Indian school report forms received today.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nRussell T.

November 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nReports on day and residential schools by Provincial School Inspectors are forwarded to the Department from time to time and acknowledgments received from you. Many of these reports contain criticisms in regard to administration or qualification of teachers, the buildings or their equipment. In acknowledgment the Department frequently refers to talking up with the Principal or the Agent the matters criticized, but in most instances merely states that a communication is being addressed to one or other of these officials.\n\nMore recent communications of this nature will be found in Department letters acknowledging reports on the Beigan (No) Residential School, the Blood (No) Residential School, the Qu'Appelle Residential School and the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nMay I ask the Department to advise me of the nature of the communications addressed to the Agent or Principal in such cases in order that I and the Inspector here may be informed of the instructions or suggestions issued by the Department as a result of the school inspectors visits to our various school institutions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H.

It is noted that you desire to be advised, in future, of the nature of the communications to agents or principals with regard to matters arising from these reports.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, when acknowledging these reports, in future, the Department will indicate to you the instructions issued regarding matters mentioned in the reports, which require action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I should be grateful if you would give one copy to each of the Provincial Public School Inspectors who visits our boarding schools. Your officers should indicate in their reports whether or not the classroom registers are being carefully kept. The Inspectors interested are, I believe, Messrs.

Kyle & Schools Branch\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Public School Inspector James Little intimated, in his last report on the Cowessess Indian Residential School, that he would make an inspection of the manual and industrial training, upon the occasion of his next visit. Please inform him that officers of this Department supervise the vocational instruction, and that I should be grateful if he would devote his entire time when at the school to the classroom activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe Chief Inspector,\nDept. of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 302-11 of the 22nd instant, enclosing Mr. Public School Inspector Veasey's report on the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. I note that the inspector has not confined his remarks solely to classroom activity. His report, however, is so helpful in connection with teaching methods and so comprehensive that I hesitate to send an official letter to the Department of Education in this case, for fear that his criticism and expressions in future could be stifled and curtailed. I have in the past, upon occasion, written such communications, but only when an inspector was evidently putting considerable time on the outside activity at an Indian residential school. This whole problem is about to be solved automatically, as I have already placed an order with the King's Printer for a supply of printed Inspector's Report forms, to be used for residential schools only. The following words are printed in order and with proper spacing on these forms:\n\n\"INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\"\n\nNumber of pupils in residence. boys girls.\nNumber of classrooms and number of desks in each.\nNumber of classes and number of pupils in each class.\n\nSTAFF.\n\nPrincipal's name.\nClassroom teachers. (name, age and qualifications of each should be separately stated)\nRemarks relative to the methods employed by teachers.\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE.\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture.\nCare of material.\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied.\n\nCLASSROOM.\n\nCondition of classrooms, ventilation, lighting, etc.\nClassroom registers. (is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\nUnder this heading, the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.\n\nDate of Inspection. Signature of Inspector.\nThis form to be used for Indian residential schools only.\"\n\nCopies of this form will be directed to your office as soon as they are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

In regard to this, I would refer you to your 305-11 of March 26th, 1926, in which you stated that, though Mr. Inspector Weir had visited the school on October 26th and 27th, 1925, also, February 17th and 18th, 1926, there would be a charge made for only one visit. We have already paid for the inspection of this school in the year 1925. Do you consider it advisable to pay for both these visits, or do you think a deduction should be made in the account.

The Chief Inspector has today written for a supply, stating that their inspectors make their reports in quadruplicate; one for their own file, one for the Provincial Department of Education and two for this office; and that a fairly generous supply is, therefore, necessary. I have requested that future requisitions be sent to you direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H.

As intimated in your letter of the 5th ultimo, (Your No. 512-11), the value of the inspectors' reports is greatly lessened if there is a delay between the date of the inspection and the receipt of the report by the Department. I trust that you have already taken up this matter with the Chief Inspector so as to ensure the reports being forwarded promptly in the future.\n\nIf, upon inquiry, you find that these schools were not inspected during the year 1927, it might be well, especially in the case of File Hills and Qu'Appelle, to arrange to have them inspected by one of the public school inspectors at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

J. Brimmie of Radisson, in whose territory this school is situated, writes as follows under date of February 25th:\n\n\"I may say that I could inspect this school almost any time by rail but that would involve considerable expense to the Department as I would have to go to Big River by rail and then drive out. It would take a full week's time to make the round trip so that I think it might be well to postpone the trip for a time.\"\n\nMr. Brimmie's idea is to reach this school just as soon as roads are fit for motor.\n\nIn reference to the Little Pine Indian School, our inspector in January wrote as follows:\n\n\"I had made up my mind to visit this school early in the fall but on calling up the Indian Agent I found that the date was not suitable for him for that week. Latter I found it necessary to visit the North. The visit was finally put off so long that the cold weather set in and the school was not reached.\"\n\nUnder March 10th, 1928, the inspector writes as follows:\n\n\"The road between North Battleford and Paynton has not been used by cars this winter. The only way to reach Little Pine at present would be from Paynton with a team. I have been in touch with the Indian Agent and the local authorities at Little Pine and they quite understand the situation. Unless there is a special call from Ottawa the expense of the trip might not be justified at present. I will take the school on just as soon as opportunity and conditions allow.\"\n\nI have written Mr. Veazey suggesting that he engage livery from Paynton so as to arrange for an early inspection of this school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sign) J.

T. Tomlinson of his visit to the John Smith's Indian Day School on the 10th ultimo. You will note his comment under \"General Remarks\" that he finds it \"difficult to examine the pupils and to observe the work of the teacher both in one half day.\" I wrote to the Chief Inspector asking him if there was any reason why Mr. Tomlinson should not have spent a full day observing the work at this school; and I am informed in reply that \"instructions to inspectors are that they should spend one half day during each visit to a school.\" If this is so the inspection of a school cannot be properly completed in one half day. I cannot understand why the inspectors should be arbitrarily limited to that time. We are paying the province $20.00 for each visit to a day school and it seems to me that this payment is not earned when we do not get the benefit of a complete inspection. Mr. Tomlinson clearly states that a half day is not sufficient and if more time should have been devoted on the occasion of his visit, he should have expended it. In a previous letter the Chief Inspector states that, if it was our wish, arrangements could be made to have this school visited again during the fall term. It is not a question of having the school visited twice, but a proper and complete inspection being made once, and we should not find it necessary to ask for a second visit and have to pay a further fee of $20.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

A cheque in payment will go forward under separate cover.\n\nThere is included a fee for the inspection of the Round Plain School. This is not being deducted, but I should be grateful if you would consider the Department's responsibility for this school. I understand that the school is conducted by a local Board and, no doubt, the inspection reports are forwarded to some local official. Last year your office did not send us a copy of the Inspector's report. The Department pays a grant towards the teacher's salary because there are Indian children attending the Round Plain School, but it is my opinion that it can hardly be classed as an Indian school. We do not appoint the teacher.

The report discloses a very satisfactory condition of affairs at this school.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the condition of the furnace, I may inform the Department that it is my intention to visit that school at an early date as possible when I will make a thorough examination of the furnace and submit my recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Hurison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward herewith Provincial School Inspector R. E. Sparkes' report on the St. Andrews Indian Day School which is situated on the Key Reserve in the Pelly Agency.\n\nThe Teacher at this school is apparently well qualified and is doing good work. The Inspector states that the attendance has shown some improvement, but it would appear that it is not what it should be yet. I may say that last December I took up the question of the irregularity of attendance at the Day Schools in the Pelly Agency with the Agent and asked him to press upon the parents the necessity of having their children attend schools regularly and particularly as the continuance of the school in operation would depend upon the showing in attendance. This has apparently had the effect of improving the attendance to some extent. The report shows that only seven children were in attendance, five boys and two girls. The cost of the upkeep of this school is quite high when one takes into consideration the number in attendance. This is a matter which I will take up with the parents when I next visit them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

These at the present time are being furnished our Department in duplicate, but I consider that we should have a third copy to pass on to the Indian Agent concerned in order to obtain the best results from these inspections. The Department of Education have consented to do this, but make the representation that, as most of their men use portable typewriters, it would avoid the necessity of typing a report twice if the forms were supplied on thinner paper, in single sheets, instead of the folded sheet hitherto used.\n\nI think this a very good suggestion, as these folded sheets are found in this office to be inconvenient for filing. My suggestion would be that these forms be printed on thin paper, single sheets, using only one side of the paper, each sheet to be numbered and space provided at the top of each for the name of the school to be inserted. I shall be glad if you would give this your favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe two teachers at our Lac la Ronge School, namely, Mr. Donald J. Greene, who holds a Saskatchewan certificate, and Miss May Titley, who holds a Manitoba certificate, have written to me, pointing out that unless their classroom work is inspected by a Public School Inspector there is a strong probability that they may have difficulty in securing permanent certificates in their respective Provinces. They informed me that they have written to the School Inspector for the Prince Albert district in the matter, and in his reply he expressed regret that arrangements had not been made for the inspection of the Lac la Ronge School, and that he had several other Indian Schools on his visiting list.\n\nI have spoken this morning to Dr. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education of the Province of Manitoba, about the situation, and he informed me that, so far as the Manitoba teacher was concerned, the time she taught at this school would be recognized in connection with her application for a permanent certificate, but that the certificate could not be issued without a School Inspector's recommendation. He suggested that I write to your Department, and ascertain if you could arrange for our Lac la Ronge School to be inspected, and it will be very much appreciated by these teachers, and also by our Commission if you can do this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a request for the regular inspection of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. This is situated about 250 miles from Prince Albert and I understand that the only convenient method of reaching the school is by aeroplane.\n\nI would appreciate your advising whether or not it would be possible for one of your Inspectors to visit this school yearly; and, if so, you might let me know if there would be an charge in addition to the amount of $35.00 which we now allow your Department for inspection of Indian Residential Schools in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.H. McKeanie, Esq., M.A., L.L.B., D.Ped.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nRegina, SASK.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of September 11th with reference to the inspection of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nI am communicating with the Deputy Minister of Education at Regina and, on receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend T.B.E.

I think possibly arrangements might be made to inspect the school regularly, using aeroplane passage. I think, however, it is rather late to make a visit this year, but I shall look into the matter further and give you more particulars relative to the cost so that everything can be arranged for a visit next year.\n\nI trust that this will be satisfactory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 4, 1937.\n\nRe: Inspection of Lac la Ronge School\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nIn response to the request contained in your letter of the 11th ultimo, I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received by the Department from J. H. McKechnie, Esq., Deputy Minister of Education, province of Saskatchewan. This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt is our intention to have an inspection of the Lac la Ronge School undertaken just as soon as arrangements can be completed in the Spring of 1938. It is my hope that this decision will be satisfactory to the teachers on whose behalf you have written.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

I do not know the reason for this but in reply I wish to say that I take a keen interest in everything I do and therefore I want to keep in the closest touch possible with these institutions. Unless these instructions are rescinded, I am going to put up the strongest fight that I can possibly wage against these instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

STILLWELL\nDIRECTOR OF TEACHER TRAINING AND SUPERVISION\n\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nDec. 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Reports on Indian Schools\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant addressed to the Deputy Minister. The reports of our school superintendents will be forwarded direct to your branch as requested, from January 1 next. I take it that you will still desire the three copies, the same as we have been sending in the past to the office of the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Saskatchewan. If this is your desire no reply will be necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Teacher Training and Supervision.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDecember 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 11, in which you state you have been informed by Dr. G. B. Stillwell, Director of Teacher Training and Supervision for the province of Saskatchewan, that the reports prepared by the public school inspectors on Indian day and residential schools should be forwarded direct to the Department.\n\nThe decision to have these reports forwarded direct to Ottawa was reached several months ago. It represents an attempt to avoid, if we can, the delay that must of necessity occur when such reports are sent through the offices of the Provincial Inspectors. With Indian day schools operating on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis, it is highly desirable that Inspectors' reports, drawing our attention to the necessity for minor repairs at the school, additional supplies such as textbooks, etc., should be promptly dealt with. It is exceedingly difficult for the average pupil to complete his year's work in a 9 month period and simply impossible to do so unless supplies are on hand either at the date of the school opening or immediately afterwards.\n\nIt is noted that the Inspector's report on the Ahtahkakoops School is dated October 25, 1940, and was forwarded by you in a letter dated November 18, 1940. The report on the Mistawasis School is dated October 15, 1940, and was forwarded by you also on November 18. The report on the Gordon School is dated October 25, 1940, and was forwarded by you on November 27, 1940. It is not suggested that the delay necessarily occurred at your office, but I feel you will agree with us that it should\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nCor. Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nREGINA, S a s k.\nbe possible to secure these reports more promptly.\n\nIn asking that reports on the Saskatchewan schools be forwarded direct to Ottawa, we are simply bringing the practice in Saskatchewan into conformity with the practice in force in the other provinces, with the exception of British Columbia, where the inspection of our schools is undertaken by an inspector who is a regular employee of this Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McGILL\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for the signature of the Secretary, a letter addressed to Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nThis letter, you will note, relates to the inspection of Indian day and residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan and to the necessity for having the public school inspectors forward their reports direct to Ottawa. This letter is written in reply to Mr. Christianson's communication dated December 11, 1940.\n\nThere is little that I need add to the information contained in the letter addressed to Mr. Christianson. I should point out, however, that the clerical work at the offices of our inspectors and Indian agents is steadily increasing. Mr. Willis, in his audit report on the Alberta Inspectorate, dated Calgary, December 3, 1940, states:\n\n\"The clerical work in this office appears to be increasing. The letter register shows 6,020 letters received for the period.\"\n\nIn view of this fact, I can see very little purpose in having the reports on Indian day and residential schools passed through the inspector's office. The inspectors themselves are, as you know, responsible for the supervision of our schools. It seems to me that it would be an advantage rather than a disadvantage to have the school inspectors' reports and the reports of our own inspectors sent in independently. In this way we could feel sure from time to time that our own inspectors were not influenced in any way either for or against a teacher, by the reports already sent in by the public school inspector.\n\nR.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nDecember 20th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 1-1-6 Sask. of the 16th instant.\n\nIn this connection I wish to say that all I could do when I read the reason given for the change in forwarding the School Inspector's reports, was smile. I will admit that when I wrote the Department my letter No. 300-11 of the 11th instant my blood pressure was up and I do not blame Dr. Stillwell for laughing when I informed him that I had not been advised by the Department. Is it any wonder?\n\nIn the past, as well as at the present time, I have always taken a great interest in the schools and have accomplished, I believe, a lot of good work in this connection both in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in bringing about better business administration at these institutions. I have already inspected several schools in this Province and reported on them, and in due course I hope to visit them all. Therefore the reports on these schools are of great assistance to me when I make my inspections. I do not want to be in variance with members of the Branch at Ottawa. You state that some of the reports have been held up. If they were, it was to obtain more information from Dr. Stillwell, as some of his men are new on the job and the information they gave in the reports was vague. For instance, we have a school report here now on the Cowessess Residential School which was forwarded on Day School forms. We were forced to return this to Dr. Stillwell and I might say here that this is the second time this has happened.\n\nWithout any more writing I would ask you again to rescind your instructions to Dr. Stillwell and ask him to continue sending the reports . . . .\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nsending the reports to this Office and I will guarantee to forward them the same day they arrive, if they come in the morning mail. If they are received in the afternoon mail, I may not be able to forward them until the next day. This will do away with controversy and I am sure is along the lines laid down by the Minister three years ago. Should any of the reports come in during a period when I am absent from the Office, I shall instruct the Staff here to forward them on.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

SCHOOL TRUSTEES SEEK FINANCIAL AID FOR EDUCATION\n\nThe three-day annual convention of the Saskatchewan School Trustees' Association held in Saskatoon last week and attended by more than 250 delegates, heard considerable evidence that in the main the problems affecting education in the province have been accurately diagnosed by the administration and have no serious threat to the educational welfare of the school districts.\n\nA resolution calling for a program of education, the equalization of educational opportunity, and the problem of securing better teachers for rural areas was adopted by the convention. There was general agreement among the delegates that land taxation was hindered far too much by the system of levying for education.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nDelegates gave unanimous approval to a resolution assuring the government that at least 80 per cent of the total cost of education should be covered by equalization and per capita grants to the school districts.\n\nAnother resolution, compared with the one just mentioned, was passed unanimously, supporting the proposal to raise the salary of primary school teachers from $160 per year to $180 per year, primary school teachers from $140 per year to $160 per year, and secondary school teachers from $190 per year to $200 per year.\n\nThe convention, in connection with the question of finance, once more reaffirmed its confidence in the association to continue pressing for a fairer distribution of resources.\n\nDuring the debate on financing, delegates noted that education bills in the past have been introduced in the province when the economy was weak and the situation has been made worse by the fact that the government has not been able to meet the demands of the schools.\n\nAnother resolution, compared with the one just mentioned, was passed unanimously, supporting the proposal to raise the salary of primary school teachers from $160 per year to $180 per year, primary school teachers from $140 per year to $160 per year, and secondary school teachers from $190 per year to $200 per year.\n\nThe convention went on record as supporting the proposal to provide lands in the Province for school tax purposes, and to provide funds for the purchase of land for school purposes.\n\nAnother resolution urged that instead of the present system of the P.F.A.A., the school board be used as a factor in estimating the equalization grants paid to school districts.\n\nRepresentation\n\nIn a convention that was marked by a spirit of cooperation and understanding, the delegates discussed the problem of financing education in Saskatchewan.\n\nSEEDS PLANTS GARDEN SUPPLIES NEWS CATALOGUE\n\nW.H.

Certainly it will be a healthier world. For science is working ceaselessly to devise more effective ways of treating and preventing disease.\n\nBut the task is enormous\u2014and costly. That is why the life insurance companies in Canada have contributed large sums of money for many years toward the work of medical science\u2014particularly in the field of preventive research.\n\nAs a result, more men and women are enabled to work in well-equipped laboratories waging war against cancer, tuberculosis and polio.

Ostreander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Department has had some correspondence with Mr. L. F. Titus, Chief Superintendent of Schools for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will note that our new salary schedule requires careful study of School Inspectors' and Indian Superintendents' reports before the setting of a teacher's salary. We have thus discovered that several of our Indian day schools have not been receiving regular school inspections. Mr. Titus has, therefore, directed me to instruct the Superintendents to make a visit to the Indian schools in their respective areas at least once a year. At the present time the Indian schools in the unorganized areas of northern Saskatchewan will have to be excluded from this arrangement.\n\nOur Department has offered to pay for two visits a year to teachers who have just graduated from Normal School and who are therefore in need of extra assistance.\n\nI would ask that your Superintendents co-operate in every way possible with the Provincial School Inspectors in this matter.\n\nBernard F.

J. Penny to visit the above-named school at the earliest opportunity. You will understand that this is a holiday season and some of our superintendents, including Mr. Penny, are instructing a short course at the Normal School. It may be early September before Mr. Penny can make a report.\n\nI have found since assuming my present position that the matter of our superintendents visiting the Indian Schools has been rather haphazard. Apparently a few years ago it was a practice to visit these schools when invited to do so. Some of the superintendents have included the Indian Schools in their itinerary and have visited them regularly once each year. Others neglected to do so unless a special request was made. It would be more satisfactory to the Department of Education in Saskatchewan if there were a very definite policy in this regard. I would like to be able to instruct the superintendents to make a visit to the Indian Schools in their respective areas at least once each year. Since our Department charges for this service I would like to have from you a definite statement as to the policy to be followed.\n\nI would exclude for the time being from this arrangement the Indian Schools in the unorganized areas of northern Saskatchewan.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Superintendent of Schools.\n\nMr. Bernard F.

The Department wishes the superintendents to observe this policy confining their visit to one visit per year, except where the number of members on the staff makes it impossible for the superintendent to complete his inspection in one visit. In that case a second visit can be made.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch also authorizes two visits a year in the case of a beginning teacher who is in need of some assistance. In such cases, you would give the beginning teacher in the Indian school the same helpful guidance as you give to the teachers normally under your jurisdiction.\n\nThe above observations are not meant to apply to the Indian schools in the unorganized areas of northern Saskatchewan.\n\nL.

B. A. degree\nProfessional standing ... Interim H.S., Saskatchewan.\nNationality ... Canadian of Scottish Ancestry\nAge ... Fifty-six\nMarital Status ... Married without children\nReligion ...

At present I am a permanent member of the staff of the Saskatchewan Government Correspondence School, which I joined nearly two years ago.\nDuring World War I I served for nearly a year training as a Cadet for Pilot, and in the last war I served for four and one half years in the Educational Branch of the R. C. A. F., though I never was overseas.\n\nI completed my B. A. degree through summer schools and night classes, only six months prior to obtaining my present position, and so had no opportunity to receive a permanent High School Certificate.\n\nWhile I like my present position, I find it very different from classroom work, to which I am very likely to return after the completion of my second year with the Department of Education, Correspondence Branch. If, however, my standing and experience will permit me to apply for the position referred to above I will be pleased to enter my name in the competition for it, as soon as your department calls for applications.\n\nI will appreciate hearing from you informing me as to whether or not your department will appoint their school inspectors for the school year 1949-50; and if so, if one of my standing may apply.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of a reply at your earliest convenience, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRonald Gillis\n\nMr. Ronald Gillis,\n2130 Argus Street\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nMay 17, 1949.\n\nMr. Ronald Gillis,\n2130 Angus Street,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Gillis:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 12.

I would very much appreciate information from your office regarding Treaty Indian Schools, Residential and otherwise in Northern Saskatchewan, as well as information as to what you would like regarding inspection of these schools and reporting of same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nT. H. Waugh,\nAdministrator of Education for Northern Saskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nBox 787\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI hereby submit my quarterly report covering the\nCarlton Agency for the quarter ending September 30, 1949.\n\nADMINISTRATION:\n\nField work on the Southern Reserves in the Agency\nhas consisted of Haying and Harvesting operations, follow-up\nwork on summer-fallow and new land broken.\n\nOn the Northern Reserves supervision has been\ngiven to construction of bridges and docks. In the case of Lac\nLa Ronge, supervision was given to the sawing of some eighty\nthousand feet of lumber taken out by the Indians for their own\nuse.\n\nIn addition to the above, supervision was given to\nthe lumbering operations carried out by Mr. James L. McLean\non the Montreal Lake Reserve. During the quarter Mr. McLean\nsawed 83,500 feet of lumber. Timber dues are paid up to date.\n\nCommercial fishing was not carried out by Indians\nat any points covered by this Agency during the past quarter.\n\nSale of fur has now been completed for last\nwinter's and spring's catch. It may be recalled in my last\nMarch 31st quarterly report I estimated the overall returns\nfrom fur sales in the Carlton Agency would be in the neighbor-\nhood of $325,841.00. To date the figures in connection with the\nSipapu Project have not been made available to this office,\nbut I find an estimate made over the balance of the area was\nten percent too high. In analyzing the returns it was found\nthe drop in the market was the chief factor. That, of course,\nis beyond our control. It is somewhat appalling when one\nrealizes the loss in returns brought about by improperly\nprepared pelts, both rat and beaver.\n\nThrough the cooperation of the Provincial Field\nmen, I am making arrangements to have as much fur as possible\npass through the hands of our own men next Spring before it is\nshipped, this is intended as an educational program. In this\nway I hope the Indians will be made to realize why some receive\npoorer grades than others and the loss in revenue which\nresults from improperly prepared pelts.\n\nMiles travelled by Departmental car No. 1412\noperated by the writer, 5977 miles, cost of operating $249.59.\nMiles travelled by Departmental truck No. 1425 operated by\nAssistant, Indian Agency, A. N. Wark, 4385 miles, cost of\noperating $245.01. Truck No. 1135 operated by Assistant,\nIndian Agency, P. A. Pederson, 3660 miles cost of operating\n$144.45.\nCost of air transportation for self and field men will amount to approximately $100.00.\n\nRESERVES AND TRUSTS:\n\nCollections made during the quarter were as follows: Timber dues received from Mr. James L. McLean for timber cut on the Montreal Lake Reserve amounted to $698.72. Proceeds from sales to date of grain produced on the Sturgeon Lake Community Farm amount to $1,693.84.\n\nMEDICAL:\n\nThe general health of the Indians during the past quarter has been good. Cost of hospitalization for the quarter will amount to approximately $14,907.00.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe five day schools in the Agency were visited during the quarter. One visit was also made to the Seasonal Day School at Stanley. The St. Alban's and All Saints Residential Schools were visited on numerous occasions during the quarter.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nCrop returns covering the farming reserves in the Agency have not been prepared, however, the yields are the best in years.\n\nMost of the trappers have left for their trapping grounds. Before they left they were interviewed in a general way and it is my understanding they were sufficiently well equipped to start out.\n\nE. S.

I have discussed this question with the Minister, and also with some of your officials who are connected with the Indian schools, and have come to the conclusion that it would be in the interests of education to have these schools inspected by the local Inspectors.\n\nIt is impossible for me to advise you with regard to the expense in connection with the inspection, as it will be necessary for me to know the number of schools, and the location of each, together with the number of rooms in each school which will have to be inspected. The Inspector will have to remain a half day in each classroom, before he will be in a position to report fully on the condition of the school, and the inspection will have to take place at least once each year. The Department, however, will endeavour to have\nthe Inspector do this work on the same financial basis as he will do the ordinary inspection work in connection with the public and separate schools of the Province.\n\nIf you will kindly furnish me with the information in respect to the number and location of the schools, I will advise you fully of the cost of the inspection, and will endeavour to co-operate with you in every way possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nList of Schools in the Province of ALBERTA, showing Agency and Reserve on which located and nearest Post Office Address.\n\nBOARDING SCHOOLS (Con)\n\n| School          | Reserve                  | Post Office Address | No. of Class-Rooms |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Vermilion       | Fort Vermilion           | Fort Vermilion      |                    |\n| (St. Henri)     |                          |                     |                    |\n| Wabasca C.

If the request to utilize the services of the public school inspectors is favourably considered, I shall be pleased if you will cite the terms upon which the Indian schools would be inspected and reported upon by them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.

Ross, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nEdmonton, November 24th, 1920.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the inspection of the Indian Schools, by the local School Inspector, I beg to state that the Department of Education for the Province of Alberta, will undertake this work provided the Indian Department will at least cover the expenses together with the remuneration of the Inspector during the time he is actually inspecting these schools. The Department will undertake to inspect the one room schools once a year, for $25.00 per year, and the two room schools, for $40.00 per year, and furnish the Department of Indian Affairs with all information in connection with the character of the work being done in these schools.\n\nKindly advise me whether or not this would be satisfactory to your Department, and if it is not, kindly make a proposition which in your opinion would be fair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. J. D.

D. McLean, on November 24th. Trusting that same has come to hand, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDecember 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letters of the 24th ultimo and the 2nd instant, in which you cite the terms upon which the Indian schools in the Province of Alberta might be inspected and reported upon by the provincial inspectors.\n\nWe will give this matter further consideration and I will communicate with you in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. T. Ross, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, February 15, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is desirous, at this time, of completing arrangements for the inspection of the Indian schools in Alberta. I have examined the correspondence with your office, of more than a year ago, referring to this matter, and I beg to state that, as soon as a definite agreement has been made, this Department is prepared to ask the Minister to authorize the expenditure that will be incurred. A list of Indian day and residential schools in Alberta was sent to you on September 24, 1920; or two of these schools have been closed; others have been opened, and I am enclosing up to date information. Five residential schools near Lake Slave Lake have been omitted from this present list. It is felt that the benefits accruing from an inspection of these schools would not be commensurate with the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe wish to have five day and fourteen residential schools inspected by your officers. These schools are readily accessible and should cause no serious inconvenience to the staff of inspectors.\n\nIn view of this fact, the Department of Indian Affairs feels that $20.00 could be paid for the inspection of one-roomed schools once a year and $35.00 for two-roomed schools. In this connection I refer you to your 58426-20 of November 24, 1920. You will remember that you asked this Department to make a proposition which we thought fair. The financial arrangement that I have mentioned conforms more nearly to the average rate offered us by the Departments of Education for the three Prairie Provinces.\n\nWhen arrangements are completed, is it your wish that we direct one cheque a year to your office, or make payment to the individual inspectors as their reports are presented to Ottawa.

The Minister has considered your proposal to have the Departmental Inspectors inspect the Indian Schools mentioned in your list at the rate of $20.00 for the inspection of a one-roomed school and $35.00 for a two-roomed school, the inspections to be made once each year. This arrangement is satisfactory to the Minister and I hope that you will find that the Inspectors will do their work satisfactorily.\n\nThe arrangement that would be most satisfactory to the Department would be to have your Department send a cheque to the Department of Education in Edmonton, at the end of each year, covering the inspection charges which will be forwarded to your Department with a copy of the Inspectors' reports on the work of the schools.\n\nI am sending you a small map of Alberta showing the boundaries of the inspectorates and the Inspectors in charge of each, in order that you may know the schools that\nEach Inspector will be responsible for.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. Russell T.

I understand that the arrangement will be satisfactory to your Minister and that it is your wish that the financial settlement be made to your office at the end of each year.\n\nYou have intimated that you are forwarding a small map of Alberta, showing the inspectorates. This will be of much value in giving this Department a comprehensive understanding of the work that your staff will be called upon to perform.\n\nWhen definite arrangements have been made with the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the Department of Indian Affairs will secure the necessary authority for the scheme from the Minister, and you will be further advised.\n\nI have to thank you for your interest and cooperation in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ross, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, April 21, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nAbout 1885 an arrangement was made with the Ontario Department of Education for the inspection of the Indian schools. It was agreed that the remuneration paid to the inspectors would be at the rate of $6.00 per room, plus the actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular route. This arrangement obtains today. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nIn Quebec and the Maritime Provinces an arrangement was made in 1888 with the Departments of Education on similar lines as for Ontario. The rate of remuneration was $5.00 per room plus expenses. Since January 1, 1921, in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces the inspectors have received $7.50 per room plus expenses. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nArrangements have been concluded this year with the Prairie Provinces. In Manitoba we have agreed to pay the inspectors at the rate of $15.00 per classroom plus expenses. In Saskatchewan and Alberta a flat rate of $20.00 per school is being charged for one inspection per year. In the case of the last two provinces, no allowances are made in connection with expenses.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, May 17, 1922.\n\nTo Indian Agents and Teachers of Indian Schools:\n\nI have to inform you that arrangements have been completed with the Department of Education for your Province for the inspection of Indian schools by the staff of public school inspectors. This action has been taken with view to standardizing the instruction offered and making it as bright and attractive as possible. Although the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, yet teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and general management of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, the course of studies prescribed by the Provincial Department should be used by each Indian school. Every assistance should be given to the public school inspectors in the discharge of their duties. This inspection by professionally qualified educationists is being done at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 19, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Ross:\n\nI have to inform you that the Minister has authorized the inspection of the Indian schools in Alberta by the staff of public school inspectors and a payment to your Department at the flat rate of $20.00 per day and $35.00 per residential school.\n\nThis Department would be grateful if you would add the Indian schools to the present lists given your inspectors. Their reports on our forms - copies of which are enclosed - should be forwarded from your office to W. M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Regina, Sask.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs would prefer to send you one cheque per annum for the services of your inspectors. When requisition is made for this payment, it might be well to attach a memorandum showing the schools that have been inspected during the calendar, fiscal or academic year, whichever you prefer. The month for this payment may be selected by your Department.\n\nIt is our wish that the schools on the list forwarded to your Department under cover of February 16th, last, be inspected once during the academic year. From time to time, we will keep you informed concerning the opening or closing of any Indian schools in the province. The inspectors of your Department should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications and the pedagogy of our teachers; the progress of the pupils; and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment, with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teachers of Indian schools are not directly responsible to the public school inspectors, as these schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department; however, teachers are expected to carry out the instructions of the inspectors in regard to their work and the general management of the school. The inspectors should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure of a teacher, or principal, to carry out any reasonable suggestions made by them.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the Department of Indian Affairs. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will be welcomed by us; but the final decision rests with Ottawa.\n\nThe course of studies prescribed by the Alberta Department of Education should be followed by the classes in Indian schools. Your inspectors will likely find teachers following a curriculum printed on the back of our school\n\nJ. T. Ross, Esq., M. A.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nregister; but this practice should be discontinued, as all teachers have been, or should have been, instructed that the Provincial course is to be followed. The registers for Indian schools that have lately come from the press contain more up-to-date instructions. Generally speaking, Indian day schools are closed during the months of July and August.\n\nI am of the opinion that you will find the work in our Indian day schools not yet up to the standard as set by the public schools of the province. It is our wish to remedy this condition as soon as possible. It may be necessary, in many instances, to hire teachers with better qualifications. This will, of necessity, mean an increased salary item, and the change will have to be made slowly with the consent of Parliament, which votes the funds for Indian education.\n\nThe inspection reports, as stated above, and all recommendations should be directed to Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina. The requisition for annual payment and any questions concerning duties or policy should be addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nThis Department is grateful to you for your interest and cooperation in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEdmonton, May 25th, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th inst., re the inspection of the Indian Schools in Alberta by the Public School Inspectors in this Province, at a flat rate of $20.00 per day school, and $35.00 per residential school. I have advised the Chief Inspector, G. W. Gorman, B.A., of the agreement entered into between the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and the Education Department in Alberta, and he will advise the Inspectors in whose territory the Indian Schools are located, with regard to the yearly inspection of these schools, and the report which must be prepared and sent through the Chief Inspector to W. M. Graham, Indian Commissioner, Regina, Saskatchewan. The arrangement to have the Department of Education in Alberta remunerated at the end of the calendar year, for the inspection of these schools, is satisfactory, as the fiscal year and calendar year are identical in this Province.\n\nThe Department of Education will advise the Inspectors that they have no authority to dismiss a teacher.\nIn one of these schools, or to compel him to carry out their recommendations, but that the Department of Indian Affairs will be pleased to have a full report on the academic and professional standing of the teacher, his work in the schoolroom, his personality, and the progress made by the students, and also recommendations which in their opinion would increase the efficiency of the institution. I am pleased to learn that you have decided to use the Alberta course of studies, as this will give our Inspectors a satisfactory means of estimating the work done in each school, and the progress made by the students from year to year. I can assure you that the Inspectors will not act in a dictatorial manner, but will endeavor to co-operate with the teacher and assist him in every way possible.\n\nHoping that this scheme will work out satisfactorily, I am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDr. Russell Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 1, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Ross:\n\nI have your No. 30901-22 of the 25th ultimo, concerning the inspection of the Indian schools in Alberta by your staff of public school inspectors. I have noted that your Chief Inspector, Mr. G. W. Gorman, B.A., has received the necessary instructions.\n\nI am grateful for the personal interest that you have given this matter, and I trust that much good will result from the present arrangement. At the end of each calendar year, you should requisition for the payment to your Department for the services of your inspectors. The account should be in duplicate, and it might be well to support it by a memorandum showing the schools that have been inspected during the year.\n\nI expect to be in Edmonton, in the regular course of my duties, some time in late July or early August, and I will telephone your office in the hope of having an interview with you, or one of your officials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. T. Ross, Esq., M.A.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nCorrespondence with Wm Graham re specific duties re Sack file\n\n20949\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 17th instant, No. 24949-3, referring to the Department's arrangement that future inspection of Indian Schools would be made by the Public School Inspectors of the Province.\n\nYour instructions in the matter are carefully noted.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your circular of the 17th inst., No. 24947-3 re public-school inspectors for the Indian schools of this Province, and in reply to say that its content has been carefully noted and the orders given shall be complied with.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nuniversities, and have had the professional training necessary to obtain first class teachers' standing. Moreover, all have had extended and successful teaching experience in the public schools of Alberta. Appointments to the staff are provisional and are made permanent at the discretion of the Minister after two years of service.\n\nNo new inspectorial divisions were created during the year, (and the number of inspectors remains at thirty-eight (38), as at the close of 1920) but some adjustments in inspectorial boundaries to equalize work were made. The work of inspection of schools has shown improvement in the matter of better organization of work and increased efficiency. This is largely due to the fact that there has been practically no change in the personnel of the staff for a considerable time, and there has been an unusual degree of continuity in the inspection service afforded in the several divisions. Thereby inspectors have acquired a close knowledge of the problems peculiar to their respective fields and this has resulted in the more speedy adjustment of difficulties and problems relating to the administration and efficiency of our schools.\n\nAll schools within the province are now under departmental inspection. These include the public and separate, both elementary and secondary, and also the private and Indian schools. The inspection of schools has been more thorough and complete than in any previous year; all schools, with the exception of 162, an average of about four schools having been visited and inspected at least once during the period of inspection. The number of inspections made during the year was 6,342, made up as follows:\n\n- 1,820 rooms inspected -------------- Once\n- 1,960 rooms inspected -------------- Twice\n- 198 rooms inspected -------------- Three times.\n\nThe aim has been to afford at least two inspections to each school department each year, and thus make it possible for the inspector to have a closer acquaintance with the capacity of the teaching force, and have his work partake more of the nature of supervision than inspection solely.\n\nIn order to make the inspector's visit as helpful as possible, the teacher (if in a school where four or more teachers are employed) now receives a copy of his report as forwarded to the Department. Formerly only city teachers received copies of reports on their work. If the present procedure is found to be satisfactory in 1922, it will be extended to include all teachers at work in the province.\n\nA clear idea of the work of inspection and the educational development in the province may be gathered from the inspectors' annual reports. Extracts which are regarded as being of greatest value have been made from these reports and are submitted herewith.\n\nA map showing the inspectorates and a list of inspectors appears herewith. The inspectorates are numbered in general from north to south, and in tabulating the extracts, the same order has been adhered to throughout.\nnecessary to continue the policy of assistance through government loans, to insure operation and the redemption of maturing debenture coupons.\n\nThe following comments of inspectors in charge of various divisions reveal the influence of conditions upon possible results:\n\nGeneral agricultural conditions in this division have not been good and this has had its effect upon matters educational. Selling prices for the farmer have continued low, whilst there has been no proportionate and correspondent fall in the prices of machinery and general commodities. The result has been a scarcity of money. The stringency has been so general throughout the school districts that it is rather creditable that school operation has been so good, and application for government help has been so rare. For only one school district has application been made for help, and here the application was made on quite other grounds than that of agricultural depression.\n\nOne usual effect on the farmer's shortage of money is the certainty of his effort to pay the teacher less than he paid him during this year and last. Trustees seem to feel that they are justified by general monetary conditions in lowering salaries. A general lowering of salaries, if applied to the whole Province, will affect the quality of the student, who is attracted to the teaching profession. (Inspector Beveridge, Peace River.)\n\nThe crops for 1921 were good, but the low market prices and the excessive freight charges have left the farmers with little or no chance of raising money. This fact is already affecting the operation of schools and teachers' salaries.\n\nHowever, teachers' salaries have, on the average been good, the majority of the districts, even those in the more undeveloped parts, have been paying in the neighborhood of twelve hundred dollars. Some of the older districts have been paying thirteen hundred, and even sixteen hundred dollars. (Inspector Bremner, Grande Prairie.)\n### ANNUAL REPORT, 1921\n\n| Divis.

I note that the inspectors' reports have been directed to the office of our Indian Commissioner at Regina. In the future, I should be pleased if you would arrange to have these reports go forward individually, as soon after each inspection as possible. I also learn, with regret, that your Inspector made a visit to the temporarily closed Old Sun's Indian Boarding School, on the Blackfoot Reserve. If there were any expenses in connection with the visit of Mr. MacKenzie, that this Department should meet, I shall be pleased to have a special account from you.\n\nTen boarding schools at $35 and six day schools at $20 have been inspected, and a cheque for $470 is being directed to you, under separate cover. This Department is grateful for your cooperation and interest in this connection.\n\nThe list of Indian schools forwarded you under cover of May 19th, last, should be amended as follows: Delete the St. Joseph's Industrial School, which was situated 20 miles southeast of Calgary and add the Morley Day School, situated on the main line between Calgary and Banff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

This grant from the Government should not be less than $600.00 per year and the Church, if the institution is to remain a church school, should be required to supplement the Government grant by an equal amount. None but fully qualified, experienced teachers of known ability, holding nothing less than a Second Class Certificate should be employed. As the principals of these schools are not trained teachers and have little idea of what to demand in or require from a teacher, her appointment should not be left with the principal nor with the church, but should be placed in the hands of experienced men. I do not know of any who could perform this duty better than the inspectors themselves. The teacher too should be given to understand that she is answerable to the inspector for the type of work she is doing and for the progress that is being made under her instruction.\n\nJ. H. Hutchison,\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 29, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Ross:\n\nI wish to draw your attention to certain features of your Mr. Inspector Hutchison's reports on Indian schools. Your officer has been quite severe in some of his criticisms and has suggested some rather radical changes. I am confident that a quiet word from you, explaining the situation outlined in my letter of May 19th, last, would be very helpful, and he, in turn, would increase his helpfulness if he understood the conditions under which we have been working for so many years. I am sure Mr. Hutchison is a tactful gentleman and has not been so outspoken in the field as in his reports. At some of our institutions, the public school inspectors have not been welcome a second time because they expected too much upon the occasion of their first visit. We have had protests from certain church authorities, relative to engaging the services of public school inspectors; and, if your officer would adopt a more kindly, but none the less critical attitude, this Department would be pleased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

If the teacher is inefficient, a statement to that effect can be made in more kindly language.\n\nI have advised Mr. Hutchison not to expect too much from these schools, as it would take a number of years to create a standard in Indian schools such as that which is expected by an Inspector in an ordinary rural school. I have also advised him in regard to his relation to the teacher, that the only authority he has is to make a few suggestions in a kindly way and to avoid being dictatorial in any respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nRussell T.

This payment is for the inspection of twelve residential and eight day schools. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you for your Department's cooperation in our effort to provide better educational facilities for the young Indians in Indian wards. Much good has resulted from the helpful criticisms of the Alberta inspectors and there has resulted better teaching services and physical equipment.\n\nI am enclosing a list of the schools to be inspected this year. This is for the purpose of keeping our files up to date. Under separate cover, there is being directed to you 50 copies of a new report form, to be used by public school inspectors when visiting Indian residential schools. The old forms should be used when reporting on Indian day schools.\n\nI note that Mr. Inspector Yule visited the St. Bruno's and Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential Schools in 1923 but not in 1924. If it is convenient to your Department and this inspector, I should be pleased if these two schools are kept on the list. I might also point out that Mr. Inspector Crispo refers to the Cold Lake Day School as the St. Lawrence and to the Goodfish Lake School as the Whitefish.

Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Calgary.\n\nMr. J. J. LeBlanc inspected the Edmonton Indian Residential School on November 16, 1933, and the St. Albert Indian Residential School on November 13 and 14, 1933. His reports were received on the 20th of November, and were forwarded to your agent in Calgary two days later. The St. Francis Xavier school was inspected by Mr. H. E. Balfour on October 5, 1933. His report was received in this office on November 23, and forwarded to Mr. Christianson on the same day.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Christianson in order that I may learn whether or not these reports were received by him and what disposition was made of them. If the originals are not available I will secure other copies and send them to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Ross.\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. J. D.

However, we have been unable to locate any record of these reports having reached here and, apparently, they must have gone astray in the mails.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate if you would forward copies of these three reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, that the reports for the year 1933 on the St. Albert and St. Francis Xavier Indian Residential Schools were forwarded to you on November 24, and that he has written you to this effect. I believe it is merely an oversight that Mr. Christianson has not mentioned the reports on the Edmonton Indian Residential School in his letter to me, as these were enclosed under the same cover as the St. Albert reports.\n\nWill you kindly advise me whether these reports have come to light in order that the matter may be settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. J.

He made an inspection of the work of these children while he was in that territory, and is prepared to send in a report provided your department wishes to have a report on this school. I wish to state, however, that it is not on the list which was sent to this department, and therefore Mr. Wilson had no authority to make the inspection. I would be pleased, however, to know what your wishes are in regard to the inspection of this school in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. J. D.

The reason it was not included on the list of schools to be inspected by your Inspectors was that we were not aware that any of your officers visited this school.\n\nIf your Inspector visits this school yearly, he should submit his report to us, in the same manner as for the other Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In schools directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education all teachers are required to hold a valid certificate of qualification in pursuance of Section 154 of The School Act. Such valid certificate is, of course, a teacher's professional certificate issued by the Minister of Education.\n\nWhile it is true that private schools are not directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, it is nevertheless obvious that the Department's responsibility in accepting recommendations for credit from instructors in private schools and in issuing statements of credits to students in such schools must rest on some assurance that the instructors hold valid academic and professional qualifications and also the special qualifications required for teaching certain elective and optional subjects.\n\nThere are persons offering instruction in private schools of the Province who hold satisfactory academic qualifications, but who nevertheless have not attended any other training institution such as a teachers' college, normal school, or school or faculty of education, and hold no pedagogical qualifications of a kind that can be regarded as definitely professional.\n\nDuring the year 1938-39, the Department of Education will continue its policy of accepting recommendations for credit in high school subjects or optional subjects of the intermediate school from instructors in private schools, provided such recommendations are accompanied by a statement of an Inspector of High Schools or an Inspector of Schools to the effect that the instruction, organization and equipment meet with his approval.\n\nThis arrangement, however, will terminate on September 1, 1940. Thereafter recommendations for credit in any or all high school subjects and any optional subjects of the intermediate school made by any private school shall be recognized by the Department only in those cases where the recommendations are made by a person holding a valid professional certificate, issued by the Minister of Education of the Province of Alberta.\n\nDuring the year 1939-40 recommendations for credit in high school subjects (or in the optional subjects of the intermediate school) may be accepted from private schools by the Department of Education if such recommendations are accom-\npanied by a statement from an Inspector of High Schools or an Inspector of Schools to the effect that the instruction, organization and equipment meet with his approval and further, that the school concerned is making reasonable progress towards securing teachers who hold valid Alberta qualifications.\n\nFrom the foregoing statement you will understand that teachers in private schools who do not hold a valid professional certificate are expected to qualify for such a certificate on or before September 1, 1940; if they desire the privilege of recommending students for crediting during the year 1940-41. Members of your staff who hold academic standing obtained outside the Province and who have also taken professional teacher-training courses at institutions outside the Province are asked to have an official statement of such standing and such teacher-training courses sent to this Department from the Department of Education of the province or state where such standing was obtained, or such courses taken.\n\nThose members of your staff who submit official evidence of academic standing and professional training that can be recognized as the equivalent of an Alberta certificate will receive such certificate. Those who are not entitled to a certificate from this Department will be advised regarding further courses or training which may be required before they will be deemed eligible for a professional certificate. The Department will offer special summer-school courses in July, 1939, which such persons may take in order to bring their professional qualifications up to the required standard. These summer-school courses will be spread over a period of two years in order to suit the convenience of the teachers concerned.\n\nIt is desirable that you and members of your staff give consideration to this matter of valid certification at an early date, in order that any necessary arrangements may be made for summer-school courses at the 1939 session of the Summer School. A copy of the newly issued pamphlet on the \"Training and Certification of Teachers in Alberta,\" and of the Summer School Announcement for 1939, will be sent to you on request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

DATE\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\nMay 23, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have before me a group of reports on Indian Schools. The following paragraph is taken from the covering letter of Superintendent Hamilton of Cardston:\n\n\"In these reports I have made a protest against the supplementary reading books supplied to these schools. I did the same last year and helped the Principal make a suitable list of books although this list was requisitioned none of them were supplied. Those sent were the same type of out-dated books that are already in the school; many of them duplications of what they already had. I wondered if a suggestion from you would help to ensure that books supplied next year would be chosen from the requisition list. I would be very pleased if you would add your recommendation to my own.\"\n\nWould you be good enough to give this request further consideration and advise me if you think it possible that favorable action might be taken along the line suggested by Mr. Hamilton?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\nOttawa, May 28, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor McNally:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you submit, for my consideration, an excerpt from a report relating to text books, received by you from Inspector Thomas F. Hamilton.\n\nI find it somewhat difficult to know what I should say by way of reply to Inspector Hamilton.\n\nIt may help you to understand more fully the position in which I find myself if I state that, in a general way, we attempt to follow in our Indian day and residential schools the provincial curricula authorized by the provincial departments of Education throughout the Dominion. These curricula or courses of study have been frequently revised in recent years. Indeed I feel I am speaking more accurately when I state they appear to be in a constant state of flux. The courses of study in Manitoba, in Ontario and in the province of Quebec are now in process of reconstruction. All these revisions involve constant changes in text-books and particularly in supplementary readers. In addition to this, our Indian day and residential schools are operated in co-operation with the Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and United Churches of Canada, with one or two schools in British Columbia operated under the auspices of the Salvation Army. It is scarcely necessary to state that certain text-books, acceptable to Catholics, would be looked upon as wholly unsuitable in non-Catholic schools.\n\nIt is a common experience here for the officials to purchase supplementary readers on the recommendation of an inspector, only to discover that a newly appointed inspector, working in the same school or schools, will point out the unsuitability of the readers recommended by his predecessor and submit a completely new list to this Department. It happens so frequently that an attempt was made to get four inspectors in one of the eastern provinces to meet, in the hope that they could submit to this Department a list of supplementary readers suitable for Indian schools in the province. You may not be surprised to learn that the inspectors failed to agree and sent in four distinct and separate lists.\n\nWhen I entered the Department and encountered this problem about four years ago, I issued a circular letter, suggesting that the time spent by white pupils in supplementary reading might be profitably spent by Indian pupils in manual training and Indian handicraft projects -\n\nG. Fred McNally, Esq., M.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nprojects, and my suggestion has been adopted in a number of schools in the East. I realize, of course, that there is a weakness in the suggestion in that it is likely to handicap the Indian pupil who is proceeding in the direction of a high school course.\n\nAll text-books for use in Indian schools, together with maps, exercise books and school supplies generally, are purchased, not by this Department, but by the Stationery Office of the Government. The officials of this office, together with our own officials here, are naturally anxious in a period like this to keep down educational costs and consequently always aim at buying text-books and supplementary readers in bulk. This fact in itself may explain why we cannot always respond quickly to the recommendation of an inspector while we have a number of undistributed text-books on hand.\n\nAnd now I come to Inspector Hamilton's reference to the residential schools on the Blood reserve. The last requisition received from the Principal of this school is dated December, 1929. All the regular text-books requested, with one or two exceptions, were supplied together with the regular school supplies. Inspector Hamilton states: \"In these reports I have made a protest against the supplementary reading books supplied to these schools. I did the same last year and handed the principals to make a suitable list of books\". I can state very definitely that no such list reached this Branch from the Principal of the St. Paul's school. In addition to the regular text-books requested, I am attaching hereto a list of the supplementary readers sent forward by the Branch, in the hope that the principals and pupils would find them interesting and suggestive.\n\nIn the case of the Blood R. C. school, a small number of supplementary readers were requested by the principal, but inasmuch as the books requested were not in stock and in view of the fact that we had still a large number of supplementary readers on hand, all the supplementary readers requested by the principal were not sent forward. However, I am sending forward a list of the supplementary readers supplied to this school. It is only fair to the officials here to state that in the case of both schools more supplementary readers were supplied than were requested by the principals.\n\nI certainly appreciate your interest in this particular matter. If you are in the East at any time in the immediate future, I would certainly welcome a visit by you to this Branch. The purchase and distribution of text-books and supplementary readers is one of the most difficult problems confronting the officials charged with the administration of Indian schools, particularly so in these days, when our educational appropriation has been drastically reduced.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

While the education of the Indian is the responsibility of the Dominion nevertheless interested parties bring their views to us.\n\nSince the inspection of Indian Schools is undertaken by our inspectors who in most instances live relatively close to the reserves and schools, this group of men should be in a good position to express a collective judgment respecting them.\n\nWe propose, consequently, at some convenient time, to have our inspectors meet together and discuss the question, their views then being made available to us and to your Department.\n\nSince the problem is primarily a Dominion one it seemed proper that you should be informed of our intention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa, July 18, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEducation of Indians in Alberta\n\nYour letter of July 12 has been received. We will certainly be interested in hearing the views of your inspectors on the above subject.\n\nA survey is being made at present of Indian Education in Canada. It is being carried out by Dr. Andrew Moore, Ph.D., Inspector of Secondary Schools for the province of Manitoba, who is working under the auspices of the Canadian Social Science Research Council and in close cooperation with the Indian Affairs Branch. Dr. Moore has started his survey in Manitoba and Ontario but hopes to be able to visit the West in the Spring of 1947. I feel sure, in view of the interest you have already shown, that he can count on your cooperation when he comes to the province of Alberta. You are no doubt acquainted with the excellent educational survey which Dr. Moore conducted in the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories in 1946.\n\nIt has been a long hard struggle to convince many of the Indians of the need for educating their children. However, most of our problems in this connection are gradually being solved and we hope that we will soon be able to offer greatly improved educational facilities for the Indians. Our newly appointed Superintendent of Welfare and Training is at work now preparing a ten year programme for the improvement of our whole educational system.\n\nWe have a few requests to make of you:\n\n(a) Could you provide us with the names and addresses of those\n\n..... of your\nof your inspectors who report on our Indian Schools. We are publishing a monthly educational journal entitled \"Indian School Bulletin\". It will do much to outline our policies and should be of benefit to these inspectors in their work in our schools.\n\n(b) Could we have copies of the legislative Acts in your province dealing with\n\n(I) Teacher's Superannuation,\n(II) School Attendance,\n(III) Schools Act.\n\n(c) Could we have a copy of the latest report of your Department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW.

It is anticipated that we will bring our Inspectors of Schools in for this gathering and I hope to be able to get the men who report on Indian schools together at that time.\n\nAttached hereto is a list of the Superintendents who have Indian schools located in their areas. Copies of your Journal \"Indian School Bulletin\" will be greatly appreciated by the members of the staff of Superintendents who deal with Indian schools and by this office.\n\nI am forwarding under separate cover, copies of the Teachers' Superannuation Act and The School Act, which includes the regulations regarding school attendance.

Hoey,\nChief Superintendent of Schools,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nINDIAN EDUCATION IN ALBERTA\n\nOn August 22, 1946, those school superintendents of our Alberta staff who had had experience with Indian schools met to discuss educational facilities for Indian pupils. The attendance was good and all those present were men of considerable experience with schools for Indians; one superintendent actually grew up on an Indian reserve where his father was engaged in educational work.\n\nThe men discussed the topic freely, and contributed a great deal of information about existing facilities which provide for the education of Indians. I have attempted to summarize these contributions in the following report:\n\nMISSION SCHOOLS\n\nOn the whole, the superintendents approved of the mission schools, chiefly for non-institutional reasons. When the Indian children come into these schools they are put into a thoroughly hygienic condition and given clean clothing. Medical officers examine them and prescribe any treatment that may be needed. Children showing symptoms of active tuberculosis are hospitalized. Nonactive cases are taken care of quite efficiently; the children are not allowed to over-exert themselves and are allowed at least two rest periods during the day; they are put on a high protein diet, weights are checked frequently, and they are given such other treatment as may be prescribed by the medical officer.\n\nAlthough the missions are usually overcrowded, the living accommodation for the Indian pupils is usually satisfactory in other respects. Their quarters are clean, well aired, and properly heated, while the diet of the children has been observed to be satisfactory.\n\nSome of the superintendents reported that occasionally the Indians object to sending their children to the mission schools, chiefly because they are taken away from their homes from Sunday night to the following Friday night, except during vacation periods.\n\nINSTRUCTION\n\nIt was generally agreed that the instruction given in Indian schools is not up to standard. In the first place qualified teachers are seldom employed; in most cases persons with Grade IX standing, and no professional training, are in charge of the classes. As a result, the teaching done in the schools is usually quite unsatisfactory.\n\nThe course of studies used is too indefinite. Usually some attempt is made to follow our own course of studies, but apparently the teachers and principals have a great deal of freedom, with the result that a very mediocre type of instruction is given which does not begin to approach the standards that we set for our public schools.\nThe library facilities for the mission schools were reported to be inadequate in practically every case. Most of the literature supplied was religious in nature and far above the comprehension of the pupils. Superintendents reported that they had frequently recommended suitable books, but that these recommendations were seldom, if ever, carried out. Several of those present were of the opinion that the books for the Indian schools were chosen in Ottawa by persons without teaching experience who were not conversant with conditions in Indian schools.\n\nOne inspector complained that the Dominion Government grants for education in mission schools were very low, and that this fact was responsible for the lack of proper equipment and library facilities that prevailed.\n\nA certain amount of vocational training is offered in the mission schools, chiefly farming. In a number of places the pupils who have reached a suitable age spend half of their school time in the classroom and the balance at vocational work. The latter includes home economics for girls, and shop and farm work for boys. It was observed that very creditable art, embroidery, leather, bead, and needlework is being done in these schools.\n\n**INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS**\n\nThere are very few Indian day schools in the Province so our superintendents have not had a great deal of experience with them. However, they report that as far as instruction is concerned the same unsatisfactory conditions prevail in them as do in the mission schools. Teachers, as a rule, have very low academic standing and no professional training whatever. The Provincial courses of studies are followed very loosely and there is a dearth of proper equipment and library facilities.\n\nAs in the case of the mission schools, the Indian children are making very slow progress with their studies as compared with our public school pupils. A certain amount of shop work is given to the boys and suitable handwork to the girls, with comparatively good results.\n\nThe superintendents complained about the poor attendance at day schools; only about half of the children attend, and the punctuality is most unsatisfactory. In most of the areas where day schools are operated the Indians go on periodical trips to carry on hunting and fishing operations, during which times the children are out of school.\n\nHygienic conditions in these schools are reported to be appalling as the children live at home under the primitive conditions of their people. They are supposed to be inspected periodically by the health nurses and medical officers, yet in spite of this they are unclean, poorly clothed and apparently not very healthy.\n\nIt was reported that in some cases the Indians attend regular day schools in which their progress is considerably better than that of the children in the schools operated by the Dominion Government. However, in practically every case\nwhite settlers have protested against the Indians being in schools on account of their uncleanliness and the possibility of their presence exposing the other children to tuberculosis. The reports of the inspectors who have observed these children under public school conditions indicate that Indian pupils are capable of making better progress than they are doing in the average day and mission schools operated on reserves.\n\nAttention was drawn to the fact that the Indians appeared to absorb very little civilization while in the school. When the young graduate from school most of them seem to enjoy going back to the primitive Indian life and resuming the ways of living practised by their people. Only one exception was noted.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIt was considered that mission schools should be continued on reserves where the Indians are comparatively static as these schools provide clean, healthy conditions for the children. In outlying points, where the Indians are somewhat nomadic in their habits, it was thought that day schools should be operated during the spring, summer and early fall. It was considered that no attempt should be made to restrict the Indians in their trapping and fishing as these are their means of gaining a livelihood and it is desirable that the young people should learn to carry on these operations.\n\nIt was recommended that a suitable course of studies be drawn up for Indian schools, designed to meet their particular needs. The Indian is artistic and is fond of handwork but he loathes anything pertaining to the abstract. He is fond of nature, athletics and games. Vocational training should form a large part of the curriculum and should occupy approximately one-half of the pupils' school time. Instruction in stock raising, farming, trapping and fishing should be included. In a few cases the Indians operate coal mines so this activity should not be overlooked in the areas concerned. The vocations practised by the Indians in the area of the schools should be stressed in the programme of those schools.\n\nEvery effort should be made to provide suitable libraries for the Indian children. The literature should be simple and should deal with those things in which the Indian is interested; such as, art, nature study, adventure and hunting. A good supply of pre-primers and primary supplementary reading books should be provided. They should be well-bound, interesting books containing plenty of colored illustrations.\n\nIt was felt important that a full course of studies be drawn up which would be elastic enough to meet the conditions of the various schools. Due to the fact that the teachers who use them are seldom properly trained, the curriculum should be quite comprehensive.\n\nEvery effort should be made to provide trained teachers with suitable backgrounds. These people should be imbued with missionary spirit. They should have a satisfactory academic background and adequate training in pedagogy. In addition, they should receive special courses in the teaching of Indian children from experienced and competent instructors.\nIt was thought that the ideal Indian teacher would be a native Indian who has undergone the necessary training to enable him to instruct in the schools of his own people. One of the superintendents has known such teachers and recommends them highly.\n\nIn conclusion, it appears to be evident that the Indian schools in the Province are not accomplishing nearly as much as they might, due to poorly trained teachers, lack of a definite course of studies, and a dearth of proper equipment and library facilities. It is felt that under suitable conditions the Indian may be educated to take his place as a useful citizen of his own community and the country at large. The meeting strongly recommended that the Dominion Government be urged to extend and improve the facilities for the education of Indians in the Province of Alberta.\nEdmonton, September 4, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of July 18th arrived as I was leaving for my vacation and apparently was not answered pending the meeting of superintendents referred to.\n\nI now have the report of the group of superintendents which met August 22nd and enclose a copy.\n\nEnclosed also is a list of the superintendents who visit Indian Schools.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. Date Agent\nEDUCATION OF SLAVEY INDIANS\n\nReport by Hugh B. Wilson, Inspector of Schools for the Alberta Provincial Department of Education, on the education of the Slavey Indians at Upper Hay River, Hay Lakes, Bistcho Lake and Indian Cabins in Northern Alberta. This survey and report is the result of the request by the Indian Department to the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThe Slavey band of Indians located at the above mentioned places are, at the present time, lacking in education, medical attention and department administration. There are no schools where any of the one hundred and fifty children may attend, and a few have attended the St. Henri Mission at Fort Vermilion. However the distance is great and the Indian parents do not wish to part from their children for the time required to receive an education at this school. Moreover the Indians do not want mission\u2014schools.\n\nThe medical attention given these people is practically nil. A report on this condition may be obtained from the medical branch of the Department.\n\nThere is practically no administration given to this area by the Department. The following recommendations are made with the understanding that an Indian Agent will be placed in the Fort Vermilion area and that this section of the district will be part of his administrative unit. These Indians particularly need some person to advise and help them to care for their immediate needs.\n\nIn the following report I wish to stress that the first requirement is more administration and with it education. If the principals in each smaller district acted as sub-agents and advisers, as well as teachers, it would appear that this might be efficient and worthwhile guidance.\n\nThe education of this Slavey band, two hundred and seventy-five miles from a railroad, will by necessity cost much more than to operate the same sized school close to a railroad. The department should recognize this fact and be prepared to grant a sufficiently large appropriation.\nCURRICULUM:\n\nThe education of the northern Indians should not have the same aim as for those of the southern bands. The Indians of this area will not come into competition with the general white population. They are now and will continue to be essentially trappers. They may, at some time, operate extensive fur farms such as beaver and muskrat. There could be limited agricultural activities which should be encouraged to facilitate in obtaining a proper diet for them.\n\nThe training of the Indian child should be basically a practical education. At the present time very few of these Indians understand English. They cannot count, calculate or solve the fundamental problems based on arithmetic nor do they know or practise the simple health rules. In this respect they are below the other tribal standards.\n\nThe curriculum should be so constructed that the Indian child will be capable of taking his or her place with the tribe and to know and develop better ways of trapping, home building and health development. The curriculum should therefore be simple and as the tribal standard is raised then the curriculum can be expanded.\n\nThe chief aim should be to keep the Indian a northern trapper and, at the same time, develop his native ability so that he may, if necessary, be able to meet competition from other traders and trappers. The Indians of this area and especially those trapping in B.C. obtain ample fur to give them a very good living; much better than they are now getting. They are lacking in relative values because they are not educated in the fundamentals as above mentioned. The curriculum for them should be less academic than it is in other Indian schools. It should be more practical. The standard set for them should not be the same as for other schools, it should be made particularly for this area.\n\nSince the main purpose of giving some education to the Indians is to raise their standard of living much of this training should be practical. The boys now are taken on the trap-line by their parents at the age of twelve or thirteen. Here they learn the Indian way of trapping. This state should be allowed to continue and the boys should be excused from school at this age to allow for this training. They should also receive additional training in fur conservation and development from some source within the school.\n\nThe Indians are also endeavoring to adopt the methods of the whites in housing, clothes and diets but they are not trained in the crafts for such adoption. They should be given rudimentary courses in wood-craft and its associates, home development and its associates, and in the principles of health. The aim should be to have the Indians able to build and to know what to build for housing accommodation. They should know how to do simple machine sewing and mending.\n\nThe curriculum should be so constructed that the Academic training will be limited to a working knowledge of the skills such as reading, number, etc. and be commensurate with the use the Indians will later make of them. They should be able to read, write and have a working knowledge of simple arithmetic. This can be done by the age of twelve or thirteen. This could later be extended as the conditions warrant.\n\nThe teaching of health practices is one of the most important. This could only be done by actual usage. It would require the employment of a health and social worker.\n\nIt appears that this area requires a particular curriculum and that such curriculum should be carefully planned by the Department giving scope to the above suggestions.\nTYPE OF SCHOOL - \"A\":\n\nA day school situated at Upper Hay River would serve the families from this area and from Indian Cabins. The Indians from this area do not wish their children to be sent too far away to attend a mission or boarding school.\n\nThe enrolment at such a school would be between thirty and forty pupils and as this band is not increasing one classroom would be adequate for quite a number of years.\n\nThe location should be near the post and on the same side of the river as the proposed highway. This will be approximately two hundred and fifty miles from railway but it will be on the Yellowknife Highway and will thus be quite accessible. This location will also be advantageous in that it will be easier to get staff.\n\nThe curriculum for this school should be similar to that for the rest of the area although it may, of necessity, be somewhat restricted by the size of the staff. The building could be one similar to any modern rural school with a small work shop, kitchen and bath facilities. A wood burning furnace should be used as coal would be too expensive. The construction should be such that the material could be readily freighted. At the present time War Assets have two buildings within four miles of the post which could supply a large amount of the material. Good insulation should be provided.\n\nThe ideal staff for such a school would be a man and wife. Each should be able to do some of the teaching and each should be trained in some of the practical arts such as carpentering, home economics and health, and social services. The man could instruct in the crafts for the boys and the woman could instruct in the home sciences and do practical nursing.\n\nIn my opinion the staff of such a school should also be in charge of the administration of the other Indian affairs particular to this area. They should not only teach in the school but they should be the advisers to the Indians and the social workers amongst them. The success or such a school will depend on having that staff. The department should be prepared to pay sufficient salary and offer sufficiently attractive housing to induce the right people to apply for such position. The cost of this unit in capital outlay will, of course, depend on the non-construction. Transportation of materials will be less when the road is completed, presumably in 1947. I doubt if this unit, school and living accommodation, can be constructed for less than $20,000.00. The furnishing of the house must also be considered.\n\nA day school will have the following disadvantages:\n\n1. Securing a staff will be difficult.\n2. Administration problems will be increased.\n3. The regular attendance of the pupils may be difficult to obtain although the Indians at this post assured me they wished their children to attend this type of school.\n4. Some children will not return to their homes each evening there may be the problem of health and cleanliness. However, this may help to inculcate some degree of cleanliness in the home. The school plant will require good bath facilities.\n5. The school will probably have to remain closed in the winter at trapping time and remain open in the summer.\n6. One balanced diet meal should be given at the school each day and this will require space, staff and supplies.\nTYPE OF SCHOOL - \"B\":\n\nSituated at Hay Lakes. The actual location of this school will depend on the survey which is now being made by Mr. Brown. The area adjacent to the lake is very low and flat and may flood at high water. There is also consideration being given to the raising of the lake. The trading posts are now situated on the banks of the river. The location would be suitable if flooding could be prevented. As this prairie is large and very flat, levels should be obtained for the whole area.\n\nThe Indian families at Hay Lakes are more scattered than those at Upper Hay River. As there are many more families in this area it will probably continue to be the centre of the Slavey settlement. The two lines are now well established and registered. There appear to be facilities for the establishment of a controlled extensive fur farm on the lakes.\n\nThis particular area will be some forty miles from the Yellowknife Highway. The winter trail is quite passable but the summer road is very bad because of the muskeg. The lakes are too shallow for the landing of water planes but planes on wheels can readily land on the prairie. With very little clearing and levelling a good air strip could be made.\n\nThe enrolment of school age children will be between 110 and 125. This will require at least four classrooms with extra rooms for the practical arts outlined in the proposed curriculum. These will include a room for shop and handiwork, a room for cooking and sewing and girls' handiwork, as well as a room which could be used for a playroom and auditorium, teachers' room, a principal's office, and a room for the nurse and social worker (this however, could be in the hospital or infirmary). Modern plumbing and washing facilities will be a necessity. To provide these will require a modern lighting and water system which might be obtained from some War Assets plant.\n\nWith these four classrooms and other necessary teaching rooms this area should be serviced with boarding facilities for the pupils as it does not appear possible to operate a day school. So a number of day schools in the area. The dormitory space required will be the usual for this number of children. Included in the dormitory should be rooms where the children may work or play if it is not sufficiently close to the school. The usual plumbing fixtures should be installed as well as facilities for giving a steam bath.\n\nA small hospital should also be built in connection with this unit. The construction of this building should be such that all the boys or all the girls are not in one room. I suggest three or four to each room.\n\nThere should be a good dining room and kitchen with modern equipment.\n\nI would also recommend that a house similar to that which the Department would recommend for the Indians of this area be built. A family of Indians could then be given the privilege of living with their children near the school. In this way some of the health habits and social habits which are desirable could be developed with the family. A change of families could be made from time to time. Such a house should be practical for this area.\nSTAFF:\n\nThe teaching staff of this school should be a principal and three or four other grade teachers. In my opinion the principal should also be the Administrator of Indian Affairs for the area. He should be able to develop, through the school, such ideas as co-operative fur sales, extensive fur farming, health services and in general advise the Indians. This man would need to be well qualified for the work. In addition to the three or four classroom teachers, a nurse and social worker would be required. At least one of these should be qualified to teach the rudimentary shop courses and to assist the principal in developing the other phases. One of the lady teachers should be capable of teaching sewing, cooking, preserving, etc. An ideal set-up would be at least two married couples who could all work.\n\nThe dormitory staff would require a cook and possibly a helper. Much of the help with the cooking and sewing could be done by the girls as part of their training. There should, however, be someone in charge of the boys and the girls. They will require careful supervision and training.\n\nThe total staff would, of necessity, be four or five teachers, a nurse, and four dormitory assistants. I estimate the cost would be:\n\n- Principal - $3,000.\n- Teaching assistants - 2,000.\n- Nurse - 1,800 to $2,000.\n- Dormitory help - 1,200 to 1,500\n\nmaking a total of around $20,000, including janitor service.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nA - Present conditions warrant special attention by the Department.\n\nB - If this report and recommendations are not acceptable some other means should be found to give this band more administration, health services and educational facilities.\n\nC - Two teaching units, one at Upper Hay River and one at Hay Lakes, should be established.\n\nD - The unit at Upper Hay River could be tried as a day school.\n\nE - The unit at Hay Lakes should be a boarding school under the administration of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nF - Compulsory education should be required from boys six to thirteen and for girls six to fifteen.\n\nG - A special curriculum should be provided which will be more useful to the northern Indians.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\nAugust 13, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with a request from your Department, I am forwarding herewith a report prepared by Mr. Hugh B.

The Inspector should be quite frank in reporting the weaker cases of teachers and in recommending the release of a teacher when deemed necessary.\n\n2. The Department of Indian Affairs appreciates the Inspector's recommendation of additional equipment, of repairs to building, etc., and these matters will receive attention when funds are available.\n\n3. Reports of inspection visits should be sent promptly to this office in the Department of Education, in duplicate, in order that a copy of the report may reach the Department of Indian Affairs as soon as possible after the date of visit. It is quite important that the Spring and Fall term reports should be forwarded promptly in order that prompt action thereon may be taken.\n\n4. The chief object of this inspection service is to bring about improvement in the classroom practice of the teacher in these schools.\n\n5. At the end of each half-year (June and December) the Inspector should send his accounts to the Department of Education for inspection of Indian Schools. These accounts should be rendered separately and should not be included in the Inspector's monthly account.\n\nNote: Will the Inspector kindly keep this memorandum on file with other correspondence and reports relating to the Indian Schools, in order that reference may be made to it from time to time.\n\nChief Inspector.\n\nTORONTO, September 9th, 1936.\nTORONTO, September 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to send to you under separate cover copies of Inspectors' Reports on Indian Schools as listed below:\n\n| School and No. of Classrooms | Date of Visit | Inspector   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Magnetawan                   | Sept. 23      | J.M.

Had I known in time of your being about to visit either of those places, I'd have done my darndest to get up to see you, as there are many things we might have discussed, among others, the effect upon Indian schools of the new curriculum just issued in Ontario. However, I'll be running into you one of these days, no doubt.\n\nThe object of this note is to ask if you could send me, say, two hundred Forms 142, Inspector's Report on Indian Day Schools. I use up quite a few of these in the course of a year.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 19, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI have your letter of October 12th and regret that I missed you when I was west two weeks ago.\n\nI had an opportunity last week of attending a Convention of Indian day school teachers in South western Ontario. At that time we discussed very fully the new curriculum just issued in the Province of Ontario and I feel that it offers every opportunity for Indian school teachers to teach those subjects which they consider most useful to Indian pupils. Apparently the new curriculum allows considerable latitude.\n\nThe forms requested will be forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.J.

Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing this letter to remind you regarding the transfer to me of the Indian School on Christian Island. This school should have been on my list from its organization as it is directly in my territory. It is only a few miles from Tiny Township in which I have all the separate and most of the public schools (catholic). I also have the Catholic Schools in Penetanguishene which is the nearest town and I also have Midland. I am in a position to do this school during my regular rounds and instead of paying expenses for an Inspector from Toronto to the Island, there would only be expenses from Penetang to the school and return. However, the real reason why the change should be made is that it has always been understood that Indian Schools should be given to the local Inspector and there is no reason why I should be discriminated against in this case.\n\nThat is my side of the matter but, if this should in any way be a cause of any personal inconvenience or difficulty to you I should be quite satisfied that you disregard this letter.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPublic & Separate School Inspector.\nTORONTO, May 17th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to send to you under separate cover copies of Inspectors' Reports on Indian Schools as listed below:\n\n| School and No. of Classrooms | Date of Visit | Inspector   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Whitefish Lake               | 1.

I trust that you will find them in order.\n\nIt is my opinion that these forms could be improved by making the grading opposite the several items a little broader. At present we must either grade the teacher as low or high. If the \"low\" was divided into say \"poor and fair\" and the \"high\" into \"good and excellent,\" it would in my judgment give a better idea of our opinion of the different points. There is one item that beats me. I am totally at sea as to what is required opposite the term \"relations\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned...H.J. Clarke\nToronto,\nMay 27th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to give to you herewith for consideration a suggestion made by Mr. H.J. Clarke, Public School Inspector, Belleville, with respect to the Forms used for report upon Indian Schools by Inspectors. It may be that Mr. Clarke would not wish me to send this suggestion on. However, I give the suggestion merely that your Department may be aware of the opinion of one of the Inspectors.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChief Inspector.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing a copy of a letter received by you from Inspector Clarke in connection with the report form.\n\nFor some time past we had received several objections from Inspectors regarding the form that we were using and very serious thought was given to the preparation of the new form. One of its very good qualities is that it is on a single sheet and, therefore, can be used conveniently in a typewriter, especially if the Inspector wishes to keep a copy of his report.\n\nRegarding the grading you will note that \"low\" and \"high\" are divided into two sections. This makes four sections for each heading and as a matter of fact the first space would mean 25%, the next space 50%, the third space 75% and the fourth space 100%. Mr. Clarke considers that \"low\" should be divided into \"poor\" and \"fair\". This is exactly what we have done. If the teacher's appearance is poor a mark should be made in the left hand blank column under the heading \"low\" or, in other words, give her 25%. The other markings will at once occur to you.\n\nThe word \"relations\" has special reference to the efforts that the teacher makes to keep in touch with the parents with a view to encouraging them to have the children attend school regularly. I think you\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nwill agree that this is a very important part of the work of a teacher of an Indian Day School as in so many cases the parents do not display the interest in their children's education that we desire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Payette:\n\nI received your letter of April 23 regarding the inspection of the Christian Island R. C. Day School. I expect to be in Toronto within the next month and will then have an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nH.

Is there any French taught to any of these pupils? I may say that we have changed the inspector of the Spanish School. Mr. W.J. Greening, Port Arthur, was the former inspector, and Mr. Carriere of Sudbury, who is both a French-speaking and an English-speaking inspector, now inspects the school. It seemed desirable that the one inspector should also visit the Indian School, and therefore lessen the expense for travelling, etc. Do you believe there would be any objection to placing the Indian School at Spanish under Mr. Carriere? Are there any other Indian Schools in this immediate area, or in Manitoulin, where in your estimation the French-speaking inspector would be as acceptable as the English-speaking inspector?\n\nI shall be pleased if I may have your reply at your early convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in connection with the inspection of the Spanish Indian residential school and the Indian day schools on the North Shore and on Manitoulin Island.\n\nEnglish is the only language taught in any of the Indian schools mentioned above and as we have always had one of your English separate school inspectors I feel that it would not be advisable to make any change at the present time. It is unnecessary for me to add that any of the English separate school inspectors on your staff would, I am certain, give entire satisfaction not only to this Branch but also to the staffs of the schools concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nV.

This arrangement came into effect from January 1, 1939.\n\nThis voucher covers the inspection of 118 class rooms during the period January 1 to June 30, 1939. Reports of the Provincial Inspectorate on each of these classrooms have been received and are on file in this Department.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. DATE\nTORONTO, July 18th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to send to you herewith a statement of the inspection of Indian Schools in the Province of Ontario for the period January 1st., to June 30th., 1939.\n\nDuring the above period the Public and Separate School Inspectors visited 116 classrooms in the Indian Residential and Day Schools and under agreement with the Department of Indian Affairs this Department is entitled to a grant of $15.00 per classroom. Accordingly the amount due the Department of Education is $1,770.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Minister of Education.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nToronto,\nAugust 25th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to discuss with you again the question of the inspection of the Indian School at Spanish.\n\nThere is still some criticism being made of Inspector Greening in this area and I think it would be in his interests as well as to the Separate School in Spanish that he should not have need to visit the Spanish area at all. My suggestion is, therefore, that you select an English-speaking Separate School Inspector from the list other than Mr. Greening for the inspection of this Indian School and that the change take place as from September 1st. I may say, not because I have any preference whatever, that Dr. J.M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, formerly visited schools in this area and is therefore somewhat acquainted with the situation.\n\nMay I have from you a short reply regarding this matter at your early convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector.\n\nPhillip Phelan, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nOn my return to the office this morning after three weeks' absence on holidays I find your letter of the 25th instant in connection with the inspection of the Spanish Indian residential school.\n\nI appreciate very much your kindness in requesting me to suggest an English-speaking Separate School Inspector and I have much pleasure in recommending Dr. F.J. Macdonald, Separate School Inspector in Ottawa. As you are aware Dr. Macdonald inspected the Spanish school for several years previous to the date of his coming to Ottawa. He is fully conversant with conditions at the school and, besides, as he resides in Ottawa it will be very convenient for me to consult him from time to time regarding conditions at the school.\n\nI hope to be in Toronto about the middle of the month and expect to have an opportunity of calling on you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nV.K. Greer, Esq., M.A.,\nChief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nONTARIO\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nToronto, August 16th, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYou are aware that Mr. Henry Conn has now retired as Public School Inspector for the city of Sarnia and it will be necessary therefore to make some new arrangements for the inspection of the Indian Schools formerly inspected by him.\n\nOur recommendation would be that since the St. Clair Reserve Schools are 3 miles from Sarnia they be placed under Mr. H.B. Galpin of Sarnia, and that the Kettle Point and Stoney Point Schools be placed under Mr. J.J. Edwards of Petrolia. The Walpole Island Schools seem to have more contact with Kent County and the town of Wallaceburg so it is suggested therefore that the inspection of these schools be placed under Mr. Geo. Pearson, of Chatham.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 15th instant I consider that the following arrangement of Inspectors for Indian day schools will be quite satisfactory to this Department:\n\nSt. Clair School to be inspected by Mr. H.B. Galpin of Sarnia.\n\nKettle Point and Stoney Point Schools to be inspected by Mr. J.J. Edwards of Petrolia.\n\nWalpole Island No. 1 and Walpole Island No. 2 Schools to be inspected by Mr. Geo.

Reports of the Provincial Inspectors on each of these classrooms have been received and are on file in this Department.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVOUCHER NO. | DATE\n\nAgent\nOntario\nOffice of the\nCONTROLLER OF FINANCES\n\nToronto, May 1, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI trust that I may, with propriety, bring to your attention a matter which I believe comes within your authority; the matter has to do with the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nUnder agreement with the Department of Indian Affairs, the Department of Education of the Province of Ontario is entitled to a payment of $15.00 per inspection per classroom of the Indian schools in the Province of Ontario. On February 12, 1940, the Deputy Minister of Education sent an invoice for $1,740.00 to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, with an explanatory letter. No reply has been received. By direction of his Deputy Minister, the Chief Accountant of the Department of Education wrote on March 21st, March 30th, April 8th and April 15th, but none of his letters has been acknowledged.\n\nI regret to have to trouble you with this comparatively small matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.

The first letter is dated Toronto, February 12, 1940, and is signed by the Deputy Minister of Education. The second letter is dated April 8, 1940, and is signed by the Chief Accountant of the Department of Education. In this letter the Chief Accountant refers to letters sent forward on March 21 and March 30. The officials are convinced that these communications did not reach this Department.\n\nMay I express regret with respect to the failure of the Department to pay this account until now. This failure was due wholly to the exhaustion of the particular appropriation set apart for professional services and the inability of the Department to secure funds, owing to the unusual conditions prevailing at the time the account was first submitted.\n\nI must apologize, also, for the failure of the officials to acknowledge receipt of the\n\nS. Walters, Esq.,\nController of Finances,\nLegislative Building,\nToronto, Ont.\ntwo letters received from the Department of Education. It has not been the practice in the Indian Affairs Branch to formally acknowledge receipt of letters requesting payment for services rendered until the officers were in a position to send forward the cheques in settlement of the obligation. The particular voucher under review was sent forward to the Treasury officials for payment on April 15th and it is our hope that cheque for the amount will reach you in due course if it has not already done so. I must again express regret at our inability, until now, to deal with this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, May 3, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Payment of inspection fees,\nProvince of Ontario.\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Jackson's memorandum of May 2 and also letter received by the Minister from Mr. S. Walters, Controller of Finances, Province of Ontario, attached thereto.\n\nThe records here indicate that the sum of $4,700.00 was included in the 1939-40 estimates for professional and special services and that this sum was exhausted prior to the receipt of the Ontario account, which reached the Department on February 14. It was not possible, therefore, to pay this account until funds had been secured by Governor General's Warrant.\n\nIt would appear that the amount of $4,700.00, included in the 1939-40 estimates, was equal to the amount that has been included in the estimates for this service for number of years. I should point out, however, that under the old financial set-up, appropriations, when exhausted, were replenished from such appropriations as the per capita grants to residential schools or from any other appropriations where surplus funds were available, nor was it necessary in the old financial set-up to secure a transfer from the Treasury Board. The Treasury Regulations now in force impose upon the officials the obligation to exercise the greatest possible -\npossible care in setting up appropriations and in working out sub-allotments.\n\nYou will note from the draft reply to Mr. Walters, prepared for the signature of the Private Secretary, that only two letters relating to this matter reached this Branch. It would appear from the records that for some reason that one cannot easily explain it has never been the practice of the officials of this Branch to formally acknowledge receipt of letters requesting the payment of accounts or the payment of grants, unless the officials were in a position to make the payment at the time the letter was received. In the case of the Department of Education of Ontario, cheques for such payments are sent out by the Treasury and are not accompanied by letters from the Welfare and Training Service. I am of the opinion that all letters reaching the Department, particularly letters from the officials of the provincial government and from members of Parliament should be answered promptly, and in cases where it is found impossible to comply with the request contained in such letters, the receipt of the letter should at least be acknowledged. It is my intention to issue instructions to the Heads of the Services in this Branch, asking them in future to promptly acknowledge receipt of such communications.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nToronto, April 16th, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMusic is now being taught in practically every school room in Ontario. In the rural areas, itinerant Music Supervisors are visiting the classrooms once a week with very beneficial results. The local boards engage these supervisors, paying usually $60.00 a year for a one-roomed school and slightly more for each additional room in the same building.\n\nI have received many requests to make this service available to Indian schools, the latest from Cape Croker Indian Reserve in Bruce County. After discussing the matter with Mr. V. K. Greer, Chief Inspector, I am writing to you to request that you give some consideration to this matter.\n\nIf your Department could pay the salary of the Music Supervisor, we would be glad to recommend properly qualified supervisors who are already working in that locality. These supervisors would be under the authority of the local School Inspector, in the same way as other teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nProvincial Supervisor of Music.\nOttawa,\nMay 7, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Fenwick:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 16th ultimo with reference to teaching music in day schools in the Province of Ontario.\n\nThis is an activity which we would like to encourage but our appropriation for the fiscal year has been drastically reduced and under these circumstances it will be impossible to consider the proposal made in your letter. At the same time I wish to express our appreciation for your kind offer of co-operation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G. R. Fenwick,\nProvincial Supervisor of Music,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 10, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor McArthur:\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that, by an agreement entered into several years ago between your Department and the Department of Indian Affairs, provision has been made by you from year to year for the inspection of our Indian day and residential schools in the province of Ontario.\n\nIt would appear that in practice each school has been inspected twice annually and that payments at the rate of $15.00 per inspection per classroom have been made to your Department for this service.\n\nYou can readily appreciate that the Government, in this period of national crisis, is anxious to conserve public funds to the greatest extent possible. I regret to state, therefore, that it was not possible to include in the 1940-41 estimates a sum greater than the amount necessary to pay your Department for the inspections made during the period January 1 to June 30 of this year and one inspection per classroom for the period September 1940 to June 30, 1941. This decision will mean that during the years immediately ahead of us we shall make provision for one rather than two inspections of our Indian day and residential schools in Ontario and throughout the Dominion.\n\nI am writing to you at this time, in the hope that you will be able to make the necessary adjustment in your own appropriations of this year with the least possible inconvenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. McArthur, B.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nLegislative Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, May 10, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor McArthur:\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that, by an agreement entered into several years ago between your Department and the Department of Indian Affairs, provision has been made by you from year to year for the inspection of our Indian day and residential schools in the province of Ontario.\n\nIt would appear that in practice each school has been inspected twice annually and that payments at the rate of $15.00 per inspection per classroom have been made to your Department for this service.\n\nYou can readily appreciate that the Government, in this period of national crisis, is anxious to conserve public funds to the greatest extent possible.

The inspectors will be asked to make the visit in the next school year beginning September, 1940, toward the middle of the year or later in order that they may gain a better knowledge of the work being accomplished.\n\nYou are assured that the inspectors will give their full co-operation in the matter of making their supervision as effective as possible.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nDr. Charles Camsell,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to send to you under separate cover copies of Inspectors' Reports on Indian Schools as listed below:\n\n| School and No. of Classrooms | Date of Visit | Inspector       |\n|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| New Credit                   | May 22nd      | J.L.

J. McDonald. I believe this was done in order to place the school under an English-speaking inspector. We now have Mr. A. M. McNamara as an English-speaking Inspector in this area and it is my opinion that Mr. McNamara, living within the area, should be made the inspector for this school. I quite appreciate the fact that Dr. McDonald can visit the school but it means the inspector travelling a long distance unnecessarily.\n\nIt might also be well to consider placing some other Indian schools under Mr. McNamara where the schools have no French pupils, e.g., in the Sturgeon Falls area, Blind River area and the Timagami area. I am not suggesting that any immediate changes, on the fact that Mr. McNamara an English-speaking inspector is now working in this whole area, might be a reason for placing the schools differently.\n\nMay I hear from you at an early date with regard to the Spanish situation particularly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools.\nOttawa,\nApril 16, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, in connection with the inspection of the Spanish Residential School. In view of the fact that you now have an English-speaking Inspector living in the Spanish area, I concur in your arranging to have him inspect the Spanish School in future instead of Dr. F.J. McDonald.\n\nI should appreciate your advising where Mr. McNamara is living and also the area covered by his inspectorate. When I have this information I will be in a position to advise you of other Indian schools which he might inspect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. V.K. Greer,\nChief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 16, 1942.\n\nDear Mac:\n\nFor your information I attach a copy of a letter which has just been received from Mr. V.K. Greer, Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools.\n\nAs you are aware, we now allow the Department of Education a fixed amount for the inspection of each school and the Department of Education looks after all travelling expenses. I suppose part of Mr. Greer's idea is that in employing the services of Mr. McNamara the expense of visiting the Spanish School will be reduced.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. F.J. McDonald,\n860 Keho Drive,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTORONTO, April 14th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to send to you under separate cover copies of Inspectors' Reports on Indian Schools as listed below:\n\n| School and No. of Classrooms | Date of Visit | Inspector       |\n|------------------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Mission                      | March 19th   | A.W.

McNamara visit the residential Indian School at Spanish. The address of Mr. McNamara is 18 First Avenue East, North Bay.\n\nMr. McNamara's area comprises all the English separate schools from Espanola and Spanish on the west side, to North Bay and north to and including Cochrane on the T.& N.O. Railway, and west to Kapuskasing from Cochrane on the Transcontinental Railway. Mr. McNamara does not go into Manitoulin, does not go west of Spanish, and does not go east of North Bay. He also has three English classrooms in the Penetanguishene Public School.\n\nMay I assume that you will write to Mr. McNamara, asking him to visit the residential Indian School at Spanish, and also to Dr. F.J. McDonald regarding the change.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSelma\n\nName & Address of Agent\n\nDorcas -\nGarden Village -\nWhitford Lake -\n\nSigned by:\nC.

It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange to visit the school before the end of the current academic year.\n\nThe Principal is Rev. J. Howitt, S.J. There are two separate buildings, one for the boys and one for the girls, and you should, of course, inspect the classrooms in both these buildings. I enclose report forms, one of which you should complete for each teacher.\n\nThis Branch pays a set amount each year to the Department of Education, Toronto, for the inspection of Indian schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.M.

Levesque, Sturgeon Falls, Ont., in connection with the inspection of the Indian day schools on the Dokis and Garden Village Reserves.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. Charvon, the School Inspector, is a Provincial Government official but inspects some Indian day schools owing to an arrangement made by this Department with the Department of Education for the Province of Ontario.\n\nFor many years both the Dokis and Garden Village Schools had been inspected by an English-speaking Separate School Inspector. Some two or three years ago there was no English-speaking Inspector available and the Department of Education suggested that we use the services of Mr. Charvon. Recently the Department of Education appointed an English-speaking Inspector for that district and in a letter received from them, they intimated to us that, if we so desired, we could again use the English-speaking Inspector.\n\nHowever, no definite decision has yet been made in that regard and, in view of your representations, I have arranged with the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch to notify the Department of Education for Ontario that we desire Mr. Charvon to continue inspecting the Dokis School.\n\nMr. Levesque's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. J.R.

Levesque, Sturgeon Falls, Ont., in which Mr. Levesque discusses the inspection by this Department of the Dokis and Garden Village Indian Day Schools.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, Mr. Charron, the present inspector, is a provincial government official, who inspects a number of Indian day schools, by an arrangement between the Indian Affairs Branch and the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nThe records indicate that for many years both the Dokis and Garden Village Schools were inspected by an English-speaking separate school inspector.

Recently, the Ontario Department of Education appointed an English-speaking inspector for the district, and in a letter received from them intimated that if we so desired we could again use the English-speaking inspector.\n\nIn view of the fact that there are English-speaking teachers in charge of these schools, that the textbooks used are English and that English is the language of instruction, it is felt that it would be advisable to have the schools inspected by an English-speaking -\n\nDr. J.

Randle\n\nOttawa,\nMay 30, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Greer:\n\nI was in Brantford last week and at that time I had an interview with Mr. J.C. Webster, Inspector of Schools for Brant County, who visits the schools on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nMr. Webster expressed the opinion that two inspections a year instead of one would be very valuable in the case of weaker teachers. On the Six Nations Reserve we are employing Indian teachers exclusively and, while they do very well when they have had experience, some of them are rather weak at the start.\n\nI regret that the funds at our disposal are not sufficient to allow us to authorize two inspections a year at all our Indian schools in Ontario, but I feel that it would be advisable to have Mr. Webster visit the weaker teachers on the Six Nations Reserve twice instead of once during the academic year 1944-45.\n\nMr. Webster expressed his willingness to follow the procedure just outlined and I presume that such action will meet with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. V.K.

Greer, Department of Education, Toronto. You might inform Mr. Webster of the contents of these letters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle,\nSupt. Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ont.\nToronto 2, May 31st, 1944\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI received your letter of May 30th, and assure you that we are pleased to permit Mr. Webster making two inspections a year of weak teachers in the Indian Schools on the Six Nations Reserve. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Webster, in order that he may know that both you and we give approval to these second visits when necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Elementary Education\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: General educational matters on the Six Nations Reserve\n\nOn Thursday, May 25, accompanied by Indian Superintendent Randle, I spent two hours with Mr. J.C. Webster, Inspector of Schools for Brant County. Mr. Webster was appointed last year as a successor to Colonel Joyce and is now the Inspector for the schools on the Six Nations Reserve. Mr. Webster brought up the following points:\n\n1. Inspection of schools\n\nHe expressed a very decided opinion to the effect that two inspections a year instead of one would be very valuable in the case of the weaker teachers and also in the case of the new Indian teachers. He pointed out that one of the three new Indian teachers appointed last September should have done much better than she has and he feels would have done better if she had had some guidance early in the academic year. I advised Mr. Webster that I would recommend to you that permission be granted him to make two inspections a year of those Six Nations schools which he considers require same.\n\n2. Books\n\nAs usual with public school inspectors, he brought up the old question of books. I pointed out to him the number of inspectors that we are dealing with all over the country and that our experience shows that in the majority of cases every inspector suggests different books. He realized our position in the matter and, therefore, limited his argument to books supplied for reading. As a matter of fact we have already requested the Government Stationery Office to place in stock the series of books mentioned by Mr. Webster and it is our intention to supply these books to the Six Nations schools for the academic year 1944-45.\n\n3. Pupils attending high schools and collegiate institutes\n\nMr. Webster was very decided in his opinion that our present system of conducting Grade 9 in the reserve schools is not wholly satisfactory. He expressed the opinion that while the brighter pupils pass their entrance examination they should immediately be sent either to Brantford, Hagersville or Caledonia High School. He has received complaints that, while\nour Grade 9 teachers do their best, they have other grades in the same room and consequently are not able to devote as much time to the Grade 9 subjects as they should. As a result many of our pupils, when they have completed Grade 9 in our reserve schools, find it difficult to keep up with the work in Grade 10 when they attend one of the high schools or colleges just mentioned. Mr. Webster is prepared to recommend those pupils who he thinks should be sent directly to high school rather than take Grade 9 in our own schools. He further expressed the opinion that it was advisable to continue the Grade 9 in our own schools for those pupils who do not desire to proceed to high school or college, but at the same time whose parents may wish them to have an additional year's education following entrance examination. In carrying the Grade 9 course in this manner in our schools Mr. Webster suggested that he felt it would be practical to drop French and Latin and concentrate on other subjects that would be of practical use to the pupils in after life. I pointed out to Mr. Webster that while I agreed that there was considerable merit in his proposal, at the same time it presented considerable administrative difficulties, due to the fact that it may prove difficult to convince certain parents that only some pupils having passed their entrance are sent immediately to one of the white high schools or colleges, while others are retained in the reserve school. He had not realized this particular point and agreed that this was something that Departmental officials would have to consider carefully. I promised him that I would bring this to your attention and that we would later consult with Indian Superintendent Randle with a view to making a definite decision in the matter.\n\n4. Following the discussion on the above points we considered the possibilities for the coming academic year regarding teachers. From all accounts I do not feel there is much advantage in continuing the services of Mrs. Sandy. We found it necessary to dispense with her services some years ago and later we re-engaged her, but it is evident, both from her lack of interest in the programme on May 24 and the comments of Inspector Webster, that she has lost all interest in school work. There are one or two other teachers that we have in our Six Nations schools who are married women and who have only been teaching to oblige us. It is quite possible that they may leave on civil service duties at the end of June. This will probably mean that we will be looking for at least three teachers for the coming academic year and both Mr. Webster and Colonel Randle agreed that it was going to be a very difficult\nmatter to secure them. However, Superintendent Randle intends to interview immediately two or three Indian women on the reserve who were formerly teachers and whose household duties are such that would probably permit them to handle a school at least during the present crisis.\n\nInspector Webster is a comparatively young man and appears to be keenly interested in our schools and is also quite evidently anxious to assist both teachers and pupils as far as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: **Ontario Department of Education**\n\nAddress: **Toronto**\n\n---\n\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1944   |                                              |        |\n| Aug. 28 | To inspection of 110 classrooms @ $15.00 per classroom | $1,650.00 |\n\n---\n\n**Notes:** Arrangements have been made with the Ontario Department of Education, Toronto, to allow a fee of $15.00 for the inspection of each classroom in Indian day residential schools in the Province.

I have been doing work in the interest of our English Catholic Schools in Ontario.\n\nThere are three Indian Schools in Northern Ontario, in which English is used, but they are inspected by French Inspectors, apparently there has been some mistake. The one School is at Mississauga, three miles from Blind River, another one is at Garden Village, and the third is at French River (Dekis).\n\nI was talking to Dr. Greer, Director of Elementary Education and he advised me to write to you and recommend that these Schools be placed under an English Inspector. Apparently no one seems to know just how they happened to be placed under French Inspection. The last two Schools mentioned are closed and some think that they are closed because the French Inspectors have no contacts with English Teachers, which I can readily understand. Dr. Greer advised that on your recommendation to him, the Department would place these Schools under an English Inspector.\n\nI think that you will agree with me that in order to get the best possible results in our English Schools, we should have an English Inspector. I would appreciate anything that you can do on this matter for me. I would be glad to know how you feel about this and if there is anything further I should do, I would be glad to do. Thanking you and extending to you kindest personal regards, I remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nReverend V. Priester,\nExecutive-Director and Secretary,\nEnglish Catholic Education Association of Ontario.\nMay 16, 1945.\n\nDr. V. K. Greer, M.A.,\nSuperintendent of Elementary Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Greer,\n\nLast year I was asked to inspect the Indian school at Kettle Point. To date this request has not been made to me. If arrangements have not already been made for the inspection of this school, may I suggest that Mr. Galpin be asked to do this work. The school is a long way from Petrolia, whereas Mr. Galpin might be able to make the inspection when he is working out of Forest.\n\nI am not unwilling to do this work, but under the present conditions of tire and gasoline rationing I feel that it is a long trip for one inspection.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Public Schools.\nToronto 2,\nMay 18th, 1945\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nUnder date of May 16th, Mr. T. J. Thompson, Public School Inspector, at Petrolia, suggests that Mr. H. B. Galpin, Public School Inspector, at Sarnia, be asked to inspect the Indian School at Kettle Point this spring. It seems that Mr. Galpin can reach the school with less driving distance than Mr. Thompson. If you are agreeable to this change, will you kindly send the necessary letter to Mr. Galpin, and a copy of your letter to me and also a copy to Mr. Thompson.\n\nI send to you Mr. Thompson's letter herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Elementary Education\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 28, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Galpin:\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would arrange to inspect the Kettle Point Indian Day School. It is located approximately 7 miles from Forest, Ont., which place, I understand, is in your inspectorate.\n\nThis school has formerly been inspected by Mr. T. J. Thompson, Public School Inspector, Petrolia, but our understanding is that it would be more convenient for you to visit the school than to have Mr. Thompson continue to do so. The proposed change meets with the approval of Dr. V. K. Greer, Superintendent of Elementary Education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. H. B.

C. Webster, Brantford, Ontario, during the fall term, September - December, 1944, of classrooms of the Six Nations' Reservation where it was felt extra supervision would be helpful. Six classrooms were inspected, and under agreement with the Department of Indian Affairs, this Department is entitled to a grant of $15.00 per classroom. Accordingly, the amount due to the Department of Education for this extra inspection is $90.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Education\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1945 Sept. 20 | To Special Inspection of 6 classrooms in the Day Schools of the Six Nations Agency, during the period September to December, 1944 | $90.00 |\n\nNotes:\nUsually, we have only one inspection of each Indian day school during the academic year, but owing to the employment of new and untrained teachers, it was considered advisable to have extra supervision between September 1 and December 31, 1944. It was therefore arranged to have the Public School Inspector make a special inspection of six of the classrooms where this special supervision was necessary.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Matters, Chapleau, Ontario.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. V.K. Greer,\nSupt. of Elementary Education,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThis office would draw your attention to an anomaly in this Superintendency which it would be in the best interests to correct.\n\nWe refer to the New Credit school, which while situated in the County of Brant, is inspected by the School Inspector for the County of Haldimand. Schools Nos. 9 and 11 which are right on the borders of Haldimand County, have never been placed under the Haldimand Inspector, - so why the New Credit School was, is difficult to understand.\n\nAs the Department is aware, Inspector Webster often calls all our Six Nations Teachers to conferences, from which considerable benefit is derived, but naturally the teacher at New Credit is not included and becomes a somewhat lonely forgotten person, under remote control by the Haldimand Inspector.\n\nThe department will appreciate, as all our teachers are employees directed from this office by the Department, it would be better if they were all in one group, supervised by Inspector Webster.\n\nMay this matter receive your early consideration please.\n\nLt.-Col. E.F. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, November 2, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Greer:\n\nThe New Credit Indian Agency is adjacent to the Six Nations Indian Agency. In the New Credit Agency we have one day school which, although situated in the county of Brant, is inspected by the school inspector for the county of Haldimand.\n\nSchools Numbers 9 and 11 on the Six Nations Reserve, which are right on the border of Haldimand County, have never been placed under the Haldimand Inspector.\n\nBoth the Six Nations and the New Credit Agencies are under the same Indian Superintendent, namely Lt.-Col. E. P. Randle, Brantford, and Inspector Webster, who inspects all the schools on the Six Nations Reserve, has been extremely co-operative. We would appreciate it very much if the New Credit Agency could be transferred to Mr. Webster's inspectorate. As stated above, the New Credit School is actually in Brant County, and it would therefore appear it should have been placed in Brant County inspectorate previously. Your kind attention to this matter would be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. V. K.

E. DITCHBURN,\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER, VICTORIA, B. C.,\ndated September 27, 1927 - His No. 14779981.\n\nOriginal on 59335-1.\n\nHaving reference to the report of the Special Committee of the Senate in Parliament, dealing with the claims of the Allied Indian Tribes of British Columbia, in which it was recommended that the Government of Canada should spend $100,000.00 annually in excess of its regular estimates on Indian administration for:\n\n1 - Technical Education -\n\nI am submitting herewith my recommendations as to how this sum should be apportioned and giving my reasons therefor.\n\n---\n\n1. Technical Education - $20,000.00\n\nI am of the opinion that in the main the State should not be expected to go to any greater lengths in this regard for Indians, except possibly in a few special instances, than is the case with the education of white children. Technical education, so far as Indians are concerned, should not be considered anything more than a full course in manual training under competent instructors at all our residential schools, and as many of the Indian day schools as is practicable. There, however, may be a case crop up from time to time in which exceptionally well educated Indians might be assisted to take a course in some particular subjects. The main thing, to my mind, is to be assured that Indian boys, when they leave our residential schools, will have a practical training in order that they will be able to assist themselves after they have been discharged, and I believe that carpentry, joining and boat-building are the lines in which their efforts should be specially directed. The first requisite, therefore, in this connection would be to have a fully equipped manual training room at each of our residential schools where the boys who are properly instructed along the lines of work which would be most useful to them. For instance, there would be no practical purpose served in teaching a boy from an interior district how to build boats. Nevertheless, they should have a good knowledge of how to build houses, make furniture, etc. The boys from the coast districts should learn both. So far as the boys from the farming districts are concerned, their future is along the lines of agriculture, and it is important that they be given instruction by competent men on this particular study. It, of course, will take a few years to properly equip all of our schools.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR CAIRNS,\ndated November 9th and 10th, 1927, on\nthe Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 159-1-6.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nI wish to state that nineteen pupils are\nbeing taught in the Manual Training class. There\nare about eighty pupils in the Indian schools of\nBritish Columbia receiving Manual Training in-\nstruction.\nEXTRACT FROM REV. G. H. RALEY'S LETTER DATED NOVEMBER 5th, 1927, TO THE INSPECTOR OF UNITED CHURCH INDIAN SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS.\n\nBut my personal thought is that it may be within the range of possibility that a share of the $100,000.00 to be expended annually for the Indians of British Columbia might be to aid carrying on and developing technical and vocational training. This essential factor of Indian education has been stressed by workers amongst the Indians from year to year, and also by the chiefs and principal men of nearly all the tribes. The possibilities of development along this line are only limited to our resources and opportunities. No branch of education gives better ultimate results nor greater satisfaction to the native people.\nOctober 17, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT\n\nWith reference to that portion of Mr. Commissioner Pitchburn's letter of the 27th ultimo which is relative to technical education for the Indians of British Columbia, I have to suggest that the following be incorporated in a reply to him:\n\nWith reference to your recommendation that $20,000 of the special appropriation be available annually for technical education, I wish to state that I believe rapid improvement in our residential school work can be effected with this amount. I agree that different subjects should receive the emphasis at different educational centres - carpentry with emphasis on boat-building at one school, farming at another, etc. In farming communities, our schools already give a fair training in the subject and we should consider ways and means of improving this instruction.\n\nManual training has been undertaken with some success at the Coqualeetza, Kootenay and Alberni Residential Schools. At each of these institutions, the Department pays for the services of a special instructor and supplies tools and materials with which to work. There is also similar training instruction at the Nesolum Indian School. This system should be extended to other schools and I should like your opinion concerning the advisability of appointing a special organizer for this work. Such an officer could visit the various schools, determine what physical equipment is required, make the purchase and employ an instructor. On the other hand, such an appointment might not be necessary if we could get the principals and agents to enter whole-heartedly into the proposal. Perhaps a decision in connection with the appointment of such an officer could be better made after receiving recommendations from each school principal regarding the activity generally. I propose to circularize the schools with a view to learning just what trades would be most useful to the graduate boys and what additional equipment and services would be required to give an efficient training along these lines.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 19, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nWith reference to that part of your 147/9981 of September 27th, last, which recommends that $30,000 of the special appropriation for British Columbia Indians be available annually for technical education, I wish to state that I believe considerable improvement in our existing residential school activity can be effected with this amount. I agree that different subjects should receive the emphasis at different educational centres - carpentry with emphasis on boat-building at one school, farming at another, etc. In farming communities, our schools already give a fair training in the subject and we should consider ways and means of improving this instruction.\n\nManual training has been undertaken with some success at the Cowichan, Kootenay and Alberni Residential Schools. At each of these institutions, the Department pays for the services of a special instructor and supplies tools and materials with which to work. There is also similar training instruction at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. This activity should be extended to other schools and I should like your opinion concerning the advisability of appointing a special organizer for this work. Such an officer could visit the various schools, determine what physical equipment is required, make the purchase and employ an instructor. On the other hand, such an appointment might not be necessary if we could get the principals and agents to enter whole-heartedly into the proposal. Perhaps a decision in connection with the appointment of such an officer could be better made after receiving recommendations from each school principal regarding the activity generally.\n\nWould you write to the principals of residential schools and to the agents most interested, with a view to learning just what trades or training would be most useful to the graduate boys. Enquiry should be made concerning what additional equipment and instructional services would be required to give practical courses in the work suggested for each school. At the present time, you should focus your attention on the Kuper Island, Sechelt, St. Mary's, Kamloops, Cariboo and Fraser Lake Schools. At Lytton and at Alert Bay, consideration of this special programme will\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 566,\nVictoria, B. C.\nbe more timely after the new main buildings are occupied. When these are being furnished, a good supply of manual training and similar equipment will be allowed. You might also enquire into ways and means of utilizing the space provided for manual training in the new community hall on the Squamish Reserve. Mr. Agent Ferry will, no doubt, have given this some consideration. At a later date, the two residential schools on the west coast of Vancouver Island and the more efficient day schools should engage our attention, in order that technical education may be extended whenever there are reasonable prospects of permanent usefulness.\n\nI should be glad to have your interim report in this connection at the beginning of the coming fiscal year, so that early steps can be taken to utilize that portion of the special appropriation which is intended for technical education. If you believe that the older boys at Coqualeetsa, Kootenay and Alberni would benefit by a more intensive or varied course along technical and practical lines, you should correspond with the Rev. Principals and the Agents, if necessary, and let me have a recommendation in this connection, also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to vocational training at the proposed new Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I am very pleased to have this detailed recommendation, and I shall see that your representations are not overlooked when our programme for the future is being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nActing Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOctober 20, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of January 19th, last, concerning manual training at Indian schools in British Columbia. Possibly, there have been some developments since our conversation this summer; and, as the Department is very desirous of getting something definite under way without delay, I should be grateful if you would let me have at least an interim report at the present time.\n\nI should know within the next few weeks what schools are now ready for additional equipment, as funds are available for the purpose this fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nJanuary 11, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI wish to refer to my letters of January 19th, last, and October 20th, concerning manual training for Indian schools in British Columbia. Funds are available this fiscal year for the extension of this service, and it is the Department's wish that something be done without delay. Have you sufficient information from principals and agents to enable you to purchase at least $10,000 worth of tools, benches, etc.? If you know where this amount of equipment could be properly used, it would not be necessary to store it as it could be shipped immediately upon purchase. I should like to see manual training on a useful scale started without delay in those schools where such a course can be offered. It is understood that the salaries of the special instructors will be met by the Appropriation.\n\nYou might comment on sources of supply for manual training benches. I believe you could secure the tools in Vancouver as cheaply as we could secure them in the East, when one considers that they would have to be shipped in small lots. I should be grateful for an immediate reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner, B.

I am pleased to say, however, that Mr. Kay, the Provincial Government's instructor of manual training, has rendered me valuable assistance whenever it has been possible for him to do so, though, of course, you will understand that he also is a busy man and has to travel a great deal to various points in the Province. I also am pleased to say, as will be shown further on in this report, that it is very doubtful if $20,000.00 per annum, as suggested in my letter of the 27th September, will be required each year for technical education, though, of course, as time goes on equipment such as that used in blacksmith shops, machine shops, shoe repairing, etc. will be required. This report, however, deals only with manual training in wood work as it is considered that all pupils in Indian schools should have a fair training in this particular line.\n\nIn April last I wrote to the Principals of the Kuper Island, Sechelt, St. Mary's, Kamloops, Cariboo and Fraser Lake Schools asking them what position they were in to carry out instruction in manual training to their male pupils. In short the replies were as hereunder:\n\nKuper Island School------The Principal stated that while he had a fair supply of tools purchased by the Department in 1915, six of the eight benches supplied them had been taken away for use at the Nanaimo Day School Manual Training room, and others would have to be supplied. He also informed me that the services of a manual training instructor from Ladysmith could be obtained, if necessary, but some arrangement would have to be made with regard to transporting him to and from the School each week. It may be possible that an addition to the staff will be made of a competent carpenter.\n\nKamloops School----------Reverend John du Planil will be very pleased to have a start made in manual training. He has a building 33' x 34' suitable for the purpose and he can get the services of the manual training instructor of the public school, at Kamloops, to teach his pupils.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Mary's School, Mission----------Reverend Father Maillard was very pleased to hear about the new step being taken by the Department and he states he has a good room which can be utilized for manual training purposes. Instruction can be given either by a member of the staff or by the manual training teacher of the public school, at Mission.\n\nCariboo School---------------------Reverend Father Rohr advises me that he is very desirous of advancing the boys at his School along practical lines if supplied with proper equipment; but he regrets that it takes so much of the pupil's time in getting wood for fuel, and suggests if the Department would provide him with $2,500.00 per annum for fuel, he would be in a much better position to carry out our policy than he is at present.\n\nFraser Lake School-----------------Reverend Father Coccola, the Principal, states he has for some time endeavoured to give the pupils instruction along manual training lines and for this purpose he obtained some funds for the erection of a blacksmith shop and a carpenter shop, but the amount was not sufficient to complete the buildings and furnish them. To do this he said would take $1,200.00.\n\nYou will note further on in this report I am providing for the furnishing of tools and I will let you know in the course of a few days as to how much it will take to complete the carpenter shop.\n\nSechelt School---------------------Reverend Father McCaffrey's reply was not as satisfactory as I would have wished, as he was of the opinion that it would be a mistake to give Coast Indians any technical education as it might induce them to migrate to the more populous centres where they would have to compete with white labour. He is of the opinion, however, that a properly equipped plant for the repair and making of shoes for the pupils would serve a useful purpose. Father McCaffrey, however, is a new man in the Indian work and what I have seen of him leads me to conclude that he is most anxious to see practical. In view of the attitude of this School, I am of the opinion that no manual training equipment should be purchased as the phase of technical education at present being dealt with has reference to manual training only. Possibly next year the Principal may become possessed with a broader vision.\n\nSquamish, North Vancouver---------Full reports on the desirability of putting a manual training equipment in the second story of the new community building have already been furnished by Mr. Indian Agent Perry. The room for manual training purposes is 40' x 42', and a class of sixteen pupils is assured with probably more, as some of the boys who have completed their school terms also desire to take up instruction in manual training during their evenings. The services of an instructor, a Mr. Shockley, have been secured.\n\nAs regards equipment for manual training rooms, I have found that in the public schools this comprises one\n\nDrawing\nDrawing Set for each pupil, one individual set of Carpenters' Tools for each pupil and one General Set for the whole class. Quotations have been obtained from several hardware and stationery firms for the articles required which go to show that the cost of each Drawing Set will be approximately $8.73; $9.69 for each individual set of Tools and Bench Screw, and $124.59 for a general set of Tools which will include such accessories as screws, nails, glue, sand paper, stains, oils, etc., etc., etc. These prices will depend entirely upon the prevailing discounts allowed at time of purchase.\n\nAs regards benches I may say that some time ago Mr. Indian Agent Perry furnished me with a tender from the Shockley Planing Mills, of Vancouver, for sixteen single benches 2' x 3'6\" complete, the cost being $250.00. This works out at approximately $14.36 each. Mr. Kyle, however, is of the opinion that it would be much more preferable that the pupils should make their own benches and that they should be of the design shown on the blue print enclosed herewith. It will not in any event be possible to have ready-made benches supplied to schools in outlying districts and the only thing to do in this regard is to make a cash allowance of $12.00 for material for each bench, exclusive of the bench screw, which is included in the equipment of tools. So far as North Vancouver is concerned, however, possibly it would be just as well to get the benches made at the planing-mill, as the Agent is very anxious to get the manual training classes started.\n\nPlease also note that I have put down certain amounts for material for each school. This means lumber of various dimensions to be utilized by the students. A cash grant should be made for the first year, but thereafter each school should then apply to the Indian Agent for whatever material may be required.\n\nIn addition to the equipment for the above mentioned schools, I may say that Mr. Raley, Principal of the Coqualeetza School, at Sardis, wrote me some time ago asking for some further tools for the usual training room and blacksmith shop which he estimates will cost $50.00. These, therefore, are included in the list of equipment attached hereto which I would recommend should be purchased.\n\nYou will observe that I have included equipment for St. Georges School, at Lytton, and the new school at Alert Bay. This I have done in order to absorb as much of the $10,000.00 available as possible. The tools could be shipped to these Schools and stored until required to be put to use. At Lytton I understand the old school building is being torn down and the material is to be used for a carpenter shop, a blacksmith shop and a gymnasium in the second story. I have provided $1,000.00 being charged against the Special Vote to be expended on that portion of the building to be used for technical training, but this is only an estimate.\n\nIn establishing the manual training classes at the various schools, I would recommend that the Department supply each school with one or more copies of the book on manual training used in the Ontario and British Columbia Schools. This is published\nis published by the MacMillan Co., of Toronto, and the cost is .47\u00a2 per copy. Also one set of \"Job Sheets in Practical Wood Work\" (31 sheets). These are supplied by the Bruce Publishing Co., of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and sold at .55\u00a2 per set. They are used in the British Columbia schools and Mr. Kyle highly recommends their use. I have written to the Stanley Tool people of Montreal, for a number of copies of their book on \"How to Work with Tools and Wood\" which I believe they issue free to manual training instructors, and if I obtain the same, I will send one copy to each school which is being supplied with equipment.\n\nThe main thing is to get these schools supplied with the equipment for manual training and then to see that instruction is given along that line. In regard to instruction I may say that it will not be possible in all cases for the Department to make use of the services of instructors at the public schools. At schools in the outlying districts, the Department must be prepared to assist by way of cash grants to help pay the salary of a competent member of the school staff who is capable of properly instructing the pupils.\n\nI have endeavoured to work this scheme out on a practical basis and I trust that my report will prove satisfactory.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nIndividual School correspondence on -11 schools series\nFebruary 6, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to manual training at the Indian schools of British Columbia. I am very desirous of getting this activity extended without delay, and, as a preliminary step, I have to authorise you to purchase the materials listed on the enclosure you forwarded. The materials for work benches, the individual and general sets of tools and the drawing sets indicated should be supplied to Kamloops, Neskonlith, Kuper Island, Cariboo St. Mary's, St. George's, Alert Bay and Fraser Lake Schools. As the Squamish activity can be started immediately, work benches complete may be purchased. For Coqualeetza, you may supply $250 worth of equipment, as listed in your letter. The Department is already in correspondence with the Reverend Mr. Lett, concerning suitable workshops for St. George's. I rely upon you to purchase to the best advantage and to write to the Principals concerned, explaining the use to which this equipment will be put. You may also authorise each Principal to purchase lumber with which to work, as soon as the classes can be started. You may fix the amount to be expended on these materials from $50 to $100, as indicated in your letter, and you should direct principals to make requisition to the Indian agent for further materials, when required. If you find that any expenditure is necessary to complete the carpenter shop at Fraser Lake, you should let the Department have an estimate.\n\nI have written a special letter to Father Rohr, of the Cariboo School, pointing out that the boys must not be overworked in connection with the supply of fuel, and I am satisfied that vocational training can be started at this institution, also. The pupilage is being increased to assist with current financing, and I have clearly indicated that the extra grant is for the engaging of labour for the supply of fuel.\n\nThe question of organising this work and the appointment or securing of suitable instructors should now engage our attention. If we could secure the\n\nW. R. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria,\nB. C.\n\n-temporary\ntemporary services of a good practical man to visit each school and see that the activity was properly commenced, it might be a good investment. The duties of such a man would be to make recommendations regarding building and equipment for vocational training at each school; to assist in recruiting the local instructors and to get the classes started. At some schools, it would be necessary to add a man to the staff and at others, to make arrangements for the holding of classes by public school instructors.\n\nThe Department will secure copies of the manuals and job sheets Mr. Kyle has recommended, and these will be sent to the various schools. If the Department is able to secure the services of a special officer to organize this work, I should expect you to supervise his activity. The organization might take from one to two years, and, at that time, experience would have shown whether it would be necessary to continue the position. If you are able to secure applicants for this organization work, please let me know when I am with you a few weeks from now.\n\nAt a later date, after courses in carpentry are well under way, the Department must consider the advisability of extending the work along other lines.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nPrior to this letter, this activity at Coqualeetza, Alberni, Kootenay, & Nanaimo Bay, was under way & I no special action.\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor: School Branch\n\nSchool on:\n\nReserve in:\n\nAgency:\n\nDate: Feb 27, 19...\n\n| ARTICLES                        | NO.

E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nManual Training to Be Instituted In Indian Schools In Province By Federal Department\n\nThis is the handsome Indian school erected at Kamloops. It is one of the several schools under the direction of the Federal Department of Indian Affairs to which manual training is to be added to the curriculum in cooperation with other schools of the Province.\n\nManual training is to be instituted in order of pupils of ten years of age forming them that it is expected that Qualicum School at Chilliwack, and the Indian residential schools will be fitted up with carpenter shops. The pupil will receive instructions for two or possibly three days a week, but where there are sufficient pupils to make a class, one individual set of carpenters will be employed for each pupil, and one general set for the whole class. Besides this, a liberal supply of materials and tools will be supplied. In cases where equipment has been purchased for the various schools, it will be possible to give instruction to sixteen pupils in one day, and so forth.\n\nThere is accommodation for the following number of pupils: Qualicum eight, Fraser Lake eight, Lytton ten, North Vancouver, Mission eight, Williams Lake twenty-two.\n\nAfter the courses in carpentry are well advanced, the system will be extended to include other forms of manual training according to the general educational requirements of the various sections of the Province.\n\nINDIANS THE ADEPT\n\nThe Indians are adepts at woodwork, and it is thought that by teaching them how to make up various articles along mechanical lines they may stimulate their interest in their school work, but when the time comes for them to leave the schools, they will have a first-class knowledge of not only the various tools used in manufacture everything in woodwork used in daily life, thus opening the possibility of their being able to earn a livelihood in the future.\n\nMr. Ditchburn has written to the various principals of the schools in...\nDUPLICATE\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\u2014SPECIAL VOTE.\n\nVoucher No. 215-A.\n\nFiscal Year\n1928-29.\n\nVote No.\n\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nIndian Commissioner's Office for\nCowichan, Kamloops, Kwawkewlth, Lytton, RENEGADE minister,\nStuart Lake, Vancouver and Williams Lake Agencies.\n\nTo\nMessrs.

The manual training texts and job sheets are being directed to the twelve schools mentioned in your letter. The Department would have sent these out earlier, but it was considered advisable to send a letter to each school and it would have been better if I had known more regarding the arrangements that have been made for the actual instruction. A letter is going to each school, mentioning the text and job sheets and the supplying of equipment and other earlier arrangements that have been made through your office. Each school has been requested to report concerning the arrangements that have been made for an instructor. This report can be quite separate to any correspondence that you have had with the various principals.\n\nYou might write if you have considered the question of an organizer for this work since Dr. Scott's visit. You might see his letter of February 6th in this connection. The Department would also be grateful for a report regarding any arrangements you have authorized in connection with the engagement of instructors at the various schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

In the past we have equipped hundreds of Indians with outfits of tools and fitted them up as carpenters and not one per cent of them are working at their trade on the reserve, and I do not know that the boy who has had manual training is any better fitted to go out on the farm and make a living than the fellow who has not. The general training that a boy receives at the school fits him for handling machinery and doing any repair work that might have to be done around the farm, and I think our efforts should be along the lines of agriculture, and agriculture only.\n\nWe found this out long ago. At one time at the Qu'Appelle School we had a carpenter shop, tin shop, shoe shop, and so on, and the boys received a thorough training in these lines of work, but this has all been done away with and I do not think we should start it up again. I am stressing this point, because I would hate to see any expenditure on this particular line of work, as I know we have not obtained results from it in the past.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have examined the various files relating to manual training activity at British Columbia schools and have found it advisable to write to the Principals of the following Institutions, asking for reports as to the progress of the work:-\n\nSt. Mary's\nKuper Island\nKamloops\nCariboo\nFraser Lake\nAlberni\nChristie.\n\nAt other schools the work is well in hand.\n\nApproximately $9,500 will be expended from the Special Grant, B.C., this year, for the purpose.

I note that you are circulating the principals in this connection. Of course, you will have the support of the Department, as I believe training in these arts is very important for the older girls.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nForeword\n\nWHILE we are assured that the Department of Indian Affairs desire that the Residential Schools shall be centres of cultural education, we are also aware that they are most anxious that we should stress technical training. Hence, though we are not slackening our efforts in the classroom, as witness the fact that we have this year the largest number of pupils trying the entrance examinations, and have been successful in getting the Department of Education of the province to establish an examination centre at the school, yet we are concentrating strongly on technical training and vocational guidance.\n\nWe consider the most important step we have taken in that direction this year is the establishment of a Department for instruction in the internal-combustion engine, called Auto-Mechanics.\n\nWe feel this course will vitally affect the industrial advancement of the native people of British Columbia, inasmuch as boys taking two years in it should be capable of handling all general repairs to the engines of power boats. These boats, which have everywhere replaced the beautiful and graceful canoe of thirty years ago, are the mainstay of the fishing industry, whose products are sold in the future a large number of the boys\u2014will earn a livelihood. At present if anything goes wrong with an engine, delay and great expense is necessary, as the engine has to be sent to some distant city for repairs, which often means the loss of a season's work and consequent hardship. If the boys are trained to do the repair work all this will be avoided.\n\nIn the matter of vocational guidance for the Indian girls and boys a very interesting movement is now afoot for the appointment of a Vocational Supervisor, with headquarters in Vancouver who can assist the graduates from residential schools to obtain positions for which their particular training and natural talents fit them. It is also suggested that a residence should be established in Vancouver, which would serve not only as a home, but as a social centre, for native young people who are either employed or are pursuing post-graduate study in the city. The need of this \"follow-up\" work has long been felt, and it is hoped that this step may soon be accomplished.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\n\"Cougaleetza,\"\nSardis, B.

Notice the photograph below, examine the character and quality of the bench as shown within, read the list of some of our customers. Sheldon benches serve better\u2014last longer\u2014they are the true measure of economy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. H. SHELDON & COMPANY.\nSheldon Benches Serve Better\u2014Last Longer!\n\nBecause of their Unusual Construction\n\nA bench used by amateur workmen must be practically fool-proof. It must be built to endure for years against the constant pounding, straining and straining and other unanticipated abuse as only the most careless student can lay upon it. Every detail of its construction, involving material, workmanship, design, and equipment, must be calculated to exceed the constructive capacity of the most careless student.\n\nAn almost fourteen-year experience, now completed in a limited period devoted to the manufacture of benches for thousands of schools, has been condensed into the following Sheldon bench construction graphically portrayed in the phantom view shown above. The partial list of cities where Sheldon benches are installed on this page attests to the satisfaction that Sheldon benches are giving in the school field.\n\nA Serviceable Top\n\nA serviceable top is the first essential of a good bench. Sheldon bench tops consist of 1\u00bd inches solid wood which deflects under heavy pressure without edge-grain surface. The finished thickness is 2\u00bc inches or over. Two 5-inch flushhead screws hold the panels firmly in place, and the vertical edges of the top. Heavy holsters are attached to both ends by dovetail joints, heavy joints reinforced by heavy countersunk 5-inch screws. A deep tool recess is built into the top as illustrated, and a tool rack is attached.\n\nE. H.

At that time complaints began to come in to the effect that, after six or seven years of service, the tables no longer gave satisfaction. A careful investigation was made and we became convinced that the light construction was not satisfactory for school use. Drawing tables are higher than work benches or laboratory tables, pupils lean against them, creating a tremendous transverse and longitudinal strain, doors and drawers are jerked open and slammed shut, changes in temperature affect them, and ordinary construction will not stand the strain.\n\nPresent Sheldon Drawing Table Construction\n\nAs the result of the above experience our present drawing table construction was developed. To show this new construction clearly we turned a table upside down and photographed it for you. One and one-fourth inch panels and stiles are used throughout, and all joints are mortised and tenoned, glued under high pressure and cross-tie-bolted as shown. This construction, which increases the weight of our drawing tables twenty per cent, entirely eliminates the weaknesses found in the tables incorporating light construction. They will give years and years of service long after tables of ordinary construction have been discarded. The initial cost may be a little more; the final cost will be a great deal less. We build over a dozen different types of drawing tables to accommodate from one to eight classes. Literature will be sent free for the asking.\n\nE. H. SHELDON AND COMPANY\nLaboratory, Home Economics and Vocational Furniture for Schools\nMuskegon, Michigan\nFebruary 19, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 403-11 of the 13th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hurison's report on the St. Albert and Edmonton Indian Residential Schools. This is being given attention by the proper officers. I note your remarks regarding milking at our institutions. I cannot agree that girls should do the milking as regular practice. I believe they should be trained to milk and that such training should be once a week during the summer time, under proper supervision. I understand that only three or four lessons with practice teach one how to milk, and if the older girls have weekly instruction for three or four months each year, they should be properly equipped in this respect for life on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., February 25, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\u2014\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant No. 110-1-1, and I note your remark regarding the girls milking cows at our schools, and that you cannot agree that the girls should do the milking as a regular practice, but that you believe they should be trained to milk and that such training should be once a week during the summer time.\n\nIn my opinion, such a practice would result in very little benefit to the girls and would most certainly be detrimental to the cows, as the cows would not continue to yield a satisfactory supply of milk if milked by a different person each day. I think it would be much more satisfactory to have each girl milk a certain cow every day during the summer months. This would give the girls a thorough training in this important branch of farm work and would be of great advantage to them in later life.\n\nIt is also necessary for them to know how to look after the milk and cream and to make butter. It may surprise you to know that about 80% of the girls after eight or ten years' training do not milk, simply because they have not been taught to do so at school. They do not realize the value of it and consequently they do not enjoy the benefits they might enjoy if they always had plenty of milk and butter for their families.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 18, 1931.\n\nTo Principals of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nThe Department desires, at this time, to emphasize the value of vocational training at Indian residential schools. In practically all our institutions, we find that the academic work receives proper emphasis. In the vocational departments, the danger is that, in the rush to complete the routine work, the instructional function will not receive sufficient prominence.\n\nThe instructors in the various departments, both domestic and outdoor, should be selected with as much care as your classroom teachers. They should be impressed with the fact that their most important function is instructing. For example, in the kitchen, occasionally, the girls assigned to that department should look upon their tour of duty as practice training for their future life and, among other activities, they should bake in the kitchen range a small batch of bread. Similarly, in the laundry, from time to time, a small washing should be put through entirely by hand, with the instruction side of the work receiving all the emphasis.\n\nOn Indian reserves, much of the gardening falls to the lot of the women, and this suggests that the teen-age girls in your school should be given training in this interesting outdoor subject. It is also true that, where cows are owned at Indian homes, the milking is nearly always done by the women. At Indian residential schools, summer milking should be done by the girls, under proper supervision. It might be advisable to have a special milking yard for the period and each girl who is receiving instruction should milk the same cow for one month continuously. Of course, the girls should be trained in the art of butter-making.\n\nIndian boys who will go home to farming communities should receive a thorough training in farming, gardening and the care of stock. Those boys who will spend much of their time in boats upon graduation should have a full course in boat making and repairing and in gasoline engines. At all Indian residential schools, the boys should receive some instruction in carpentering - those showing particular ability being given a complete training as carpenters.\n\nPrincipals, teachers and instructors should keep ever in mind the fact that the school is to prepare pupils for the future. Much of the expenditure on Indian education will be wasted if there is not a direct correlation between everyday exercises and duties and home life on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nAttention R.T.Ferrier, Esq.-\nRe Letter No.1-1-11.\n19th March, 1931.\n\nWinnipeg, 24th March, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter number and date as noted above.\n\nI have put this letter on a card, and it is placed where it can be picked up and commented on readily so that the subject can be worked out by continuous attention and comment.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJno.

Institutions.\n\nWhile the Vancouver school system has an excellent display on the ground floor of the School Building, there is an equally interesting display on the second floor by the Indian schools of the province.\n\nWith the exception of the display in Vancouver Technical School, the exhibit of the Indian schools of British Columbia is as praiseworthy as that of any school in the province. The equipment or expert teachers of city schools are not needed to make fine buildings, the Indian schools have done their part in the display.\n\nManual training, domestic science and art and handicraft work of the primitive elements of the population of British Columbia is not much superior to that of the Indians at the Indian schools. These institutions are doing a commendable work with the times, and their display is matched by many complimentary comments from the public.\n\nAmong the schools showing are Alert Bay, Squamish, Sechelt, Alberni, Oceanside, Port Alberni, Ucluelet, Spuzzum and Sechelt Indian schools. Indian baskets on sale.\n\nHow to Buy and Cook\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 29, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nThe enclosed cutting was taken from the Vancouver Daily Province of yesterday's date and may be of interest to you.\n\nI circularised the agents and others regarding the Exhibition and the response was quite good.\n\nCoqualeetza has usually carried off first prize, but this year Sechelt will probably be successful. I have nothing whatever to do with the judging which is left to the exhibition authorities to handle and do not know who act as judges. The Okanagan exhibited some work this year for the first time, due to the keen interest of the teacher, Anthony Walsh, but of course being a small day school, can not compete against the larger residential schools. Next year I will have the school exhibits in two divisions, Day and Residential, so as to encourage more of the day school exhibits.\n\nConsiderable work such as totems, basketry, etc., was sold to the public and good prices obtained for the Indians as a reward for their industry. The exhibition exhibitors gave us four times the space this year than has been allowed in the past and the Indian section was well patronised. One of the Squamish chiefs exhibited at the entrance a twenty-five foot totem made by himself and also lectured several times a day on totem lore but most of this was imagination and nonsense and the effect was spoiled by his continual plea for money.\n\nThe Exhibition has been a great success especially as far as our section was concerned, this being due to the committee of three, Mr. Macdonald, the general manager, Mrs. De Brilay, a keen student and collector of Indian works, and my own who has had the task of receiving, unpacking and displaying all the exhibits and is responsible for their safe return to the exhibitors.\n\nB/HM.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball].\n\nRussell T.

The average size of one instructor shop such as outlined in this bulletin, will take care of 15 or more boys each period. With additional equipment a larger number of boys can be taught by one instructor.\n\nThe most desirable location for a General Shop is on the ground floor where automobiles, trucks, tractors, etc., may be driven in, so that they may be worked on by the boys in the motor mechanics unit. Plenty of light and good ventilation are valuable features. However, the ideal room is not always available and many shops are doing excellent work in rooms not originally intended for shop work.\n\nIf a school already equipped with a manual training or woodworking department the General Shop may be built up by adding the various units to that department. If there is no available room in the present school building it is advisable to erect a separate shop building. Some schools have built their own shops at a very small cost as a project in carpentry and building trades. See page 24.\n\nThe principal machine equipment of the General Shop consists of a back geared screw cutting lathe, a bench drill press, bench grinder and a forge. These machines, as well as a number of small tools and other shop equipment are used in common by all units of the General Shop, as the occasion may require. The average life of this equipment is about 25 years.\n\nIn planning a General Shop for the small school we have studied many of the leading manuals and consulted with many foremost educators in the subject. In addition, we have drawn on our experience of 25 years in our own manufacturing plant where we have trained more than 2,000 apprentices. The machines and tools in the shop equipment have been selected to meet the requirements of the boys in General Shop work from the 7th to the 12th grades.\n\nOutline of a General Shop Course\n\nFor One Instructor\u201415 or more Pupils at One Time\n\nThe General Shop course outlined briefly below includes six important subjects that are widely used for instruction in shop work in the 7th to 12th grades. This shop is of a suggestive nature, and may be varied to suit local conditions.

WARNER\nOhio State University, Columbus\n\nShop teachers and public school officials are usually on the alert for new ideas and improved ways of equipping and teaching industrial arts work. The problem is unusually important and difficult for the small school and for the rural consolidated school.\n\nAfter considerable study of the problem Dr. Warner has made a short report in connection with an extensive exhibit of such work at the Ohio State Fair in 1929.\n\nThe equipment described above provides provisions for a planning or drawing center for two pupils. Either cabinets or pedestal type tables may be used. Also included is a two or more speed wood-turning lathe, two double four-vise table-type woodworking benches, a portable hand drawing board, a small 6\" to 8\" motor-in-head circular saw, a 16\" to 20\" band saw, a good 6\" to 8\" jointer, a hand or motor planer, a drill press (portable), a 13\" x 5' back-geared screw-cutting metal-working lathe, a portable automatic forge, including a rebuilt Ford or other engine that will drive a forge, bench, a sheet metal or soldering bench, an electrical area, and equipment for experimental and assembly work, lumber storage, blackboards, bulletin boards, a supply closet, and magazine racks.\n\nThe arrangement is not only convenient and interesting but efficiently planned as well. How many shop teachers would not be eager to get into such a laboratory? It may be termed a Laboratory of Industries, where individual pupils have opportunity for exploration and try-out. All of it can be housed in a room no larger than 35' x 70', which will cost less than two thousand dollars. Not all of the units need be developed at once, but those of the operation most in play afford for doing a better and more varied type of shop work.\n\nBlueprint Plans\n\nIn the past ten years the French Bend Lathe Works has made plans drawings shops of hundreds of schools all over the world. These shops range in size from the small shop having a single lathe to the large shops having twenty or more lathes of various sizes and types. There are also many different kinds of shops, including Metal Molding Shops, Metal Shops, Various Industry Shops, General Shops, etc. Various types of drives are also shown, including different arrangements for both overhead shaft and individual motor-driven machines.\n\nWe will gladly furnish any superintendent, principal, supervisor, teacher, or anyone with blue prints. Write us telling the kind of a shop you are interested in and it is probable that we can send you something similar to what have been installed by other schools having similar requirements. These blue prints are sent postpaid charge and there is no obligation whatever as we consider this a part of our service in the interest of vocational education.\n\nEquipment for Other Shops\n\nThe floor plan illustrated above is reproduced from a page in a bulletin, \"The General Shop,\" by MARIS M. PROFFITT, Specialist in Industrial Education, Office of Education, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. Any shop planning a General Shop for its rural school should read for this bulletin, as it contains valuable information and many helpful suggestions for the planning of a General Shop and the teaching of the various subjects. This bulletin is for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C., at 5 cents a copy.\n\nThe entire equipment for the above shop may be installed for less than $2,000.00. It consists of a forge and anvil, a sheet metal bench, a drill press, a power wood working bench, two double four-vise table-type woodworking lathes, a machinist's bench, a carpenter's bench, an electrical bench, an automotive bench, a small tool room and lockers. Much of the equipment, including the benches, lockers, tool room and engine shop may be made up in the shop as projects for the woodworking department, thereby reducing the cost of the installation to a minimum.\n\nThe size of the room is 35 by 70 feet, or a little less than 2,500 square feet of floor space. The shop will accommodate at least 20 boys per period, and there is plenty of room in the center of the floor for carpentry projects and repair classes. One instructor can take care of this entire shop.\n\nIt will be noticed that Mr. Proffitt shows two metalworking lathes for this shop. This permits more comprehensive general shop work. It is considered better to install one small and one larger lathe, perhaps a 9 inch lathe and a 15 inch lathe. This permits taking care of a wide variety of work.\n\nEquipment for a Comprehensive General Shop\n\nSome of the larger schools have installed equipment for a comprehensive general shop. This equipment is similar to that shown in the above floor plan except that additional facilities are installed to take care of a larger number of boys in each unit. There may also be a larger number of units in the comprehensive General Shop than in the small General Shop. The cost of the equipment for a comprehensive General Shop will run from $4,000.00 to $6,000.00. We have on file suggestive lists of equipment, floor plans, etc., and will be glad to assist anyone in planning a comprehensive General Shop.\nSeparate Building for General Shop\n\nMany schools, in considering the installation of a General Shop, postpone action because there is no suitable room available in the school building. The illustrations show how one of many schools solved this problem.\n\nOn a corner of the school grounds a frame shop building about 25 feet by 40 feet was erected. The construction of this building is such that the cost was low but the improved conditions have been preferable.\n\nThe building is designed for ideal shop conditions, having large windows along both sides, affording excellent lighting for the entire shop. A large double door in one end permits easy access and mobility into the shop for use in the instruction of auto mechanics. Steam pipes running underground from the main school building supply heat. The floor is of concrete.\n\nSome schools are fortunate enough to have an old shop building attached to an old building that can be used for shop work. Sometimes temporary school buildings, erected for use while the main school building is being built or repaired, are remodeled for shop use. Another plan is to rent a nearby building for a temporary shop.\n\nIn some schools a separate shop building has been erected as a project for the advanced classes in woodworking and building trades. The construction of a shop building is a good project as it may include experience in concrete work, plastering, electrical wiring, painting and plumbing, as well as woodworking.\n\nShop Building at Meriden, Kansas\n\nThe illustration below shows a typical example of a separate building for shop work.\n\nSchool Shop Building at Meriden, Kansas\n\nEquipment for Small Machine Shop\n\nLineshaft and Countershaft Drive\n\nThe above illustrations showing the arrangement of equipment for a small machine shop are taken from a booklet entitled \"How to Run a Lathe.\" This equipment is for larger and heavier work than is usually done in the small machine shop. The machines are driven by the countershaft drive type and are driven from an overhead lineshaft, the lineshaft being driven from a motor attached to the side wall.\n\nThe countershaft drive can be used in the General Shop instead of individual motor drive, but when the size of the motor, lineshaft, hangers, pulleys, belting and the extra labor of installing are considered, it is doubtful whether there would be any saving. However, if the shop already has several countershaft driven machines which are to be replaced, it would be advisable to retain that type of drive.\n\nThe individual motor drive equipment as shown on pages 10, 11, 12 and 14 is considered more modern and is much easier to install, as it affords a more flexible arrangement of the machines than the countershaft drive. The modern tendency in small shops is to install the individual motor driven type of machine.\nViews of Typical School Machine Shops\n\nIn the illustrations below we have one of each of the six major classes of machine shops ranging from the Junior High school shop to the college engineering shop. We have equipped over 250 of these shops with machinery and tools during the past year. Our Engineering Department assisted in making up the plans and specifications for many of these shops. The benefit of our experience is available to any school contemplating the installation of any type of shop, including the small General Shop. We make no charge for the plans of this nature as we consider it a part of our service in the interest of vocational education.\n\nTHE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL SHOP\nA number of students using Bench Lathes in a Junior High School Shop\u2014their first experience in actual Machine Shop Practice.\n\nTHE TRADE SCHOOL SHOP\nThe illustration above is a common scene in the Trade School Shop where students are being trained in correct Machine Shop Practice.\n\nTHE VOCATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SHOP\nThe illustration above shows a Vocational High School Shop where part time students are learning the fundamentals of the Machinist Trade.\n\nTHE NIGHT SCHOOL SHOP\nThe Night School Shop is popular with the Industrial worker who wishes to enable him to improve himself in his spare time.\n\nTHE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL SHOP\nThe Illustration above shows a number of advanced students working in a Senior High School Shop doing Machine Work.\n\nTHE COLLEGE ENGINEERING SHOP\nThe Machine Shop Department at Engineering School is shown above. The Lathe plays an important part in the development of the young Engineer.\n\nNotes On the General Shop\n\nOrganizing the Shop. The General Shop should be the first shop built in any school. It should be located in a well lighted place in the building, preferably with an outside door. The shop should be thought out thoroughly as given in this bulletin as they represent the most popular industrial activities throughout the entire state. A fundamental training in these subjects is of importance to every boy.\n\nEngineering Advice. If you are in doubt about the plan or lay out of your General Shop, method of placing the benches, machines, etc., write to us. Give us a rough sketch of the location of the shop and you will receive a plan showing location of windows, doors, ceiling height, and general dimensions. Our Engineering Department will submit suggestions and provide you with a blue print layout to meet the conditions and requirements of your shop.\n\nBlueprint Plans of Other Shops. We have equipped hundreds of shops throughout the United States and have prepared blue prints of these shops. Many of the original drawings are on file in our office and blue prints will gladly be made available to any interested person whose instructor is interested.\n\nCourse of Study. The best method to follow in teaching the General Shop is the project method using job sheets and blue prints for each project made or handled in the shop. If you are not yet getting started in a course of study, write to us as we have abundant information and are able to which we shall be glad to supply on request.\n\nJob Sheets and Blue Prints. We have job sheets and blue prints ready made and are preparing job sheets and blue prints for the course in woodworking, forgings, castings and other activities of the General Shop. Details regarding these job sheets and blue prints will be sent to anyone interested in the General Shop.\n\nReference Books. Suitable reference books on the General Shop are described in this bulletin. In addition there is a book on Auto Mechanics. This book will be a valuable reference in the auto mechanics course in the General Shop. A copy will be sent free of charge to anyone interested.\n\nMaking Wood Benches. Drawings and construction plans for benches of various types suitable for the General Shop are on file in our office. As we make our own benches because of the saving in expense, we shall be glad to supply blue prints of these workbenches without charge to anyone who is planning the installation of a General Shop.\n\nExtending General Shop Activities. The General Shop will be found to be one of the most popular courses among the students in the entire school program. It offers practical, interesting training. As the number of students increases, the capacity of the shop can be enlarged by purchasing new equipment each year. To those who have already started General Shop work and are interested in extending their activities we have also sent plans and more comprehensive training materials, details of which we shall be glad to supply on request.\n\nPrinting in the General Shop. The fundamentals of the printing trade are also taught in some General Shops. Printing is a trade which has been in the United States hence offers a good field for properly trained personnel. The press, type case and an assortment of type make up the proper equipment for the printing unit of the General Shop. One of the best texts of the printing trade used in school shops is \"The Practice of Printing\" by Ralph W. Polk. Price per copy $1.50.\n\nFarm Mechanics. The constantly increasing use of machinery in agriculture makes training in the fundamentals of mechanics essential for every boy attending consolidated schools located in rural districts. A course in Farm Mechanics is offered to pupils in the General Shop. This will be added to the General Shop Course outlined in this bulletin and include instruction in the following subjects: farm electricity, mechanical drawing, farm buildings, concrete work, etc. We are preparing a course covering the Farm Mechanics course and will mail a copy on request to anyone interested.\n\nPurchasing Equipment. In this bulletin we have listed all the machine equipment, essential tools and accessories and reference books to make up the General Shop complete in every detail. All of these materials are in stock and ready for ordering the prices given in the bulletin, or may be purchased separately. Some of these tools may be ordered from your local hardware store if desired. We do not manufacture these items ourselves but list them for accommodation to our customers. Any item you already have in your shop or may purchase yourself may be omitted from the list.\n\nQuotations Supplied. Itemized quotations will be supplied on all material described in this book and any additional supplies approved by you will be supplied upon request. The Educational Department of The South Bend Manufacturing Company sincerely invites you to serve to schools all over the world and will welcome inquiries from anyone who may be interested.\nThe South Bend Lathe Works\n\nThe South Bend Lathe Works was established at South Bend, Indiana, in 1906. For 25 years the entire plant has been devoted exclusively to the manufacture of South Bend Back-Gear Screw-Cutting Lathes. There are now 50,000 South Bend Lathes in use in the United States and in other countries.\n\nAbout 90% of the South Bend Lathes manufactured are used in industry for the manufacturing of all kinds of metal products, for the making of the finest precision machines, tools, dies, etc., and for maintenance and repair work in general. We feel that we have supplied about 80% of the lathes that have been purchased for use in school shops in the last 13 years by vocational schools, colleges, engineering schools and trade schools throughout the United States.\n\nThe 9\" Back-Gear Screw-Cutting Lathe illustrated in this bulletin was selected for the equipment of a small General Shop because it is so widely used in industrial plants manufacturing the working of all kinds of metals. On this lathe the student can quickly learn the fundamentals of the operation of a screw-cutting engine lathe which are the foundation of the machinists' trade.\n\nSouth Bend Lathe Catalog No. 91-A\n\nThis new 104 page Catalog, No. 91-A, illustrates, describes and prices the entire line of South Bend's New Model South Bend Back-Gear Screw-Cutting Lathes, from 6\" swing to 18\" swing, complete with motor stand. Each size of lathe is fully described with its features and specifications. A full line of attachments, tools and accessories is also shown.\n\nThis catalog is 6\"x9\", it has 100 illustrations and is a valuable book of considerable value to anyone interested in mechanical equipment. Mailed anywhere in the world upon request, postpaid, no charge.\n\nSOUTH BEND LATHE WORKS\n428 EAST MADISON STREET, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, U.S.A.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada\n\nSeptember 17, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nYour letter of September 9 has been received and although you do not at present feel the need of mechanical instruction in the various Indian Schools of Canada, we should like to call your attention to the enclosed Bulletin No. 50.\n\nThis book takes up a practical course of six units that can be taken care of in a very small class room with but a small installation of equipment.\n\nThe instruction units were selected because they are the most important followed in practically every community in the world. Your Indian communities are possibly engaged in some of these trades at the present time and any instruction that can be given to the younger boys will naturally bear fruit.\n\nIf it is agreeable with you, Mr. Ferrier, we should like to supply the various superintendents and shop men of your Indian Schools with copies of this No. 50 Bulletin. Will you please give us a list of their names and addresses?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSOUTH BEND LATHE WORKS\n\nF. B.

Ferrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJune 17th, 1932.\n\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nA gentleman in the United States has been corresponding with me concerning the Goodwill Industry idea. I am taking the liberty of giving to you a quotation from his letter received here of June 10th, 1932.\n\n\"I do not know your Indian Schools, their location, their curriculum nor methods of maintenance. On this depends just what could be done. Missions are learning to take whatever material is at hand and without expensive equipment make saleable articles from the very beginning.\n\nI taught one season in the South and aside from the construction of doors, sash, etc., for our own work, we made cedar chests. These chests cost something like $3.00 and it took a fair sized boy to make one in an evening which brought $10. This was lower than the stores, brought ready sale, and some ten boys earned their way.\n\nI do not think there is cedar up your way but there probably is black walnut at a reasonable price and other hard woods that would make up into fine occasional tables, jardinere stands, bon bon stands, screens etc., which pack in small space for transportation.\n\nOne thing I feel most sure of is leather and fur work. If there are deer and other skins they can be tanned very simply by any boy into valuable rugs and the fur to neck pieces. Bichromate of potash and hydrochloric acid make good serviceable chrome leather in a few hours. Then any old boy with a jack knife can cut fringe, thong and lace a cushion in half an hour which will bring $5.00 and cost a few cents.\n\nAnd if you have art students in the school a whole world of dying, enameling, carving, turning, stamping, sketching, carding, graining and fluffing, can be done all by hand and double the value. There are hundreds of saleable articles from the leather coat down to moccasins, all easy to make and ready sale at a good price.\n\nNo need to mention the many toilet articles and cases made from the cuttings and even the scrap can be ground up into artificial leather. There is very little duty on leather goods to this country or on furs providing the furs are not completely finished, but Eatons or the Missionary Societies of the Dominion could probably absorb the output for quite while.\"\nThere may be even better material at hand and thus\neither put in the school quite a number of new boys or\npay for boys already in. One thing is sure. No matter\nwhere the school or by much industry if not practical,\nthat is if they cannot earn their way with it, it is\na failure. The reason industrial and agricultural work\nhas been so costly and disappointing is because they\nare taught to do things with Western appliances and\nmethods that they as individuals cannot duplicate and\nfor that reason never earn their way or become independ-\nent. In my teaching, mechanics, have never used a text\nbook. We go to work on whatever we have, my bench in\nthe centre and when finished and sold, the boys get the\nprofit. Technical questions are explained as they arise\nin the work and have built entire houses that way. Manu-\nfacturing in the school work will lift the depression in\na dozen or more cases and as soon as everybody gets\npractical the depression is gone from the Dominion.\"\n\nI think these suggestions may be of interest to you\nin connection with the future of the Indian work, and if at\nany time you feel like taking the matter up by direct cor-\nrespondence, I am appending his name and address:\n\nMr. Lewis A. Werrick,\n1725 Green Street,\nHarrisburg, P.A.,\nU.S.A.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 22, 1932.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with an extract from a letter of Mr. Lewis A. Nemrick, of Harrisburg, Pa., concerning industries which might be profitable at Indian schools. The Department is very grateful for these suggestions, one or two of which, I believe, may have a practical application. I will take steps to see that certain schools direct some of their energy along these lines.\n\nI may say, for your information, that one of our institutions turned out 1700 moccasins a couple of years ago, and, although all interested cooperated, we had a very difficult time finding a market for even part of the output.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Robert B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., July 13, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated July 11th, instant, received from the Director of Technical Education, of the Department of Education, Provincial Government, Victoria, B.C., in regard to the desire that this Department should meet the cost, amounting to the sum of $50.00 on a set of working drawings of a forty foot boat for the purpose of instructing Indians in technical branches at our Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia. This letter will be self-explanatory.\n\nI am referring this matter to the Department as this office has no record of the source from which the working drawings of boats which have been already built at the Coqualeetza and Ahousaht Indian Residential Schools were obtained and in case these drawings may have been supplied through the Department, the latter may not wish to extend this expenditure in the manner suggested by Mr. Kyle. I understand from Inspector Barry (Indian Schools) that in the event of this Department meeting the cost of the set of working drawings suggested by Mr. Kyle it is the intention of the Technical Education Branch at Victoria to copy and distribute these plans to our Indian Residential or Day Schools as occasion may require for the purpose of technical education. I may say I am in perfect sympathy with the good work which Mr. Kyle is endeavoring to do in the interests of technical education, but I think that the proposed set of working drawings to be prepared by Mr. T. Halliday should be submitted for the approval of the Department before payment is made. I mention this because it has been our experience in purchasing boats for our Agencies to find that there have been omissions of detail in construction which have proven costly to the Department after the vessels have been built and it is thought that any model set of working drawings of the forty foot or any other boat should be as comprehensive as to detail as is feasibly possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Education\nVictoria.\n\nJuly 11, 1933.\n\nC.O. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Manual Training Course for Students in Indian Schools.\n\nIn carrying out the work of above it was at once evident that the courses of instruction for Indian Schools would have to be very different from that work conducted in the ordinary schools of the Province at which white children attended.\n\nProblems in carpentry and joinery, building construction and boat-building had to take the place of the smaller models which characterize the course for white children.\n\nThe Provincial Department of Education has been able to assist your Department from time to time owing to the fact that they had ample projects in Woodwork, Carpentry and Joinery and House-building but we have no projects in boat-building, and it is with a view to adjusting this defect that I write you.\n\nMr. T. Halliday, Marine Architect, 650 West Hastings St., Vancouver, is willing to produce a set of working drawings of a forty foot boat at a cost of fifty dollars. These drawings would be prepared specially for instruction purposes and would be well worth the money; moreover, they would be valuable to a great many Indian Schools although, according to Mr. Anfield and Mr. Jordan, the needs of the school at Alert Bay are of outstanding importance.\n\nWould it be possible in view of the urgent necessity of this boat-building course, to obtain permission from the Dominion Government Department to proceed with the preparation of the plans for the fishing boat referred to and pay for same?\n\nI can assure you that the cost is very reasonable for the amount of work entailed and, moreover, I do not know of any existing plans which would do for instructional purposes.\n\nCapt. Barry, I may say, is in complete accord with this idea.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"John Kyle\"\n\nDirector of Technical Education.\nOttawa, July 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 182-30243 of the 13th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Director of Technical Education of the Department of Education, Victoria, B. C., recommending that this Department provide the cost of printing $50.00 set of working drawings of a 40 ft. boat for the purpose of giving instruction in boat-building to pupils at Indian residential schools.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is not prepared, at the present time, to incur the expenditure required in the supplying of a set of working drawings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Commissioner for B. C.  \nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe-Purchase of working drawings (at a cost of $50.00) for a 40' fishing boat, to be used as a project for Manual Training.\n\nLast July a request was submitted to the Indian Department at Ottawa for the cost of a set of drawings suitable for teaching purposes, and the proposed expenditure was disallowed.\n\nThe set of drawings referred to would be of great benefit to the instructors at Indian Schools on the Coast, and the drawings would be prepared by a qualified boat-builder. The design would be of the type of fishing boat preferred by fishermen in B. C.\n\nI therefore beg to apply again for this expenditure, and feel certain that if the Official in charge of Indian Affairs at Ottawa understood how much value the Provincial Government has given in the way of providing courses of instruction in Building Construction and suitable projects for the Manual Training centres in the Indian Schools, he would be glad to avail himself of the opportunity of complying with this request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"John Kyle\"\n\nDirector of Technical Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.

Perhaps the Department will kindly consider the representations made and advise me at its pleasure of the decision arrived at.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 129/32221 of the 7th instant, regarding the proposal of the Provincial Department of Education to supply a set of working drawings of a 40 ft. boat to be used for the purpose of giving instruction in boat-building to pupils at Indian residential schools and enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Director of Technical Education, Provincial Department of Education, Victoria, B. C., concerning the matter.\n\nIn the event of purchase of the set of working drawings suggested by the Director, it would be necessary, in order that each school is supplied with a set; that copies be made and distributed to the residential schools. It is presumed that the set of drawings would be comprehensive as to detail and for a type of boat that could be satisfactory for fishing purposes. I am of opinion that pupils of the residential schools would be competent to perform the labour in the building of a boat? Would this involve the Department in future expense for materials and the supplying of an engine? Further, could a school use the boat for its own purposes or sell same to advantage? Frankly, the Department is in some doubt as to whether the set of working drawings could be put to practical use. I shall be pleased to have a further report from you, together with your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst.

Kyle, Director of Technical Instruction for British Columbia. Mr Kyle and I are in complete agreement with regard to the matter of plans for a 40 foot fishing boat.\n\n1. Mr T. Halliday, of 650 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, is a Naval Architect, and is willing to draw a complete set of INSTRUCTIONAL PLANS for a 40 foot fishing boat for the sum of $50.00.\n\n2. The above plans are quite different from the ordinary plans from which boats are constructed. They would be drawn for teaching purposes, and would be used to construct such a boat as a project in Manual Training.\n\n3. The necessary reproduction of these plans as Blue Prints would be undertaken by the Department of Technical Instruction.\n\n4. The fishing boat to be constructed from such plans would be very suitable for the purposes of fishing on this coast.\n\n5. Mr. Kyle and I are quite certain that the boys of the Alert Bay, Coqualeetza, and Ahousaht Indian Residential Schools are well able to construct boats of this type under the instruction of the Manual Training Instructors.\n\n6. I do not recommend that the Department provide engines for any boats constructed under this plan. I do think that for the first year or two, there should be a grant for the necessary lumber for the FIRST BOAT at each school, and that after this grant has been made out of the Special Vote, the schools finance the building of the next boat by the sale of the hull of the boat previously constructed. One boat should be made yearly at each of the above mentioned schools.\n\n7. Mr. Kyle will visit Mr. Halliday on his next visit to Vancouver, and inspect Mr. Halliday's work. Mr. Kyle will then write to Mr. C.C. Perry, Assistant Commissioner for Indian Affairs in British Columbia, and make a report on the whole proposal.\n\nI would recommend that no further action be taken in this matter till the report of the Director of Technical Instruction has been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

Grayling of the Gordon Indian School.\n\nI am interested in Indian work and am anxious of offering a position of possible vocational training.\n\nI am by profession a first class shoe maker also harness maker and have often thought that to join the Indians training in these lines would be of great benefit.\n\nI am not suggesting that they earn their livelihood by these trades, but to learn them would do them much good and would be of practical value. I have often visited the mission at Little Peace River and always been greatly interested.\n\nI am living in a district that has suffered through drought and business conditions so are not good.\nI feel that I could use my time to better advantage by helping the Indians to help himself. I am also interested in Work-culture and I think this would also be of great assistance.\n\nI have a daughter that covers herself knitting sweaters, socks, and various in this line; also is a fine needle worker, dress making etc., and is an adept at fine embroidery work.\n\nFor these services I do not expect but a simple - remuneration.\n\nI am\n\nYour Truly,\n\nWalter Stovall\nOttawa, May 6, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo and to state, by way of comment, that the teachers and manual training instructors engaged in our Indian residential schools throughout the Dominion are employed by the church authorities under the auspices of which these schools are operated. None of these teachers or instructors are employed by this Department.\n\nIf you are anxious, therefore, to secure a position, the only suggestion I can make is that you communicate with the church authorities. Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, B.D., 38-43 The Bible House, Alexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man., is the representative in western Canada of the Anglican Church; Rev. Robt. E. Cochran, B.D., Secretary, Board of Education, United Church of Canada, 299 Queen St. West, Toronto, Ont.; is in charge of the United Church residential schools. If you are anxious to secure a position in a school operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church, you might communicate with Very Rev. U. Langleois, O.M.I., Oblate Fathers' Provincial House, 9916 - 110th Street, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Walter Kerchin,\nPaynton,\nSask.\nI beg to submit the following report on my recent inspection of the Fort Arthur Agency.\n\nNo. 54 McIntyre Bay also known as Grand Bay.\n\nIt is not hard to visualize the day when McIntyre Bay may become an important manual training ground for many of our Indian school graduates in place of sending them to High school. The possibilities for such a scheme to be put in motion are good. I believe the idea merits earnest consideration.\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAug 25/1926\n\nMr John Lawlor,\n\nDear John:\n\nWe take this opportunity on the eve of your wedding, to congratulate you and the future Mrs Lawlor on this auspicious occasion, and at the same time we would like to express our thanks for the wonderful work you are performing with our boys. We have been watching your progress and you seem to have acquired the gift of imparting your knowledge into the minds of the boys with beneficial results, at the same time blending kindness with discipline. Your personal conduct, manner of speech, and your willingness to work with the boys at all hours, proves that your heart is in your work and you are in your right vocation. Therefore, on behalf of the staff and boys we extend to Mr Lawlor and yourself the best of good wishes for a long and happily married life.\n\nPov. Denis,\nDirector\n\nSt John Ind. School\nToronto\n175 Laurier Ave.\nHull, P.Q.\nFeb 26/38.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation of recent date pertaining to my application for position as Manual Training Instructor, I hereby present an outline of my experience and qualifications:\n\nI was apprenticed to the Woodworking business (Carpenter-joiner) in England at the age of 13. Two years later, I commenced to attend night classes, taking up theory for the teaching of Manual Training, and at the age of eighteen, I obtained a position as Manual Training Instructor at Shuben Industrial School, Halifax, Eng., which position I held until the Home Office closed the school in 1924. All manual training work at this school was under the supervision of Home Office inspectors, who laid out a schedule of work to be taught to the various grades, and an inspection of this work done by the boys was made every three months by the Home Office.\n\nIn 1924, I arrived in Canada, and obtained a position as Manual Training Instructor at St John's Industrial School, Toronto, which position I held until the spring of 1930. Then a new school was opened at Alfred, Ont., and over 50% of the boys from Toronto were transferred there. This caused a reduction in the staff, and as I could\nnot obtain another position of the same kind at that time, I entered the business world and have been engaged in some ever since. At the present time I am employed as district supervisor for the P.F. Collie Co. of Toronto, Canada.\n\nI might say here, that in teaching manual training in Canada, we followed a wider field of work than was practised in England. That is to say, besides the usual model making in the class room, I instructed the boys in outside construction work and other handicrafts, with the idea of giving them a working knowledge and ground work to enable them in obtaining a position as an apprentice or helper to a carpenter or a construction company, when their time at the school expired.\n\nIf my services can be used by any branch or school under your supervision, I would greatly appreciate same, as my most earnest desire is to continue in the line of endeavour, in which I feel I can accomplish the most good, in the training of boys or young men, who have been deprived of serving an apprenticeship, or who desire to start in same.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of an unsolicited testimonial from the Director of St John's School, under whom I worked. Thanking you,\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJohn Lawler.\nWinnipeg, Dec. 14th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are informed that it is the intention of your Department to conduct Manual Training classes in the various schools on the Indian Reserves. If this is correct, we certainly think you are to be congratulated as we believe this is an excellent training for young people, and in this connection are wondering if we could be of service to you.\n\nThis Association has, from time to time, prepared various plan books, building suggestion booklets, etc., which we supply to our member retail lumber dealers. We have also prepared a set or 30 Manual Training suggestions in blueprint form, giving full details of construction of such articles as magazine racks, table, medicine cabinet, lamp, cedar chest, small tree, footstool, fern stand, music rack, book rest, poultry feed hopper, nail box, etc. This set of blue prints we have been selling to our members at $2.00, and no doubt something of this nature would be very useful in your various schools.\n\nIf you would be interested in seeing a sample of this Manual Training set, we will be very glad to send you one.\n\nUnder separate cover we are mailing you a sample of our \"Pocket-Size Book of Building Suggestions\", which might also be helpful to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWESTERN RETAIL LUMBERMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n(W.

His report was that the set is excellent but that sheets 4, 5, 11, 16, 18 and 19 require considerable study and would be more suitable for advanced pupils.\n\nIf there is any school in the Province of Alberta, either day or residential, where you consider a set of these blue prints could be used to advantage please let me know and an order will be placed.\n\nAs requested in your letter I return the blue prints which you forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Superintendent\nWelfare and Training\nIndian Affairs branch\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 5th instant enclosing excerpts from your inspectors' reports for the month of December 1938. These reports are quite interesting and I am glad to notice that manual training in its various forms is being taken up with zeal in most of our Schools.\n\nThe tendency in quite a number of Catholic Residential Schools during the last seven or eight years has been to dismiss boy-pupils on or about their fifteenth year. This was done for two reasons:\n\nFirst, the age limit for Indian Boarding Schools having been changed from eighteen to sixteen, Indian parents were very often insistent that their boys be dismissed on their fifteenth birthday claiming that when their fifteenth year was fully accomplished they were really to be considered as sixteen year old children.\n\nSecondly, our Residential Schools being over-crowded, the older pupils were dismissed to make room for younger ones.\n\nThis condition has rendered manual training a rather difficult matter for boys. Indian children are admittedly about two years below the average white child in intellectual development. The consequence of this is that what can be taught successfully to a white child of fourteen years of age can only be taught to an Indian child who has reached the age of sixteen. As a consequence, all farm work and all mechanical training can be best taught to Indian boys when they have reached their sixteenth birthday.\nThis should be taken into account in any system of manual training which the Department may wish to institute either in Residential or Improved Day Schools. Doctor Westgate, in his memorandum on Indian education, a copy of which you must have on file, suggests that the age limit be placed again at eighteen. Most Indian educators would subscribe to this suggestion of Doctor Westgate.\n\nWhat I have just said about Indian boys applies more forcibly to Indian girls and as far as the latter are concerned, the moral aspect of the question of age must not be lost sight of. Our Indian girls are exposed to great many dangers when they are dismissed from Schools at the age of sixteen. They are too young to marry and the home environment does not contribute to their moral well-being; the homes are so small that privacy of any kind is impossible of attainment.\n\nThe nuns who are in charge of our Schools have always made the statement that it is with girls between the ages of sixteen and eighteen that the best results in all the domestic arts can be obtained in Residential Schools.\n\nAt the present time, whilst Principals are desirous of keeping these girls after the age limit, the parents, relying on the Indian Act, demand the dismissal of their daughters and it is very difficult for Principals not to accede to the wishes of the parents.\n\nWould it not be possible for the Department to have the Act changed or, at least, to give the agents and Principals some authority in the matter of dismissals from Residential Schools?\n\nI hope to have time shortly to write you at length concerning the progress being made in manual training in the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba Catholic Residential Schools. I think you will be pleased with the response given to your suggestions by the Principals and by the Sisters in charge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOP/TR\nOttawa, January 23, 1939.\n\nRe - Promotion of vocational training at Indian residential schools.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in which you submit, for my consideration, a number of suggestions with respect to the above noted subject - all of which will be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that a few days ago I had an interview with Mr. R. J. Johns, Director of the Manitoba Youth Training Centre. It is my understanding that the workshop operated under the direction of Mr. Johns is located on Henry Avenue, Winnipeg. In any event, you will experience no difficulty in locating it.\n\nMr. Johns was described by a New Zealand educationist a few years ago as the finest exponent of vocational instruction in either Europe or the United States. The New Zealand Government made him an offer to go to that country, which he refused at that time. In my judgment it would be very helpful if you could persuade the principals in charge of your residential schools to visit this youth training centre and while there discuss vocational instruction with Mr. Johns.

H. Andrews, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa. In addition to the regular school work and equipment, the Department has endeavoured to emphasize the advantages of manual training and vocational instruction to the teachers by stressing the importance of such instruction in Indian schools and the response of the instructors and students to these efforts. These efforts have been a major factor in the success of the work.\n\nIndian schools are equipped to provide an educational program designed to meet the needs peculiar to each school. When they are located, in order to fit the Indians for such occupations as may be within their reach. Courses in agriculture, carpentry work, tailoring and, in some cases, meat butchering are available for the boys, while at all residential schools there is given similar training in cooking, dressmaking, and hand-loom weaving.\n\nVocational instruction is now being extended to the day schools, where the Indians are taking a particular interest in the manual training courses. At one day school, the teacher reports that the boys in the manual training class have carried out extensive repairs to the school building in addition to doing work benches, cupboards, picture frames, saw-horses, and many other articles for use in the school.\n**MINK PROSPECTUS PREPARED FOR MR.

Pirt.\n\n64 Canora Street,\nWinnipeg, August 10th, 1939.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nCity\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAs suggested to you in our recent conversation, I enclose herewith a prospectus on Mink ranching, which I feel will give you a little clearer insight into the costs of animals, pens, and food, together with estimated income over a period of four years. Costs as shown herein, are exact. Our Ranch was average with over 5,000 pelts last year was $15.25 each but have based your pelt average conservatively at $10.00, leaving a fair margin for market fluctuations.\n\nIf the placing of these animals can be arranged at three or four locations such as, Sioux Lookout, Kenora, Brandon, Norway House, will extend to you free of charge, with the exception of expenses to these locations:\n\n1. Assist and advise personally at each location, the correct method of pen construction, selection of site for ranching purposes.\n\n2. Periodical visit to each location to check on housing, feeding and care of animals.\n\n3. Will lecture to those interested, and render every possible assistance to convince your pupils of the possibility of them earning an independent income after they leave school.\n\nHave viewed the feeding situation at the above mentioned points, and find they are all ideally situated, fish is in abundance at every point, with the exception of Brandon. Their supply can be obtained from Lake Manitoba without any great difference in costs.\n\nIf there is at all a possibility of making a start on this proposed plan this fall, would strongly urge you to do so. There is plenty of time at our disposal for pen erection, also to acquaint those interested in the necessary ground work. The sooner these chaps make a start with this mink production the quicker they will be able to start out for themselves.\n\nIf there is any further information that you require, or any manner in which we can be of further assistance to you, will you please feel free to call upon me at any time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Morley B. Pirt.\nDear Sir:\n\nI believe an effort should be made to educate some of our better Indian boys in the care and manner of operating a Mink Farm. In view of the supervision required I would suggest that this education be started at certain boarding schools where boys are enrolled from the bush or lake country.\n\nI would like to see a start made at three schools, providing the principals are willing to undertake the work. I would suggest the following:\n\n1. The Roman Catholic School, Kenora, Ont.\n2. The Church of England School, Sioux Lookout\n3. The United Church School, Brandon.\n\nThese three units would cost approximately $500.00 each or a total of $1,500.00. I would recommend Mink that produce pelts that will bring $10.00 to $12.00 each rather than a cheaper class ranging from $6.00 to $8.00. The cost of feed and care is the same, therefore it is foolish to start with low grade stock.\n\nMr. W. P. Pirt, perhaps the outstanding Mink breeder in the West, is prepared to supply the stock and has offered his services free of charge, except for transportation and meals. He figures two or three visits to each point might be necessary, after which further information can be secured through correspondence.\n\nI am writing this because I believe it is the type of work that will appeal to the more intelligent Indian boy, and most of the bush and lake Indians can secure fresh fish at all seasons.\n\nI would like to know if funds are available to start this work and if not would the Department consider including $1200.00 in the 1940-41 estimates for this purpose.\n\nMr. Pirt has called several times and I enclose a copy of a letter just received, together with his estimates of the cost of one unit. Personally I would prefer to start at three points and reduce the number as set forth by Mr. Pirt to 3 females and 1 male.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from the Department concerning this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Promotion of Mink Farms\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd instant and also certain correspondence relating to the establishment of mink farms enclosed therewith.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the one or two attempts we have made to establish mink farms at residential schools have been in no sense successful. I am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter recently received from the Principal of the Qu'Appelle residential school and my reply thereto sent forward to Inspector Robertson. If, after you study these communications, you are still of the opinion that additional experiments should be undertaken you should again communicate with the Department. I am personally of the opinion, however, that very few of our residential school Principals have the training or experience, or even the inclination, to make a success of anything outside the routine school duties. It seems to me fairly safe, however, that Dr. Robertson is likely to take immediate steps to dispose of the mink now at Qu'Appelle it might be well to communicate with him in respect to the matter. The Department would have no serious objection to the transfer of a few of the mink now at Qu'Appelle to one or two of our residential schools in Manitoba. This transfer, however, would have to take place on the distinct understanding that the school authorities would accept full responsibility for any outlay that might be required in the construction of pens and in the feeding and care of the animals. I may state that in the case of Qu'Appelle the Department purchased the mink and in addition paid for the construction of the pens.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

I would like to draw your attention to the following fact: These Job Sheets are very flexible. The analytical sheet, called the Student Record Sheet, is very important.\n\nAfter the pupils know how to handle a hammer and a saw, they pick out an article which appeals to them. For this purpose I am sending you, under separate cover, a list of plans for the use of the first year. If you think that these plans will be of any help to your schools, a set is available for each school and will be sent on their request. After the pupil has made his choice and it has been approved by the instructor, the tool processes are checked on the analytical sheet. From this sheet, then, the pupil and instructor notice which operation the pupil does not know. He is then referred to the job sheets and taught the operations, after which he constructs his object. You will readily see that the pupil always has an objective before his mind, which is of the utmost importance for efficient work. I am drawing your attention to this because to use the job sheets otherwise would somewhat destroy their effectiveness.\n\nI would be pleased to read the suggestions and comments made by your manual training instructors. Nothing will please me more than to be able some day to visit the schools of B. C. If there are any other remarks or any questions in reference to the use of these job sheets, I would be very pleased to answer them. I would like your manual training instructors to feel that I am at their service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCaptain G. H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.

McGill\n\nThe Minister read the report of Mr. Doucet following an inspection made of a number of residential schools in Western Canada. He expressed the view that it was an excellent report and inquired what work Mr. Doucet was doing now. He suggested that it might be well worth while to have him make a careful survey of the possibilities of increasing the teaching of manual training in the schools in Eastern Canada.\n\nWhile it is appreciated there are more day schools and fewer residential schools in the east than there are in the west, the Minister thought that serious consideration should be given to changing the present curriculum in our day schools, which it is understood closely follows the provincial curriculums, and provide for more instruction in manual training and handcraft work. And, further, that if this policy is decided upon there should be a more thorough and frequent inspection for the purpose of seeing that the curriculum is carried out and what progress is being made.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, November 18, 1941.\nOttawa, December 23, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am sending forward herewith a report dated December 20, 1941, received by me from Mr. Doucet, immediately following his inspection of the Maria, Restigouche, Lorette and Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools.\n\nYou will note with interest Mr. Doucet's reference, on page 3 of his report, to the Indian Agent at Maria. The service rendered by this agent since his appointment has never been wholly satisfactory. Mr. Jacobs, the father of the two girls mentioned in the report, is not a member of the Maria band but was visiting Maria early this year. At that time he asked the Indian agent to secure the release of his two daughters, who were pupils at the Shubenacadie Residential School, and the agent, without consulting us, instructed Father Macdonald to return the girls to Maria. We have found it impossible to return these girls to Shubenacadie until their case has been dealt with by the courts. Apart from the expense involved, this has been in my judgment a very unfortunate incident and one that could easily have been avoided if we had been able to persuade the Indian agent to accept instructions from this Department rather than from other sources.\n\nThis report on the whole, however, is somewhat encouraging. I was particularly pleased to learn of the willingness of the Quebec Department of Education to cooperate with us in the promotion of worthwhile vocational courses at our Indian schools.\n\nActing Director.\nMarch 26, 1942.\n\nMemorandum\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nRe: Dr. Moore's report on a trip in western Canada.\n\nIt was stated that in some of the residential schools a small model house was provided where the girls lived for a time and were taught practical housekeeping.

ROEY.\n\nReport re Visit to Restigouche, Maria,\nLorette and Caughnawaga.\n\nI wish to express my appreciation for the kind attention extended to me by Indian Agents, Dr. Richard and Mr. Bastien.\n\nMARIA: I was quite pleased with the plan of the Maria School. The large basement consists of two rooms, one of which is used for domestic science and the other may be used for activities for the boys.\n\nThe school has no tools and no work benches. The rooms are at present rather dark. A whitewash of Casein paint would greatly improve the brightness and appearance of these rooms. A wood stove has been installed in the domestic science room. This was necessary for teaching cooking and to wash the military clothing that has been sent to be repaired, remodelled and distributed among the needy.\n\nI was very greatly pleased to notice the splendid use made of the socks sent from military sources. These were the only articles received by this school, so far. These socks were unravelled and the wool rolled into balls -\nballs. These machine-knitted socks consist of one-strand yarn, which is not suitable for hand knitting. The teachers, by means of the spinning wheel, twist this wool into a double-strand yarn, which then can be used for hand knitting. The Maria School has not as yet been able to prepare all the wool for this kind of work, as the school does not possess a spinning wheel. However, the Sister Superior feels sure that she will be able to borrow a spinning wheel from her Community.\n\nBesides observing work in the classrooms, I had two teacher meetings, at which I outlined the subjects to be taught to Indian children. I dealt with the use of methods more appropriate to Indian education. I wish to express here that the teachers showed a great deal of interest and enthusiasm for the work of Indian education, and a translated extract from a letter written by one teacher to their Supervisor of Studies would, I believe, prove interesting:\n\n\"This gentleman, an ex-teacher, has entertained us for too short a time with his methods - pedagogical methods of a remarkable realism. Here I must say that his visit will leave its mark.\"\n\nRe: Jacobs Family\n\nActing Indian Agent Cyr had ordered discharged from the Shubenacadie School the two Jacobs girls - one 11 and the other 13 years of age - for their summer holidays. This was done without the authorization of the Indian Affairs Branch. Jacobs was known to be irresponsible, and the fact that the Acting Agent allowed these girls to live in the home of an equally irresponsible old man, without any womanly care, seems to me an indication of rather poor judgment. I expected to be able to settle the whole matter at the time of my visit, but due to complications, as already reported, I was unable to do so. The Indian constable had affidavits from these girls -\ngirls of indecent conduct towards them. Acting Agent Cyr, instead of communicating with this Department, made a report to the Provincial Police at Quebec City, asking them to conduct an investigation. This, it appeared to me, was taking the matter completely out of our hands. In his last report Mr. Thibault warned Acting Agent Cyr that this method of procedure could not be tolerated and that when he was in doubt he was to consult this office before making any decision. This, the Acting Agent is unwilling or unable to do. If this procedure is allowed to continue, I fear many unnecessary difficulties are bound to arise frequently.\n\nRESTIGOUCHE.\n\nI observed the work in each classroom. The reading in general is good. The methods used are the conventional methods generally used in the classroom. A change of method in some instances was recommended. Methods more suitable to Indian education were explained at the teachers' meetings; two such meetings were held. At the first of these meetings the Pastor and his assistant were present. At the teachers' request, another meeting was held on Saturday. I wish to give these details to show the eagerness with which the teachers endeavor to accept all help given them. I am confident that complete co-operation will be given by the teachers of both Maria and Restigouche.\n\nRe Military Clothing -\nRe Military Clothing:\n\nThe use made of the clothing given at the Restigouche School is truly worthy of mention. The socks are unravelled and the wool is then twisted into a 2-strand yarn, by means of the spinning wheel. Then the children knit hose for themselves. I have witnessed the whole process and have examined a completed pair of stockings. The result would do credit to any institution. I have also seen skirts and jackets made from sailors' trousers. These appeared as beautiful as new articles. I examined dresses made by the girls and also gloves made from used wool. The teachers deserve commendation for the splendid use made of the used clothing sent to them. Besides clothing these children, the training given them in the use of used material is beyond doubt the best training that can be given them.\n\nRe Manual Training and Agriculture for the Boys\n\nI had several meetings with Mr. Arsenault, the new farming instructor. I feel confident that here we have an ideal set-up. During the winter months the instructor can teach manual training to the boys and prepare the boys and girls for gardening. A school garden is all important, and the pupils should also be encouraged to have their own garden plots at home. Using the proper methods of encouragement, competition, various clubs, etc., great results may be expected. I was pleased to note that school gardens had already been started at the school. Here, with the co-operation of the authorities on the reserve, the home and the school, the results should be very satisfactory. The concerted effort of these three agencies towards one objective cannot but produce splendid results. In order to bring the home more efficiently into the cycle, a Parent School Association is being organized at Restigouche. A definite program was discussed with the Pastor and the teachers - this to be followed with a definite outline of procedure, objectives, etc.\nOn my way back to Quebec City, I stopped at Rimouski, to interview the Director of Studies for the Congregation of the Holy Rosary, Mother Mary St. Fortunat. We had a 2-hour discussion on educational methods and subjects that should be taught in our Indian schools. She is very anxious to co-operate with the Department; she is even anxious to train the teachers that will take charge of our schools along the lines we wish to indicate. I am very pleased with her extended cooperation on these teachers. They are willing, I might say, they are anxious to follow the directions we wish to give them. I hope that it will be possible to revisit this school in order to make sure that they are using the right principles necessary for success.\n\nQuebec City\n\nIn my interview with B. O. Filteau, Secretary of the Catholic Council of Education, I discussed the problem of preparing our students to live. The claim of cultural course as given by the Provincial Course of Study does not meet the requirements of our schools. This, Mr. Filteau has readily conceded. He has promised full co-operation in the promotion of a program suitable for Indian schools. He feels we are justified in corresponding directly with the inspectors responsible for the inspection of our schools.\n\nI also interviewed Mr. Percival, Director of the Protestant Board of Education. He also has offered us the full co-operation of his department. He wishes us to issue instructions to the inspectors when he deems it necessary. I must say that I was cordially received by these officials. This co-operation is sure to result in a better understanding between those responsible for the administration and inspection of our Indian schools.\nWhile at Quebec City I visited the Technical School, to study the methods that they are following. The methods followed in this school would not, I believe, give us in our schools the results we would expect.\n\nMONTREAL\n\nIn Montreal I had an interview with Instructor A. E. Wescott, of the Caughnawaga School. I discussed with him the difficulties he met with in introducing woodwork at this school. I gave him definite directions by which he could overcome these difficulties. I let him understand that I would send him definite instructions on the manner of using the analytical sheet and the plans supplied to them from this Department. I also passed part of an afternoon in his shop while he was instructing the pupils. I was quite pleased with the attitude of the pupils in general. They have shown a great deal of skill in the work completed so far. The progress made is quite satisfactory, under existing conditions. The fact that some of the pupils have asked to put in extra time is quite significant.\n\nI visited the U. C. School, which was closed due to convention at my last visit, and had a meeting with the teachers, after school. The teachers are doing good work. I had met these teachers, however, on my last visit in Montreal. They have carried out the suggestions made at this meeting and state that they are very pleased with the results. As for manual training, another attempt is to be made by the teachers and the Minister, Mr. Wheeler, to send the two or three boys old enough to take manual training to attend the classes given at the R. C. School. This is to take place on Thursday afternoon, if arrangements can be made. I discussed the problem with Mr. Wheeler. He made this suggestion and is to make a survey of the possibilities of carrying out the plan. Junior activity may be carried out by Miss Bryan, while Miss Joblin instructs the girls in sewing. A survey is to be made on the possibility of forming a student council in order to develop responsibility among the pupils.\n\nLorette -\nLORETT\u00c9:\n\nAt Lorette, conditions that do not exist in any other of our schools require special attention. Instruction in this school is carried out in the French language - the language spoken in general in the surrounding community. The teachers state that their greatest difficulty seems to be the teaching of language. Definite instructions were given in order to overcome this difficulty, which seemed to be due to the fact that too much was attempted. This school possesses a few tools but has no space outside of the classroom itself where this activity could be carried on. The teachers are anxious to have specific directions as to the work that should be carried on. As these teachers are not very familiar with the English language, all directions will of necessity have to be given them in the French language. This will entail a great deal of work in translating into French the various directions we have given to the other schools.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, December 20, 1941.\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nAs you are aware, increased efforts have been made, since Mr. Doucet was appointed, to encourage the teaching of vocational work at the Indian residential and day schools.

What I have in mind are only the schools that I have recently visited. For instance, the Key Indian Day School under the direction of the Reverend Marzden Buck, at Norquay should be contacted. There is also the Fishing Lake Indian Day School at Kylemere, where the Reverend A.J. Lawes is teaching, and the Gordon Indian Residential School at Punnichy.\n\nAs far as I know none of these schools are doing any woodwork but if they are it is very little, and I think this should be taken up with these schools direct by our School Branch. I know Mr. Desmet, the official our Branch is possibly referring to in the recent letter sent to me, has been at these institutions and he can better explain the matter to the teachers than either myself or the Indian Agent.\n\nI would therefore ask that he be instructed to get in touch with these schools noted above, and probably it would be well to get in touch with all of the schools, and just find out what is being accomplished in the courses referred to.\n\nI trust this will be looked into immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nMc/ed\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMany schools have been organizing courses in manual training for the boys as well as for the girls. We feel that the boys are getting manual training to some degree but that the boys have little opportunity of obtaining such training. If you have any teacher who is willing and capable of taking manual training and if you have available space suitable for a shop, the Department is ready to furnish the tools necessary for such a course. Job sheets and instruction sheets are also available if the school feels that adequate use can be made of them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.E. Prayling,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1942.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 21st ultimo, I wish to state that the Gordon's School has not requisitioned for any tools or for the courses in woodwork. At the time Mr. Doucet visited there there was nobody available who was capable of teaching this work, also no space for shop work could be provided. We are, however, communicating with the Principal of the Gordon's School and if he feels that it is possible to organize these courses, we would be only too pleased to see that he gets the material required to do so. We do feel, however, that it is not desirable to have tools and material tied up if no adequate use can be made of them.\n\nAs regards the Fishing Lake Indian Day School, I wish to quote a passage from the Inspector's report:\n\n\"Hand Work: Largely under direction of Mrs. Lawes who is an experienced teacher; this work is excellent and deserves special mention. It is truly wonderful what these children can be taught under sympathetic guidance.\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRegina, December 7, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 1-1-11 of the 3rd instant and I note that you have not given my recommendation very much consideration as you have left out the Key Indian Day School entirely.\n\nRegarding the hand work which is under the direction of Mrs. Lawes at the Fishing Lake Indian Day School, this is not necessarily woodwork.\n\nI notice you are quoting from the Inspector's Report on the above mentioned school. These reports are the ones you prevented this office from receiving.\n\nWhy did you not also take the matter up with the Key School as requested?\n\nM. Christierson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nDecember 11, 1942.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, I admit that the work done at the Fishing Lake Day School may not necessarily be woodwork. It is mostly carried out by Mrs. Lawes. However, it should be kept in mind that while woodwork is important especially in the case of the boys, it is only part of manual training. To introduce it effectively it must be taught by teachers who have had training. At the present it is not our policy to force this work on all teachers, but rather to proceed cautiously and introduce the work as circumstances warrant. The Department is encouraging manual training principally in the residential schools for reasons that will suggest themselves to you. From this beginning it is intended to expand.\n\nAt the Key Indian Day School Rev. J.M. Buck has no training as a teacher and has had but two years' experience. I believe it would be very unwise to have an untrained teacher attempt our integrated programme. In spite of his lack of training, Mr. Buck is doing very well, but it would be unfortunate to possibly ruin this work by demanding too much.\n\nThe Department is prepared to organize manual training at any school where, in our judgment, the teacher is able and willing to handle it efficiently. All the teacher has to do is to requisition for the material required and at the\n\np.t.o.\nsame time advise the Department the number of pupils who will take advantage of the course, the time that will be available and the space that can be used. Such an application from any teacher will receive sympathetic consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Item Code | Description       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 340       | COOKING BADGES    |          | $0.15      | $51.00      |\n| 170       | POULTRY           |          | $0.15      | $25.50      |\n| 170       | GARDENING         |          | $0.15      | $25.50      |\n| 340       | SMITHING          |          | $0.15      | $51.00      |\n| 340       | RATTING           |          | $0.15      | $51.00      |\n| 340       | CARPENTRY         |          | $0.15      | $51.00      |\n| 340       | HOUSEKEEPER       |          | $0.15      | $51.00      |\n| 340       | DAIRY B           |          | $0.15      | $51.00      |\n| 80        | LEATHERWORK       |          | $0.15      | $12.00      |\n| 80        | METALWORK         |          | $0.15      | $12.00      |\n| 80        | WEAVING           |          | $0.15      | $12.00      |\n\n**Total Sales**: $388.00\n\n**6% Sales Tax**: $23.28\n\n**Total Amount**: $411.28\nMODEL A 9-INCH SOUTH BEND Precision LATHES\n\nThe 9-inch Model A South Bend Lathes are precision tools capable of producing work to the exacting tolerances demanded in modern industry.

D.Sc.\nDirector,\nDominion Experimental Farms,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Archibald:\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nDuring my thirty years experience with Indians and Halfbreeds I have observed, where such people have an opportunity to receive either manual or domestic training, by attending training schools or through association with persons in places of business or homes, a fair percentage of them become quite proficient and useful citizens. Observation during my trip down the Mackenzie River, showed a definite decrease in practical knowledge and ability of these people as I proceeded north. Discussing the matter with Drs. Truesdell, Harvey and Livingstone all agreed with me, that manual training to include agriculture, animal husbandry, horticulture, carpentry and general mechanics should be included in the school curriculum and that experts should be engaged to give such instruction. While it must be admitted that such training, no matter how efficient it might be, would not increase the intelligence one hundred percent, I am of the opinion that a large percentage would become better able to serve a more useful purpose in the development of the country, for they would at least provide a source of intelligent help, which at present is almost un procurable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Albert Lawrence,\nSuperintendent,\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJanuary 8, 1963\n\nFile No. 1-1-11\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE: Allotment\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. R.A.

If you do not think this will be an improvement let me know, and we can print it in black if you want.\n\nEnc.\n\nF.H. Peters,\nSurveyor General, and\nChief, Hydrographic Service.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1943.\n\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Proficiency Badges\n\nAs illustrated by Mr. Doucet on various occasions, the proficiency badges will soon be ready and it is our intention to award badges for cooking, sewing, weaving, knitting, housekeeping, gardening, leather work, dairying and poultry raising.\n\nBefore making these badges available the Indian Affairs Branch desires the teachers of the various manual skills to make a list of the basic operations which, in their opinion, the pupil should cover for each year of a three-year course in order to entitle the pupil to receive a badge.\n\nThese basic operations should be progressive from the easiest to the more difficult. It must be kept in mind that the operations listed must be basic; namely, operations that are absolutely necessary in carrying out the simple duties of a housewife, or a cook etc. There should be about twenty basic operations for each year.\n\nPrincipals should notify the teachers concerned and forward their lists as soon as possible to the Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Chart for Proficiency Badges\n\nYou are being forwarded two charts illustrating the proficiency badges about which you were advised in circular letter of January 29, 1943. These charts should be framed and one posted in the boys' side of the building and the other in the girls'.\n\nYou will note that these charts indicate the basic operations which pupils must know in order to qualify for a badge.\n\nWhen a pupil has efficiently covered the first group of basic units a green badge is awarded. When the second group is covered a red badge is awarded. Later you will be advised regarding the badge which will be awarded for covering the third group of basic units.\n\nIn the majority of cases it will require one year for a pupil to cover each of the groups of basic units. In some cases a pupil may cover this group in less time than a year, while other pupils will require a longer period than a year.\n\nFor reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you, it has been decided not to award any badge to a pupil under twelve years of age. It is true that some of the operations recognized for badges will have been learned before that age is reached, but these operations will not be recognized for badge purposes until the age mentioned.\n\nWhen a pupil has qualified for a badge a special form is signed by the instructor and the principal and forwarded to this office. The badge will then be sent to the pupil. This badge should be awarded publicly as soon as possible after its reception, either by the Student Council or any similar school organization.\n\nTeachers should keep in mind that the success of any enterprise depends on the enthusiasm shown by the teachers themselves. The Department, therefore, depends upon principals, teachers and instructors to use every possible effort to create interest and enthusiasm among the pupils in the badge system.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nApril 30, 1943.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. F.M. Peters, Surveyor General, Chief,\nHydrographic Service.\n\nOne hundred blue prints have been sent to Mr. Murray by a messenger. Please have one hundred copies of each made by the same process as was done last year, samples of which have been sent with the blue prints. These are to be used for manual training in the Indian Schools. They may be done when it is convenient for you.\n\nSupt of Welfare & Training.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1943.\n\nTo principals and teachers of Indian schools:\n\nRe: Proficiency Badges\n\nAs illustrated by Mr. Doucet on various occasions, the proficiency badges will soon be ready and it is our intention to award badges for cooking, sewing, weaving, knitting, housekeeping, gardening, leather work, dairying and poultry raising.\n\nBefore making these badges available the Indian Affairs Branch desires the teachers of the various manual skills to make a list of the basic operations which, in their opinion, the pupil should cover for each year of a three-year course in order to entitle the pupil to receive a badge.\n\nThese basic operations should be progressive from the easiest to the more difficult.

Classes include writing, manual training, sewing, mechanics, art, social studies and hobbies.\n\nBig winners were pupils of the Thunderchild Industrial School, Lloydminster; the residential school at St. Philips and the residential day school at Duck Lake. Awards were as follows:\n\n* **Grade 1 \u2013 Margaret Henderson, Anglican Indian Res. School, Lloydminster**\n* **Grade 2 \u2013 Glenna Ray, Anglican Indian Res. School, Lloydminster**\n* **Grade 3 \u2013 Lucille Sansom, Anglican Indian Res. School, Lloydminster**\n* **Grade 4 \u2013 Elmira Brown, Anglican Indian Res. School, Lloydminster**\n\nThe exhibits on display include paintings, drawings, and miniatures made by the students.\n\n**Bright Indian Work Displayed**\n\nGaudy-colored bead jackets, of what can be done by hand, are striking to the eye. They represent work of half-breeds as well as full-bloods Indians.\n\nDrawings, paintings and miniature figures in skeletons, depict the skull of the Indians. Tiny tepees, patterned to fit miniature buffalo skin hides, used in the Indian encampment, are also on display.\n\nAttention has been drawn to the Indians' full dress and headgear, tomahawk, and snowshoes.\n\nSoapstone pipes, moccasins, used for household use made from tin cans further demonstrate the ingenuity of the students.\n\nThere is a definite contrast in designs on exhibits entered by full-breed and half-breed Indians. The half-breed designs, especially on wearing apparel on display, are extremely attractive. The exhibits themselves are in conservative colors. Designs on pieces of furniture vary and are mostly square-shaped. The exhibits are brightly-colored.\n\nOne of the Indians' wares on display are fruit and pickle preserves, a new class of Indian exhibit. These are canned wild and cultivated fruit, jam made of wild and cultivated apples and cucumbers.\n\nThe entries are from scattered reserves in the province and compared favorably with past years. These items are increasingly popular in some of the sections.\n\n**Special Indian Art Exhibit**\n\nGrades 1 \u2013 4, Gordon Henderson, Anglican Residential School, Lloydminster; Grade 5 \u2013 Edith Bell, All Saints Indian Res.

I am sending forward also two of our vitamin charts, prepared for distribution last year, to Indian schools, to Indian agents and our medical health officers. It is my hope that you and the members of your Society will find this information interesting and suggestive.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Dorothy Davies,\n406A Pemberton Building,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, November 15, 1943.\n\nDear Miss Ravenhill:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is our hope that immediately following the close of the war we shall be able to secure a large number of fully qualified teachers, particularly teachers qualified to carry forward a worthwhile vocational course of study at our Indian day and residential schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Alice Ravenhill,\nWindermere Hotel,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Mr Hoey,\n\nI trust apologise for a little delay in sending my thanks to you for the copy of the new Technical Training Courses for Boys and Girls in the Indian School with samples of the Padres, etc. In these as in all school work the prime factor in success is of course the teacher; and as one of fifty years experience in the field of education in Great Britain, the U.S.A., and to my regret a very small degree in Canada, I beg your forbearance in writing that until the teachers in our B.C. Indian Schools have special preparation for this line of work we must not expect the results some of us desire. However, you do not ask for my opinion, so I apologise for intruding it upon you.\n\nI think you will feel our Society, struggling against great difficulties in yet serving these \"Wards of the Federal Government.\" Last year I was nominated to their Indian Committee by the Canadian Handicraft Guild as well as Anthony Walsh. The result is that for the very first time some examples of our B.C. Indian skill has been shown at this year's Exhibitions of Handicrafts not only in Montreal but at the Royal Academy of Quebec. Possibly you know that for the first occasion in its 67 years of existence the Quebec Royal Academy opened its doors to a few examples of Handicrafts, metal, pottery, weaving, etc. Articles submitted had to satisfy 3 Committees to gain a place; the beautifully fine basketry of two Nootka women were selected and perhaps one of the finest reproductions in needlework of a complicated Haida design I have ever made; more intricate even than the much larger specimen I worked by our Queen's request. This week I have received a cutting from The Montreal Star of Oct. 8th, which gives space to the fact that examples of highly praised handicrafts from four of our B.C. Indian Schools were on view at this \"All Canada\" Handicrafts Exhibition; a small testimony of our work among them. We had no prior notice of the exhibition that it was no easy undertaking to collect these specimens; the schools were closed, children and teachers dispersed except at the Christie and the Alex Bay schools; the other two schools which earned this approbation were Inkaneeep (paintings on doe skin executed before Anthony Walsh left) and St Catherine's School, Duncan.\n\nTrusting I have not trespassed unduly on your time,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAlice Ravenhill.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 13, 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. F. Peters, Chief, Hydrographic Service,\nLabelle Building, 105 George St., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nPlease find herewith an order, along with\nthe sample of a chart, which the Indian Affairs\nBranch wishes to have reproduced. This chart is to\nbe used in connection with the drive to encourage\nsubsistence gardening. Mr. Doucet will deliver the\nabove mentioned and discuss the details with Mr.\nMurray.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 20, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have just been reviewing our expenditures from the B.C. Special appropriation for the nine-month period April 1 to December 31, 1945. As you are aware, $10,000.00 of the total amount was assigned to technical education. Part of the 1945-46 allotment lapsed at the end of March last and for the nine-month period under review it would appear that a considerable amount will lapse at the end of March, 1946.\n\nI realize that the residential schools and the day schools at which vocational training is given in British Columbia are becoming fairly well supplied with necessary equipment and consequently the only expenditure necessary in this particular regard will be for some replacements. Highly qualified instructors are unavailable at the present time and consequently the increased expenditure that might be made for their salaries is unnecessary.\n\nIt is possible that you could secure some materials for the use of the vocational training classes at the schools where this is taught and this would ensure a supply for some months to come. If you feel it is desirable to take this action, the total expenditure between now and the end of March should not exceed $2,000.00.\n\nHowever, I think the time has arrived to give the matter very serious consideration with a view to determining if we should make advanced education\navailable for more pupils. I refer particularly in this regard to vocational training. This might include encouraging some of the more qualified girls to take nursing courses. Evidently the Coqualeetza Hospital is having considerable difficulty in securing staff and it is quite possible that this condition may continue for some years to come.\n\nWith the contents of this letter in mind I wish you would give the matter some consideration and let me hear from you.\n\nR.A.

ROEY.\n\nWith reference to our recent interview regarding an increased effort to encourage vocational work at certain schools, I have again discussed the whole matter with Mr. Doucet.\n\nTo carry out a proper vocational program, it is necessary to have a qualified teacher. It is possible that qualified teachers can be secured for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nThe residential schools and the larger day schools in British Columbia have given considerable attention to vocational work for many years and have been assisted in that regard by the allowance of part of the salary of the teacher, plus the supplying of equipment and supplies. Funds for this purpose are available in the B.C. Special Appropriation.\n\nIn each of the fiscal years 1943-44 and 1944-45 we provided a special amount of $7,500.00 for vocational equipment at residential and day schools other than in British Columbia. A similar amount is included in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46.\n\nHowever, we do not make any allowance towards the salary of qualified vocational teachers as we do in British Columbia. Owing to the financial condition of most of our residential schools, I believe that it will be necessary for us to make an allowance towards the salary of the vocational teacher, if we wish the work to be handled in a proper manner.\n\nIn view of the above, I recommend that provision be made for the following funds in a supplementary estimate when Parliament reconvenes:\n\n1. AN AMOUNT OF $17,250.00 TO ASSIST CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS IN SECURING QUALIFIED VOCATIONAL TEACHERS AND IN ENGAGING VOCATIONAL TEACHERS AT CERTAIN DAY SCHOOLS.\n\nIf the above amount were available, we would communicate with the residential schools we have in mind for the academic year 1945-46 and advise them that the Department is prepared to make an allowance of one-half the annual salary of a vocational teacher, provided such teacher could be secured for $1,500.00 a year, or less. This would mean a maximum allowance from the\nDepartment of $750.00 for the academic year. If a teacher could be secured at a lower salary, the allowance by the Department would be proportionately less. On their part the residential school would be required to pay the other half of the salary and provide room and board. Before any residential school would be allowed payment of half the salary for the vocational teacher, it would be necessary for them to submit the name, address and qualifications of the person they propose to appoint. In order that the Department may assure itself that such teacher possesses the necessary qualifications. The residential schools that we suggest be given this offer for the academic year 1945-46 are as follows:\n\n**ONTARIO:**\n- Cecilia Jeffrey\n- Fort Frances\n- Mohawk Institute\n- Shingwauk\n- Sioux Lookout\n- Spanish\n\n**MANITOBA:**\n- Birtle\n- Brandon\n- Elkhorn\n- Pine Creek\n- Portage la Prairie\n- Sandy Bay\n\n**SASKATCHEWAN:**\n- Qu'Appelle\n- Duck Lake\n- Cowessess\n\nAll of these schools have some facilities at the present time and it is felt that the suggested program would function well at them.\n\nIn the case of the day schools, it will be necessary to pay the full salary of the vocational teacher and in these cases also we should have authority to employ a qualified vocational teacher at a salary not exceeding $1,500.00 a year. The day schools suggested for this increased activity for the academic year 1945-46 are as follows:\n\n**QUEBEC:**\n- Caughnawaga\n- St. Regis\n\n**ONTARIO:**\n- Six Nations No. 3\n- Rama\n\nAt all of these schools considerable vocational work has already been done and it is felt that decided progress would be made if a fully qualified teacher was engaged.\n\n2. AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF $5,000.00 FOR EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL.\n\nAs mentioned above, $7,500.00 is available in the current year's appropriation for the purchase of vocational equipment and material, but, if the proposed intensive program is carried out, an additional amount of $5,000.00 might be required.\n\nThe total -\nThe total estimated expenditure would therefore be:\n\nAllowance towards Salaries of Teachers .... $17,250.00\n\nEquipment and Supplies ............... 5,000.00\n\nTotal ...... $22,250.00\n\nArrangements will be made to have Mr. Doucet visit these schools early in the new academic year, with a view to determining the specific procedure to be followed for vocational work.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 6, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Suitable subjects and courses have been outlined and a measure of progress has been made; however, in that fully qualified teachers have not been available for this work and latterly it has been increasingly difficult to secure tools and equipment. A careful survey of our whole field of educational effort has recently been undertaken. We have decided to ask Mr. Doucet to devote practically all of his time to the organization of vocational courses at Day and Residential Schools. The recommendation made by Mr. Phelan that a supplementary estimate be asked for to enable us to start this program at the beginning of the next academic year (September 1st) is well worthy of consideration. This program of vocational instruction might well be carried out in conjunction with the program of Physical Fitness, for the organization which Major Eisehardt of the Department of National Health and Welfare is responsible.

Manual skills, especially for woodwork.\n3. Ability to handle physical training and games for boys.\n4. Good command of English.\nOttawa, September 13, 1945.\n\nDear Father Lavigne:\n\nI understand from Mr. Doucet that when he was in the West recently he discussed with you our desire to make an increased effort to encourage vocational work at certain residential schools during the current academic year. As you know, it has not been our policy, in the past, to pay any amount towards the salary of teachers at residential schools, but we are hopeful that the Principals of certain schools, at least, will co-operate with us in having this important phase of education placed on a firm basis.\n\nOur proposal for the current academic year is that if certain residential schools can obtain a qualified vocational teacher, the Department will pay one-half the salary provided the service of a teacher can be secured for $1,500.00 or less.

In this connection I may say that for several years past we have been allowing grants towards the salary of vocational instructors at Alberni and other residential schools in British Columbia, due to the fact that funds for the purpose were available in the B.C. Special Appropriation. The funds which we are now securing are being used in certain residential and day schools outside of British Columbia. As a matter of fact, we are at present allowing the Alberni School an amount of $75.00 a month towards the salary of a manual training instructor and, in addition, an amount of $50.00 a month towards the salary of an assistant manual training instructor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, October 1, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCareful consideration has been given to your application for appointment as manual training teacher in an Indian school.\n\nIt is particularly noted that you have not had any experience as a teacher, and it is felt that this would be a very severe handicap.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given at the present time toward giving you an appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Eugene J. Lusignan,\n16 Douglas Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Manual Training Supplies\n\nI should appreciate being advised of the Department's policy in respect to the supply of expensive hardwoods to Residential schools for manual training purposes. Some time ago the Department questioned the need of the use of such woods for instructional purposes in manual training and we have endeavoured to discourage requisitions for same. Requisitions continue, however, to be received here for hardwoods from certain Residential schools and I should appreciate the Department's views on the subject.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Mr. Melan:\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 14th Inst. regarding the hiring of a vocational teacher for the school here, I have consulted many times with the staff and put before them a financial condition report. We do not see it at all possible. We have two paid teachers already plus several other workers in the house who are drawing monthly wages.\n\nIt is very regrettable that the offer cannot be accepted. We have looked at it from every point of view and discussed it several times at great length, but financially it is impossible.\n\nFrom a point of view of the class work, these boys come for the most part with no previous schooling or it is not until they are here three or four years that they can be put at any work which takes them from the three Rs. The boys from grade five and up are the only ones who really have enough school work done to give time to the vocational training. The amount that is done now in the grades from four to six (not including the latter) is the usual Ontario hour a week. In the last three grades six seven and eight they have the system of a day in class and a days work. I need not go into the different trades poultry farming etc. If the new course were to take the boys out of their classes for many hours a week it would hardly seem feasible.\n\nOne solution offered by a member of the staff was that we should have a maintenance man who would teach at the same time. If such a man were willing to come under those conditions that is, do the regular required number of hours a week and teaching the matter assigned and then looking after repair work in electricity etc., then we would be able to bear the burden of the expense. This plan of course would depend on the number of hours required in the new course and of course on the Department's acceptance of such a plan. At any rate we shall most likely be forced by circumstances to hire such a man for maintenance. There are many difficulties in getting teachers.\nespecially qualified ones in that line. As for maintenance men, it will soon be possible to get a good man for the ordinary maintenance work at a fair rate. If this last suggestion should find approval then we can believe, get the person we want. Gerard \"Sibley\" came here before the war, and subsequently joined the R.C.A.F., did the full course of Technical training at one of the Vocational Institutes in Toronto, had part of his high school and the full five years of Tech School. He visited here just before your last letter and was waiting discharge but did not think of coming back here at all because we could not offer the wages that we should pay a man of his training (here I speak of an offer to hire him for maintenance).\n\nThis was the only plan suggested and it was agreed that we could not possibly stand the expense of hiring a teacher along with the Department as outlined in your letter.\n\nHoping that this makes the matter clear and waiting your answer as to the suggestion offered\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Rev) J.R.Oliver S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian affairs - ranch, Ottawa.\nOttawa, October 6, 1945.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, we are interested in your suggestion.

Please let me know, by wire, when the information regarding your nominees will reach us.\n\nMr. Doucet is prepared to conduct a course, but in view of your recommendation that this course be held at Sandy Bay, he would like to reach there at an early date, in order that he will not be tied up for an indefinite period by bad weather.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Chambers who has been appointed as Manual Training Instructor at the Bishop Horden Memorial School at Moose Factory. When at this school recently I arranged for a building to be put in shape to serve as a workshop and understand that a requisition for tools and materials has been sent in to you. I believe that Mr. Chambers will be able to do good work in this capacity as he has served in several schools and has taken special training while in the Air Force to fit himself for the position.\n\nIn regard to Elkhorn, we have no one on the staff at the moment who could qualify for this special grant. We are, however, endeavouring to secure a teacher with Manual Training who would have been appointed earlier if we could have secured his release from the Army.\n\nThe question of remuneration creates some difficulty in our minds. As you know our salary scale has not been very high and this is one reason we have not been able to secure certain types of workers. However, if we were to pay a total salary of $1500 with room and board provided at Moose Factory we should place the Instructor at a figure $300 higher than the amount paid to the Principal. We have also to remember the feelings of other male members of our staff who may only be receiving $60 per month in cash. We only secured Mr. Chambers by offering him $75 per month and this would probably be sufficient as his total remuneration.\n\nI shall write further as soon as we are in a position to make application for this grant at Elkhorn.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nMEETING PROPOSED FOR OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND TO THIRTIETH\nSTOP APPLICATIONS ON THE WAY WITH LETTER:\nREV M LEVINE\nOctober 11th, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThank you for your letters of September 14th and 22nd, giving the offer of a vocational teacher and the information regarding the use of the Government grants.\n\nI have delayed answering your letter until I had a reply from Mr. Pitts of the Cecilia Jeffrey School at Kenora.

One of our usual forms for making application for this position is being sent to Mr. Pitts.\n\nAs stated in the opening sentence of my letter of September 14, we are endeavouring to encourage vocational work at certain residential schools during the current academic year. Funds are not available at the present time for the promotion of this work at all residential schools. For this reason and for other reasons which will readily suggest themselves to you, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your suggestion about the Principal of the Birtle School.

May I be fully advised concerning this matter.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, 29th October, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, we are anxious to make an increased effort to encourage vocational work at some Residential Schools during the coming academic year. As you know, it has not been our policy in the past to pay any amount of the salary of teachers at Residential Schools but, as the result of a special appropriation that we have just obtained, we are now in a position to assist some Principals in obtaining a qualified Vocational Teacher.\n\nWe have communicated with some schools and if Vocational Teachers are secured, it is our intention to watch their work carefully with a view to providing such assistance at all Indian Residential Schools within the next year or so.\n\nBefore any Vocational Teacher is appointed, an application form is submitted to the Department in order that we may decide if the qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory. The Department would pay one-half of the salary provided the services of the teacher can be secured for $1,500 a year or less. Of course, the school management is expected to provide the other half of the salary, plus maintenance.\n\nNo doubt Mr. Doucet has called on you recently, as he is conducting a short course at Sandy Bay Residential School for certain Manual Training Teachers whose qualifications we consider are satisfactory. In conducting this course, Mr. Doucet is simply endeavouring to outline to these teachers the Department's policies and wishes regarding manual training work at Indian Residential Schools.\nI have already been in touch by correspondence with the four Churches associated with us in Indian work, and have settled with them the schools at which we are prepared to grant assistance during the current academic year.\n\nSome of them have been successful in obtaining teachers and others have not yet secured one. As soon as the teachers are definitely selected, you will be advised regarding the schools in Manitoba where such assistance is being given.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRE: Grouard Indian Residential School.\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Brother Tugdual Nicol has been conducting in the above school, for the past year, carpentry and general mechanics' classes. He has under him, the oldest boys of the school whom he is training in the use of carpentry tools. During the school year 1944-1945, they made a large number of useful articles which were sent to the Edmonton Exposition and won several prizes. He is also teaching the boys that show an inclination for the general principles of stationary engines.\n\nWould it be possible to have Brother Nicol accepted as a teacher in the Grouard School, with the salary that you are paying for such classes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, November 1, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to Brother T. Nicol, of the Grouard Residential School.\n\nI enclose one of our regular forms and would appreciate it if you would forward this to Brother Nicol and have him supply the information requested. When returning the form it should be stated what salary he is being paid. As I informed you previously, the Department is prepared to pay one half of the salary, provided the services of the manual training teacher are secured for $1,500.00 a year or less. Of course, the school management is expected to provide the other half of the salary plus maintenance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. O.

March 2, 1946\n\nMr. William Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nDuring the course of the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity, either of visiting or of hearing from a number of our Indian Residential Schools. I am pleased to report that the craft and trades instruction program, such as it was outlined by yourself, has begun in a very satisfactory manner and that the boys' response seems to be quite in keeping with the hopes you founded on this venture.\n\nThe boys show a keen interest for woodwork and the other branches of the program. I was pleased to note also that the teachers are cooperating with the instructors by insisting in the classroom on such topics as are related to the particular item of manual training actually under way. I was told that, at St. Philips, some of the boys who thus far had been unable to grasp the theoretical explanation of fractions, readily understood them when they were confronted with woodwork projects involving the use of fractional numbers. At Camperville, Sandy Bay, Kenora, and Fort Frances the results achieved so far are likewise very good and the satisfaction the boys derive from this new project produces a wholesome reflection on the general atmosphere of the school.\n\nI take much pleasure in expressing my thanks to you for having brought about the realization of this plan and for having so liberally supplied the equipment required therefor, as well as for many other highly appreciated favors which it would be too long to enumerate at the present time.\n\nPlease accept, dear Mr. Phelan, with my respectful regards and best wishes, my very sincere thanks for your kind and generous cooperation.\n\n[Signature]\nMarguerite Lavigne, O.M.I.\nProvincial\nOttawa, March 26, 1946.\n\nDear Father Lavigne:\n\nI was greatly pleased to receive your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the progress that is being made at the schools under your charge in connection with manual training.

Special Appropriation, in the absence of any definite information regarding the commitments already made against this amount in the way of manual training grants to Residential Schools, manual training instructor's salaries, etc., it is not possible to make recommendations in any great detail. Consideration might be given, however, to:\n\n(1) An upward revision of technical instructors' salaries, with a view to attracting better qualified teachers.\n\n(2) The supply of a greater variety of tools and materials for advanced manual training instruction, and particularly the more modern and up-to-date power tools such as circular saws, band saws, planers, jointers, sanders, drill presses, routers and shapers, scroll saws and lathes.\n\n(3) Opportunities for Indian girls to attend hair-dressing schools of recognized standing.\n\n(4) Commercial training for both boys and girls who show the necessary aptitude and are recommended for such training by the Principal and School Inspector concerned.\nWith reference to item (2), tools and materials are in such short supply at the present time I would like to suggest that a percentage of the allotment, say $5,000 be sent aside for expenditures on direct authority from this office as on many occasions after securing quotations by the time authority is received from Ottawa the goods are not then available.\n\nD.

Very few teachers have had any opportunity to train in the technique required to teach subjects successfully. These Job Sheets have been prepared to help those Instructors who are endeavouring to carry on notwithstanding this great handicap. These are intended as guides. They will also provide Instructors with a clear objective.\n\nA student analytical and record sheet is supplied. The pupil will select a project either from plans supplied or from other sources. He will have this project approved by the Instructor, who will make sure the article is not above the pupil's ability. The Instructor will then proceed to analyse the object to discover the operations required for its fabrication. This may be done in the presence of all the pupils, although each has chosen a different article. It will give practice in analysing from a sketch. After a check mark (v) is inserted in the first column, (Process required), opposite the operation necessary for the construction of the chosen project the student checks the other two columns. (At first this is done by all the students under the supervision of the Instructor).\n\nThese Record Sheets are handed in to the Instructor who files them in some manner easily accessible for himself and the students. By observing these complete records, the Instructor can easily notice which pupils require instruction on the same operation, (obviously these may be given simultaneous instruction). After the operation has been performed the Instructor grades, with a colored pencil, the operation by means of \"A, B, C, D or E\", as the case may be in the last column. The grading is then transferred by a pupil on the \"Monthly Report\" which is to be sent every month to Head Office.\n\nA. Excellent\nB. Good\nC. Average\nD. Fair\nE. Unsatisfactory.\n\nEach project is similarly analysed. A glance at the pupil's charts discloses repeated operations. An inferior grade for a repeated operation would probably indicate lack of application. In brief, this chart is in reality a record of pupil achievement.\n\nThe repair job sheet is self-explanatory.\n\nNo. 228\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES.\n\nA few preliminary lessons are required before starting the actual work. Shop rules and regulations should be thoroughly discussed. The pupils will understand the reasons for the regulations. They will be impressed with the importance of system and cleanliness. They will know the simple rules of prevention of accidents. Prevention and First Aid posters should be displayed in the workshop. Posters illustrating the tools and the various joints should also be posted.\n\nThe preliminary lessons should also include - How to Use a Hammer, How to Use a Hand Saw and How to Handle a Plane.\n\nThe selection of a project should be the next step taken by a student of woodwork. The project, of necessity, will be very simple. This project should be one which will furnish the desired training as well as prove interesting to the pupil.\n\nBooks of projects, drawings, current magazines, etc., should be a part of every shop library. Many publications are available free of charge: Government bureau of publications, manufacturers of woodworking tools, manufacturers of supplies of all kinds, etc. These companies are only too pleased to furnish publications and charts, which should prove beneficial to the students. Pupils should get good practice in writing themselves for these.\n\nNo. 229\nInland Falls, Sask.\nSept. 16th 1946.\n\nMr. Daucet\nTraining Div.

Kindly give me all information in regard to your school together with the name of the Agent and Inspector who visit the school. When I receive this information I will be able to go into the matter more fully.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nIsland Falls, Sask.\nSept. 20th, 1946.\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet\nTraining Service,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nIn reply to your letter of 10th instant regarding further information about Manual Training in Band-Beach schools,\n\nThis is a native school operated under the provincial Gov't., although some \"Cree\" children are also in attendance; I thought it would be partly a Redfern issue as well.\n\nAlso may I add that this settlement is mixed, namely, Treaty and non-Treaty as well as a few whites which make up the population.\n\nFor reference our Agent is Mr. Sam Lovell\u2014The Pas, and Superintendent is Mr. C.H. Pierson.\n\nTrusting this is the required information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.P. Sobulski\nOttawa, October 8, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I might say that we are at the present not dealing with schools operated by the Province. This would complicate matters a great deal. I believe that you can obtain from the Department of Education at Regina all information that you would require about Manual Training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\n\nMr. P.F. Sebulski,\nIsland Falls,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, October 19, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nMajor Davey, of your Correspondence Branch, wrote and told me of your intended visit to Ottawa. I would very much like to see you to discuss further the question of providing power tools for use in our Residential Schools in British Columbia. My telephone number is 9-4465 and my office is Room 502, Booth Building, 145 Sparks Street.\n\nHoping to hear from you, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. A. Jones, Esq.,\nDirector of Industrial Education,\nProvince of British Columbia,\nRoom 262, Centre Block,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 25, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nVocational Training Grant\n\nReference your C-11-6 of 23 May and 15 October, and our I-1-11 of 29 May and October 19, 1946.\n\nWe are now in a position to agree to the suggestion advanced in your letter of May 23, 1946, regarding an allotment to be set aside for expenditures for manual training purposes on direct authority from your office.\n\nAs seven months of the year have elapsed, it is not possible to now allot the full sum of $5,000.00. However, this matter has now been discussed with the Director and you are allotted a sum of $2,000.00 to purchase tools and materials required for manual training purposes. These expenditures would be on direct authority from you and would be such as are necessitated by the present shortage of materials and tools. It is understood that such a procedure will prevent your losing supplies of needed items such as has happened in the past while awaiting authority from head office.\n\nYou are requested to confine individual purchases to the usual purchase order limit of $500.00.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 30, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nProvision of power tools for the Schools of British Columbia.\n\nYou have recently requested that we clarify the whole situation insofar as the provision of power tools to Residential Schools of British Columbia is concerned. Therefore, in answer, we would like to point out the following general policy which will be followed by the Department in this regard:\n\n1. MANUAL TRAINING TEACHERS\n\nThe Department will provide power tools for manual training shops where the teacher is fully qualified and holds the proper teaching certificates granted by the Department of Education of the Province of British Columbia. In all other cases, each individual instructor's qualifications will be carefully considered before approving expenditures for power equipment.\n\nThe grants to be made by the Department for the purchase of power tools will be based upon the attendance at the residential school concerned.\n\n2. USE OF POWER TOOLS BY STUDENTS\n\nIt is understood that in the manual training shops of the junior and senior high schools of the Province of British Columbia, pupils use power operated machinery\n\n........ only when in\nonly when in view of the instructor. It is most essential that a similar precaution be employed in our schools, especially in view of the fact that our manual training begins often at an earlier age for Indian boys than for boys in the provincial schools.\n\n3. **INSPECTION OF SAFETY DEVICES**\n\nIt is understood that the workmen's Compensation Board of the Province of British Columbia will send one of their Inspectors to check the installation of these power tools and will be glad to give whatever advice is required in their operation. In all instances where residential schools have such equipment or are installing such equipment, this service of the workmen's Compensation Board should be used.\n\n4. **SAFETY LITERATURE FROM THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION BOARD**\n\nIt is most essential that all such literature receive the fullest distribution throughout the manual training shops of our schools using power tools. These posters must be displayed in our manual training shops and the Inspector of schools will ensure that this is done. Indian agents should also check on this practice in their visits to our schools.\n\n5. **SAFETY PRECAUTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF POWER TOOLS**\n\n(a) Saws: It is now generally agreed by the various Directors of Technical Education for the Provincial Departments of Education that there are fewer accidents when power saws are used than with circular saws. In industry the band saw is more generally useful than a circular saw and is also less dangerous.\n\nThe band saw should at all times have a guard over it, leaving only the opening exposed where the actual sawing takes place. Boys should not stand at the side of a band saw.\n5. (b) Planers: It is unlikely that an accident should occur when pupils are using this tool. However, care should be taken that the feed is not too heavy and that no one stands in front of the plane.\n\n(c) Jointers: The most serious thing that is likely to happen in an accident using this tool is that 1/8\" of the finger might be taken off, which would of course involve only the fleshy part. However, this would only happen in the case of gross carelessness.\n\nThe jointer should have a telescopic rear-guard as well as a standard swing-guard in the front so that at no time any portion of the knife is open other than that over which work is passing. When using short material, pupils should always use a push stick.\n\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nIt is felt that if the principals of residential schools and Indian Agents are all made aware of the above precautions very few accidents should occur in our manual training shops. It is realized that this training in operating such machinery will be most valuable to our Indian students and will enable them to obtain better positions in the mills and factories of your province.\n\nDirector.\nAERIAL\n\nOttawa, November 4, 1946.\n\nMajor D.

Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, December 26, 1946.\n\nWILLOW CRAFT IN INDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nThe Welfare and Training Service, Indian Affairs Branch, is securing a supply of fine peeled willow, suitable for use in basket weaving\u2014as well as a small supply of heavier grade willow for use in making basket bottoms.\n\nIn the past, many teachers have requested supplies of Reed and Raffia for handicraft purposes. As these supplies are not available, we wish to suggest the use of willow, which can be supplied in reasonable quantities.\n\nOn pages 43-45 of the publication \"Arts and Crafts for Canadian Schools\", by Louis A. Short, will be found directions and illustrations dealing with \"reedcraft\". Practically the same directions are applicable to the use of willow, but it must be mentioned that it is necessary to soak willow in water for at least 12 hours before using, and only the supplies to be used the next day should be soaked at one time.\n\nIf it is desired to split a willow wand, to secure flat strips for binding handles, etc., a simple tool can be made by sawing 2\u00bd or 3 inches off the end of a broom handle (or by using a piece of hardwood of similar size, texture and shape). As it is difficult to describe the tool, an Indian worker has been requested to make a small supply, and one tool which can be copied will be sent to each school in which willow basket making is undertaken as part of the craft program.\n\nWhen a supply of flat strips is needed, select a few thick willow wands, and with a sharp knife make three incisions (from one to two inches in length) in the heavy end of the wand\u2014dividing it into three sections. The wooden tool to be used is also shaped in three sections. Insert the centre of the tool in the centre of the willow wand to be split, and ease it through the length of the wand, endeavouring to \"feel\" the fibre of the willow, and to steer the tool in such a way as to produce strips matching reasonably in width. With a little practice it is possible to secure in this way long flat strips of willow which are as pliable as the expensive bamboo strips formerly used by professional craft workers for binding handles.\n\nShould schools interested in such a project send in a requisition on form I A 413 covering the following items:\n\n(a) Willow (10 lbs. per residential and 5 lbs. per day school)\n(b) One peeling wand\n(c) One copy of \"Arts and Crafts in Canadian Schools\".\n\nBernard F.

I understand there is such a program but one is not at hand in this office.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nFOREWORD\n\nLESSON PROCEDURE.\n\nPREPARATION:\n\nThe pupil will read the \"Reading Course\" listed at the bottom of Job Sheet #1. This may be done at his study period, during free periods or at any other suitable time.\n\nIt may be wise to let the pupils, coming to the workshop for the first time, move freely about the room. They will examine the posters, the tools, the furniture; in one word they will familiarize themselves with the quarters assigned for this study.\n\nAt the proper time the Instructor will call the students to order; he will assign a place to each one; he will discuss with them, the \"Shop Regulations\". He will make sure that the pupils know the reasons for these regulations.\n\nShop responsibilities will then be assigned: Care of the tools; List of groups responsible for tidiness; Heating of the Shop, etc., A list of those responsible for the above will be posted at a convenient place and a standing, A, B or C recorded for the accomplishment of these tasks.\n\nDEMONSTRATION:\n\nIn the presence of the pupils, the Instructor will dismantle a plane. A general discussion will follow: What is the purpose of this part? Why is it constructed in this manner? What would happen if it were constructed in such a manner? This discussion should last as long as the pupils show interest. The Instructor will then proceed to put the plane together, again seeking the reasons for such a procedure in preference to another.\n\nSTUDENT ACTIVITY:\n\nThe pupils, each at his work bench, dismantles his plane, afterwards putting it together. They will follow the Procedure indicated in Job Sheet #1.\n\nNOTE:\n\nIt may readily be seen how easily the above could become a lesson in oral or written language. This is integration as recommended for Indian schools.\n\nSECOND LESSON: The Hammer and the Saw.\n\nThe pupil will read:\n\na. Hand Woodworking p. 91 No. 128 and p. 47 to 56 Nos. 81 to 90.\nb. Woodwork for Junior High Schools p. 16 and p. 14.\nc. Instructional Units in Hand Woodwork p. 152 to 154 and p. 33 to 38.\n1. The Hammer: Proper method of handling, its history, the simple scientific principles involved.\n\n2. The Saw: Its use, the difference between the rip saw, the crosscut saw, the back saw, the panel saw. The methods of handling to secure a square cut.\n\nSUBJECT ACTIVITY:\n\n1. The Instructor will continually check to make sure the pupils form the correct habits in handling these tools.\n\n2. Choice of Object:\n\nIt is of the greatest importance that the work of the pupils at this stage should be motivated. To learn joints in succession lacks interest. Joints should be learned as they are required. For this purpose the Instructor will have each pupil pick an object which he desires to make. This project may be selected from the set of sketches sent or from any other source. The Instructor might approach the subject in the following manner: - Here are some drawings and pictures of what you might choose an article you would like to make. These sketches will be placed in the shop hall so that you may look at them during your free time. On a piece of paper write your name, the name of the article you have chosen and the reason for your choice. Hand this paper to your teacher. I will get these papers and we will discuss the articles you have chosen, next time we meet in this shop.\n\nThe Instructor must prevent failures. It is important that the project chosen by the pupil be an article within his ability. He must be reasonably successful with his first article, otherwise all future interest may be lost. Should the Instructor judge the project presented by the pupil as too difficult he will suggest to him to make another choice. The former object may do for a second or third project. With the proper approach the pupil will be led to pick a suitable project. Besides avoiding the risk of ruining the pupil's future attempts, the Instructor will have led him on a reasoning process which is a definite part of his education.\n\nAfter the various projects have been approved the analysis takes place. The purpose of this analysis is fourfold:\n\n1. To teach the pupils to read and understand simple sketches.\n2. To teach the pupils to recognize the construction process of the described project.\n3. To discover the Basic Operations required for the manufacture of the project.\n4. To help the Instructor to group his students.\nThe following example will illustrate the above points, (each pupil uses a separate analytical sheet for each project).\n\nJohn Doe selects a project. Suppose he selected a Book Rack. (See Job Sheet #4). This project will require a knowledge of the following processes. (Numbers refer to Student Record Sheet).\n1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,15,16,19,21,29,31,35,38,50 and 51.\n\nAdam Smith selected a Knife Box, (See Job Sheet #7). This project will require a knowledge of the following processes. (Numbers refer to Student Record Sheet).\n1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,15,16,19,21,28,31,34,37,38,50 and 51.\n\nIn both cases students have already learned the following. (Second Column \"Process Learned\" on \"Student Record Sheet\"). 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 11.\n\nThe students have to learn the processes checked in the third column on Students Record Sheet (Process to be learned). In each case they are:\n\nJohn Doe - No. 10,14,15,16,19,22,29,31,35,38,50 and 51.\n\nAdam Smith No.10,14,15,16,19,21,28,31,34,37,38,50 and 51.\n\nAfter all the projects have been analysed, the instructor can readily organize his students and group those who have similar processes to learn. The \"Student Record Sheets\" are kept in a handy place and the processes checked off as they are learned. The check consists of A, B, or C standing as the quality of the work warrants. Each student should have a copy of his own and check his progress.\n\nNotice that the student practices the process on scrap lumber not only to learn the process but because he needs that operation to construct his project. This motivation is essential to the pupil's progress.\n\nNOTE:\nThe following Job Sheets need not be taken in the order in which they appear. The processes are to be taught as the students require them for their project.\nTEST 1.\n\nSome of these statements are true and some are false. Make a circle around the capital T if the statement is true or make a circle around the capital F if the statement is false.\n\n1. The plane is in reality a chisel.  \n2.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the proposed establishment of a Technical School at North Battleford.\n\nI discussed your letter with the Director this afternoon. I note, from the fourth paragraph of your letter, you recognize the fact that if the proposal contained in your communication were followed, it would mean the establishment of another residential school, because we would have to provide adequate living accommodation for the Indian children who would attend the technical school.\n\nWe have been in communication recently with all the Churches operating residential schools and have offered to pay one half the salary of a qualified manual training teacher, to a maximum of $750.00 a year. For instance, if the salary paid by any residential school to the manual training teacher was $1,500.00 or less, we would pay one half the salary and the school management would pay the other half and provide living accommodation. Several schools have already taken advantage of our offer and others have written to us, expressing appreciation of the offer but regretting that they cannot accept it at the present time, due to the difficulty of obtaining qualified manual training teachers. If more schools take advantage of the present offer, we hope, in a year or so, to be in a position to pay the full salary of the manual training teacher. In addition, we are prepared to provide the equipment that we consider necessary and to make payment for the material required. We feel that our program would be more effective than to take part in the proposed technical school. I would appreciate hearing further from you when you have had an opportunity of considering this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have been informed by the Superintendent of Schools of the Department of Education in the Battleford area that some of the buildings of the Air Training Centre at North Battleford are being taken over by the Department of Education for the purpose of establishing a technical school.\n\nThe Superintendent of Schools, Mr. C. Innis, informed me that he had been asked by his Department to enquire as to the possibility that our Branch would wish to co-operate with the Provincial Department of Education with a view to having a number of Indians attend this school.\n\nIt would be necessary to provide living accommodation for the Indians near the school and some of the buildings are being held for our Branch. These buildings were first spoken for in the hope that they could be used to establish a hospital and are still available.\n\nI realize, of course, that a residential technical school would be no small matter for us to undertake but it would appear that a move should be made in that direction to provide some useful training for young Indians who do not intend to become farmers.\n\nMr. Innis asked to be informed as soon as possible whether there is any probability that our Branch will co-operate in this connection. If it is decided to co-operate in the near future, arrangements should be made, as soon as possible, to take over as many buildings as would be necessary. I believe we could have as many as we wish and this is a matter for a more detailed report if considered advisable and I am so instructed.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nProvincial Normal School,\nFredericton, N.B.\nJanuary 20th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.J. Whalen,\n360 Regent Street,\nFredericton,\nN.B.\n\nDear Mr. Whalen,\n\nFor some time I have followed with interest the work of the Department of Indian Affairs and would like to inquire if there are any possibilities for extension work in your area or any of the various areas or Reserves.\n\nI am at present teaching Home Economics at the Provincial Normal School here in Fredericton; I have experience in extension work with young people and with adults teaching different phases of Home Economics and Crafts, before taking up my work here at Normal School.\n\nShould there be any possibilities of work in this field I would gladly\nforward a letter with details of my qualifications and experience.\n\nTrusting that this letter may receive your favourable attention,\n\nYours Truly,\nBeatrice Mahoney.\n\nWould deeply appreciate it if this letter were treated confidentially.\nFredericton, N.B.\nFebruary 28, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed you will find a letter, which I received from Miss Beatrice Mahoney, contents of which are self-explanatory.\n\nMiss Mahoney is a very smart, capable, young lady, and became interested in the Indians in 1944, when a girl's club was started at the St. Mary's Indian Reserve, and Miss Mahoney kindly consented to teach the girls some domestic science work.\n\nIf you have any openings for a person of Miss Mahoney's ability, I am sure she would not disappoint you, if employed.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1947.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ult., enclosing communication received from Miss Beatrice Mahoney.\n\nAbout September 1st, 1948, we hope to have vacancies available for what will be known as \"Welfare Teachers\". In addition to operating the school, they will be expected to do considerable social work on the reserve with the older Indians.\n\nMiss Mahoney would appear to be a very desirable person for this class of work. Enclosed is one of our regular application forms which we would appreciate her completing and returning to us. When we decide to go ahead with the class of teacher mentioned above, she will be given every possible consideration.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, March 17th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of October 25th, 1946 in connection with expenditures for manual training purposes. In that letter you were authorized to expend an amount of $2,000. to purchase tools and materials required for manual training. Please let me know if you have expended this amount and if all the accounts covering the purchases have been forwarded for payment yet.\n\nI would also like to have an early reply to my recent letter suggesting the possibility of increasing the allowances for salaries for manual training teachers in British Columbia schools.\n\nThe Director read the statement of our expenditures to February 28th and he spoke to me this morning regarding the fact that although we have $20,000. allotted for manual training purposes in schools in British Columbia from the B.C. Special Vote, we have only expended 50% of it so far. There is no desire to waste the money but the Director was hopeful that by judicious expenditure we could possibly improve our manual training services.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 28th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Manual Training Buildings Required at Some Residential Schools.\n\nAt any residential school where there is a building that can be converted and used for manual training purposes, we are making necessary changes at the lowest possible cost. This avoids the erection of a new building at the present time.\n\nHowever, there are some schools at which no building is available for reconversion and, consequently, it is absolutely essential to provide a new building in order that manual training may be properly taught.\n\nMr. Doucet has drafted a plan of a manual training building that will meet our requirements for the next few years. The approximate cost of material and labour for this building will not exceed $5,000.\n\nIn order to carry out our manual training programme during the fiscal year 1947-48, it will be necessary to erect at five different residential schools, one of the type of building mentioned above.\n\nWe would, therefore, appreciate the authority of the Minister to include an item of $25,000 in the supplementary estimates, 1947-48, for the purpose mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention of Mr. Doucet\n\nRe: Indian Exhibit for the Calgary & Edmonton Fairs\n\nIn compiling the classes for exhibits of pupils at schools, they fall into three definite groups:\n\n1. Classroom\n2. Sewing\n3. Cooking & Manual Training\n\nIt has been our experience that there is a good representation in all but manual training as laid down in the course of study. The manual training exhibits, which come under your general supervision, are not the sort of stuff that really demonstrates that the boy is learning his craft. Furthermore, it is generally some fragile or more or less useless article, that is very difficult to transport.\n\nI do not know how to classify it, but it seems that the boys, who do carpentry or metal work, should exhibit that which they have been taught to do throughout the year. Could you give any suggested articles or pieces of work that should be exhibited, eliminating, as far as possible, such fragile articles as miniature hayracks, sleighs and oxcarts, which have been very much exhibited in the past?\n\nI am attaching hereto list of classes for the Calgary Stampede 1946. We are trying to remodel it and include something more of general value, adding farm produce, preserving and canning for adults.\n\nAny suggestions and any comments, that can be given by yourself and others in charge of Welfare and Training, will be very much appreciated.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nGHG:RM\nenc.\nOttawa, March 29, 1947.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI have taken careful cognizance of your letter of March 14th.\n\nI wish to pass on some remarks which I heard while visiting schools. I had intended taking these up before but time seems to be a great determining factor. The teachers complain that they are not given the objects required for exhibition purposes until late in the year. This, apparently forces them to devote more time at a certain period of the year. In other words, it becomes a drive for exhibition purposes until the exhibition should be a display of the actual work done during the year. We are wondering if anything can be done about the complaints or whether the complaints are justified.\n\nAs regards woodwork projects, the Department does not require any specific project from the pupils. Its plan is to allow the pupil to choose a project that interests him. Here follows a list of suggestions:\n\n- Book Rack\n- Wash Stand\n- Ironing Board\n- Sleeve Ironing Board\n- Knife Box\n- Jardiniere Stand\n- Stool\n\nKitchen Stool\nKitchen Bench\nMedicine Cabinet\nOrnamental Shelf\nMail Box\nPot Stand\nThe Department concurs with your suggestion so possibly the Manual Training for boys of grades six to eight could read:\n\n1. A practical article useful around the home.\n2. A practical article useful around the farm.\n3. Any article of wood not included in the above.\n\nI hope that this is the information you desire. I know that it is not very specific, however, can training be very specific? Should there be anything else that I can give you kindly let me know.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of March 17th in connection with expenditures for manual training purposes since receipt of your letter of October 25th, this office has authorized expenditures for manual training supplies and equipment at an approximate cost of $1300.00, of which amount vouchers to the extent of approximately $200.00 are still outstanding.\n\nIt is hoped that during the next fiscal year, now that we have the services of a School Inspector, and that manual training supplies and equipment are becoming more readily available, we will be in a better position to utilize funds allotted for vocational training.\n\nfor D.

Used as a text book by the Army, the Navy, the Air Forces, and by thousands of vocational and engineering schools, it is perhaps the best known authority on lathe operation.\n\nThe two 16 mm colored motion picture sound films on lathe operation described on page 3 are based on the book \"How to Run a Lathe\". Each of these films is approximately 800 feet in length, and it requires 20 minutes for showing each film.\n\nThe South Bend Machine Shop Course for apprentice training is shown on page 4. This book contains a series of practical projects in lathe work.\n\nSOUTH BEND LATHE WORKS\n425 E.

They show what the lathe is for, how it operates, the principal lathe operations, and the application of these operations on a representative job. Used by the Army, the Navy, and by hundreds of schools and universities for training men and women for the war industries.\n\nFilm No. I, \"The Metal Working Lathe,\" introduces the student to the standard Back-Gear Screw-Cutting Lathe by familiarizing him with the name of each principal lathe part, its purpose, and operation. It is ideally suited for showing to beginners before they operate a lathe for the first time. After seeing the film, the student will be allowed to manipulate the various lathe controls, thus demonstrating his new knowledge. The film may then be shown again to answer the many questions that are bound to arise after his first experience with a lathe. This method of instruction shortens the training period and reduces the amount of individual instruction. Approximately 800 feet of 16 mm sound film in full color. Showing time, 20 minutes.\n\nFilm No. II, \"Plain Turning,\" clearly illustrates all of the operations involved in the turning of a workpiece on a lathe center. It teaches many of the basic procedures encountered in all lathe work. Among these are measuring with calipers and micrometers, locating and drilling center holes, selecting the proper cutting tools, facing, rough turning, and finish turning of the workpiece. Approximately 800 feet of 16 mm sound film in full color. Showing time, 20 minutes.\n\nThousands of enthusiastic reports attest to the educational value of these pictures. In many school shops they have become a \"must\" for every new class. They supplement instructional work, reduce personal supervision, and eliminate errors through an effective presentation of lathe operation.\n\nHOW TO SECURE THESE MOTION PICTURES\n\nFree Loan Basis\n\nThe South Bend motion pictures may be borrowed without charge to industrial organizations, vocational schools, colleges, universities, army and navy training schools, industrial apprentice schools, and other technical organizations teaching machine shop practice.\n\nWhen films are supplied on a free loan basis, the organization agrees to pay postage both ways and agrees to handle the films carefully, to return them promptly and intact, and to sign a receipt card which is furnished with the films.\n\nFilms are shipped express collect and may be returned express prepaid or by insured parcel post.

I do not, therefore, recommend this plan. However, a sample of each of these should be enclosed in the book. I would like the separate sheets to be mounted in tablet form of fifty copies - glued edges would very well answer the purpose. This would permit these sheets to be distributed as required by the instructor. I am returning, herewith, the sample sheet of the type to be used.\n\nThe main idea was to have this fairly heavy printed so that the pupils would not strain their eyes as we are aware that this is one of the difficulties that Indian children have. I believe that this type should prove satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. J. Doucet.\n\nEnc.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and\nNatural Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am sending this letter to you, as I don't know whether Mr. Doucet is back in the office yet.\n\nIn working on SECOND YEAR WOODWORK, I find that there seem to be some pages missing. For one thing, there is no Job Sheet 6; the copy I have jumps from Job Sheet 5, \"Table leg mortise and tenon,\" to Job Sheet 7, \"The dowelled joint.\" This may be all right, as I note the Job Sheet numbers have been changed, and No. 6 may have been skipped.\n\nJob Sheet 7 doesn't seem to be complete. The general heading, \"To joint long edges to build up wide surfaces,\" is given, and the sub-heading, \"The dowelled joint.\" The page contains instructions for making the dowelled joint only, but there is no diagram of a dowelled joint. At the bottom of the page there are diagrams of the plain joint, the tongue-and-groove joint, the spline joint, and the way to clamp boards together, but the text does not go on to explain any of these joints. Should there be more material for this project?\n\nJob Sheet 9 describes how to make a table. Under the heading \"Materials\" it says, \"Pine (See blueprint),\" but there is no blueprint or diagram included.\n\nWill you please have someone look into this matter, see if there is any additional material, and send it to me?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. There are a number of references in this second book to WOODWORK PRACTICE AND THEORY. I would appreciate it if you could tell me the author and publisher.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have been hoping that you would have had some word from Mr. Doucet as to the woodworking book. The most important point to be decided is, of course, whether you wish the Stock Bills and Record Sheets to be separate or whether you like my suggestion to have them bound in the book but on perforated sheets so that they may be torn out.\n\nFor technical reasons in manufacturing the books, we should require to have either 16 or 32 pages perforated, but these could be either Stock Bills or Record Sheets. With this letter I am sending you the manuscript as revised by our editor. The editorial work has consisted chiefly of laying the manuscript out page by page, with suitable spacing left for the illustrations. We shall, of course, want Mr. Doucet to read the edited manuscript with the utmost care. You will see that the manuscript is laid out to occupy 31 pages. We can either insert another page somewhere, or else leave page 32 blank, and then give you 32 pages\u2014that is, 16 sheets of paper with a Record Sheet printed on one side and a Stock Bill on the other side. Since there are twelve jobs in the book, you will see that this would leave a small margin to allow for the inevitable spoilings of one or two sheets by the student. These last 16 sheets (32 pages) are the ones which would be perforated.\n\nYou will note that I say the present manuscript runs to 31 pages, which would allow us to add another page. However, if an additional page is to be inserted, it should be done with some care. For example, pages 6 and 7 must face each other because the illustrations on page 6 relate to the job on page 7. By the same token, page 2 should properly face page 3 because there are cross references. It would appear that if an additional page is to be added, it should be towards the end of the manuscript. We are all ready to go ahead with the composition and manufacture of this book just as soon as we get clearance from you.\n\nWe are laying out the second book in much the same way and hope to send it out to you for examination in the next two or three days. We have a number of minor questions to ask Mr. Doucet. These questions are on a separate sheet with the manuscript. Perhaps Mr. Doucet would answer them in the spaces provided on the sheet. We have provided a duplicate copy of this for his file.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[NiR]\n\n[Signature]\nMay 26, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Ingram:\n\nOn my return yours of the 6th instant has been referred to me for attention.\n\nWith reference to the Stock Bills and Record Sheets being bound in the book and put on perforated sheets there appears to be objections to this method. They may be listed as follows:\n\n(1) The principle of having the pupils mutilate the text book is not recommended.\n\n(2) Apparently the Bill of Material would be on one side of the page and the Student Record on the other. This would not fit in very well with the system used.\n\n(3) This text, although partly a workbook is to be used for several years. For obvious reasons, the advanced grades do not write in the workbooks but use them as text books.\n\nPossibly you may have in mind, the use of this book other than in Indian Schools. Should this be the case you may have an arrangement that would answer the purpose better than what I suggested. I would also like to diminish its use for us too much as we will probably be the principle users. This dual purpose is not necessary incompatible. The perforated sheets definitely do not appeal to me. Kindly refer to my letter of April 20th to Mr. Neary. I believe a copy has been sent to you.\nWith reference to page twenty-nine, I am enclosing a Standard Progress Record in which I have made some changes. Probably a note to the pupil at the head of the report would help to understand the process. The note would read something like this:\n\nKeep a record of your progress by completing the columns of this record. In the column READING insert the date on which you have completed reading the process listed. The last line summarizes the scores of the six tests which you have completed. Fill the spaces after each test has been completed.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of the above mentioned letter you have noticed that the tests for the second year are not included in the copy which you have been given. Possibly, you have taken these from a previous copy sent.\n\nThe second year has not been revised. Some errors happened when these were typed. I will send you a revised copy as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Vocational Training.\n\nMr. N.

Neary,\nEducation Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThis letter follows the discussion which we had today regarding the format of the wood-work job sheets which Mr. Doucet sent to us. Since he is out of town, I am following your suggestion and writing to you about this.\n\nWe have given quite a lot of consideration to the format and, as I explained, have two alternative ideas.\n\nIn the first, the sheets would be bound together at the top of the page and reinforced there with a cloth strip. In the second plan, the sheets would be printed on stout paper and inserted in a manilla envelope which would bear suitable printing indicating the content. I am having dummy copies of both of these formats prepared and hope to be able to send them to you tomorrow.\n\nFollowing the first suggestion of binding the books at the top, we estimate the cost at approximately 55\u00a2 for the larger book and approximately 35\u00a2 for the smaller. The second style, using the envelope, would be quite a bit cheaper than this.\n\nI hardly need to assure you that these prices contemplate giving you a first-class job with an attractive page printed in a good, legible type. The size of the page is something to be considered. I am thinking of a page of approximately 8\u00bd x 11 with a ruled border of a single line all around the page, and the type and illustrations set inside this border. This is slightly wasteful as regards space, but I am trying to make these look something like the job sheets which a youngster would actually use in industry. However, I shall not be offended if you tell me that I am altogether wrong in this, because perhaps very few of the Indian children who use these sheets will ever be employed in industry.\n\nIf you will indicate the format which you prefer and the size which you think the pages should be, we will then have some specimen pages put in type and submit these to you for your approval. I have thought of setting the actual job sheets in imitation typewriter type with the headings, et cetera, in a bolder;\nperfectly plain type which would harmonize. Here again, my point is to simulate somewhat the actual sheets which an industrial worker would have.\n\nMr. Doucet, in his letter, indicated that you are running short of the mimeographed copies of these job sheets and that you will either have to re-mimeograph them or have finished books quickly. I find that we can put this work in hand for you quite promptly as soon as you give us the go-ahead signal. I shall be quite happy to go to Ottawa and discuss the matter further with you, or, what might be better still, would be to have Mr. Doucet, if he has any business in Toronto, visit us here where we have all our samples of paper, type, and so on, readily available.\n\nIt was a great pleasure seeing you today and I was glad you were able to have lunch with us.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNGSI/MMS\nJune 29, 1948.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Natural Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMiss Ritchie has been in correspondence with Mr. Doucet about the wood-working book and all the details seem to be settled satisfactorily. The book is now being set in type and we expect to submit a proof to him very shortly. You will be pleased to know that we have permission from the Stanley Tool Company to use certain illustrations which they had on hand. One such illustration is the drawing of a plane. We thought it was much better to get an illustration such as this from an authoritative source rather than have an artist start anew. Other drawings, of course, are being made specially for the book, including all of the plans. The finished book will be 32 pages and we are planning to bind it in a flexible, yet strong Bristol, because we assume that it will be subjected to hard usage. I suggested earlier that we bind this book at the top so that it would open like a stenographers' note-book, but I understand that this was not acceptable to you and Mr. Doucet; so we are planning to bind it in regular form at the left-hand side.\n\nI suggested to you in an earlier letter a price of 55\u00a2 for this book and I shall be glad to have you confirm it if this is satisfactory to you.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNORMAN G.

Arnell, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nEarly in 1947 we wrote two letters to former Indian Commissioner MacKay regarding the possibility of increasing the allowances for salaries of manual training teachers in British Columbia schools.\n\nWe realize that the amounts we have been allowing for this purpose in the past have not been sufficient if we hope to have reasonably well qualified manual training teachers. We did not receive any specific recommendation in the matter from Major MacKay.\n\nThe matter has again been brought to our attention today when we received a letter from Reverend J.W. Hennessy, O.M.I., principal of the St. Mary's Mission Residential School stating that he is engaging a manual training teacher who appears to have good qualifications. Father Hennessy intends to pay him $175.00 a month and requests us to allow $100.00 of this amount.\n\nWe are quite prepared to do so, but before making a final decision we would like to have the reaction of Inspector Davey and yourself as if we increase the amount of our grant towards the salary of the manual training instructor at St. Mary's Mission Residential School, we will likely receive similar applications from other residential schools in British Columbia. Of course, any increase would depend on the qualifications of the manual training teacher employed.\n\nAn immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F.

Day, Caughnawaga Quebec.\n\nDate 21 July 1948.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE COMMISSIONER\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential School,\nManual Training Instructor\n\nI refer to the letter of Superintendent Moore, dated August 2nd, concerning the above-mentioned school.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Moore has suggested a salary grant of $125.00 per month for this purpose. It seems rather large, considering the fact that the enrolment at this school is only 100 pupils and that probably not more than six to ten hours of the Instructor's time would be taken up with manual training classes. It is assumed that the remainder of his time would be occupied in doing maintenance work and other duties about the school which would normally be borne by the per capita grant.\n\nFrom time to time, requests for increases in the grants towards manual training instructors' salaries pass through this office, and I believe that the time has come for a definite policy to be established with respect to the amount of the grant which would be paid by the Department for this purpose.\n\nI suggest, therefore, that a schedule of grants should be drawn up in the light of the factors of school enrolment and the instructors' qualifications. I would also suggest a maximum grant of $100.00 per month be set for schools having an enrolment of 100 or less. At schools where the enrolment is over 225, the grant...\nshould be paid on the basis of the instructors' qualifications and in accordance with the salary schedule already in use for our Day Schools.\n\nIn the case of the Kuper Island Residential School, I am prepared to recommend a grant of $100.00, providing the instructor is suitably qualified.\n\nR. F. Davey\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nPlease find attached, in duplicate, a copy of a letter received from Rev. Father Camirand, re Manual Training Instructor at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nI take it from the Rev. Principal's letter that he is asking that the salary for the Manual Training Instructor be increased considerably and, while he has not said so in his letter, I recall him telling me verbally that one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month would be the minimum amount required.\n\nKindly refer this matter to the Department and advise at your convenience.\n\nR.

C.,\nAugust 2, 1943.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nJuly 15/48\n\nManual Training Teacher - Salary.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department is exacting more qualifications from the Manual Training Teacher, as evidenced by the form of application for this position, which has to be completed and forwarded, in September, I beg to state that the salary of the Instructor will have to be doubled, considering that it has been up to the present, maintained at $50.00 per month, and that no instructor, with the qualifications needed, can possibly be attracted at that rate.\n\nThe manual training Instructor who has been responsible for this position in the past, is qualified in many respects and particularly experienced in handling boys, while at work having done this for some twenty years, but has no experience in handling physical training and games for boys, as he is crippled and has never received any training in this regard. The same also holds no certificates.\n\nTo enlist the service of a Manual Training Teacher, who would be fully qualified and hold certificates, and particularly would be satisfied in segregate himself on an Island, would require a salary that would compensate in all respects.\n\n(Signed) \"J.

You will note Mr. Davey suggests a maximum grant of $100 a month for schools having an enrolment of 100 or less and a grant on the basis of the instructor's qualifications and in accordance with the salary schedule in use for our day schools for the schools where the enrolment is over 25.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCOLONEL NEARY.\n\nThese are a workbook and text to be used in teaching Manual Training.

They, in turn, have been able to get illustrations from the Stanley Tool Company and have had the other drawings made. The finished book will be 32 pages and will be bound in a flexible strong bristol board. It will be bound in regular form at the left hand side so that the lessons will be easily accessible to the students using the book.\n\nAt the present time there is not a simple woodworking manual on the Canadian market and it is intended that this book will be sold for use in other schools. The price will be 55 cents and I estimate that we will require approximately five thousand copies over a period of the next five years.\n\nI would recommend that you give your approval for the publishing of this book. As indicated above, orders for stocks will of course be placed in the usual manner through the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. This is the second book which Mr. Doucet has prepared; the other being \"The Beaver and the Muskrat\", also published by Ginn and Company.

Without interest the girls do not do their work well nor will they be interested in repeating the work in their homes later. So that the girls may get the most out of their training in the kitchen you must present meal preparation as a whole.\n\nIt is much easier for us to plan a menu and tell each girl her duties but that is not the purpose of kitchen training. She might never realize that she would have to combine all these duties to prepare meals in her own home. Only with practice and assistance from us is the girl going to be able to adapt her training to her specific home conditions. If we take time to train the girls to plan the menus and work out the duties of others, she will see meal preparation as a whole. This can be done by having the senior girl as kitchen supervisor for a period of two weeks or longer. During this time she would prepare the menus with your assistance and develop a work plan for the other kitchen workers. So that this duty would not prove too strenuous or foreign to them, and at the same time develop an interest, it is advisable to take each day's menu as planned and discussed with the group. Explain the good and bad points of it and why it is necessary to serve certain foods. The girls will show eagerness to learn and it will give them a background for preparing meals when they return home.\n\nOften any deviation from our present method of operating our kitchens seems too much. However, if we look at the future we will see where a little extra effort today might improve the method of our kitchen operation tomorrow, send the girls out to their homes better equipped, and ease the burden on our own shoulders.\n\nBulletin No.30\nFebruary 28th, 1949.\n\nYour File 1-1-11 (E2)\n\nMr. Bernard F.

The construction of the legs will, in general, be as per the clipping with the exception that the legs will be removable for shipment and fastened to the table in a manner similar to the classroom activity tables presently being manufactured.\n\n4. Our price, f.o.b. Kingston Penitentiary, Sales Tax and crating extra, is $34.20 each.\n\n5. If the table drawers are to be supplied with locks as per the cut, the price will be, including 4 locks, $41.00 each, f.o.b. Kingston, Sales Tax and crating extra.\n\n6.

Rice\nSuperintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration.\nApril 18, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nReport on Vocational Education\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nFor many years Manual Training in Residential Schools had been carried on mostly as a time-consuming activity, with little thought being devoted to its educational possibilities. Playrooms in these schools were generally very inadequate as far as size and equipment, but children after classroom periods had to be kept busy. To do this girls were taught to do knitting and fancy work and boys were given coping saws to make toys and bird houses. Some of the older girls were needed for laundry, housekeeping, kitchen work and to mend the younger children's clothes. The older boys were needed for repair work, to assist with the dairy activities or to perform other farm operations. As many of these chores were done through necessity, in general very little educational value was obtained from them.\n\nIn order to obtain educational value from the various activities to which the student must participate a method of awards was introduced. This is known as the \"proficiency badge system\". A badge is provided for eleven activities; see Appendix A. A definite number of the basic operations are required to earn these badges. (Appendix A1) In order to encourage the pupils of various ages and abilities the badges are divided into three steps referred to as first, second and third year. Pupils who become proficient in these basic operations and earn a sufficient number of badges are awarded a silver brooch or class pin.\n\nThe philosophy behind these awards is to make every activity of the child meaningful and at the same time a part of the educational process. Every activity of the child in residence should have an educational value. This system was received with a great deal of enthusiasm at the beginning and is still operating in a commendable manner. However, the lack of supervision and encouragement has prevented this system from bearing as much fruit as could have been expected. It is gratifying however to note the number of badges that have been awarded. A total of 7,648 badges have been distributed to date. This may be broken up in the following manner:\n\n|                | Girls | Boys | Total |\n|----------------|-------|------|-------|\n| First Year     | 4113  | 977  | 5090  |\n| Second Year    | 1750  | 332  | 2082  |\n| Third Year     | 337   | 11   | 348   |\n| Class Pin      | 122   | 6    | 128   |\n| TOTAL          | 6322  | 1326 | 7648  |\n\nThe above figures mean that approximately 5000 pupils have learned basic operations which they will find very useful in life. The above figures include both residential and day schools.\nIn order to encourage the teaching of this subject in residential schools a special grant towards the payment of the salary is awarded by the Indian Affairs Branch. (Appendix B.) The Department purchases the equipment necessary for this instruction besides allowing a special grant for the purchase of the expendable material. These grants depend on the enrolment for the courses.\n\nDAY SCHOOLS\n\nThe encouragement of Manual Training activities in day schools has been a difficult problem due to the fact that a teacher in a one-room school has so much to do that her efforts have to be restricted primarily to academic subjects. Moreover there are two groups to be handled - the girls and the boys. It is obvious that one teacher cannot handle the girls for sewing and the boys for woodwork at the same time. At some schools the wife of the teacher has taken charge of the girls when the teacher took the boys but there are not very many of these combinations. However, in many rooms where the teacher is familiar with the activity or project method of teaching, he has been able to teach many simple basic operations that should prove useful.\n\nAt our larger day schools it has been possible to provide a teacher who devotes his entire efforts to the teaching of Manual Training and another to the teaching of Domestic Science. It has been rather difficult to obtain Manual Training teachers. Teachers who have taken this training are quite scarce.\n\nAt the end of this report self-explanatory tables are appended in order to give a more complete picture of these activities. It must be remembered, however, that many schools are making a good attempt at teaching this subject but who do not submit regular reports. The activity is due mostly to the enthusiasm and devotedness of the teacher, as the Department does not allow any special remuneration to these.\n\nIn order to help our Manual Training teachers, especially those who have not had an opportunity of receiving training for this form of education, we have prepared lessons that have been edited and bound in books entitled \"First Year Woodwork\" and \"Second Year Woodwork\". \"Third Year Woodwork\" which completes this subject is being prepared. Lessons have also been prepared for first and second year metalwork and for mechanical drawing. Teachers who have used these helps have expressed great satisfaction for them. These booklets are distributed on requisition and it is expected that each child taking the course will have a copy.\n\nThe teaching of Manual Training has been affected greatly by the following:\n\n(1) The impossibility of obtaining fully qualified teachers. However, to encourage this training the Department has divided residential school teachers into three classifications Grades I, II and III. (See Appendix C.)\n\nIt has been possible to obtain several fully qualified Manual Training teachers in our Day schools who come under the classification of teacher, Grade IV.\n(2) The lack of teaching accommodation.\n\nMany of the residential schools had but small shops that were sufficient for repair purposes but were very inadequate for instructional purposes. Many of these schools have been given plans and financial help to enlarge and remodel these shops. Other schools were provided with a small grant to build a shop. In order that this teaching may expand, more shops will have to be provided. The inclusion of these activities in our schools has been one of the factors that has led to a change of spirit among the students in the school and made the school a happier place where children find greater contentment and satisfaction, thereby causing the truancy problem to rapidly disappear.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Training.\n\nAJD/MCN\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR USE OF PROFICIENCY BADGES.\n\n1. These badges are awarded in three colours\u2014Green for the first year, Red for the second and Blue for the third year respectively.\n\n2. Proficiency Badges, on the facsimile, are numbered. These numbers correspond to the numbers on the \"Basic Operations Required to Obtain Proficiency Badges\" and the same number is inserted by the teacher on \"Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations\". These charts are of corresponding colours as follows:\n\n| Badge | Subject       | Facsimile Chart | Student Record |\n|-------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| #1    | Cooking       | Blue            | Blue          |\n| #2    | Woodwork      | White           | White         |\n| #3    | Housekeeping  | White           | White         |\n| #4    | Knitting      | Rose            | Rose          |\n| #5    | Gardening     | Green           | Green         |\n| #6    | Poultry       | Yellow          | Yellow        |\n| #7    | Sewing        | Rose            | Rose          |\n| #8    | Dairying      | Yellow          | Yellow        |\n| #9    | Metalwork     | Russet          | Russet        |\n| #10   | Weaving       | Rose            | Rose          |\n| #11   | Leatherwork   | Goldenrod       | Goldenrod     |\n\n3. The badges are awarded by the \"Indian Affairs Branch\". A special requisition must be made on a card form provided by the Department.\n\n4. A pupil may be awarded any number of badges provided he has mastered the basic operations required for each badge and provided he has attained the age of 12 years.\n\n5. Teachers should prepare a reading list and keep a record of each pupil's reading. This may advantageously be done by the pupils themselves. (See \"Reading Record Sheet\" for woodwork.) A definite discussion period on the reading should be provided.\n\nYOU HAVE NOW:\n\n1. A facsimile of the eleven badges available;\n2. \"Basic Operations Required to Obtain Proficiency Badges\";\n3. \"Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations\";\n4. Card requisitions for badges;\n5. Instructions for the use of the Proficiency Badge System.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\n1. Frame the facsimile of the badges and hang one in the boys' quarters and one in the girls' quarters.\n2. Post the \"Basic Operations Required to Obtain Proficiency Badges\" near the facilities.\n3. Post the \"Student Record of Mastered Basic Operations\" in a place readily accessible to the students, preferably the class room. Each pupil should rule a sheet for his own record. (See \"Student Record Sheet\" for woodwork). At a definite period, once or twice a week, each pupil calls out his standing: Badge No., Basic Operation No. and standing A, B or C. The teacher enters these on the class student record. The teacher should take advantage of this period for a general discussion.\n\nThe eleven badges so far provided do not comprise all the training that may be given to Indian children. Badges may be added from time to time. Comments and suggestions from principals and teachers will be appreciated.\n\nB. F. NEARY\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of W.

They should also be able to handle young people.\n\nGrade II $100.00 per month for ten months.\nWhile this group need not be certificated, teachers applying for this grade must have followed courses for the teaching of Manual Training at some school satisfactory to the Department. They should have practical experience and should be able to handle young people, in the shop as well as on the playground.\n\nGrade III $150.00 per month for ten months.\nThe teachers in this group should hold a Manual Training certificate issued by a school acceptable to the Department. They should also be able to handle young people in the shop and on the playground.\n\nIt will noted that the Department desires more organized play in its Residential Schools. Some schools have this activity well organized already, others are sadly lax in this respect. The Department strongly disapproves the method allowing the children to roam around during their spare time with nothing definite to do. The reason for this is obvious.\n\nThe school is expected, as its contribution towards this training, to furnish board and lodging and any additional salary above amount allowed by Department.\n\nThe school must follow the programme outlined by the Department, and furnish the Indian Affairs Branch with a schedule of the time allotted to this training.\n\nA monthly voucher for the payment of the Instructor should be submitted through the office of the Superintendent of the Indian Agency. This voucher should be accompanied by a monthly report on the training accomplished. No salary will be paid unless this regulation is adhered to.\n\nBernard F.

In general they have proved very satisfactory but I wish to draw your attention to the following two facts:\n\nAt Caughnawaga seven tables were installed. Among these seven tables two of them were approximately 1\" lower than the others. This will probably be easily remedied by the use of silent domes on the tables that are too low.\n\nThe second fact is that in sandpapering the molding that was placed on the contour, the surface of the black masonite has been somewhat damaged by removing the finished surface. I feel certain that with a little care these two defects could very easily be remedied.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J.

Neary, Superintendent\nEducation Service\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Manufacture of Shop Work Benches\n\nIn reply to your request for a quotation on the manufacture of a Shop Work Bench for use by your Department, we are pleased to quote a manufactured price of $27.58 each, F.O.B. Kingston Penitentiary, Sales Tax and crating extra. This price does not include the bench vise nor the bench stop, but it does include the cost of labour necessary to attach and install these items.\n\nThe bench will be manufactured in accordance with Canadian Penitentiaries Drawing No. D-1011, 2 copies of which are enclosed.\n\nOur Departmental Purchasing Agent has obtained prices on various woodworking vises and bench stops. We request that you review the enclosed clippings and select the vise and stop most suitable to your use and add this amount to the above quotation to arrive at the actual cost per bench.\n\nTrusting we may be of assistance in supplying your requirements,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. J.A. McLaughlin,\nAssistant Commissioner.\nNovember 26th, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nCanada.\n\nAttention: Mr. A. J. Doucet, Supervisor\nof Vocational Education.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet -\n\nWe are pleased that by your letter of November 4th you have requested one of our Handicraft catalogues \u2014 this went forward under separate cover and you will undoubtedly have received it prior to this letter.\n\nWe hope to make our handicraft catalogue as explicit as possible for those who wish to order from it. We do feel however, that in your particular case, we would like to make some special remarks regarding the services which we are prepared to offer to the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nWhile we have not to date been privileged to supply the Department of Mines and Resources in many parts of Canada, considerable handicraft supply material has gone out to the Northern parts of B.C., and into the Yukon and from reports by the Vocational teachers in these outposts, our services have been much appreciated.\n\nRealizing that the Department of Indian Affairs is extensive and that should a broad policy of introduction of handicrafts into different outposts be considered, the business resulting would be valuable and we are most anxious to prove our worthiness of your support!\n\nIf you will be so kind as to leaf through our catalogue you will note that under \"Bedford Services\" we offer to handicraft groups, schools and hospitals, the privilege of sending to us for displays of made-up articles to be used both for inspiration for them on the verge of taking up handicraft work and to be used also as models from which to work. Where a 16 Millimeter projector is available our film The Art of Leather Carving will be sent out on loan to those interested. It would be only fair to say that in regards to this film, the demand for it is great, and requests for loan of it should be made well in advance of its showing.\n\n....../2\n\nAIRMAIL\nWe offer also a Craft Consultant service whereby an instructor in a school or hospital may write to us for any information pertinent to the handicrafts which we carry. We will send a bulletin on the organization of handicraft groups and clubs. All orders by your Department will be subject to a 10% courtesy deduction.\n\nSo much for the services \u2014 some other particular features which might be of genuine interest especially to those with little previous experience in Leathercraft, is our Project Kits shown on pages 12 to 16. These Project Kits represent a tremendous saving in time, in bookkeeping and since they contain patterns, designs and all requisite material, they are in a sense a Leathercraft instruction course in themselves.\n\nOur leathers, tools, fittings and all materials requisit to carrying on Leathercraft work are of the very finest! We consider quality the prime requisit to the building of our handicraft service, equalled by none in Canada!\n\nWith these few words of introduction beyond the actual catalogue forwarded to you, the writer hopes that you will consider us seriously as a source of supply for your different outposts and we will be more than pleased to forward upon request, catalogues wherever you might suggest. We are here to be of service to you. May we help you?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBEDFORD FINE LEATHERS LTD.\n\nP. S. Farrar,\nGen.

Also the life of a school desk cannot be greater than the life of the hinge. In the development of the New Globe Automatic our energy was directed toward the elimination of faults in the Hinge.\n\nOUR SUCCESS IS COMPLETE\n\nWe sincerely believe that the Hinge in the New Automatic is the strongest Automatic Seat Hinge ever invented and comes nearer to being noiseless than any other now on the market.\n\nAbsolute noiselessness can only be secured by the use of rubber or leather buffers, or springs and when such parts are used it is only a question of time till they become worn or dislodged and must then be replaced or the desk is too noisy for further use.\n\nThose who have had experience in getting repairs for school desks know how difficult and unsatisfactory it is, and, therefore, the desk that will wear the longest without needing repairs is the most valuable one to the school.\n\nThere are fewer parts in the Hinge of the New Globe than are found in any other School Desk Hinge on the market. This alone reduces the possibility of its getting out of order.\n\nIt does not depend on lumps or rubber, leather or other material, nor on springs of any kind for its noiseless action.\n\nThe steel balls used in the Hinge are one-half inch in diameter, being twice as large as those used by any other manufacturer, thus giving greater wear resisting qualities.\n\nThe balls in the Hinge of the New Globe ARE NOT held in position by means of springs, because when such is the case the spring will in time lose its tension allowing the balls to get out of their proper position, or drop out entirely.\n\nIn the Hinge of the New Globe the steel balls absorb the friction and bear no wearing contact of iron against iron. In every other so-called Ball Bearing Desk there is a wearing contact of iron against iron.\n\nThe accompanying illustration, Fig. 1, will give you a fairly accurate understanding of the great simplicity of the Hinge and also show you that \"P\" is the Seat Arm. \"B\" shows a portion of the Desk Leg or Casting. When the Seat Arm is in its place, the Ball \"P\" fits into the socket \"Q.\" The Shoulder \"R\" on \"A\" rests in Groove \"S\" on \"B\" when the seat is raised or lowered. Ball \"P\" runs in socket \"R\" and runs along the inside of the Casting \"B\" at \"S,\" between \"J\" and \"K.\" The Casting grows gradually thicker as it nears the point \"K,\" so that the Ball runs less easily as it approaches the lower end. This brings the seat to a gradual stop without jar or noise. When the seat is lowered the ball rolls towards \"J,\" where the casting is also thicker. The seat comes to a gradual stop in the same way and for the same reason as when it is raised.\n\nThe office of the Bolt \"F\" and the Cap \"D\" is merely to hold the parts together. The bolt passes through the Seat Arm \"A\" in Slot \"G\" and through Casting \"B\" at \"H.\" The notch \"E\" Casting \"D,\" is placed over the Slot \"G\" on \"B\" to prevent \"D's\" turning with the Seat Arm.\n\nThe Lugs \"L,\" \"M\" and \"N\" prevent the Seat from raising or lowering beyond the proper position and also carry a part of the weight of the pupil, thus relieving the working parts of some of the strain.\nNew Globe\nAdjustable Automatic Desks\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014ADJUSTABLE\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 or A | 3 or B | 5 or C |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Size of Top  | 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 16 | 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 14 | 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 12 |\n| Size of Book Box Inside | 22 x 11 | 19 x 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 16 x 8 |\n| Range of Desk Adjustment | 26\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 32\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 27\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 19\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 24\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Range of Seat Adjustment | 13 to 18 | 11 to 15\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 9 to 13 |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 25 to 27 | 22 to 25 |\n| Ages Accommodated | 10 up | 6 to 11 | 4 to 7 |\n\nEvery part of our New Globe Automatic and New Globe Automatic Adjustable Desks is made of the very best material procurable of their respective kind. The construction is solid and durable. Woods finished in our special school desk hard oil varnish. Castings finished in black japan, thoroughly baked. Woods are of selected hardwood, kiln dried and seasoned, all joints are dovetailed and glued. Regularly finished rich cherry color or natural back and seat with cherry top.\n\nWhen ordering specify Color wanted\n\nOur desks are easily and quickly put together, set up and adjusted.\n\nFASTENING WOOD PARTS TO STANDARDS\n\nOur method of fastening top, back and seat to the iron is one of the most important features of our desk. The iron and wood is fitted together, so that the two parts interlock the full length of the contact of wood and metal, thus giving a holding power not obtained in any other way.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014STATIONARY\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Length of Single Desk | 24 | 24 | 21 | 21 | 18 | 18 |\n| Length of Double Desk | 40 | 40 | 38 | 38 | 36 | 36 |\n| Height of Seat from floor at highest point | 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 16 | 14\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 11 |\n| Width of Top of Desk | 16 | 16 | 14 | 14 | 12 | 12 |\n| Height of Top from floor at highest point | 30 | 28\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 26\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 24\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 23 | 21\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 27 to 29 | 25 to 27 | 24 to 26 | 23 to 25 | 21 to 23 |\n| Age of Pupil Accommodated | Adults | 16-20 | 12-18 | 9-14 | 6-10 | 5-8 |\nSUMMARY OF THE REASONS WHY OUR SCHOOL FURNITURE PRICES ARE LOWER THAN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS:\n\n(1) \u2014 We sell by mail only; no travelling expenses, no travellers' salary or commission added to our cost.\n\n(2) \u2014 Overhead Expenses reduced to a minimum.\n\n(3) \u2014 We are Manufacturer's Agents\u2014not Middlemen.

The bolt passes through the Seat \"O,\" the Seat \"G\" and through Casting \"B\" at \"H.\" The notch \"I\" in Casting \"D\" is placed over the Lug \"C\" on \"B\" to prevent \"D's\" turning with the Seat Arm.\n\nThe Lugs \"I,\" \"M\" and \"N\" prevent the Seat from raising or lowering beyond the proper position and also carry a part of the weight of the pupil, thus relieving the working parts of some of the strain.\nNew Globe Adjustable Automatic Desks\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014ADJUSTABLE\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 or A | 3 or B | 5 or C |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Size of Top  | 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 16 | 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 14 | 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 12 |\n| Size of Book Box Inside | 22 x 11 | 19 x 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 16 x 8 |\n| Range of Desk Adjustment | 26\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) to 32\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 22\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) to 29\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 19\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) to 24\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) |\n| Range of Seat Adjustment | 13 to 18 | 11 to 15\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | 9 to 13 |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 25 to 27 | 22 to 25 |\n| Ages Accommodated | 10 up | 6 to 11 | 4 to 7 |\n\nEvery part of our New Globe Automatic and New Globe Automatic Adjustable Desks is made of only the best material procurable of their respective kind.

Current expense is met from the per capita grant paid by this Department to the principals of the institutions. Nearly all the residential schools are managed by the various churches interested in the work. The principal pays for supplies with a school cheque or a cheque from the missionary society to which we give the grant. Occasionally the per capita earnings are supplemented by church funds.\n\nAlthough payment to the firm supplying the article is not made direct from Ottawa, the funds are largely provided by the Federal Government. Certain church authorities have requested that Indian residential school purchases be exempt from the Sales Tax, and I would be grateful for your consideration and ruling.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C.

If the establishment of these schools is not covered by any statute, will you please state whether these schools are under the absolute control of the Dominion Government, and whether or not they constitute separate bodies corporate.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nL/ELS.\nOttawa, Jan. 13, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Farrow:\n\nI have your No. S.T. of the 10th instant, relative to Sales Tax applicable on purchases made by the principals of Indian residential schools. These institutions are established under Statute known as The Indian Act, Section 9 of which reads in part: \"The Governor General in Council may establish industrial or boarding schools for the Indian children of any reserve or reserves or any district or territory designated by the Superintendent General.\"\n\nI am applying for exemption from the Sales Tax for only those schools owned and financed by this Department. Certain Indian residential schools are the property of a Church Missionary Society or Order and, as such, might constitute separate bodies corporate. However, those institutions erected and maintained by parliamentary appropriation are under the absolute control of the Dominion Government, and it is for these that I am asking your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. R. Farrow, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Customs & Excise,\nConnaught Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Purchasing Commission of Canada has recently ruled that requisitions in future for all purchases exceeding $100.00 are to be submitted to it before action is taken, except in emergency cases when time will not permit of doing so. Such cases, however, should be rare, as generally, requirements can and should be foreseen, and the regulations complied with. When such purchases have to be made all possible competition should be obtained and full records kept of those who were asked to quote; also their replies. This information together with a proper description of articles on which prices were obtained to be submitted with the accounts.\n\nIt must be understood that Canadian made goods are to be purchased where possible and the lowest tenders are to be accepted. When the lowest tender is not accepted, a full explanation should be made.\n\nWhen a requisition is referred to the Department for authority to purchase and a list of names from whom to call for tenders, a full description of the article or goods required should be given, and if possible, a catalogue reference as a guide to those tendering. Requisitions should always give the name of the nearest City, Town, or Village, to the Reserve where it is proposed making the purchases.\n\nAn abstract, in duplicate, of all Tenders received should accompany all accounts.\n\nThese regulations will not apply to authorized purchases, the account for which does not exceed $100.00, which may be made without further reference to the Department, after obtaining competitive prices, but to such an account an abstract in duplicate of the tenders received should be attached for the information of the Purchasing Commission, to whom all accounts for are submitted before payment can be made.\n\nCompetitive prices need not be obtained for purchases the value of which do not exceed $15.00 but the account should bear a certificate to the effect that the purchases have been made to the best possible advantage and that the prices are fair and reasonable. It is the desire of the Purchasing Commission that this business shall be divided as much as possible and when there is more than one store in the Town where the purchases are made. That is meant by this is, that should you be purchase one week at a certain store in the Town where you do business, the next purchase should be made at another store, if the goods can be purchased to advantage. In this way the Government business will be equally divided amongst interested Merchants throughout the year. The accounts for these as well as all other purchases should be forwarded in duplicates, direct to the Department monthly, and not allowed to accumulate for months.\n\nPurchases of Live Stock and Seed Grain are exempt from these regulations; also purchases of Beef, Hay, and Food, when made from Indians.\n\nThese\nThese regulations cover all purchases made by any officials of the Department whether on behalf of the Department or for Indians and irrespective of the Fund from which payment is to be made.\n\nYou are therefore required to carefully observe these regulations and acknowledge receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nTHE PURCHASING COMMISSION OF CANADA\n\nOttawa, January 10th, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 27th ultimo, and our discussion yesterday afternoon with your Mr. Paget, relative to purchases in general for your Department, when certain changes were agreed to.\n\nI am directed to advise that the following regulations cancel all previous ones issued to your Department, and now in force:\n\nSection 1 - All requisitions to be referred to this Commission before any action is taken. Exceptions to be made for purchases under $100.00 in value, and up to $500.00 if time does not permit of referring the matter to Ottawa.\n\nSub-Section (a) - When purchases are made without first having secured authority, all possible competition should be obtained. Full records kept of those who were asked to quote and their replies. This information, together with a proper description of articles on which prices were obtained, to be submitted with the invoices.\n\nSub-Section (b) - It must be understood that Canadian made goods are to be purchased where possible, and that the lowest tenders are to be accepted. When the lowest tender is not accepted a full explanation should be made.\n\nSection 2 - When a requisition is referred to Ottawa for authority to purchase and a list of names from whom to call tenders, a full description of the article or goods required should be given, and if possible a catalogue reference as a guide to those tendering.\n\nSection 3 - In connection with the purchases for Indians, who are your Wards, or where expenditures are made from Trust Funds on account of the Indians, these purchases are to be treated in the same manner as any other purchases made by your Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) W.B.

Slater Co., Limited, Hamilton, are manufactured of the highest grade material by expert Canadian workmen with particular care so that they meet the most exacting requirements of the finest Canadian Schools and institutions.\nThe jaws are wood faced and these wood faces extend 1/4\" up from the iron face just level with the top of the table. Each vise is provided with a wooden plug, which can be moved up or lowered at will. Vises can be supplied with quick action if desired at a small additional cost.\n\nThe bench top measures 44\" x 24\" x 30\" high, and twenty-four benches as well as the Instructor's Desk can be placed in a room 25 x 40' without undue crowding.\n\nThe enclosed folder illustrates the bench as described above, and also shows a Manual Training Room equipped with the Prince of Wales Manual Training Benches.\n\nWe would be pleased to quote you on your requirements in these benches, and we can assure you that if favored with your order that you will be well pleased with your investment.\n\nThis bench is Canadian made throughout by a Canadian Company.\n\nAwaiting your reply, and hoping that we may have the opportunity of welcoming you to the Slater family of satisfied customers, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.

Scott, Deputy Supt.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nDominion Gov't.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nUp to the present time the majority of Manual Training Benches have been imported from the States. During the past year we have been doing a lot of investigating in connection with these benches and we have produced a bench that will stand any amount of rough usage and save you money owing to their being built right in all particulars. We list below a few of the details, which may be interesting to you when you wish to specify Benches for your Manual Training Rooms.\n\nThe Prince of Wales Technical Benches are built with heavy angle iron legs rivetted and bolted together, making them thoroughly rigid and practically indestructible.\n\nTOPS - The tops are made from clear maple, and are assembled with the Linderman joint, which makes the top about as strong as a solid piece of wood. A series of six square holes are provided for a wooden plug for use in connection with the wooden plug in the vise. A handy tool rack is also provided at the rear face of the bench. This rack has five holes for chisels, files, square, etc., and one square hole for marking gauge, one oblong hole for the saw. The drop board at the back, which is fastened in place with bolts acts as a shield (Safety first) to protect the worker at the bench ahead from injury on the edge tools. The well in the rear section is edged with bevel strips so as to enable the worker to clean shavings away quickly. Not a screw or bolt head is visible on the bench tops, which prevents injury to the tools.\n\nVISES - Two vises are mounted on each bench. These vises have a double pitch screw and one complete turn of the handle moves the jaws one half inch. These vises are made from iron, the iron jaws being dropped 1/4\" from the top of the bench.\nCanada Foundries & Forgings Limited\n\nBrockville, Ont.\n16th May, 1923.\n\nChas. Stewart, Esq.,\nSupt.
