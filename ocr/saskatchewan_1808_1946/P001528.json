That your Memorialists are the proprietors of what is commonly known as the Bell Farm,\nin the North West Territories.\n\n2. That your Memorialists have carried on Farming in the said Territories on a very extensive\nscale, and had invested in their operations up to the Spring of 1885 over half a million of dollars.\n\n3. That your Memorialists, during the Season of 1884, caused to be prepared for cropping the\nfollowing Spring, upwards of Eight Thousand Acres of Land, in wheat chiefly, at a cost of $19,727 94,\nan average per acre of $2 37.\n\n4. That all preparations had been made during the Winter in providing the necessary Seed, and\nprocuring at a large outlay the additional implements necessary to enable your Memorialists to\ncommence operations so soon as the season had sufficiently advanced, and seed the entire area so\nprepared.\n\n5. That on the breaking out of the Rebellion in the North West, the greater part of the motive\nforce of your Memorialists, in Horses, Wagons and Men, were drawn off by the General in Command\nof the Forces, to do duty in assisting the movement of troops to the front.\n\n6. That owing to the crippled condition in which your Memorialists were left through such\nwithdrawal, the management were able to seed, during the seeding season, a small portion only, of\nthe lands so made ready, and, with every exertion, were able to cultivate properly only 1000 acres of\ntheir lands, while the additional implements purchased and the greater portion of their large stock on\nhand were forced to remain unused.\n\n7. In consequence of such non use the area of 7,300 acres, or so much thereof as could be\novertaken, had again to be plowed and harrowed for the coming year.\n\n8. Your Memorialists, therefore, not only lost the cost of the preparations of the previous year,\nand the profits naturally arising from its crop, but owing to the prolongation of hostilities and continued\nabsence of their staff, were unable during the season just passed to till the quantity of land which under\nother circumstances they would have done, in readiness for the year 1886.\n9. The Bell Farm has become widely known as a very important factor in the development of the North-West, and the effect of so many of their fields going to waste in 1885\u2014considered by your Memorialists and the public generally as the crucial year of its existence\u2014was not only a direct loss to your Memorialists, but jeopardized the credit of the Company to an alarming degree, compelling them to strain their resources to the utmost to pass through what otherwise would have proven a profitable season.\n\n10. Your Memorialists also respectfully state that the assistance rendered throughout the crisis in the North-West by the staff and material of the Bell Farm, more notably at the commencement of the troubles, was loyal and of incalculable service to the General in Command, enabling him to move with much greater rapidity than otherwise\u2014without such a staff to draw upon\u2014he could have done.\n\n11. Your Memorialists feel, and they believe justly, that under these circumstances their claim to compensation from the Government for the losses they have sustained should be favorably entertained.\n\n12. It may be urged at first sight that as a partial set off to these losses may be placed the sums received by your Memorialists in compensation for the work done in the transport service, but your Memorialists would point out that these earnings were minimized\u2014(a) by the large sum paid their men in extra wages; (b) the heavy loss to their live stock through horses killed, maimed and rendered useless through casualties and exposure, and the extra wear and tear of wagons and harness; (c) the very great reductions made by the Commissioners on War Claims; (d) the serious straits in which the Company were placed through loss of credit; (e) the interest paid on capital not fully employed, and the entire loss of dividend and consequent disappointment of shareholders; (f) the very serious curtailment of their operations for the season of 1886, and general derangement of well settled plans; (g) the necessarily increased expenditure consequent on the attempt to overtake as far as possible the ground lost the preceding year; and (h) lastly the large number of acres which through non-cultivation have returned to their natural state.\n\n13. Your Memorialists respectfully present in a Schedule hereto affixed a fair representation of the direct losses incurred by them, as aforesaid, in addition to those set forth in the preceding paragraph.\n\nAnd your Memorialists respectfully submit\u2014\n\n(a) That after deducting from the cost of preparing the gross acreage the proportion for the acreage employed, viz.: $2,377, they are entitled to compensation for the balance, that is to say, to $17,350.94, and interest thereon for one year at the rate most favorable in the North-West, eight per cent, $1,388.07.\n\n(b) That your Memorialists are entitled to compensation for the fair measure of net loss sustained through non-cultivation of their land, the particulars of which are fully set forth in the said Schedule, amounting to $38,690, making a total claim of $57,429.01.\n\n(c) Your Memorialists therefore respectfully ask your consideration thereto and pray for the payment of the claim presented.\n\nAnd your Memorialists, &c.\n\n(Signed)\u2014W.

EBERTS,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nThe Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Co., Limited.\n\n(Dated)\u2014WINNIPEG, MANITOBA,\nFebruary 26th, 1886.\n\nThe foregoing is the Memorial marked B referred to in the declaration of W.
