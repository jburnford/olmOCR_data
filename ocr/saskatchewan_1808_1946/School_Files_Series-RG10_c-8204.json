I am now in receipt of the attached statements from the Public Printing and Stationery Branch with regard to the articles that have been shipped. They forwarded these addressed \"The Teacher\" but they have been returned. We overlooked advising them that we have not yet secured a teacher for this school and presumably the supplies are at Byng Inlet. It would be appreciated if you would accept delivery of the parcel and keep it at your office until a teacher is secured. If we do not obtain a teacher within the next month or so, you can open the parcel and return to this office the Corona Readers. The other supplies may be distributed among the other schools in your agency. As soon as you have checked the parcel you should sign the attached advices from the Stationery Office and return them to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-8-4.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th Inst. with reference to supplies for the Magnetawan Indian Day School.

Mr. Wood informs me that with the help of the Indians, he can complete the whole, in six weeks.

The moneys paid to workmen, up to date, are as follows:\n\n| Week ending | April 26 | May 2 | May 10 | May 17 |\n|-------------|----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Amount      | $75.00   | $117.00 | $139.75 | $134.50 |\n\nThis makes a total of $469.25, leaving me a balance of $30.75.\n\nI expect that the building will be finished within 10 days and would respectfully request that the Dept. forward $175.00 to enable me to meet the remainder of the payments of wages to these men.\n\nI beg to state that the band are very well pleased with the building, and the progress so far, has been very satisfactory. I am satisfied that the Dept. is getting value for the money spent in the building of the school at Maganetawan. I might say that a bell is needed for the school, so will the Dept. please send me one or else instruct me how I should get one.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nAgent.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise the Dept. that the ages of the children who will be going to the Maganetawan school are as follows:\n\n15 children 10 years and under.\n15 2 \" 11 \" over to 16 years.\n\nI would be pleased if the desks would be ordered as soon as possible to suit these ages. Most of the children were never at school before. Some of them are half-breeds, and I am told that there are some white children, whom their parents would like to send to our school, such as the station master's children, at Byng Inlet. I presume that there will be a fee for such children. Would the Dept. please say if they will allow this, and if so, how much the fee would be per quarter.\n\nThe Band does not object to the white children coming to their school. I approve of it, as I have seen the children, and there is no chance of them getting schooling unless we allow them to come to our school.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6141, File 404-5, part 1)\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the desks required for the new school building on the Maganeetawan Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before an order is placed further information is required. School desks are manufactured in the following sizes, viz:\n\nNo. 6 - Pupils 5 to 8 years,\nNo. 5 - 6 to 10\",\nNo. 4 - 9 to 14\",\nNo. 3 - 12 to 16\".\n\nPlease state the number of rows it is intended to set up in the classroom. If the desks are arranged in 4 rows, I would suggest that the following seating arrangement be carried out, viz: 4 fronts No. 6 and 4 single desks No. 6; 8 single desks No. 5; 12 single desks No. 4; 4 single desks No. 3 and 4 rear seats No. 3. This would provide seating accommodation for 32 pupils seating 8 to each row of desks. If this is more desks than required, please state the number you would advise be furnished and how they will be arranged, also give full shipping directions.\n\nBesides the school desks, we will supply a teacher's desk and chair and two visitors' chairs.\n\nPlease state whether a cupboard is required, or if you will arrange to have a suitable cupboard built in the classroom in which to store books and school material. It is considered that it might be cheaper to have this done than to purchase a cupboard.\n\nYou should also furnish the dimensions of the blackboard required. We now supply beaverplate blackboards today schools. This is manufactured in widths of 3', 3\u00bd' and 4', and up to 12' in length.\n\nAs soon as the above information is received, an order will be placed for the desks, etc.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication regarding the admission of white children and the fees that will be charged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6141, File 404-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of 23rd, 22-8-5, re school desks and blackboard for the Maganetawan school, I beg to state that your suggestion of desks would appear to be the correct thing for this school. The number of desks required at present as far as I can see is about thirty, but there are a few children who are about school age and your finding some to suit the situation perfectly. The space allotted for blackboards is 16 ft., and if we could get it all income so much the better, if not, whatever way is suitable will be made to suit.\n\nI am having a cupboard built as it will be so much cheaper than to buy one. I think that it will save money by having the desks sent put up as the foreman carpenter will be through this week, and none of the Indians are over-smart at putting them up.\n\nI am a little disappointed at the progress last week, but on the whole, I think I'm getting value for the money being spent.\n\nThe Indian labour is very slow as the building is progressing they are so pleased, the foreman tells me they would like to stop every ten minutes and admire their work. When I estimated, I estimated for a rush job. On the whole perhaps I expect too much. One thing I can assure the Dept., it will be a nice little school and the best value for the money in this part of the country. I would have liked a storm porch on the main building but perhaps later on I will be able to get an appropriation for this porch.\n\nHave all desks and other supplies shipped to Byng Inlet to Samuel Noganosh (Chief) of the Maganetawan Band. It makes them feel good to have it done that way and they take a greater interest in the work. I will have to have the supplies carted onto the reserve, which will cost a little more. The road is very rough and they will have to make quite a few trips. However, rest assured I will keep the cost down as much as possible.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the approval of the Dept.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

An order will also be placed with the Government Stationery Office to supply 1 - 16' green hyloplate blackboard, 4' wide, with the necessary chalk trough and moulding. When shipment of the desks is being made, they will be forwarded addressed to the Chief, as requested by you. As it is not intended that the school will open until on or about September 1st, next, it is hoped that all furnishings and supplies will be in place before that date.\n\nHave any arrangements been made for the providing of closets and for the storage of fuel? If not, would you recommend that the same be erected? It is preferred that separate closets with screened approaches be erected. If it is intended that a woodshed be erected, one building with a closet in either end and a separate apartment for fuel in the centre might be suitable. However, we will be pleased to have your recommendation, together with an estimate of the cost of any work which you would recommend be undertaken.\n\nRegarding the installing of a bell, which you refer to in your letter No. T-36 of the 19th instant, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to incur the expenditure required for this purpose at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You will observe ontotl that the estimate on labour has been exceeded $23.00. I misunderstood Mr. Woods, and thought he said that the whole building, school and teacher's house would be finished by Thursday May 29th. He explained to me that owing to the school having to be shellacked before being varnished that it was the same as a two coat job ad made the varnish set up better and of course took more time. There was not enough of inside V-joint to complete the inside of teacher's house so I had to order 20' of more and 30' of old wood. It will be Thursday of this week before the building is completed. There is platform built at front of school which was not estimated on, so that the door which opens out would not hang against the building and be knocked off the hinges. The inside of the school looks good with B.C. fir, shellacked and varnished with the windows done in white. There is also a platform shaped so, which was not estimated on and which of course takes time, along with the cupboard, which is done in B.C. fir, to correspond with the rest of the inside of school. I figured on two toilets, and have them built, but there is one required for teacher's use. I thought of putting it in the wood shed built 15' by 16', on frame plywood, clapboard outside and rough lumber sheeted inside to save clapboards when they are filling the wood in shed. I figured the whole building will cost in the neighbourhood of $400 dollars, that is allowing for a two coat job of paint, the same as the main building and the toilets.\n\nAs it is more economical to have all done at once I am ordering the lumber for the wood shed to be shipped this week so as to keep the men. I understand that the mill will start next week and it will make easy to get men. I trust the Dept. approves of my actions in this matter for I am indeed anxious to keep the cost down as much as possible. The price for lumber for wood shed will be the same as for main building as I am getting it from the same firm, Mark Rogers, Parry Sound.\n\nThe Dept. can rest assured that I will endeavour to keep the cost of everything down to the lowest. The estimated cost of lumber and labour, I will forward this week. I require a check for $23.00 to cover this week's pay sheet and as I purpose going right ahead with the wood shed, would ask the Dept. to forward the check for next week of $117.00. I figure, and Mr. Woods assures me that school, wood shed and everything will be completed not later than Thursday June 12th.\n\nI have a bellfry built and would appreciate the Dept. re-considering the supplying of bell.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to certain requirements for the Magnetawan school grounds.\n\nWe require fence posts for the east side of the lot and sufficient fencing for same, also 2 gates 8 ft. You will remember that I asked for a porch for this school, which is required, and it was arranged to leave it over to this year's expense. Through the winter, I observed the need of same, and would respectfully ask your consideration. One screen door is required for the teacher's house, and later on, perhaps next year, we might be able to get a well dug on the school grounds.\n\nI can get all work done satisfactorily by the Indians on the Reserve. The lumber for the porch would have to be shipped from Parry Sound, and I can buy same at wholesale price from Roger's Mill.\n\nTrusting that you will give this your serious consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, drawing attention to certain requirements for the school and grounds in connection with the Maganetawan Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the number of fence posts required, the type of fencing and the quantity of same required, also the cost of the posts, fencing and gates, as well as the labour in putting up the fence. Please also furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in having a porch built to the school building.\n\nWhen we have full particulars regarding the cost of the fencing and the building of the porch, consideration will be given to having the work done.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 1 screen door for the teacher's house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the lumber and materials required and for the labour in having the work done. The quotation which you forwarded is returned herewith for your information. The Department would like, if possible, that you obtain other prices for this material, and purchase the same from the dealer quoting the lowest price. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed. If this work is undertaken before the school closes, as little interruption as possible should occur in the classroom activities. Please furnish properly certified vouchers covering the cost of the lumber, paint and other materials. This should be accompanied by a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote for supplying same and the prices quoted. The total cost of the porch should, if possible, be kept down to the estimate submitted by you of approximately $243.\n\nRegarding the fence, you may purchase the posts, fencing and 2 gates, and arrange for the labour in putting up the fence. The total cost of the material and labour for the fence should not exceed your estimate of $48.20. You should also forward properly receipted vouchers for the material and labour for the purpose.\n\nYou should arrange to have the porch and fence undertaken at a time considered by you satisfactory to have the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kindly follow the usual procedure in connection with the presentation of this account.

INSPECTOR McGOOKIN,\nDATED SEPTEMBER 15TH, 1930, REGARDING HIS RECENT\nVISIT OF INSPECTION TO THE PARRY SOUND AGENCY.\n\nOriginal on File 77-22.\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my recent visit of inspection to the Parry Sound Agency.\n\nMaganeetawan Day School:- Some of the floor joists have given way causing the floor to sag badly. Part of the flooring will have to be taken up and new joists put in. About 250 feet of flooring will be spoiled and have to be replaced. The work, including labour and new material, will cost approximately $90.00. This school needs painting outside and inside of porch. This should be done this year if funds are available.\nOttawa, September 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his recent visit to the Waganetawan Indian Day School, reports regarding the school building as follows:\n\n\"Some of the floor joists have given way causing the floor to sag badly. Part of the flooring will have to be taken up and new joists put in. About 250 feet of flooring will be spoiled and have to be replaced. The work, including labour and new material, will cost approximately $90.00. This school needs painting outside and inside of porch.\"\n\nThe Department has no funds at the present time to provide the expense required in having the above work carried out this year, and the repairs and painting will have to stand over until next Summer. I have to request that you will draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next Spring, stating, in detail, the work you would advise be carried out in order to place this school building in good condition. Please state the approximate cost involved and how you would recommend that the work be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of Sept. 25th, 28-8-5, received, re Inspector McGoogins recommendations for repairs to the Magnetawan Indian Day School, I have to report that the repairs to the joists and flooring should be attended to right away. I refrained from reporting on this matter knowing that Mr. McGoogan would be in this vicinity and was under the impression that when he would report and show the great need of these repairs that the Department would sanction the cost.\n\nThe repairing of the joisting in this school would not be expensive, it would be the tearing up of the flooring, and the time spent pulling up and replacing it that would cost the most. I feel there is a reflection on this Agency and on the Department if these repairs are not attended to right away. So far as the painting is concerned that would lie over until next year, but the flooring should be done right away. I can assure the Department that if this expenditure, which I shall watch very closely, is granted, that I will keep it as low as possible.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/BK.\nOttawa, October 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the joists and flooring in the Maganetawan Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your report as to the urgency of this work, the Department will approve of your arranging to have the repairs required carried out. It is noted that it will be necessary to have the floor taken up, new joists put in and the flooring relaid. The Department will rely on you to see that all the work is completed in a satisfactory manner and at the lowest possible expense. You should arrange to purchase any materials required and for the labour in having the work carried out. After these repairs have been completed, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe matter of the painting of this school will have to stand over until next Spring, at which time you should draw same to the attention of the Department, giving particulars as requested in our letter of the 25th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

The windows have to be kept closed and it certainly isn't healthy. The mesh of the galvanized screen supplied a few years ago is too large to keep black flies out and even mosquitoes.

If you consider it would be more advantageous and cheaper for you to purchase the paint and other materials required and arrange for the labour, you may have the work done in this manner. However, if you are of the opinion that it would be cheaper to accept the lowest quotation which you received for the work, of approximately $130, you may accept same. The Department will leave the matter of the painting of this building in your hands, to have the work performed at the lowest possible cost.\n\nIt is understood that the painting required includes two coats to the outside of the school, two coats on the inside of the teacher's house and that the toilets are to be painted. In your letter of May 12th, last, you estimated the cost to be $125. You should see that the work is satisfactorily performed and that a good grade of paint is used. After the painting has been completed, please forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. If the work is done by day labour you should keep proper time sheets in triplicate, for the labour employed. These should be signed by the individual labourers, certified by yourself and forwarded for payment. It is hoped that you can have the painting at this school completed at an early date.\n\nAll accounts should be kept separately, covering the cost of the work at each of the schools which you have been authorized to have painted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.-F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above supplies. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The purchase and delivery of the above supplies should receive your early attention.\n\nThe teacher visited the Department yesterday and requested that outside windows and a storm door be provided for the residence part of the school building. She stated that five storm windows and one storm door are required. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of January 5, 1932. It is thought that the supplying and installing of the storm windows and door would not entail a large expenditure, and would add to the comfort and warmth of the teacher's living quarters.

He states as follows:-\n\n\"The building is sinking in the centre of the classroom. Evidently, the timbers underneath the centre floor have decayed. The slope to the centre of the classroom and in the kitchen is considerable. Even the chimney has dropped. I feel it is a dangerous situation. This school is only up 8 years and why it is collapsing in the middle is hard to understand.\"\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you, regarding the present condition of the building. As no funds have been provided for repairs to this school during the present fiscal year, it is doubtful if we could authorize any extensive work. However, I shall be pleased if you will state what is required to have the foundation of the building placed in good condition and the approximate cost of the necessary material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of June 28th 22-8-5 re the condition of the foundations of the Magnetawan Indian Day School, the building is sinking, and on the repairs recently done on the one side of the building, it was found that the foundations are in quicksand. I do not think that the situation is at all dangerous, and I would have made requisition to have the building fixed, but I was marking time until such times as there would be more funds available.\n\nIt will be necessary to have the floor torn up and have new joists and some flooring. Some of the joists there can be used over again, but some have to be replaced. This is a job that I cannot state just exactly how much it will cost, because I do not know how many joists and how much flooring will be required, until the flooring is taken up. When the building was being built there were vent holes put in for the preservation of the joisting and flooring, but it appears this was not sufficient.\n\nI can get labour on the reserve and a man to do this work. I do not think there is anything dangerous about the situation. It is very inconvenient and very annoying to me to see the building going as it is. I think the best way to do is to put the two men that I have in view on the job to tear up the floor and then I will have a better idea of what has to be done. What I can guarantee is that there never was a better time to get work done than right now.\nI wish to state emphatically that I do not agree with the Inspector's remark that there is anything dangerous about the situation. I am very proud of the schools and the condition they are in, and quite annoyed about this school, however with quicksand even the wisest people can be deceived.\n\nI would suggest to the Department that they give me permission to go ahead and take a section of the floor up, then it can be seen what is required. I can give instructions to save the flooring as much as possible and will keep down the costs. Until the flooring is taken up I cannot estimate just exactly what the repairs would cost. This work can be done during the vacation.\n\nA reply from the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK. Agent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the condition of the foundation of the Magnetawan Indian Day School. It is noted you do not consider that the situation is dangerous. As it would involve considerable expense to have new joists put in and the flooring replaced, it is thought that, unless urgent, the repairing of the foundation of this building could stand over until next year. Our funds are extremely limited, and, unless you believe the work should be done at once, the Department will not be prepared to authorize the expenditure. However, if you consider it is necessary that the repairs should be made to the foundation this summer, you may have the flooring taken up, in order to ascertain what new joists and work to the foundation would be required. After this has been done, it will, no doubt, be possible for you to furnish an estimate as to the material required and the cost of the labour in having the foundation placed in good condition and any repairs necessary to the flooring completed.\n\nThe Department will await your further report, giving an estimate of the cost, before deciding whether funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nJuly 11, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of July 4th, 22-8-5, I have been to the Magnetawan Indian Day School and went thoroughly into the situation and I find that the foundation of the school is all right. The cause of the trouble there is a dry rot on the joists.\n\nI have explained the situation to the caretaker and his grandson and they will be able to handle the situation, and do all the repairs that are necessary. This will save bringing a carpenter in there. Enclosed find a rough sketch of what I think is necessary for the preservation of the joists. There was a vent hole in the foundation but it was not sufficient and I find that at the back of the building where the teachers house is, there is a certain dampness. The enclosed sketch is what I think is necessary to preserve the timbers from rotting in the future or at least to preserve them for a much longer time.\n\nWhen the flooring is up a ditch will be dug the whole length of the school and two cross ditches; and they will be arranged so that the water will run into one of the ditches running across, out to the side of the school, and will be an outlet for any water that might happen to collect. In this way there will be a through current of air both ways. This can be done when the floor is taken up, and at very little cost. The cost will be the time of the labour. I have explained all this to the caretaker and his grandson and they understand what is required. At the vents in the foundation, I have arranged for the caretaker to have flat stones put across the opening resting on two stones which will prevent the foundation from cracking.\nThis, on paper, might appear to be a big job, but it is not a big job. I think it is absolutely necessary to do this to prevent the same thing occurring again because dry rot seems to be quite prevalent in that section of the country. I have noticed at Byng Inlet and Britt where the houses are built on low foundations on flat found that they have all sunk more or less.\n\nI am getting prices on the lumber, and nails required, and will forward them in the next mail. I think this is a suitable time to have this work done because labour can be got cheap, 35 cents an hour for the man and 30 cents an hour for the young man. It might be necessary to have another man but his wages would be 30 cents an hour.\n\nI will give an estimate of the time I think it will take to get this work done, when I get the prices of the lumber and the nails. I would strongly recommend that this work be done at the present time as it can be done much cheaper now than later on.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJMD/BK.\n\nAgent.\nApproximate cost of Lumber, Material and Labour for repairs to Magnetawan Indian Day School.\n\n1,120 ft.

I intend to stay for a few days to superintend the repairs as I am satisfied that I would have to be there to see that it is done right.\n\nI quite agree with the Department not to incurr any expenditure for oretonne. When I look around about me in this section of the country and compare the teachers in the reserves with their salaries, accommodation, and comfort that they have, I am sure that they are pretty well fixed for the service they give.

This should read $72.00 and make the total of $187.87.\n\nI am sorry at making this mistake and respectfully request that the officials of the Department will alter this when considering the estimate of the whole.\n\nPlease try and let me know this week if I can arrange to go ahead with this work.\n\nThe consideration of the Department will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th instant, regarding the repairs required to the foundation, joists and flooring of the Magnetawan Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour necessary.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that the Department will approve of you arranging to carry out the work in the digging or ditches and replacing of any joists and flooring required, as mentioned in your letter of the 15th instant. It is noted you estimate the cost of the work for lumber and material to be $148.67 and for the labour $72.00. The Department notes that you can arrange with the caretaker and his grandson to perform the necessary work. The Department will leave this matter in your hands, and I would request that you will supervise the activity and see that it is satisfactorily carried out.\n\nI enclose encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure to the amount of $190. This should be sufficient to include the replacing of the broken glass in the windows.

Magnetawan Reserve\nAugust 15, 1933\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI have to report that after tearing up the floor in the school house I found that all the joints were rotten under the teacher's house. There is nothing left for me to do but tear up the flooring under the teacher's house and put new joints in place. It seems to understand why all the joints should not but it appears to me there was not enough air space.\n\nI am making sure there will be lots of air space this time as I have trenches dug two across the building and two lengthwise.\n\nI have put two more men on and will have to say there is no more work to be done about 600 feet of flooring and 6 poles 2 x 8 x 14 I am doing all I can to get this job finished before school opens.\n\nI do not think I can finish the job according to the estimate because of the condition of the joints. Flooring in the teacher's house I will keep all costs down as low as possible and I am giving the job all the time I can spare. It just so happens that the soil...\nin my office is on holiday and I find it not easy to attend to the office and look after the field work as well but this job is important and I will stay with it until I am sure no mistakes can happen. I cannot get back to Parry Sound until tomorrow so am sending this letter out tonight so that the Department will understand I am up against something I could not foresee and being there I am doing the best I can to get the work done as good and as cheap as possible.\n\nThere will be extra for labour and lumber but I will keep it as close to the estimate as possible.\n\nI should state that the chimney that the Inspector reported dangerous has been placed into position and a rock foundation built underneath.\n\nTrusting that the Department approves my action in this matter there is no other way I can see and the men I have are cheap and good but I am taking no chances hence I am very keen looking the matters over and seeing the work is done satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJohn McAdy\nAgent\nOttawa, August 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the repairs which you are having carried out to the foundation, joists, and flooring of the Magnetawan Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted you found that new joists would be required under the teacher's residence portion, which will necessitate extra expenditure, for both material and labour.\n\nThe Department hopes that you will be able to complete the work in a satisfactory manner, for an amount not greatly in excess of the sum authorized by E.

Also ordered a dozen size patly pan and five yards of heavy cretonne to cover\nthe couch in the living room. The present cover on the couch is a disgrace! I have ordered this just five times. There was a garbage pail ordered to hold water, as I'm always out of water and you know the well is half a mile from the house. If I had this pail I can always get the children to fill it up, as it holds about four pails of water.\n\nIn the school requisition there was no liftel or dustpan sent, things also very necessary. I really cannot understand this as all things ordered are needed. I do not order things unless they are needed and consequently expect\nto get them.\n\nHoping you will give\nthis your immediate consider-\nation I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\nGertrude E. O'Mara\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find correspondence received from Miss Gertrude E. O'Meara, School Teacher at the Magnetawan Indian Day School, Bing Inlet, C.P.R. Ont. I am sending the correspondence along to the Department so that they will know just how the teachers feel when their requisitions are not supplied.\n\nThe part of the requisition that was sent forward was 5 bars of soap, 1 wash basin, 1 pail, 2 lamp burners, 2 yds of lamp wicking, and 2 tons of coal.\n\nI am writing to Miss O'Meara informing her that the Department at Ottawa has the say as to what part of the requisition will be supplied for the teacher's house.\n\nAfter reading Miss O'Meara's letter will the Department please say if they can do anything about sending the supplies as ordered through the requisition. I am afraid Miss O'Meara thinks that I am refusing to supply the things she asks for.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD EK.\nENGL.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, January 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the teacher of the Magnetawan Indian Day School, regarding the non-receipt by her of supplies for which she requisitioned on December 21st, last. In this connection I have to say that in official letter to you, dated December 30th, you were authorized to purchase the following:\n\n5 bars of soap, 2 lamp burners,\n1 wash basin, 2 yards lamp wicking,\n1 pail, 2 tons of coal,\n\nfor the teacher's residence. It may be that you did not receive this letter. I would request that you arrange for the purchase of the above supplies and have them delivered at the school as soon as possible. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nBesides the above mentioned articles, it is noted in the teacher's letter that she requests pie plates, a dozen size patty pan and 5 yards of heavy cretonne to cover the couch in the living room, a garbage pail, a stove lifter and a dustpan. If you consider these supplies also required, you may purchase same, forwarding properly certified vouchers, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

BENNETT'S REPORT ON THE MAGANETAWAN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nDate of Inspection - October 10, 1934.\n\nI suppose it is useless to ask for storm windows on the 5 classroom windows. They face the west and get the full force of the cold weather.\n\nSchoolhouse bell needs fixing - the revolving wheel is off and it is a man's job to fix it. It is also badly cracked. There is no sound to it.\n\nSchool porch is falling away from the building and is leaking badly.\nOttawa, October 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Magnetawan Indian Day School, recommends that storm windows be installed on five classroom windows. He states these windows face the west and are exposed to the full force of the cold weather. He states, further, that repairs are required to the bell - the revolving wheel is off and it is also badly cracked. He states, also, that the school porch is falling away from the building and is leaking badly.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you, regarding the need for storm windows and the approximate cost and also the cost of the repairs required to the bell and school porch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nNovember 1, 1934,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of October 30th, 22-8-5, re public school inspector's report of his recent visit of inspection to the Magnetawan Indian Day School, I expect to be up at Magnetawan School in a day or so, and will look the situation over.\n\nThe teacher has been asking me for storm windows for the last two years. I explained to the teacher, the lack of funds, but who wants the windows. Re the bell being cracked, that is the first I knew about it. As for the porch falling away from the building and leaking badly, I knew about the porch being a little heaved, but I do not think it is half as bad as he has reported. If so, it has happened in the last two months.\n\nThe school would be much more comfortable if we had storm windows, but if we cannot get them there is no reason why the school cannot be kept comfortable, as it is. However, I will report on the situation by the end of the week.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory in the meantime.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/ek.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6141, File 404-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nByng Inlet, Ont.,\nOct. 22nd 1934.\n\nMrs. M. Daly,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nDear Mrs. Daly:\n\nReceived on Saturday a steel lining for favorite stove. This has to be returned as it is not what ordered. I ordered brick grates for the stove and will look for same in exchange for this lining.\n\nI am still waiting for the six bars of lifeboat soap and 6 soup plates as ordered. Would like to know why such necessary articles as a can opener, butcher knife and bed spread are not being sent. These can all be purchased for about two dollars. I am\nsurprised at the Dept. cancelling such a trivial amount. There is a bed spread here that has been here since the school was built eight years ago. I am afraid to wash it for fear it falls to pieces.\n\nHas any provision been made for the shipment of the three tons of coal? There is not a bit left from last year and in fact I did not have enough to see the winter through. Hoping this will be looked after before the cold weather sets in; for I froze for two months last year before the coal was delivered.\n\nTrusting you will look after these affairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGertrude E. O'Meara\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of October 30th,\n28-8-5, re the Public School Inspector's report\nof the Magnetawan Indian Day School, and the need\nfor storm windows, I have been to the Magnetawan\nSchool, and made an inspection, and would recommend\nthat storm windows be supplied. Following are\nthe prices received here for the school windows,-\nFor schoolroom:\n5 windows 6'7\u00bd\" x 2'10\u00bd\" (6 lights) @ 4.50 - $22.50\nFor cloak room:\n2 windows 6\u00bd' x 2\u00bd' (4 lights) @ 2.76 - $5.50\n\nFreight on storm windows to Byng Inlet (approx.) 1.00\nCartage from Byng Inlet Station to School \" 1.00\nFitting storm windows on. \" 2.00\n\nTotal:- $32.00\n\nRe the bell, it has been cracked for some\nconsiderable time, but still gives out enough sound to\ncall the children, all that is required for the wheel\nis two screws which I can get here in town.\n\nThe school porch is the same as it was the\nlast time I was there, and I cannot see why the\nInspector should say it was leaking badly. It is not\nleaking at all. The last time I was there I instructed\nthe caretaker to put a strip on the floor opposite the\ndoor. This he has done and I cannot see why it cannot\nlast in this condition for a number of years. I would\nnot advise that anything be done to the porch at the\npresent time.\nOwing to the vents being put in the foundation during the last repairs the cold will get in the floor, and this might make the floor a little colder. It is a double floor with heavy building paper between.\n\nMy observation since I came here, is that when a teacher has put in three years in the schools in this section that it is time for a change.\n\nThe soup plates granted to Miss O'Meara on her last requisition were supplied to her. I sent up two nice soup plates, but they do not match the plates she has and she sent them back with me. I am trying to have the plates matched up with the dishes she has. The brick that she ordered for the stove was not required. It is little fussy things like this that show how the wind is blowing and how for the teacher's benefit she should have a change.\n\nMr. Moore the School Inspector here informs me that there are 600 qualified teachers in Ontario who would be glad to get a job. I think Miss O'Meara is a good girl, but too long in the one position. I have heard that she does not intend to teach after next June. Miss O'Toole, whom the Department sent to Christian Island, must have heard the same because she has written to me asking me if, when the school becomes vacant and Miss O'Meara leaves she get first consideration for the school. Miss O'Toole's home is about two miles from the school at Britt, across the river.\n\nRe the coal for Miss O'Meara, she has a very hazy idea of costs and thinks her demands should be attended to right away. I tried to explain to her last night, when she suggested that we could get the coal by freight that it would cost too much for loading the coal unloading it, and hauling it to the Reserve. This did not seem to worry her in any way, all she wanted was the coal. There is no need for her being cold as she has always had lots of wood, and the coal will be delivered as soon as the ice is strong enough on the river to haul it across.\nIf Miss O'Meara were a man, I would say she was \"bushed\" and would be improved by having a change from Magnetawan Reserve. Enclosed please find a letter sent to me by Miss O'Meara.\n\nI explained to Miss O'Meara that the coal would be delivered to her as soon as the ice was strong enough to stand the transportation of it across the river. It is a short distance across the river to Britt, but it would cost almost as much as the price of the coal to have it sent by freight, because of the handling.\n\nAs Miss O'Meara is impatient about getting the storm windows would the Department please reply at their earliest.\n\nTrusting this is the information required.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nEnc.\nOttawa, November 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, with reference to the supplying of storm windows for use on the classroom and cloakroom windows at the Magnetawan Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure of approximately $32.00 in supplying the windows, of the dimensions required, and having them shipped to the school. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. You should attach receipts for the freight and cartage charges.\n\nIn view of your report, the Department is not prepared to authorize any expenditure in connection with the bell or the school porch.\n\nRegarding the supplying of the coal, it is noted that you will have this delivered as soon as the ice is strong enough to stand the transportation of it across. In the meantime, the teacher can use wood for heating purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

In the wind storm last fall they were blown over.\n\n\"The front porch is pulling away from the building. This school was built in low-lying land. Water remains under it even in the summertime. It will never be right until it is moved to higher ground.\"\n\nI am aware of conditions at this school and I presume that it would be difficult to make any permanent improvement without spending a very large sum of money which, at the present moment, is not available.\n\nHowever, I should appreciate receiving another report from you regarding this building indicating what improvements you consider might be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. S.

There is no doubt that, due to the selection of a poor site when this school was built, it requires repairs and adjustments practically every year.

Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nWith reference to requisition of the 1st instant, you may purchase the following for use at the Magnetawan Day School:\n\n- 3 Bars Lifebuoy soap\n- 1 Wash basin\n- 1 Water pail\n- 2 Locks\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJuly 3, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Magnetawan School Inspector Bennett writes as follows:\n\n\"Boys' toilet so insecurely set up that it has been blown over by strong winds. Couldn't these toilets be set on higher grounds? Every spring when I come they are surrounded with water.\n\n\"School house needs painting inside and outside. The classroom is not very attractive inside.\"\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of painting the interior of this school.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why something could not be done to the toilets. I wrote to you along similar lines in a letter dated June 15, 1942, to which you did not reply. I should appreciate your giving immediate consideration to the matter and letting me know what can be done.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-8-5.\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter of the 3rd Inst., I beg to submit the following with regard to the situation at the Magnetawan School.\n\nI inspected the toilets there last summer and had any necessary work done. The site chosen for this school in the first place was not ideal, but I cannot see that there can be very much done about it now. The site of the school and its surroundings are low ground and in wet weather it does get very muddy. I will have in mind the situation of the toilets and will see if it is possible to have these moved to a more suitable location.\n\nWith regard to painting the school house, I would not recommend this at this time as, in my opinion, the building does not require this for several years at least. I have seen schoolhouses throughout the country which have a much worse appearance than our school on the Magnetawan Reserve.\n\nYou will observe that following your letter of June last I had all the work that was necessary done on the toilets.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nOn November 20, 1942 authority was granted, File No. 22-8-5, for repairs to the Magnetawan Indian Day School, which involved principally the building of a cement chimney on the teacher's residence. The chimney was purchased and shipped to the school, but I was unable to get the work done before winter set in and had to put off the job until now. As the man I was relying on has now left that neighborhood, I will be obliged to send a man from town to do the work. I find also that I was misled as to the number of cement blocks necessary to build the chimney and that I will require about eight more sections. A recent inspection also reveals some other small items of repairs and the revised bill will be as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost |\n|-----------------------------|------|\n| 8 sections cement chimney   | 8.00 |\n| 1 window sash, 20x25, 4 ft. | 1.45 |\n| 20 ft.

Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, in which you state that the material and labour for repairs to the Magnetawan Indian Day School will cost $29.18, instead of the estimated $26.45 mentioned in your letter of November 14 last. Authority is granted for proceeding with these repairs at the amount quoted in your recent letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Rate  | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|---------|\n| Building chimney                                 |          |       |         |\n| Repairing windows                                |          |       |         |\n| Outside toilets                                  |          |       |         |\n| at Byinglet School House                         | 22hrs    | $7.50 | $16.50  |\n| Helper                                           | 32hrs    | $4.50 | $9.90   |\n| Traveling Expense for two                        |          | $2.35 | $4.70   |\n| **Total**                                        |          |       | **$31.10** |\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is our practice to have Roman Catholic schools inspected by Separate School Inspectors, and I should be pleased if you would inform me whether there is any reason why the same procedure should not be followed at Maganetawan as at other Catholic Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of June 1, 22-816, re--inspection of Maganetawan Indian Day School, I should state that there is no reason that I know of why this school should not be inspected by a separate school inspector, in fact, I should rather like it for my teacher there would be liable to get more credit for her work.\n\nPerhaps it is not known to the Dept. but it is a fact that all the teachers in this Agency are asked by me to take an interest in the spiritual welfare of the children and in justice to the teachers, I must say they all do. I have arranged with the Parish Priest to supply catechisms and with the teachers to take sufficient time to instruct the children in same. The same applies to the Protestant children. I really think it would be the proper thing to have this school inspected by a separate school inspector.\n\nTrusting that this is the information required,\n\nI have the honour to be.\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/RD\nOttawa, June 8th, 1927.\n\nSir,-\n\nAs the teacher and pupils of the Maganetawan Indian Day School are Roman Catholics, it is desired that this school be inspected, in future, by a Separate School Inspector.\n\nIt has previously been inspected by Mr. J.L. Moore, Public School Inspector, Parry Sound, Ontario. Please advise him that it will not be necessary for him to visit this school in future. I would also appreciate if you would arrange to have it inspected by Mr. J.M. Bennett. His first visit to the school should be made during the Fall term as Mr. Moore has inspected this school on April 8th last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The children of two white families are very irregular, and interfere with the good progress of the school. The teacher should report the irregular attendance of the whites to the Attendance Officer of the Byng Inlet School. The latter could take steps to enforce better Attendance.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY... Satisfactory\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION...

The grounds are neat and well fenced. The buildings present a neat appearance. The closets, however, should be cleaned regularly or steps taken to prevent odors.\n\nThe greatest need at the present time is an adequate supply of good drinking water on the premises. There is no supply at all on the property, and the water used is taken from an inconvenient source, and one that would be very subject to contamination.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nThe school is well conducted and a pleasant tone exists. The credit is Miss McCarthy's.\n\nIn general I believe the course is too academic in character to suit the Indian disposition. More practical work should be done, such as agriculture, manual training, domestic science, art, etc. These subjects should have a definite allotment of time on the time-table.\nOttawa, June 25th, 1928.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your recent reports on the Golden Lake and Maganetawan Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn connection with your account, this should be made out in duplicate.

This could hardly be charged to the Ontario Department of Education, until there is some agreement with the Ontario Department to bear some share of the expenses of Indian Education. As to the fact that the previous Inspector did not make such a charge, I have no comment to make other than to state that I believe he should have for the inspection of the said school certainly involved staying one day longer in Sudbury than his ordinary departmental work required.\n\nI did not secure a receipt for the said hotel bill, for I did not notice any mention of such a requirement on the Expense form. However, I shall do so in the future. The items were: June 19th Supper, Bed & Bath, June 20th Breakfast, Supper.\n\nHoping that this will prove satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The irregularity of some of these pupils impedes the progress of the other pupils, besides giving bad example to the Indian children. I am glad to note that the attendance of the latter is satisfactory.\n\nThe character of the work should be more practical.\n\nHealth habits should be cultivated; cleanliness of the teeth is a difficult habit to instill where proper cooperation is not obtained in the homes; consequently, I believe that if the pupils were supplied with toothbrushes, they would be more likely to acquire the habit of cleaning their teeth regularly.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She uses the devices provided well enough. Some further advice and direction was given her at this visit.\n\nBy the way she has 12 primers but only 6 each of the \"Joe and Ruth\" work book and \"Two Little Indian\" were sent. Of course only 6 of these are Indians but I would say that it would be difficult to draw a distinction with Primary pupils in the use of these texts. I think that Joe and Ruth work book is advisable for development of school interest and child imagery.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nM.A.G.N.E.T.A.W.A.H.

Would it be possible to determine upon a choice of these recommended books, as seen in the New Course for Grade 1 to VI, for all Indian Schools? I feel that with so many books listed someone should recommend a minimum list for immediate use in Indian Schools, for pupils and teachers. The New Course in Social Study and Natural Science demands that immediate aid be given these teachers especially in these two subjects. The new authorized Arithmetic for Grade III and IV is ready at 10 cents each.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nIndian School Date of visit JUNE lst. 1938\n\nPost Office address of school BYNG INLET, ONTARIO.\n\nGrades 1 II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nEnrolled 5 7 0 6 0 8 3 3 -- = 32\nPresent 4 5 0 5 0 3 2 2 -- = 21\n\nTeacher EDITH MARY BEASUGI (Name in full)\nLicence (or certificate) ONTARIO FIRST INTERIM\nValid to JULY 1941\n\nTaught last term in HERE\n\nTotal teaching experience FIRST YEAR years\nService in Indian school ONE YEAR years\n\nConventions attended At Parry Sound October 1937\n\nAppearance X\nHealth X\nPersonality X\nInitiative X\nDiscipline X\nRelations X\nManagement X\nTeaching skill X\nPreparations X\nLanguage X\nCommunity service X\nPupils' progress X\n\nGeneral comment: In management in discipline, this teacher has done well.

I recommend that she be given consideration. Her work is quite satisfactory. While she does not appear very strong yet she only lost two days from school due to illness.\n3. I tested all classes in Reading, Spelling, Writing, Arithmetic. Also all work books were examined and commented upon. The higher grades were tested in Literature as well. Progress and proficiency is satisfactory.\n4. There is an Entrance Class of three pupils. I have recommended intensive work with them until examination time in the four written subjects, because the youngest of these is already 14\u00bd yrs. old.\n5. The school was seen to be slipping off the foundation.\n6. There is quite a bit of water surrounding the outdoor toilets due to heavy rains, making it difficult for pupils to enter without getting wet feet. The door is broken off the toilet.\n7.

It is evident that this teacher has made progress in developing a reasonable fluency in reading and word recognition and in seeking accuracy in Arithmetic. Writing can improve even with these pupils. On the whole, I consider that this teacher has given good service.\n\nSUGGESTIONS: 1. If Clarence Hogonosh will work on his father's small acreage for the required 8 weeks and since he is 16\u00bd years of age, I and the teacher will be willing to grant him Entrance Standing. (Insp. Moore, Parry Sound)\n2. Since these pupils are so irresponsible, something should be done demanding attendance. On rainy days, practically none attend, as the records show.\n3. If Aileen Gray returns to school next fall she should be given as much of the Grade IX work as possible.\n4. The teacher needs to plan drill and seat work, if any real success is to be accomplished here.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Toilets need repairing. In the wind storm last fall they were blown over.\n2. The front porch is pulling away from the building. This school was built in low-lying land. Water remains under it even in the summertime. It will never be right until it is moved to higher ground.\n3.

The children appear anxious to learn.\n2. Both toilets are so placed in low land that in wet weather it is difficult to approach them, as I found out, without getting ones feet wet. One of the toilets needs cleaning. (Urgent) The gates are off the fence enclosing the property. The roofs are leaking in the porch and pupils' cloakroom. So is the woodshed roof. This teacher is not residing here now, boards elsewhere. Night prowlers had made living conditions rather trying on the nerves.\n3. Two families do not send their children at all regularly to school, one is the Boucher family (white). The Indian children attend well.\n\nN.B. If this teacher should leave here, notify her successor to bring her own bedding. This teacher had some of her supplies stolen. Clayton, Clarence and Don Boucher attend poorly.

One pupil for Entrance - Donald Grey, age 15 in October. Weak in Spelling but I would recommend that the Entrance Board give him every consideration when he writes.\n\n2. Boys' Toilet so insecurely set up that it has been blown over by strong winds. Couldn't these toilets be set on higher grounds? Every spring when I came, they are surrounded with water.\n\n3. School house needs painting inside and outside. The classroom is not very attractive inside. The caretaker is a boy of 16 who does not seem to have much sense of responsibility. He is not always on the job.\n\n4. Some copies of Social Studies Texts are needed for Grades IV, V, VI. I suggest two copies \"My Countries Story\" for Grade V (J.M.Dent & Co.) Toronto.\n\n5. All pupils were tested in Reading, Spelling, Hand-writing and Language. Note books in other subjects examined.\n\n6. If a teacher is engaged for this school, who will be residing here, I would suggest that the Indian Agent call previously and have the teacher's quarters properly prepared because no one has been residing here for over two years.

Workbooks and work habits were noted. In general, I would say that this young lady did well enough. She had control of the pupils and had their cooperation. The only Grade VIII, Leonard Deshev, is not ready for the Entrance Examination this year. I would like the new Catholic Readers to be used in Grades V to VIII. Approximately, six of the Indians were in daily attendance all winter and none in the finer weather. All the pupils were clean and neat in appearance. They all seemed to wish to learn. There is a family from Rutter named Yenne who commenced to attend but do not come at all regularly.\n\nThe whole appearance of this school, both inside and out is depressing. The place is not attractive in any way. The teacher's quarters have been vacated have been broken into and almost everything stolen. Some repair is needed to toilets as well as the school. Exterior and interior painting should be done. Since this teacher was only a High School girl, I regret very much that I did not call in the fall term to give her direction. It might be better if the Inspectors can call only once a year, to use their judgement in a matter of this kind.\n\nJ.M.

Indian Agent visits frequently. As I said before, the building needs painting. There will be two more Indian children in attendance in the fall. No matter how many children there are, the Indian School should be in operation, because outside of the school there are few educational influences, if any.\n\nThe teacher is much above average and ideal for Indian schools. She would do fine work anywhere but actually she prefers these children. A Christmas concert and one on the 17th of March attracts all the parents. Not many teachers would go to this trouble. What latent talent have is fostered. I examined all work books, including those absent. They reflect good work habits. Reading ability is good. Spelling and arithmetic skills progressing. Drawing is encouraged. Religious instruction is well done. Written and oral language is satisfactory. The physical training of the children includes some folk and step dancing which the pupils enjoy and so did their parents at the concerts. A large Union Jack and other flags have been flown from the belfry.\n\nIf the interior is ever painted, paint with bright colors. The school needs attention.\n\nR. C. S. S. DIV.

I understand he taught school in England, and I would strongly recommend that he be appointed, as I think he will get a good attendance. I informed the Indians that unless they would guarantee an average attendance of at least eight pupils, I would not recommend the school to be opened, this they have promised to do, but they say that they do not want Mr. Fryer to have anything to do with their teacher or school, for if he did he would want to have their children taught religion, and they claim that is what broke up their school before, the teacher wanting to teach them religion. All the Indians of this band are pagans. They say that they never asked to have a big school on the Rainy River, they say Mr. Fryer made that up himself.\nOttawa, October 8th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 17th of May last with reference to the desire of the Manitou Indians to have their school re-opened I beg to say that in view of your recommendation the Department will provide the salary of a teacher, $300.00, and the necessary school materials.

All the day schools with the exception of the ones at Manitou Rapids have been closed. The Stangecoming and Couchiching Schools were closed on account of the opening of the boarding school at Fort Frances. The reason for the closing of the other schools was the absence of the Indians from the reserve for long periods at different seasons of the year and the irregular attendance of the pupils when on the reserve.\n\nThese Indians have a school at Manitou Rapids in charge of Mr. R. Gill. The December quarter return has been received and we have had no intimation that the teacher intends to resign.\n\nThe last census return shows that there were 203 children of school age in the Fort Frances Agency, distributed by bands as follows:\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the time of my visit there were 11 boys and 5 girls present which was slightly above the present average, two boys being noted as visitors on this occasion.\n\nThe examination of the classes was fairly satisfactory. Reading was good considering the short time which has elapsed since teaching was begun. Spelling was fair and writing was good. One or two of the boys show considerable ability in drawing. Behaviour in school appeared very good but the teacher reported that the boys were rather rough in their treatment of the girls out of doors and that all pupils seemed to regard all milder forms of punishment with stolid indifference.\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a recent report on the Manitou Rapids day school, Inspector Semmens states that the attendance at this school is not very satisfactory.\n\nThe Department would like to see a large average attendance at this school, during the year, and you will be good enough to point out to the parents the necessity and advantages of sending their children, regularly.\n\nIt is hoped that your interest in this matter will encourage them to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.P.

Spencer, Manitou Rapids Reserve, via Emo, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nOfficer in Charge of I. D. Stores, Winnipeg.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INDIAN AGENT J. P. WRIGHT,\nFORT FRANCES, ONT., Dated Oct. 24, 1924. His No. 7798.\n\nOriginal on File 10-124.\n\nIn view of the possibility of Mr. A. Spencer, Farm Instructor, being promoted to the position of Indian Agent for this Agency, I would recommend that Mr. Wm. J. Hayes be appointed Farm Instructor of the Amalgamated Rainy River bands at Manitou Rapids Reserve and that his sister, Miss Olive C. Hayes, be appointed school teacher for the Manitou Rapide Indian Day School. She is 18 years of age and well qualified to teach this school.\nOttawa, October 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to that portion of your letter of the 24th instant, in which you recommend that Miss Olive C. Hayes be appointed teacher of the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School, to succeed Mrs. A. Spencer, who is resigning on the appointment of her husband as Indian Agent, I beg to say it is noted that Miss Hayes is only eighteen years of age, and you have not stated whether she has any professional qualifications.\n\nI may say that we would prefer a teacher having professional qualifications. However, it may not be possible owing to living conditions at this point to obtain a teacher of this type. I shall be pleased if you will state what living accommodation is provided for a teacher, or whether suitable boarding facilities can be obtained near the school. It is doubtful if the services of a young girl would prove satisfactory, but we will await further information from you or Mr. Spencer as to whether you consider Miss Hayes would prove satisfactory, or whether you would recommend that a qualified teacher be obtained. I may say that the salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications which the teacher secured possesses. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to the appointment of Miss Olive C. Hayes to the position of teacher of the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School, I beg to state that Miss Hayes qualification for teacher is only three years in High School, and I doubt very much if you could get a professional qualified teacher to take this School, as there is no place near that she could get to stay at, unless the Farm Instructor would take her in, and as Miss Hayes is a sister of the Farm Instructor, the question is settled as far as living accommodations go.\n\nThe Farm Instructor's house and the School room are combined in one building.\n\nI consider that Miss Hayes would prove a satisfactory teacher for this school and I spoke to Mr. Spencer and he is of the same opinion, in fact the young lady is now teaching this school, and has been doing so for the past month.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nOnt\nOttawa, November 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a letter from the late Indian Agent, Mr. J. P. Wright, dated the 3rd instant, regarding the appointment of Miss Olive C. Hayes to the position as teacher of the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say in view of his recommendation and the difficulty in obtaining living accommodation, the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Hayes. As she has no professional qualifications, the salary allowed for her services will be at the rate of $500 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. Please inform Miss Hayes of her appointment.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the date on which Miss Hayes began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlonzo Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Nov 8th Re. appointment of Miss Olive C.

Would you recommend the re-engagement of Miss Hayes? If not, please submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you to carry on the work at this school from the 1st of April, next, until the end of the present school year.

The great hindrance\nis the home-life of the children.\n\nA real live and suitable teacher could, no doubt,\nwork wonders in the school but the difficulty is to\ninduce such a teacher to accept the principalship\nof an Indian School.\n\nAbout half the Indians connected with the school are\nAnglican and the remainder (the Manitou Tribe) are\nPagan. This is my first inspection of this school\nand I have endeavoured to confine myself to general\nconditions and advancement of pupils, but at the\nnext visit I shall be able to give an account of the\nprogress made. I am confident proper inspection of the\nSchool will tend toward greater efficiency.\nOttawa, April 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the work being performed by Evelyn E. Alderson in the classroom. He states she has no professional qualifications and that the success being achieved in the work is not good. He also states that no real success can be expected until a qualified teacher, possessing tact and judgment, is placed in charge of the school, and that a real live and suitable teacher could, no doubt, work wonders in the school.\n\nWhen Miss Alderson was engaged, it was on the understanding that her services, if not satisfactory, would be dispensed with at the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next. The Department would be prepared to pay a higher salary if the services of a teacher having second class professional qualifications were secured. You should, in due time, endeavour to nominate the services of a qualified teacher for this school for the next school year, stating the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend for the position. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to the rate of salary we can allow. When replying, you should also furnish full information as to the boarding accommodation available for a teacher.\n\nPlease inform Miss Alderson in due time that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have to report that we can get no Teacher with a second class professional qualification, for less than $800.00 per Year. And if the Department is willing to pay that for service, I would be able to get a Teacher that the Inspector would approve of.\n\nIn regard to boarding accommodation, Teacher could board with Farm Instructor right at the School, for a reasonable rate.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the salary that will be allowed for a qualified teacher at the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow a salary of $80 per teaching month to a teacher having second class professional qualifications. It is hoped that you will be able to nominate the services of a teacher in time to reopen the school after the present summer holidays.

McCardle, who holds a Second class interim teachers certificate, and only lacks three subjects of holding a 1st class certificate. I consulted with Mr. Ewers, School Inspector in regard to accepting her, and out of 25 Applications we accepted Miss McCardle, who comes with good recommendation. School opened on the 3rd of September, and I visited the School yesterday, and find that Miss McCardle is stepping into the harness right at the start, and think she will make good, as she seems to take an interest in the Indian Children.

Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year.

I am a teacher applying for my superannuation with the Ontario Department of Education. I have taught for thirty-three years under the Department of Education of Ontario, but I taught for two years for the Department of Indian Affairs in the District of Rainy River in the province of Ontario.\n\nThese years were (a) from September 1936 to June 1937, and (b) from September 1937 to June 1938. I was at Manitou Rapids Indian Day School, near Eme, Ontario. The superintendent of the reserve was Mr. William Hayes. My salary was ninety dollars a month.\n\nWhat I require is a statement from your Department indicating these two years of service, and that no superannuation...\nwas deducted from my salary for either the Dominion pension or an Ontario pension.\n\nI would very much appreciate a prompt reply.\n\nYours truly,\n(Miss) Phyllis Pratt.\nDear Miss Pratt:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter dated March 16, 1970.\n\nOur records indicate that you were employed at the Manitou Rapids School on September 1, 1926 at a salary of $90.00 per month.\n\nI am unable to verify the number of years you were employed with us as our records have been destroyed. I have contacted our Regional Office in Toronto for information regarding your employment.\n\nAs soon as a reply is received you will be advised.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. Primeau\n\nD.G.

I am a teacher at Fort William Collegiate, and am retiring from the profession this June. I have completed thirty-three years of teaching in the province of Ontario and am applying to the Ontario Superintendent Commission for my pension. But I also spent two years teaching Indians in an Indian Day School run by federal government, where I paid my superintendent of any kind. Now I want to pay up this superannuation with interest, so it would give me thirty-five years.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Superintendent Commission of Ontario wrote to say they would consider this, but that I must have a statement from the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa as to my service, salary, and the fact that no superannuation had been paid. I wrote over a month ago to the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa, and have not even received an acknowledgment of my letter. I wonder if you could be able to channel this letter into the right hands at the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa. These are the facts I want a statement on:\n\nI taught at Manitou Rapids Indian Day School, Essex, Ontario for two years. These years from Sept. 1936 to June 1937, and 6 from Sept. 1937 to June 1938.

Paid order scrubbing School $1.25.\" This item was paid by cheque No. 3688 in favour of Langstaff Mercantile Co., on the 20th October.\n\nOn December 4th you submitted Voucher No. 948 in favour of this firm. It contained the following item: \"Oct. 12th, 1931. Goods supplied Mrs. A. Medicine on order of Wm. Hayes $2.50.\" Payment in this case was made by cheque No. 4392 on November the 18th.\n\nOn December the 15th the Department received Voucher No. 1004 in your favour for the cost of the scrubbing of the Manitou Rapids School from June 1930 to October 1931 viz: $27.25. Each of the items referred to above, for which the firm of Langstaff Mercantile Co., received payment were included in Voucher No. 1004 in your favour. Kindly refer in this connection to Receipt No. 10 for $1.25 and Receipt No. 12 for $2.50. The duplicate charges were not at once observed and the Voucher was paid by cheque No. 5510. This made an over-payment of $3.75, which amount should be refunded without delay, and explanation furnished.\n\nIn future you should not have accounts for cleaning of school paid by Langstaff Mercantile Co. You should submit them direct to the Department, in order to avoid mistakes such as referred to above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

In this I had done the same as in the past, took his Receipts made out Account and forwarded it to the Department, not knowing that he had taken a Receipt from Mrs Medicine and given her an order on Langstaff Co for $25, and they in turn charged it up to the Department. No doubt but Hayes intended to pay Langstaff Co, when he received Cheque for scrubbing of School, because as soon as I receive a Cheque for scrubbing I simply sign it and forward it to Mr Hayes, for advance made for scrubbing.

Mr. Sutherland.\n\nManitou School Caretaker.\n\nAt my recent visit to the Manitou Reserve the Chief and Council complained that the allowance for caretaking of the school there was mis-appropriated in that although, as they understood, $15 per month was allowed for this service only $2.00 was actually spent, as this sum was given to an Indian woman for scrubbing work each month.\n\nThey also complained that the school children had no playground as the ground set aside for this purpose was used for a pasture lot for cows and chickens belonging to the farm instructor.\n\nApparently some fencing should be done, in such a way that the children during recess had a playground for themselves, and from an inspection of the premises made at the time of my visit, this could be done at small cost.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

During hunting season great number of white men comes to our reserve to kill deer and take it away. If this keeps up, we are afraid that they will be no meat left for us.\n\n6. We understand that $15.00 was to be deposited towards the care of our school. The school is only scrubbed once a month which is done by one of our Indian women. She receives $2.00 in trade for that one cleaning period. Where is the balance of the $13.00? As far as we know only $2.00 is used each month to keep the school in order. Mrs. Hayes takes charge.\nPage IV\n\nof the school work.\n\n1. During school year, Mrs. Williams Hayes has her school children do all the sweeping etc. to keep the school in order. If that can be done by our own children, why should we put $5 out $5.60 a month to keep this school in order. At recess our children are sent out of the school yard because she keeps her dog, cows and chickens in what supposed to be a school yard. Please look into this matter. In plain English, we can't get along with Mrs. Williams Hayes. She hates the ground we walk on.\n\n& Concerning our truck.\nOttawa, September 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen Mr. Bury visited the Manitou Rapids Reserve recently, he was informed by the Chief and Council that an allowance of $15 a month is made for caretaking services and that only $2 of this amount is paid to Indians.\n\nYou should inform the Chief and Council that the Department does not allow $15 a month for caretaking services at the Manitou Rapids School. Your voucher No. 351 of March 10th, amounting to $14, covered the cost of scrubbing and cleaning the Manitou Rapids School for the calendar year 1932 and, according to that voucher, all the money expended for the purpose was paid to Indians.\n\nThe Indians also complained to Mr. Bury that the school children have no playground, as the ground set aside for this purpose is used as a pasture by Mrs. Wm. Hayes. Please let me have a complete report regarding the latter complaint and advise if you consider any action should be taken in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Bury, in regard to School Children and Play Ground,\n\nAnd in reply to same, I have to report that there is Three Acres of ground in the School Lot, and on this lot there is a combined School and Farm Inst'r Residence, an Implement shed and a stable, there is no separate ground fenced off for the children, and they have access to the whole Three Acres, the Farm Inst'r has a cow and no doubt but the cow grazes on the School lot.\n\nWe have a lot of Machinery at the Machinery shed and as the children will not keep away from the machinery, Mrs Hayes tries to keep them away, and for this reason the Indians are very sore at her.\n\nThere is a little fault on both sides, Mrs Hayes has no place to hang her clothes when she washes, and the children run all amongst her clothes, because she has to hang them in the school yard, and she gets very angry at them, and when she scolds them they go home and tell their parents.\n\nTo save all this trouble, I would recommend that a portion of this Ground be fenced off for the School Children, so that the children would know where they should be, as we cannot have them fooling with machinery and around the stable, as it is so late this fall, it could not be done, but it should be done the first thing in the spring, and by doing this I think we could avoid all trouble between the parents and Mrs Hayes.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to playground facilities for the children at the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is considered that, if tact is used by Mrs. Hayes and yourself, it would be easy to have sufficient space allotted for playgrounds on the lot surrounding the school. The question of fencing a portion of the lot for a playground might be considered next spring.

Please let me know the date of the authority for the purchase of these supplies. You should, also, state for what length of time the articles purchased will last.\n\nFor your information I may say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department has only been authorizing very limited supplies for midday meal purposes and, in addition, has only been allowing midday meals from November 1st. In connection with the Manitou Rapids School, I would point out that a reasonable supply of biscuits has already been supplied the school.\n\nPayment of the account will be withheld until your explanation is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR EWERS' REPORT ON HIS VISIT TO THE MANITOU RAPIDS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON October 13th, 1933.\n\nOriginal on File 124-3-6.\n\nThe steps leading to the Classroom should be repaired or new steps built, as the wood in the steps are practically decayed beyond repair. This matter should be attended to as soon as possible as the steps are really not safe. The steps are rather high and should any child fall from the steps, it is in danger of being more or less severely hurt.\n\nI very strongly urge the Department to continue to supply sufficient soap for the children as one of the most difficult tasks of the teacher is to inculcate the habit of cleanliness in these children.\nOttawa, November 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School on October 13th, last, draws attention to the condition of the steps leading to the classroom. He recommends that they be repaired or new ones built. He states the wood in the steps is practically decayed beyond repair and that the steps are really not safe.\n\nI have therefore to request that you will arrange to have these steps repaired and placed in a good, strong condition, at the earliest possible date. All expense for the purpose should be kept as low as possible. When the work is completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Inspector recommends, further, that the Department continue to supply sufficient soap for use by the children. You may therefore arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of the quantity of toilet soap considered by you to be absolutely necessary. Please forward a certified account, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir;\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd:- in regard to supplying midday meals for the Manitou Rapids Day School.\n\nIn reply to the same I have to report that on August 6th., 1933, letter No. 124-3-5, I was authorized to purchase cocoa and milk for midday meals at the Manitou Day School. Since that date the School children have been receiving a midday meal consisting of biscuits and cocoa, and as I was never requested to cease doing so the children have been receiving these meals at noon.\n\nThe children at the Manitou School have a long way to come to School, some as far as three miles. Often when there is nothing to eat at home their only meal is the biscuits and cocoa received at the school. It is hard to state how long the cocoa and milk will last, as it all depends on how many children attend School. The last purchase was on February 3rd. 1933, but the present purchase should last for about six months.\n\nI may have been at fault for not sending in a Requisition for purchase of these articles, but I was not aware of the purchase of the same until I received the bill. The Teacher notified the Farm Instructor that they were out of cocoa and milk for the midday meal and he at once purchased the cocoa and milk for the School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to supplying a midday meal at the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School. It has been decided to pay the account which you submitted.\n\nI note that you refer to letter of August 6, 1933, as authorizing you to purchase cocoa and milk for midday meals at the Manitou Rapids School. This is apparently a mistake, as the letter referred to was written on August 6, 1931. In this connection I would point out that circular letters which have been forwarded to you indicate that new authority should be obtained for expenditure such as this at the beginning of each fiscal year. Expenditure should not be incurred on the strength of authority issued a year or more ago.\n\nYou may authorize the teacher to continue serving cocoa at the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School until the end of March, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As this will likely involve only a small expenditure, you should arrange to have these steps repaired as soon as possible.\n\nThe Inspector reports, further, that the teacher is handicapped in endeavouring to train the children in cleanliness and tidiness, owing to no soap being provided. You should provide the soap that is necessary at this school and forward an account covering its cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

It is cracked so badly that they are smoked out when a fire is put on in the furnace.\n\nI have seen Mr. Tompkins of Emo, Ontario and he informs me that it can be fixed by taking it out and patching the crack but it would only crack again. This is because all the cold air goes in on the one side of the furnace and to stop it from cracking there would have to be two cold air pipes put in on the other side of the furnace which would cost about $100.00.\n\nI would requisition the Department for authority to have this alteration done so the School could be heated to better advantage. Mr. Tompkins claims that it would be a saving on fuel and the School could be heated not matter what direction the wind blows. At present it cannot be heated when the wind is from the west.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 25, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nMr. A.

It would require an expenditure of approximately $100.00 to have the furnace repaired and two cold air pipes installed, to provide sufficient heating facilities for the school.\n\nFunds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year. I should be pleased to be advised of the name of the firm who should carry out the repairs.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 14, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nI beg to refer you to my memorandum of the 25th ultimo, requesting to be advised of the name of the firm who should be engaged to carry out the repairs required to the furnace in the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School, Eso P.

You should therefore issue a voucher at the end of each quarter in the teacher's favour for this service at the rate mentioned. This means that, at the end of June, December and March, a voucher for $6.00 will be issued and, at the end of September, a voucher for $2.00. This will avoid the necessity of keeping receipts. The Department will expect, of course, that you will see that the school is scrubbed regularly and kept in a cleanly condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. A. G. HAMILTON,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES, ON HIS INSPECTION\nOF THE MANITOU RAPIDS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL DURING\nTHE MONTH OF APRIL, 1935.\n\nThe front steps are badly rotted and should be rebuilt. The building has not been painted outside for years and this work should be carried out this year, if possible.\n\nThe furnace was repaired last year, but is over 20 years old and operates very unsatisfactorily. A new large furnace should be provided as the two buildings contain a large air space.\nOttawa, May 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a report regarding his inspection of the Manitou Rapids Indian Day School during the month of April, Inspector Hamilton states that the front steps are badly rotted and should be rebuilt. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of repairing these steps.\n\nMr. Hamilton also states that the furnace does not operate satisfactorily. Would it be possible to repair the present furnace or do you think a new furnace is required? In either case, please let me have an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The oldest of the four provides for himself, and the grandmother looks after the three others.\n\nThere are four younger children in the family, whose ages range from 3 to 8 years; they are with their mother - her daughter - who scrubs for a living.\n\nMrs. Bernard would like if we could put some of these children in the Wikwemikong boarding school.

There are four children of her son and four of her daughter, who is a widow. The oldest boy, who is eighteen, is able to provide for himself, but the remaining seven require assistance from the Department, so she states.\n\nAs we have no knowledge of the facts, I should be glad if you would be good enough to state the circumstances. One boy is said to be a cripple and he is attending the Mattawa school, while the others are all under fourteen years of age. The Department would also like to know whether provision could be made for four of the children by the Sisters of Mattawa, if necessary, on their being paid for their maintenance and on what terms.\n\nThe Rev.

The Sisters of Matamora are at the head of a hospital and no accommodation could be found here for young children. In my opinion St. Patrick's Orphan's Home, or an industrial school would be the right place for the grandchildren of the old lady. Perhaps the four children of the widow of W. Leyton, who are under ten years of age are too young yet for an industrial school, and the Orphan's home is the only place that would suit them. These four and the boy who is a cripple are the only ones, I think, that would need assistance from the Indian Dept.\n\nHoping, dear Sir, you will find this information sufficient to act upon.\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are too young to be placed in Wikwemikong, and there is no other school available. Rev.

The Sister Superior wrote stating that they had no vacancies. I also called at St. Joseph's Orphanage and asked the same question and a reply has been received from the Sister Superior of that institution, stating that they will take them for the usual per capita grant allowed boarding schools in Ontario.

Since that time, the father, Michel Antoine has joined the Veteran's Home Guards.\n\nNone of the rest of the children on this list are the responsibility of Mattawa on account of the 18 months regulation, because they are not recognized as Indian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

This list has been carefully reviewed and it is found that only Doris Antoine is a member of a recognized Indian band. The other names mentioned on the return are not recognized as Indians by this Department.\n\nVery definite regulations have recently been made which only permit our allowing payment for recognized Indian children. Under these circumstances it will be necessary to discontinue the grant to the Mattawa Separate School. However, in order that you may have sufficient time to make any plans which you consider necessary we will continue to pay the usual grant until June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

There are four children of her son and four of her daughter, who is a widow. The oldest boy, who is eighteen, is able to provide for himself, but the remaining seven require assistance from the Department, so she states.\n\nAs we have no knowledge of the facts, I should be glad if you would be good enough to state the circumstances. One boy is said to be a cripple and he is attending the Ottawa school, while the others are all under fourteen years of age. The Department would also like to know whether provision could be made for four of the children by the Sisters of Ottawa, if necessary, on their being paid for their maintenance and on what terms.\n\nThe Rev.

The Sisters of Matamaw are at the head of a hospital and no accommodation could be found here for young children. In my opinion St. Patrick's Orphan's Home, or an industrial school would be the right place for the grandchildren of the old lady. Perhaps the four children of the widow of W.

If funds could be spared I know of no more suitable home for these children. They have some 200 children of about the same ages, who are well looked after and have every comfort and care that an institution of this kind can afford.\nThere children can be placed in the Orphanage not as per capita pupils but the funds contributed by the Dept can be estimated on the per capita basis.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, October 8, 1907.\n\nMadam\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 30, last, stating that you will receive the Indian children from Mattawa, about whom you were written to on the 27th of that month, at the rate of $60.00 each per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept your offer, and the Rev.

You should also state where the parents of these children live, and how they maintain themselves and their families, and whether any of them are liable to taxation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWoo.

Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nSIR:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter in reference to the Wallawas Reserve School, and may I respectfully inform you that I visited the school on the 1st of January, and found a total attendance of 36 children.\n\nThe parents of these children are half-breeds, who live mostly by the river, and their occupations are chiefly fishing and river trading, and working in the adjacent lumber camps.\n\nA number of these children are illiterate and I find they are taken care of by the Sisters in charge of the school.\n\nI also have the honor to report that 6 of the families from a total amount of $75 in taxes contribute the attendance at the school. I have the honor to assure you of the best results in return for your annual funds of $25 which is made by the Department of the Interior.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. A.

I think as the School is doing good work and is a factor in the civilization of the country that we might increase the grant to $300.00 a year but under the circumstances I do not think we should go beyond that.\n\nAccountant.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMemorandum for Mr. [Signature]\n\nWill you please let me have the last Inspector's Report.\n\nOttawa, January 23, 1908\nOttawa, March 13th, 1908.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nWill you please let me have a full statement regarding the grant allowed by this Department to the Mattawa School. Since what date has this been given, what was the first amount allowed, what reasons were given for increase, what do the returns show since the grant was increased.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, March 17, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of the 13th inst., I beg to say that in November, 1874, the Rev. Father Poitras, Missionary at Mattawa, applied for a grant to assist the new school he had established there, stating that there were about thirty Indian families in the neighborhood, with fifty children of school age. The department agreed to contribute $100 a year after July 1, 1875, and has paid the grant ever since then. The grant was increased to $200 from January 1, 1907, in view of the large attendance at the school, and this is the rate at which it is paid now.\n\nThe attendance at this school has always been very regular and shows an average of over 35 for the past three years, while December quarter had an enrolment of 36 with an average of 29.\n\nMr. Agent Cockburn, who visited this school on January 13, last, reported that the register showed an attendance of 36 and there were 32 present the day he visited the school. His report is turned out herewith, and shows that the school is doing good work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are educating these children for almost nothing since it costs us about $30 per child each year. We have not the taxes from the public utilities. In many cases the Indians are not paying taxes, merely squatting there are facts and for the confirmation of the above, refer you to Mr. George Coburn, Indian Agent at Sturgeon Falls. He knows the work is being done, having been here a week ago.\n\nTrusting this appeal will receive your consideration and a satisfactory response, I remain,\n\nPerfectly Yours,\n\nFather Hogan,\nMattawa, Ont.\n\nSept 17, 1923.\nOttawa, September 24th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, requesting an increase in the grant paid for the tuition of the Indian children in attendance at the Mattawa Separate School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring this matter to Mr. Agent Cockburn, Sturgeon Falls, for a report and his recommendation regarding your request. As soon as a reply is received the Department will be able to decide whether or not an increase will be allowed, and you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aast.

Father Hogan, Mattawa, for an increase in the grant paid by this Department for the tuition of the Indian children who attend the Mattawa Separate School. At present we allow the sum of $250 towards the salary of the teacher. We note that the returns show an attendance of about 50 Indian children. No doubt, a certain number of these are half breeds.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the number of bona fide Indian children who attend, also state whether their parents live in the town of Mattawa and pay taxes. I shall also be pleased if you will state whether you would recommend that the grant paid be increased, and, if so, the amount of increase you would recommend. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. P. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6142, File 406-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 43-2-1, of the 24th instant with reference to request from the Rev. Father Hogan of Mattawa, for an increase in the grant paid by the Department for the tuition of the Indian children who attend the Mattawa Separate School.\n\nI beg to report that I visited the school yesterday and report that the school register shows an attendance of 56 children of this number there are 12 considered Indians the balance being half-breeds.\n\nThe parents of the Indian children reside adjacent to the town limits in the township of Papineau and do not pay taxes. The majority of the half breed families reside in the town of Mattawa and are assessed and pay taxes to the school.\n\nDuring the summer months a small number of Indian families reside in tents adjacent to the town when their children attend school. The Rev. Father Hogan states that the Department should pay for the salary of a teacher namely $800.00 per annum, in view of the conditions I beg to recommend that the grant be increased $100.00 per annum.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Oct. 5, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the request of the Rev. Father Hogan for an increase in the grant, paid by this Department for the tuition of the Indian children who attend the Mattawa Separate School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is under no obligation for the education of the half-breed children. We note that the majority of the half-breed families reside in the town of Mattawa and are assessed and pay school taxes. As there are only 12 bona fide Indian children who attend regularly, and in view of the excellent reports received, regarding the work of this school, the Department will allow an increase of $100 per annum in the grant, from the first of September, last, the beginning of the present school year. This will make the grant allowed from that date at the rate of $350 per annum, which is considered ample remuneration for the number of Indian children who attend. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Rev. Father Hogan and the school authorities accordingly.\n\nIn preparing the quarterly returns, only the names of the bona fide Indian children who attend should be included and no half-breed children should be mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Aest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeo. P. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls,\nOnt.\nJune 16, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWhen I was in the Nipissing agency in May, I enquired if our grant of $350.00 was sufficient towards the cost of the Mattawa combined White and Indian Day School. Mr. Cockburn informed me that there were really only 4 or 5 families of Treaty Indians and that this grant was sufficient.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\nSturgeon Falls, August 24th, 1940\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 21st, concerning grant to Mattawa Combined School, I have to advise you that at present there are no Indian children, for whom the Indian Department is responsible, attending school in Mattawa.\n\nThe only family on the Nipissing list with children of an age to attend school are the Michel Antoine's, No. 122, living in Mattawan Township, and they do not go to school. Moreover, under the 18 months regulation, the Department does not assume responsibility in any way for this family as they are living in organized territory.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if I should still advise the Mattawa School Board of the grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of your explanation, it will not be necessary for you to advise the Mattawa School Board with respect to a departmental grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of August 24 and my reply of August 27 in connection with the grant which has been made for several years to the Mattawa Separate School.\n\nThe September return of this school has just been received and I am enclosing it with this letter. Please indicate the children who are recognized as Indians. From the information contained in your letter of August 24 I presume that none of the children shown on the return reside on an Indian reserve but that all of them have for some years been squatting on land in the vicinity of Mattawa. In view of the fact that this grant has been allowed for several years it may be difficult to discontinue it immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nSturgeon Falls, October 22nd, 1940\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 16th with reference to attached September return from Mattawa Separate School, I have to advise you that there is only one recognized Indian child on this list.\n\nDoris Antoine, Aged 8 years, daughter of Michel Antoine, No. 122, Nipissing Robinson Treaty list. This family live in Mattawan Township and Doris should be attending the Township school. Although relief was paid to this family for years, the Department discontinued all relief to them last May and they were the responsibility of the Township of Mattawan. Since that time, the father, Michel Antoine has joined the veteran's home guards.\n\nNone of the rest of the children on this list are the responsibility of Mattawa on account of the 18 months regulation, because they are not recognized as Indian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOctober 28, 1940.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have recently reviewed the September quarter return showing the names of children who are presumed to be Indians and are attending the Mattawa Separate School. This list has been carefully reviewed and it is found that only Doris Antoine is a member of a recognized Indian band. The other names mentioned on the return are not recognized as Indians by this Department.\n\nVery definite regulations have recently been made which only permit our allowing payment for recognized Indian children. Under these circumstances it will be necessary to discontinue the grant to the Mattawa Separate School. However, in order that you may have sufficient time to make any plans which you consider necessary we will continue to pay the usual grant until June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

These four children's ages range from 10 to 18. The oldest of the four provides for himself, and the grandmother looks after the three others.\n\nThere are four younger children in the family, whose ages range from 3 to 8 years; they are with their mother - her daughter - who scrubs for a living.\n\nMrs. Bernard would like if we could put some of these children in the Wikwemikong boarding school.

Sirs\u2014\n\nMrs. Catherine Bernard, of Ottawa, called at the Department today in company with her daughter and asked that her grandchildren be taken care of by the Department. There are four children of her son and four of her daughter, who is a widow. The oldest boy, who is eighteen, is able to provide for himself, but the remaining seven require assistance from the Department, so she states.\n\nAs we have no knowledge of the facts, I should be glad if you would be good enough to state the circumstances. One boy is said to be a cripple and he is attending the Ottawa school, while the others are all under fourteen years of age. The Department would also like to know whether provision could be made for four of the children by the Sisters of Ottawa, if necessary, on their being paid for their maintenance and on what terms.\n\nThe Rev.

July 15th, 1907\n\nTo the Secretary of the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe statement made at your Office by Mrs. Catherine Bernard, as to her grandchildren, is correct. The Sisters of Mattawa are at the head of a hospital and no accommodation could be found here for young children. In my opinion St. Patrick's Orphan's Home, or an industrial school would be the right place for the grandchildren of the old lady. Perhaps the four children of the widow of W. Leyton, who fall under ten years of age are too young yet for an industrial school, and the Orphan's Home is the only place that would suit them. These four and the boy who is a cripple are the only ones, I think, that would need assistance from the Indian Dept.\n\nHoping, dear Sir, you will find this information sufficient to act upon,\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Sister Superior wrote stating that they had no vacancies. I also called at St. Joseph's Orphanage and asked the same question and a reply has been received from the Sister Superior of that institution, stating that they will take them for the usual per capita grant allowed boarding schools in Ontario.

As there are only 12 bona fide Indian children who attend regularly, and in view of the excellent reports received, regarding the work of this school, the Department will allow an increase of $100 per annum in the grant, from the first of September, last, the beginning of the present school year. This will make the grant allowed from that date at the rate of $350 per annum, which is considered ample remuneration for the number of Indian children who attend. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Rev. Father Hogan and the school authorities accordingly.\n\nIn preparing the quarterly returns, only the names of the bona fide Indian children who attend should be included and no half-breed children should be mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeo. P. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6142, File 406-1 part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWhen I was in the Nipissing agency in May, I enquired if our grant of $350.00 was sufficient towards the cost of the Mattawa combined White and Indian Day School. Mr. Cockburn informed me that there were really only 4 or 5 families of Treaty Indians and that this grant was sufficient.\n\nRussell Y. Ferrier\nSturgeon Falls, August 24th, 1940\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 21st, concerning grant to Mattawa Combined School, I have to advise you that at present there are no Indian children, for whom the Indian Department is responsible, attending school in Mattawa.\n\nThe only family on the Nipissing list with children of an age to attend school are the Michel Antoinettes, No. 122, living in Mattawan Township, and they do not go to school. Moreover, under the 18 months regulation, the Department does not assume responsibility in any way for this family as they are living in organized territory.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if I should still advise the Mattawa School Board of the grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of your explanation, it will not be necessary for you to advise the Mattawa School Board with respect to a departmental grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of August 24 and my reply of August 27 in connection with the grant which has been made for several years to the Mattawa Separate School.\n\nThe September return of this school has just been received and I am enclosing it with this letter. Please indicate the children who are recognized as Indians. From the information contained in your letter of August 24 I presume that none of the children shown on the return reside on an Indian reserve but that all of them have for some years been squatting on land in the vicinity of Mattawa. In view of the fact that this grant has been allowed for several years it may be difficult to discontinue it immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nSturgeon Falls, October 22nd, 1940\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 16th, with reference to attached September return from Mattawa Separate School, I have to advise you that there is only one recognized Indian child on this list.\n\nDoris Antoine, Aged 8 years, daughter of Michel Antoine, No. 122, Nipissing Robinson Treaty list. This family live in Mattawan Township and Doris should be attending the Township school. Although relief was paid to this family for years, the Department discontinued all relief to them last May and they were the responsibility of the Township of Mattawan. Since that time, the father, Michel Antoine has joined the veteran's home guards.\n\nNone of the rest of the children on this list are the responsibility of Mattawa on account of the 18 months regulation, because they are not recognized as Indian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOctober 28, 1940.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have recently reviewed the September quarter return showing the names of children who are presumed to be Indians and are attending the Mattawa Separate School. This list has been carefully reviewed and it is found that only Doris Antoine is a member of a recognized Indian band. The other names mentioned on the return are not recognized as Indians by this Department.\n\nVery definite regulations have recently been made which only permit our allowing payment for recognized Indian children. Under these circumstances it will be necessary to discontinue the grant to the Mattawa Separate School. However, in order that you may have sufficient time to make any plans which you consider necessary we will continue to pay the usual grant until June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As the Indians are so anxious to have a new school the Department would like to know whether they would be willing to have the amount necessary taken from the capital funds of the band for this purpose. As no estimate has been furnished with regard to the probable cost of repairs or of the new building but in submitting the question to the Band, it would be well for you to ask them to consent to a sum sufficient to put up a modern structure suitable for the requirements of the Day and Boarding School pupils.\n\nAs the season for buildings is growing late I would be glad if you will attend to this matter at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P. Hodder, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nSecretary.\nFort William, 13th, October, 1902.\n\nWe the Indians of the Fort William Band assembled in council hereby agree to pay for the erection of a modern school building from the funds of our Band, said building to be about 70 x 30 feet on stone foundation, and we hereby appoint Chief Moses McKay, and Councillors Frank Williams and J.

Secretary-\n\nA School building erected in accordance with the sketch forwarded with Agent Hodder's letter of the 14th Instant, would be expensive and unsightly. It would also be difficult and expensive to keep it warm. I think it altogether objectionable, and would advise that it be not approved.\n\nA two story building giving the same space, could have a very pleasing outward appearance, and be commodiously arranged inside. The cost of erection would be at least one fifth less, and the heating arrangement would involve less immediate and future expense. The cost of such a building should not exceed $2600.00. That is to say, it is to be a frame building erected on a stone foundation.\n\nIt is proposed that the building should be heated with a wood furnace. This involves the construction of a furnace pit, and necessarily a drain therefrom. The point should be settled whether the site on which the building is to be erected is a favourable one for the construction of a drain.\n\nIn the event of it being so, I would recommend that as the extra cost would not be very great (less than $200.00) that the entire basement be excavated. This will add to the warmth of the building, a room for the storage of wood, and a play room for the boys, besides the\nthe necessary furnace room.\n\nWith regard to preparing Plans and Specifications I beg to state that I would be glad to prepare them in my Office, as we have occasionally done heretofore, but we have so much work on hand that we positively cannot undertake this, without dropping other work equally urgent.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, an Architect residing at or near the place, would be more competent because better locally informed, to draw up the Plans and Specifications for a suitable building. In any case, if the Plans and Specifications were made here, it would be desirable to employ a local Architect to oversee the work. I therefore beg to recommend that a local Architect be employed to get up the necessary Plans and Specifications, and to superintend the work.\n\nChief Surveyor-\n\nSam Bray\nOttawa, 31st October, 1902.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., inclosing a resolution of the Port William Band consenting to funds being taken from their capital for the erection of a new school-house, together with a rough sketch of such a building as the Band desire to have put up; and in reply I beg to inform you that before the Department can obtain the necessary authority from His Excellency the Governor General in Council it will require to be furnished with an approximate estimate of the cost of the proposed new school, as a specific amount has to be included in the memorandum that is prepared for Council.\n\nIn order that you may arrive at the probable cost of a suitable building you may consult the local builder as to the amount which it would be necessary to provide.\n\nIn regard to the sketch furnished, the Department considers that a two-storey building would be more economical and would suit the requirements better than one of the dimensions furnished, for the reason that it would be more easily heated and would separate the class-rooms to better advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Kindly attend to this matter at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nJ. F. Hodder, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have seen all the principal builders and they say that there is no possibility of their undertaking any more work this fall, the building of elevators in the two towns and great number of houses under construction has put them behind in their contracts, it not being possible to secure sufficient labor, they would also like to see a plan before making a figure.\n\nTo give the Indians all the benefit possible from the building of the school house I think it would be advisable to have it constructed of stone, which could be taken out this winter, thus giving them employment for some time when they have little chance to get employment, the cost I am informed would be nearly equal, if the Department has not plans under way they could be made out here by a competent Architect who would oversee the construction of the building, and everything could be arranged to make an early start next spring.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the proposed erection of a new schoolhouse on the Fort William reserve; and in reply I beg to say that as you were previously advised, it will be necessary for the Department to have a rough estimate of the probable cost of the building the Band wish to have put up, as a definite sum must be stated in the memorandum submitted to Council. As soon as this information is received, the Department will be in a position deal with your suggestion that the Indians should be allowed to take out stone during the winter for the building. The Department would like to know how much a toise the stone would cost laid down at the site, as well as what a local architect would likely charge for preparing the plans and superintending the work of construction. The Department has no knowledge of the cost of material in this locality and there should be no difficulty in getting the estimate asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.

He strongly recommended the erection of a new building without delay as it would be poor economy to patch up so unsuitable a building as the old one. (Report on 153815----6 herewith)\n\nIn addition to the day pupils on the reserve who are attending this school, the children from the Orphanage are also taught there, all being classified together as a graded school with two teachers. There are about 70 children of school age on the reserve, and 36 in the Orphanage, and of these 72 are enrolled with an average attendance of 47 for last year.\n\nMr Agent Hodder's attention was called to the Inspector's remarks and he was asked for a report thereon making suggestions as to any improvements he thought might be made. He replied stating that the building is not large enough for the present attendance and is in a very bad state of repair, and that in his opinion it would be advisable to erect a new one. A resolution was passed by the Band for the erection of a modern school building to be paid for out.\nout of their funds. A sketch of the building it was proposed to put up was forwarded, which provided for a one-story structure but no estimate of the cost was given. The Department informed the Agent that it was considered a two-story building would be more suitable and economical and asked him to furnish a rough estimate of the probable cost, as such information was required before a memorandum could be submitted to Council.\n\nThe Agent now forwards a resolution of the Band asking that the sum of $5000.00 be set aside from their funds for a new schoolhouse, which they would prefer to have built of stone.\n\nAs the capital funds of the Band are less than $9000.00 I think it would be well to have a report from the Accountant before submitting the matter to Council as a stone building such as they want would, when finished and properly equipped, leave a very small balance to their credit.\n\nIt is some years since I saw the present building when then appeared to be substantial and capable of enlargement. The Mission buildings are all first class stone structures and it is no doubt the desire of the missionary and the Indians to have a school in keeping with them.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The building is a frame one and the outside boards are so rotten in many places that they will not hold together. The foundation also has given way so that the building has sunk and in consequence there are large openings at the tops of the doors which must let in a great deal of cold in winter. The floors too are badly worn, and, in fact, the whole building is, in my opinion, unfit for use as a school.\n\nIn addition to the fact that the building is in such a bad state of repair I have also to say that it is altogether too small to accommodate the number of pupils, between 70 and 80, who attend.\n\nThe seats are so close together that it must be very uncomfortable for the children to sit in them. The box-stove also which is used to heat the building almost fills up the width of the hall and must add to the discomfort of the pupils whose seats are in its vicinity.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOTTAWA, 2nd September, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nAs there is urgent need of some action being taken in regard to providing a new school building for the Fort William Indians, I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the probable cost of a new wooden building as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nL.U.

(RG 10, Volume 6142, File 406-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nThe estimate given me by contractor Hamer of this town on a two story building at the Fort William Mission as follows:\n\nWooden Building 30 by 30 with stone foundation, 7 feet Basement, Furnace, Hard-Wood Flooring, one class room on each floor $2650.00\n\nWooden Building 30 by 30 with no basement and no stone foundation $2000.00\n\nI think that if I were to call for Tenders the building might be built at a little less cost than this estimate.\n\nWith regard to the building of this school there is considerable dissatisfaction that exists among the members of the Band. They say that a good number of the children who attend the school are children from other bands, and that if the building is built it should be paid not all out of their funds. They even go so far as to say that rather than have it built all out of their fund, they would rather not have it built at all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 22nd September, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe day school building on the Ft. William reserve is in very bad condition and from reports received from the Agent, the Inspector and Mr Stewart of this Department (who was lately there) it would appear that a new building is absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Ft. William Band two years ago wished to expend the sum of $5000.00 out of their capital funds for the purpose of providing a new schoolhouse. The Accountant pointed out in his memo. of 5th Jan. 1903, that their capital would not stand this outlay as they had only about $9,000.00 to their credit, which produced a revenue of a little less than $300.00.\n\nMr Agent Bonin who was lately asked to furnish an estimate for a new wooden building, instead of one of stone, and he states that, with a stone foundation and suitable basement, it would cost $2,650.00 and without a basement $2,000.00. He says that the Indians are now not satisfied to take even this amount from their capital, claiming that a number of the children who attend this school come from other Bands.\n\nThere is no doubt that a new schoolhouse is required. The children in the Orphanage all attend this school which has also to provide for the day pupils on the reserve and it is just a question of how much the band should be asked to contribute. I\nwould certainly recommend that the building have a basement and stone foundation.

Hemin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAs I have lately visited the school house on the Indian Reserve at Fort William, Ontario, desire to place before you after facts to show the necessity of providing a new building. The present building which is of wood, is so long built and the walls and joints are so decayed that it would be too costly to repair. There are only two rooms, one of which is 20' x 25'6\" and into that space are crowded from fifty-three to sixty junior pupils. The other room is 20' x 23', and there normally in it from thirty to thirty-eight senior pupils.\n\nLast winter there was an epidemic of typhoid fever amongst the children so much so that the Sisters were obliged to close the school and send the boarders home to their parents. Considering the unsanitary conditions the size of the school rooms I am not surprised that sickness prevailed and I fear it may happen again notwithstanding the precautions adopted by the Sisters.\n\nTrusting that you will be pleased to order the erection of a new school house.\n\nI remain your truly,\n\n+ P.M.

The school at Squaw Bay should be large enough to accommodate the pupils of the Boarding School as it now exists. $500.00 was the evaluation placed on the present school building, if I remember well. Price of lumber is going up all the time, and we expect that there will be a great jump in March as the building prospect is very great, and lumber very scarce. Just now there is only the Pigeon River Lumber Co. in Fort William that can supply lumber in large quantity and deliver at Squaw Bay. They are hauling just now for our residence, church, etc., and soon for the Boarding School.\n\nYours truly in Xst,\nRev. P. E. Lamarche, S. J.,\nSup. of the School.\n\nThe Mission, Fort William, Ont.\nOttawa, March 26, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Rev. Father Lamarche has written the Department with reference to the establishment of day schools for the Fort William band at Squaw Bay and the Mountain, and he says that a new building will be required at Squaw Bay to accommodate day pupils and the children in attendance at the Orphanage and that one will also be needed at the Mountain for the Indians who are settled there.\n\nThe Department would like you to make enquiries with a view to ascertaining what size of school-house would be needed at Squaw Bay and also whether a sufficient number of children of school age will be at the Mountain to justify the Department in putting up a building there. Your report should state the probable number of pupils that would be in attendance at each place. The Department would also like you to obtain prices for the following building material for May delivery, as well as the cost of labour for the different trades:\n\n- 2x4 10 and 12 studding.\n- 2x6 \" and rafters.\n- 2x8 joists, all lengths.\n- 2x10 \"\n- 2x12 \"\n- Flooring, 1\" and 1\u00bd\".\n- Shingles.\n- Rough Boarding.\n- Shingles.\n- Drop Siding and Laths.\n- Brushed lumber for cornices, etc.\n- Stone, Sand, Lime and Cement.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nIn further reference to the proposed establishment of day schools for the Fort William band at their new locations I beg to say that, after April 1, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year, the grant now paid to the two teachers at the Fort William Orphanage will cease, and the money now voted for these teachers will be paid to the teachers of the day schools at Squaw Bay and the Mountain when established.\n\nAs there is a temporary school in operation at present at Squaw Bay, one teacher's salary only will be paid at Fort William and this will be continued at Squaw Bay, and if a school is established at the Mountain, the other salary will be used to pay a teacher there.\n\nIn boarding schools under the per capita grant system no allowance is made for teachers' salaries, and the Department's only reason for continuing the grant is that day pupils are in attendance and it is willing to allow the salary of one teacher for instructing these pupils.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI see that the schools to be built at Mission Bay and at the Mountain for the Indians of this Reserve will not be ready for opening at the usual time. Will this delay affect the salary of the teachers?\n\nI had secured the services of a teacher early in June for the Mountain school. She would have accepted another position if she thought that the salary would be less than $300.00.\n\nI would like to have an answer from the Dept. about the salary before I make any agreement for the Mission Bay school.\n\nThe Indians of that place would like to have a man teacher, but we could not get a man teacher for the ordinary salary of $300.00.\n\nShe may obtain help, if none of the ladies who conducted the Waskwemikong Girls' school, if the Sisters of Saint Joseph do not decide after all to build at Mission Bay, but I could not say when we could obtain those ladies.\n\nI met Mr. Ogilvie, architect of the Dept., last week at Mission Bay and he told me that a separate\nhouse from the school is to be built for the teacher's accommodation. And the school is to be heated by a furnace, according to a law passed by the Government. But we cannot expect a girl teacher to attend to the furnace; and this will mean a double quantity of fuel at both places.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nRev. C.

It is now paying the teacher at Squaw Bay and a salary for the Orphanage, and until the Mountain School is opened no payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.D.

I wanted to know if the salaries of the teachers would be diminished on account of the delay to build the schools. I received an answer but not to the purpose. Early in June I retained the services of one teacher for the Mountain school, and she refused an offer of $300.00 with boarding for the Wikwemikong Girls' school, because she preferred to remain near her sister at Fort William, if the salary was the same, viz: $300.00. I have to look for another teacher for the Mission Bay and would like to know what salary can be offered for the rest of the year.\n\nI think that it would be hard to obtain a teacher for less than $300.00, even considering that the first quarter will soon be over.\n\nYour very humble servant in Xst,\n\nSgd.

I am sure he would fill the place as he don't do anything else. And he is leaving his position when he is just because we were sure of giving him sure promise of staying here. And the Band of this place will be greatly dissatisfied if the Indian Department refusing you will favour us and I know with a little help from you we will be sure he will be granted the position.

Please have Mr. Long take charge for the Mission school, and Mr. McCay or Mr. Ducheine for the other school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.M. Bugees s.j.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nPort Arthur, Feb. 27, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nThere has been no school at Mission Bay since last spring. Rev. Father Dugas in his letter attached recommends Mr. Jerry Alire as teacher at Mission Bay and that Mrs. Alex. McCoy be given the school at the Mountain till they can get Dominie Ducharme to come. He is now teaching school at the Ashland reserve Wis. If the Dept. did not wish to open the school at the Mountain till spring I do not see why any of the children could not attend the Mission school which is only half a mile away. The latter will likely have to give up their premises in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nNeil McDougall,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 10, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 37th ult., I beg to say that, before agreeing to the appointment of Mr. Jerry Alire as teacher of the Mission Bay school, the Department desires further information in regard to his qualifications for the position. If he holds a teacher's certificate, the class should be stated, and, if not, the Department should be advised as to what special qualifications he has that would entitle him to be placed in charge of this school.\n\nAs the Mission school is only half-a-mile distant from the Mountain, the Department sees no reason why the children in that neighborhood cannot attend this school till such time as the premises are vacated.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMission Bay March 17th 1808\n\nMr. J. D. McClean\nSec. Ind. Dept.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Indian Agent by you I see that the Department desires to have further information in regard to the qualifications of Mr. Jerry Hila for the position of school teacher at Mission Bay. First I must say that if I had not known the man to be well qualified for the position I would not have recommended him, for if any one is anxious to have a competent school teacher for the children of this mission you may be sure that I am very anxious to have a good school teacher if possible.\n\nNow I must say that Mr. J. Hila holds no school teachers certificate, but that he has made a complete commercial course of studies in one of the best schools in Quebec, moreover he has been for two years in the employ of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. as book keeper & otherwise in offices. I beg to say that you may have all the references needed from the following C.P.R. officers: James Campbell, Cashier on Selkirk division, A. G. McCall, Chief accountant.\nat White River), W. B. Way, train master at White River, J. S. Kent chief clerk to the Superintendent also at White River and C. S. Rogers, C.P.R. agent, White River.\n\nBesides these men, who could give recommendations as to the capacity of Mr. Alice, I have to say that I know him personally for nearly three years, and from that can judge I am positive that Mr. Alice is far better qualified to fill the position of school teacher than any of those who have heretofore been appointed by the Department to be teachers in any of the Indian schools or the numerous missions that I was in charge of for over nine years.\n\nI hope Mr. the Secretary that this will be enough to induce the Dept. to place Mr. Alice in charge of this school notwithstanding what the Indians may have or may write contrary to my statement. I humbly think that I am a better judge than them in the matter.\n\nI send this letter directly to the Dept. because I am afraid the Agent neglects to do so, and can tell by the dates on the letters received by him from the Dept. I wrote to him first on 25th January, and I see on your letter that he only forwarded my letter on the 27th Feb., since then I went four times to Port Arthur to see, but could never find him in his office.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

So the man was working for us last winter. I tried to induce him to teach school here, for a long time he refused but at last consented to accept the position, it is then that I recommended him because I am very anxious to have the best teacher possible for our school, and I think it would be hard to find anyone better qualified for the position than he is.\n\nMr. Alan has been for two years in the employ of the C.P.R. as book keeper and other wise in offices. You may have all the references needed from the following offices: James Coughlan, Roadmaster, Schreiber; A. J. McColl, chief accountant at White River; W. B. Way, train master White River; E. E. Hart, city clerk to the Superintendent White River, and also E. B. Beeson, post master White River. By these you can see that Mr. Alan...\nis well known by people who can judge of his capacity as a scholar, far better than some Indians who may write or have written contrary to my statement.\n\nAs to the school at the foot of the mountain, I do not see any need of opening before the sisters close their own school, but I would like to have Dominic Ducharme appointed for that school so that he could begin to teach as soon as the sisters close their school. No matter what the old Bible says I am afraid that there will be very few children attending that school, and I say that because experience of nine years has taught me that nearly none of the children now residing at the Mountain have ever attended school, but I am very willing to give them a fair trial and if they were to go to school I will be very, very glad.\n\nPlease Mr. Agent, try to have Mr. Ducharme appointed for Mission Bay school as soon as possible, at the same time he will continue to teach and I will pay him myself if the Agent refuses, which I am sure the Agent will not do.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nL.V.

Lea\nDept. Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMme Ducharme has been teaching school on the mountain road for a month by the order of Mr. Macdonald and from the 14th of June to the 27th June here at this Bay also with the approval of the Indian Agent. Mr. Macdonald told Mme Ducharme that he could not be paid for his teaching, that seems to me very strange, when the Agent told Mme Ducharme to teach she promised him that he would be paid alright for his teaching. I wish that you would try to something to have justice done in favor of Mme Ducharme.\n\nOn June 12th Mr. Macdonald wrote to me that Mme Ducharme could teach here if I wanted her as the Agent did not approve of the school being open on the mountain road. I had Mme Ducharme to teach here at once, and wrote to Port Arthur to tell Mr. Macdonald, but as usual he was not in his office so I wrote at least seven times to Port Arthur to see your Agent and could never find him. I wrote to him about the 28th of June notifying that Mme Ducharme was teaching here, and to please arrange with the Dept. to have him pay appointed...\nbut I never had any answer from him. Mr. Doughty went several times to see the school when he was lucky enough to see him. Mr. Doughty always told him to continue teaching, nor the man should be paid by all means.\n\nI wish also to tell the fact that the teacher does not seem to care at all about the school building here at the Bay and on the mountain road near. If those buildings be finished and the chimney in the teacher's house here at the Bay is about to fall down, the bricks are all loose at the back in the cellar. Mr. Doughty will do his very utmost for the Indians should he that those houses be finished and the chimney would at once.\n\nThe road from the old mission to here is in a very bad condition. We let the men who were to be willing to do anything to finish the road. As you know we will have to move the crops from the old to the new cemetery this fall, and it is pretty near impossible to carry these crops over a road like the one we have. In the spring the bridges were fixed up the worst, Mr. Doughty had them repaired at last, and always has men to work on the road for days repairing bridges and putting sand over the stones in the way. I wish to say it would cost again at least two or three weeks work to be done in the road here to all that would enable us to transport the crops from the old to the new grave-yard without wrecking everything and the dust would be so bad. Has he promised that next week to the Indians that they would have a good road.\n\nHoping that you will do your best in that city of our poor Indians, I remain your truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department cannot approve of the re-opening of a school in the teacher's residence at Mission Bay until full particulars are received as to the accommodation that could be provided, and the cost of fitting up the class room.\n\nThe Department would like to receive full particulars regarding the provision of educational facilities for the children at Mountain Road, if it was decided to close that school. You state they could attend a separate school in West Fort providing street railway fares were paid. I may say that this arrangement does not meet with approval, as the Department does not consider it advisable to have children travelling to and fro each day on the street railway. Full particulars should be given before the Department can come to a decision regarding the request submitted by you.\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of August 2nd, reporting the destruction by fire of the Mission Bay School and stating that you were taking up with the Insurance Company the matter of the collection of the insurance on this building, which amounted to $1,000.

If it were used as a classroom there would be no accommodation for a teacher. Besides, it is considered that it would be necessary to still conduct the school at Mountain Road to provide educational facilities for the children residing on that part of the Reserve. The Department recognizes the need of a school at Mission Bay, as Mr. Bennett, the Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mountain Village school stated that there were 20 children at Mission Bay for whom school facilities should be provided.\n\nAt the present time we have no funds available for the erection of a new school building at Mission Bay and until such is available, the question of erecting a building and providing educational facilities at this point will have to remain in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The expenditure involved should not exceed your estimate, namely, $200, and you may arrange with a competent contractor, or the Indians, if they are competent to do the work, to make the necessary alterations.\n\nIf any material is required, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before the purchase is made, or you may call for tenders, which should include all material and labour, and give the contract to the person quoting you the lowest price.\n\nThe accounts, when received, will be paid from the money received for the insurance on the former school building.\n\nThis work should be undertaken as soon as possible in order that the building will be ready for occupation after the present summer holidays on or about September 1st, next.\n\nAs you were informed, the school at Mountain Village is to be closed at the end of the present school year, and the school furniture, desks, etc., should be removed from that school to fit up the school at Mission Bay.\n\nIt will be necessary to rent a house as a teacher's residence, and your suggestion that one of the vacant houses\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nobtained is approved. You should arrange for the rental of one of these houses as a teacher's residence, and this should be obtained at as low a rental as possible. You should obtain and forward a lease of this house from the 1st of September, next.\n\nIn fitting up this residence, the furniture and other supplies should be moved from the residence at present occupied by the teacher at Mountain Village.\n\nThe Department hopes that you will be able to complete all arrangements for the re-opening of the school at Mission Bay, and for the necessary alterations to the teacher's residence, and also be able to rent another residence and have it ready for the teacher by the 1st of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nRe teacher for the Mission Bay School.\n\nJ.A. Fushomme, the present teacher at the Mountain Road School would be prepared to take charge of the Mission Bay School but he requires a salary of $900.00.\n\nHe would like to know soon as possible if his services will be required or not.\n\nIn event of Mr. Fushomme not being engaged I would point out that it would not be necessary to rent a separate building for a residence if a young woman is employed as she could either live in the rooms above or board with one of the Indians as the former teachers did.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 12, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to a teacher for the Mission Bay Indian Day School. It is noted that Mr. Prudhomme would require a salary at the rate of $900.00 a year to take charge of this school.\n\nThe Department only allow salary at this school at the rate of $550.00 plus bonus. Kindly advise Mr. Prudhomme accordingly, and, if he wishes to accept, we will approve of his appointment. In the event of his not accepting, you should endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher. The names, qualifications, religion, etc. of all applicants should be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nThe services of a female teacher should, if possible, be secured, and it is noted that, if this is done, it will not be necessary to rent a separate building for a residence, as she could live in the rooms above the school, or board with one of the Indians.\n\nKindly inform us as soon as possible as to whether Mr. Prudhomme will remain, or not, at the salary allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nFort William\nAug 1, 1922\n\nMr. W. R.

Prudhomme\nSir,\n\nEnclose herewith notice from S. A. Pinahomme to effect that his services will not be available for the Mission Bay School.\n\nIf a young woman is secured to fill this position she could either live in the same building where school is to be held (the teachers residence) or she might board with a half breed woman.\n\nKindly advise if you will secure a young woman for this position or whether the resident priest be advised to make a recommendation.\n\nSchool should commence September 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 10, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. S. A. Prudhomme, in which he states that he will not be able to accept the position of Teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School, which it is intended to re-open after the present summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I have to request that you will endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable teacher for this school. It would be advisable for you to consult the resident priest, who may be able to recommend a suitable person. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicant secured should be forwarded immediately for the approval of the Department. If a teacher can be secured, having at least a Second Class Certificate, we would be prepared to provide a higher salary than that mentioned in official letter of June 12th. The salary allowed will depend on the qualifications of the teacher you are able to secure.\n\nKindly give this matter your prompt attention, in order that a teacher can be obtained in time to re-open the school on or about the 5th of September. It is considered that a woman teacher would be best for this school, as it might be possible for her to get boarding accommodation near the school. If not, quarters will have to be fitted up for her in the building in which it is intended to carry on the school work.\n\nYou will also be good enough to see that this building is ready for classroom work in due time. Any supplies, in the way of desks, etc., could be taken from the Mountain School. The Department will rely on you to see that the building is ready in time for classroom purposes and that every effort will be made to obtain a suitable teacher. You should give these matters your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H.

Father Renaud is unable to recommend a teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have no applications here from which to select a suitable teacher. If Father Renaud is unable to obtain a teacher, it may be necessary for you to advertise in a local paper in Fort William for a qualified teacher.\n\nIf a teacher with the necessary qualifications is obtained, the Department will allow salary at the rate of $600 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. I may say that the bonus to teachers in Indian Day Schools for the present fiscal year only, ending March 31, 1923, is being paid at the rate of $15.00 per month for each of the ten teaching months.\n\nIf you can obtain a teacher who you consider is satisfactory you may engage his or her services, and you should immediately inform the Department as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangement you can, and it is hoped that you will be able to obtain a suitable teacher in order that the school may be opened as soon as possible after the 5th of September, next.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a Roman Catholic teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

We could not approve of the appointment of Mrs. Ladouceur. She taught the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School and, while there, acted in a very strange manner, keeping herself locked in the school and giving no service to the Department or to the Indian Band. It was necessary for us to have our Agent remove her from the school. In view of our experience with her at Whitefish Lake, we consider that she would be entirely unsuitable as teacher in an Indian school.\n\nWe are writing Mr. Agent Burk, Port Arthur, and requesting him, if Miss Flanagan gives up her duties, to endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable teacher.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., 9-2-1, regarding an application received from Miss Nellie Whelan of Ottawa, for an appointment as teacher in this Agency, and in reply I beg to advise I have so far been unable to secure a teacher for the Fort William or Gull Bay Schools. Consequently I advertised in the Toronto Globe for teachers.\n\nThe Fort William Indian Day School is situated at Squaw Bay, Fort William Reserve, a distance of 4 miles from the City of Fort William.\n\nThe school residence is comfortably furnished. The teacher can always arrange, when visiting Fort Arthur or Fort William, to come in with one of the Indians who are constantly going in to the City with their automobiles.\n\nThe Gull Bay School is situated on the west side of Lake Nipigon, approximately 75 miles from the C. & R. Railway station at Orient Bay. This school will be furnished and equipped by the end of November.\n\nI would suggest that Miss Nellie Whelan's application be accepted for the Mission Bay Day School, Fort William, Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 24, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your application of the 9th instant and to your interview yesterday with Mr. Ferrier, I have to inform you that you are appointed teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School, near Fort William. Salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month will be allowed. It is understood that you will leave Ottawa on the C. P. R., early Sunday morning, November 3rd (1.10 A.M.), and will detrain at Port Arthur, reporting to Mr. Indian Agent J. G. Burk, of that city, at 9 o'clock Monday morning, at his office, which is near the railway station.\n\nThe Mission Bay Indian Day School is controlled entirely by this Department but is inspected semi-annually, at our request, by Separate School Inspector F. J. McDonald. Mr. Burk will draw your attention to the regulations, as contained on the classroom register and the quarterly returns. Anything that you require in your work should be brought to the attention of Mr. Burk, to whom you will look for advice concerning the conduct of the school.\n\nPlease acknowledge this letter, accepting the post and confirming the arrangement. Later, before leaving for the West, you should telephone Queen-3000, Local 297, for an appointment with Mr. Ferrier, for the purpose of receiving final instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Nellie Whelan,\n86 Empress Ave.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 210-8A of the 19th instant, and, in reply, I wish to inform you that the Department has appointed Miss Nellie Whelan to the position of teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School. Miss Whelan will leave Ottawa early Sunday morning, November 3rd, arriving in Port Arthur Monday morning, and will report to your office at 9 o'clock. Please take her out to the school and give her every possible assistance as she starts her new work. Salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month will be allowed in her case. Miss Whelan is a second class professional, with several years' experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nFort Arthur, Ont.\n86 Empress Ave., Ottawa,\n10, 25, 29.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th instant, No. 9-13-1, I wish to say that I accept the post as teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School at a salary of ninety-five dollars per teaching month.\n\nI shall be ready to leave Ottawa on the C.P.R. early Sunday morning, November 3rd, and will report to Mr. Indian agent J.G. Burke, as advised.\n\nHoping to give satisfactory service in my new work,\n\nI am\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nNellie M. Kelan.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Whelan informed the inspector if it would be possible to locate a teacher for the Mission Bay School she would be pleased to make the change as the Mission school was frightfully isolated and the life very lonely.\n\nDuring the past 2 months, the former teacher at Squaw Bay, Miss Lavelle, who was appointed as Field Matron, has been feeling her duties much too strenuous. She consulted Dr. Gillie, our Indian physician, who advised her strongly to discontinue the Field Matron's work, and try and get back to teaching. Miss Lavelle resigned her position as Field Matron on Saturday, March 15th, and has been reinstated at the Mission Bay Indian School.\n\nMiss Whelan resigned the same day to accept the new position in Fort William.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 21, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department that Miss Nellie Whelan has given up duties as teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School to accept a position as teacher in Fort William, and that you have arranged with Miss C. M. Lavelle, who formerly taught this school and who has recently been performing field matron's work, to again take up teaching duties after Miss Whelan's resignation. The Department will approve of the re-engagement of Miss Lavelle from the 15th instant, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, the same as was allowed her when she formerly taught this school.\n\nPayment of the salary due both the above teachers will be made upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns. Any balance of salary due Miss Lavelle as field matron should be included in your pay list for the current month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Agent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWhen in Fort William recently, I saw Miss Lavelle, teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School. She is badly run down and wishes a year's rest. I told her she had better resign and that, later, we would see that she got a school. She wishes a letter from the Department regarding her service.\n\nJuly 25, 1930.\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department understands that it is the intention of Miss C. M. Lavelle, teacher of the Mission Bay Indian Day School, to give up duties on account of the condition of her health. The Superintendent of Indian Education, while in Fort William recently, discussed this matter with Miss Lavelle, and advised that she resign. If she terminates her services, it will be necessary to obtain a teacher to succeed her for the coming school year. Please ascertain definitely from Miss Lavelle if she is giving up duties, and, if so, you should endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher to succeed her. You should forward the names, qualifications and experience of any applicants for the position. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6142, File 408-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith reference to verbal conversation of recent date regarding Miss C. Lavelle, who has been teaching at the Mission Bay Indian Day School for the past 5 years, I wish to advise that Miss Lavelle recently called at this office and reported that owing to poor health she was obliged to resign.\n\nIt is surmised if Miss Lavelle is in good health next year she will, no doubt, apply for another Indian Day School. As this teacher has been very conscientious and a very good worker I presume the Department will look with favour when she applies for another school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1930.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:-\n\nThis is to certify that Miss G. M. Lavelle has taught for this Department at the Mission Bay Indian Day School, near Fort William, Ont., from September 1st, 1925, to June 30th, 1929. Miss Lavelle's services were altogether satisfactory to this Department and it was with regret that her resignation was received.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nPursuant to my letter of the 2nd instant and in reply to your 210-8A of the 30th ultimo, I have now to state that the Department will give very favourable consideration to an application from Miss Lavelle for an Indian school next year or whenever she applies. She has asked for a statement concerning her services and I am enclosing a writing for her.\n\nYou will please forward to the Department any suggestions you have for the filling of the vacancy. There are some good applications on our general file and, if I fill the position from headquarters, I will telegraph you to that effect. If there is any applicant for whom you wish favourable consideration for this post, you might telegraph the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F.

She would be pleased to receive a letter of recommendation from the Department.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter regarding the advisibility of securing the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Lavelle, I wish to report Miss Troy, who is teaching at the Sand Point Indian Day School, has applied for the Mission Bay Day School. Consequently I will immediately secure a qualified teacher for Sand Point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the appointment of a teacher for the Mission Bay Indian Day School to succeed Miss Lavelle, who has resigned.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you have arranged for the transfer of Miss Cassie Troy, who formerly taught the Sand Point Indian Day School, to the Mission Bay School for the coming school year. The Department approves of the appointment of Miss Troy as teacher at Mission Bay, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month. I shall be pleased if you will inform her accordingly, and arrange with her to take up duties on September 2nd, next, the date the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that the Mission Bay Indian Day School, on the Fort William reserve, has been closed on account of an epidemic of mumps. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to keep the school closed for any lengthy period. The teacher, when preparing the return for the current quarter, should state thereon the dates between which the school was closed on account of the epidemic. It is presumed that the necessary medical attention has been given in the cases having contracted the mumps.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G.

The school-house and dwelling, if placed there, should face in the same direction as the council house, but if the residence is to go on one of the village lots, it should face the road.\n\nAt the Mountain village, these buildings should be placed on the Government road, if possible, and, if no site is available on this road, as near the centre of the village as space can be obtained. Lot No. 5 appears to be available. This lot is situated on Concession 3 according to Mr. L\u00fcgheed's plan.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The amount of his tender for the whole four buildings is $11,100.00. This is a large sum to take from the capital funds of the Band, unless as above stated, with their special consent.\n\nBefore submitting the matter to the Indian Council please request LeBlonde to give you a tender on school houses, modified as follows:\n\nTo be no basement or excavation or furnace. The building is to simply rest on an ordinary stone foundation raised two feet above the ground, to be of the same dimensions as indicated on the plan, but without the steps, of course, at the back. The shed will be required for wood; it should, however, be two feet wider than it is now. The shed is to be of the ordinary type of wood-shed resting on cedar posts. The chimney should be provided with a fire-place, and a thimble placed at a proper distance above for the reception of the stove-pipe. A good box-stove thirty inches long piping and zinc should be provided.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nNo change is proposed to be made in the teacher's residence.

You may explain to them that under the \"Indian Act\" their consent is not necessary, but as the expenditure proposed is a large one, the Department prefers to have their views. You may show them the desirability of having good buildings of the reserve, and you may assist them with your own views as to what, under the circumstances, would be more judicious. The school building, as originally intended, may be adopted, or if preferred the cheaper building described above.

Although larger expenditures have been incurred than was at first contemplated it was thought that when the work was completed there would remain a sufficient amount to meet the ordinary expenses of the Band, and to give an annual interest distribution of about $3000.00; but if such a large expenditure from capital is incurred as is contemplated by the plans and specifications for school buildings on which tenders were asked, the funds would be so greatly reduced that it would not be possible to do so. As the Council House only cost $600.00 it is thought that a school house with accommodation for the School-teacher could be erected for $1200.00. This would make the total expenditure $2400.00 for the school buildings instead of $12000.00. Would you kindly prepare a rough sketch of a building that could be erected for $1200.00. The building should be 35' X 25' and should have simple accommodation overhead for the Teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNeil MacDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It seems desirable that before coming East you should make a thorough examination on the ground of the school buildings which it is proposed to erect on the Reserve, and be able to give the Department a full report on your return. As you may be aware Mr. Leblond, who has not been awarded any contract for the work, began the erection of the buildings at Squaw Bay on plans and specifications which were then under discussion. The amounts to be expended from the Indian Capital for buildings of the style proposed seem to the Department too large, and it is thought advisable to re-consider the whole question. The work undertaken by Mr. Leblond without proper authority has ceased, and the Indian Agent reports that he will complete both buildings at Squaw Bay for $4500.00; that he will erect the School House at the Mountain, with accommodation upstairs for the teacher, of 22 X 34 dimensions, with a store for $8600.00, or the same building without accommodation for $2800.00; and will build a residence 14 X 18, with a kitchen for $750.00. Rough sketches were enclosed in a letter from Agent dated the 14th October without specification, and I enclose amendments for your information. Would you kindly go into the matter thoroughly with Mr. McDougall and Mr. Leblond, and be able to inform the Department whether Mr. Leblond will complete the buildings at Squaw Bay without change from the original plans and specifications for $4500.00. If not, what changes does he propose, and is the cost fairly represented by $4500.00? No specifications of the buildings proposed to be erected at the Mountain were forwarded.

It was the first intention of the Department to provide two buildings which would cost about $1300.00 each and plans were directed to be prepared for buildings of that character. The expenditure of even such a sum as $7100.00, which would be the limit of cost under the new proposal, is much greater than was at first contemplated.\n\nI trust that you will give this matter your best consideration and be able to forward a report at an early date. Mr. McDougall points out that with the approach of winter it is necessary to have some decision at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS. Stewart\n\nAsst.

He is also\nalso quite willing to make any changes that may be deemed, if not a material nature, without increase in cost.

He pointed out certain faults in construction which I have pointed out to Mr. LeBlanc and he has promised to remedy them all.\n\nI hope the whole matter will meet your approbation.

Our letter of May 27th, last, authorized an expenditure not exceeding the above amount, and you were instructed to carry out any alterations which you considered necessary in order to provide sufficient classroom accommodation. As yet, no accounts have been received covering any such expenditure and, consequently, the Department presumes that this matter has not yet received your attention.\n\nMr. Inspector Bennett, who visited this school on the 11th instant, states as follows: (1) the entrance steps are broken; (2) the cellar is in very bad condition; (3) the teacher's kitchen and bedroom have no privacy from the pupils entering and leaving the school; (4) a porcelain jacket is required for the pipe hole; (5) a new chimney is needed before the pipes can be put up, and (6) a large stove should be secured in order to give more heat in the classroom.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will take immediate steps to make this building as comfortable as possible, keeping in mind the matters which Mr. Inspector Bennett states are urgent. The expense incurred should not exceed your estimate of $200.\n\nAs it is considered that a number of the articles which Inspector Bennett states are required for the teacher's residence were in the Mountain Village School, the Department would like to have a list showing the articles, etc., removed from Mountain Village to Mission Bay. Possibly you have removed these since the date of Mr. Bennett's visit, but we desire to have definite information on this matter.\n\nKindly advise the dimensions of the additional blackboard required, and an order will be placed for same.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will give all these matters your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Storm windows from the residence at the Mountain Road were put on the Mission Bay building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.R. Brown,\nagent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter re Mission Bay School and beg to advise that a considerable amount has already been expended on this building. Everything has been taken from the school residence at the Mountain Road and practically everything but the school desks and the stove from the school.\n\nWhen this building was being put into shape it was the intention to have the class-room downstairs and the teachers' quarters upstairs but the teacher decided otherwise and is teaching upstairs.\n\nThere is a cook-stove and a large camp heater there now and I note that the Inspector thinks that another heater is necessary.\n\nWhile this building is not ideal for school purposes it answers the purpose fairly well and I do not consider that a new building should be built until the Indians show by proper attendance of their children that the expenditure is warranted. The Inspector did not help matters out by informing the teacher about the fine quarters provided for teachers at other points.\n**Department of Indian Affairs**\n\nTo: Robinson Lumber Co.\n\n---\n\n**DATE**\n\nOct. 30\n\n**SERVICE**\n\nSupplies for Mission Bay School repairs\n\n**AMOUNT**\n\n$28.50\n\n---\n\n**ROBINSON LUMBER CO.

I have gotten in touch with your representative here, Mr. Browne, several times, but up to the present he has given me no satisfaction, with the exception of a new chimney and oil cloth for the floors. As winter is coming on I would like very much to get things in condition. It is not necessary for me to outline what I need as Mr. Bennett no doubt did this in his report.\n\nI would very much appreciate it if you would give me some idea when I can expect things to be made more comfortable both in the school-room, and in my residence.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter due consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nK. Flanagan\nOttawa, November 27, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th instant, I beg to inform you that we are again requesting Mr. Agent Brown of Fort Arthur to take the necessary steps to place the classroom and living quarters in connection with the Mission Bay Indian Day School in as comfortable a condition as possible for the coming winter. Accounts, covering supplies furnished and repairs made, have already been received and paid, and the Department is, therefore, not aware as to what further equipment is needed.

Accounts have been received for supplies and repairs, and we cannot understand what further equipment the teacher requires. If you have not purchased all the supplies authorized, you should attend to the matter at once. We desire to make the conditions at this school as comfortable as possible for the teacher during the coming winter and would appreciate it if you would give this matter your prompt attention.

A pencil sharpener will be ordered to be sent from the Government Stationery Office here.\n\nRegarding the teacher's desk, I beg to say that if the desk at present in the Mountain Road School can be repaired, you may have the work done and the desk transferred to the Mission Bay School. If, however, this desk is beyond repair, you may arrange for the purchase of a cheap table or desk which would be suitable for the purpose. If the price exceeds the sum of $15, it will be necessary for you to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers before making the purchase, and the desk should be bought from the firm quoting the lowest price. You will kindly forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is hoped that the requirements of the teacher will soon be fully supplied, and I shall be pleased if you will attend, as soon as possible, to all the purchases and repairs which you were authorized to have made at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If you are unable to obtain a satisfactory stove of this kind, you may purchase a new stove. If a new stove is purchased, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.

In reply I beg to say that the classroom material required is being ordered from the Government Stationery Office, to be sent to the teacher's address.\n\nRegarding the bed, dresser, and kitchen cabinet, Mr. Inspector Bennett included these in his list of requirements for this School, but we were of the opinion that when all the supplies were transferred from the Teacher's Residence at the Mountain Village School, that ample equipment would be provided for Mission Bay. We have already authorized you paid for a considerable amount of furnishings. We regret that we had not in the first instance instructed you to furnish a complete list of the requirements for the Teacher's Residence, in order that all purchases could have been made at one time.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a cheap iron bed, spring and mattress, also for a chest dresser and small kitchen cabinet, and a stove. If possible competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase of these supplies made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers in duplicate should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached an abstract of the prices received. It is hoped that when these goods are furnished that there will be sufficient equipment for this teacher's requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nW. R.

Could even a small alarm clock be provided?\n\nThe teacher has no washboard. She says it is difficult to wash the towels used by the Indian children without one.\n\nWhen she wants to iron clothes she has to borrow one. Two flat irons for ironing would not cost much.\n\nNew fire brick needed in the stove.\n\nThis combined teacher's residence and school is in a rather poor condition. The interior of the teacher's rooms appear fair but the interior of the classroom is forbidding. Rain enters under windows. The plaster is falling from the ceiling.\n\nDesks are all broken; the pipes continually smoke when a strong fire is on, although the chimney and pipes were cleaned.\n\nHowever, the building is not a suitable one in any way. I hope a new school and residence combined will be provided.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, INSP.\nOttawa, April 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mission Bay Indian Day School, requests that certain supplies be given for the teacher's use. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following: 1 alarm clock, inexpensive; 1 wash board and 2 flat irons.\n\nThe Inspector states that new fire brick are needed in the stove, and you should arrange to have the brick supplied and installed.\n\nRegarding the classroom, the Inspector states that rain enters under the windows and the plaster is falling from the ceiling. You should arrange to have the repairs required to the plaster carried out, and any repairs required made around the windows, in order to prevent the rain from entering.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the desks are all broken. You will be good enough to furnish a report regarding the condition of the desks and whether or not they can be repaired. If any new desks are required, you should state the number, sizes and whether double or single.\n\nWhen you have made the purchase of the above authorized supplies and have completed the repairs authorized to the plaster and windows, you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nPlease give these matters your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir -\n\nWith reference to yours of the 29th ult.,\nI beg to advise that the Mission Bay Indian Day\nSchool has been supplied with the articles mentioned\nin your letter.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the school, as this\nwould probably interfere with classes I would suggest\nthat this be left until vacation time and am therefore\nnot making any arrangements to have this done at this\ntime unless otherwise instructed by you. The building\nneeds two new coats of paint and I shall be glad to\nhave the Department's authority for this expenditure.\n\nThe teacher lives in the downstairs portion of\nthe building and classes are held upstairs in a room\n18' x 12' which is, of course, very unhealthy. Would\nit be possible to have a new school-house built?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G.

You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department at the end of June, next, giving full particulars as to the repairs required and the approximate cost of the same. It is noted that the building requires two coats of paint. Please state the approximate cost of having this work done, when reporting on the repairs required.\n\nIt will not be possible during the present fiscal year to provide the funds necessary to erect a new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I beg to advise that there is very little work for the Indians to do at the Fort William Indian Reserve at the present time and would suggest that the painting be done as soon as possible. This will cost approximately $60.00. Please advise if the work can be done at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

The building is to receive two coats of a good grade of paint. You should, after obtaining competitive prices, purchase the quantity of paint and any brushes required. The work is to be done by day labour - Indian labour to be employed if possible. You should keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, for all labour employed, which you should certify and forward to the Department for payment. If necessary, an accountable cheque could be sent you to pay the men employed. It is noted that you consider the cost of painting the building would be approximately $60, and, if possible, this amount should not be exceeded.\n\nYou should report on the repairs required to this building during the coming summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Wm, Band.\"\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 9-13-5 dated 31st May, 1924.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWhen paying the Indians of the Fort William Band who reside at Mission Bay, my attention was called to the difficulties under which the day school is operated. Since the school house was destroyed by fire a few years ago, school has been held in the teacher's residence in a small room upstairs with a low ceiling. I found 16 school children in this small room, furnished with old (and some broken) wooden desks, taught by a very bright young woman, who is most interested in her work, and has carried on since last fall under discouraging conditions, and will continue to do so if there is a chance of improvement before next winter. Please refer to the Inspector's report on this school. The teacher informs me that she fully expects in the near future an attendance of 25 pupils as there are several youngsters approaching school age, and she expects will attend after the fall term commences. The teacher spends her week end in summer at Fort Williams where she has relatives, and one has only to come in contact with her to realize that she is well equipped for the work she has in hand and should receive every encouragement. The residence should have some repairs made to it before another winter in order to make it habitable. The plaster is falling off in places, the roof leaks and the basement is a veritable mud hole, but could be drained at a small cost, as the house is built on sloping ground. A woodshed should also be built at the rear in order to store wood during winter.\n\nThe location of this school is near the Fort William Public Park, land for which was purchased from the Band a few years ago, and is becoming a popular resort, so that this portion of the Reserve is bound to be visited by people who come to this resort and the educational facilities are bound to be criticized and the Department blamed, and I am sure the teacher could easily arouse the sympathy of the Press and others if she chose to do so. I informed her to leave it to me, that I would lay the facts before you and felt sure that I would succeed in improving the conditions under which she is labouring.\n\nThe foundation of the school house remains and only needs some repairs. On this should be erected a frame structure with one large room with a cloak room partitioned off. It should be plastered and lined with building paper to make it warm. There should be a cement floor in the basement, which the Indians can use for a council house. I took the measurement of this foundation to aid the Architect in preparing plans in event of it being decided to build. They are as follows: Inside wall 4 inches in thickness; 4 windows 20 inches deep and 3 ft. wide; 1 door at 6 ft.; wall is 5 ft. 6 inches in height at the front and 3 ft. 8 in. at the rear where the door is. Steps leading up to front door are necessary. All materials can be landed at the dock at Mission Bay, near the school site. Tenders should be invited both at Port Arthur and Fort William. The contractor and his men could live under canvas. An Inspector should be employed to watch the job. The cost including repairs to residence which should also\nbe done by the contractor will it is estimated cost $3000, of this $1000 was obtained from Insurance Co. for burned building and is at credit of Account 10, I think. The Indians will not I fear contribute towards the cost as they say that under the Treaty they are entitled to a school, and the Government must provide the funds. There is no other school on this Reserve. One or two Indians will not send their children to any school, and the other Indians asked me if they could not be compelled to do so. Almost all are now anxious for their children to attend school.\n\nIf you can find $2000, I would advise taking action at once, and disarm criticism that is bound to come.\n\n(Sgd.) F. H. Paget.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6142, File 408-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRegarding the communication which you received from Mr. Paget setting forth the necessity for the erection of a school building at Mission Bay on the Fort William Reserve, I beg to say that the former school building was destroyed by fire some years ago, it having been rented by the Agent to an Indian for living purposes. At present school is conducted in part of the teacher's residence, and there is not sufficient accommodation for the number of pupils, viz., 25, who could attend. Mr. Paget has given the dimensions of the foundation of the school building, and states that a new building could be erected thereon at a cost of approximately $3,000. We obtained the sum of $1,000 insurance on the old school building, and this was credited to the band account. It would be necessary, besides this amount, to take the sum of $2,000 from the interest at the credit of the Fort William band. The amount at the credit of interest is $9,030, and the band have to their credit in capital the sum of $102,619.\n\nI would recommend that the $1,000 insurance be used, and that the balance, viz., $2,000, be taken from the interest funds at the credit of the band. Mr. Orr could prepare the plans for the building. He has information as to the requirements. If you concur in Mr. Paget's recommendation as to the urgent necessity for the erection of a new building, the funds necessary, over the amount of the insurance on hand from the old building, could be taken from the interest funds of the band, and Mr. Orr should be requested to prepare the plans and call for tenders.\n\nBesides the new school building, certain repairs are required to the teacher's residence and a woodshed should be erected.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shabb\nFrank Williams\nErward Louis Councilman\nFrank Pellitier.\n\nWitness, Edward Bouchard.\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed resolution passed by the members of the Fort William Reserve on October 8th, 1924, asking the Department for the privilege of using the basement of the new Squaw Bay School, now nearing completion, for the purpose of a Council House, as their old Council House is a considerable distance from their homes, and is in very poor repair, owing to the fact that younger members of the band broke all the windows three years ago, and the said council house has not been repaired since.\n\nI wish to point out that I think that this is a very poor arrangement, as the Indians will be continually interfering with the teacher, and the basement will no doubt be used on rainy days at recess time, for the school children.\n\nWould appreciate an early reply to this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. BURK,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 16th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a resolution of the members of the Fort William Band requesting the privilege of using the basement of the new school building which is being erected at Mission Bay (Squaw Bay) for the purpose of a council house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the department cannot approve of the basement of this building being used for council purposes. The basement will be required for the use of the pupils at recess and as a playroom during wet weather. Please inform the chief and council accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

All windows need putty.\n2. Ceiling of bedroom needs replastering. Down stairs is the same.\n3. Basement needs draining and walls of basement fixing to keep out water.\n4. Woodwork down stairs needs painting.\n5. Stove needs new grate and firebox plates put in. If this is not done it will soon burn into the oven.\n\nWhen repairs were made to this house a few years ago they were of a make-shift character. If the Department has the money to spare new flooring should be laid. I understand that Mr. Burk has made representations to the Dept. as to the necessary things to be done.\n\nThe new school room is in course of erection. It may be ready in a month.\n\nJ. M.

The Inspector states that the following repairs are needed:\n\n1. All windows need putty,\n2. Ceiling of bedroom needs replastering. Downstairs is the same,\n3. Basement needs draining and walls of basement fixing to keep out water,\n4. Woodwork downstairs needs painting.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the condition of the stove, which he states needs a new grate and fire box plates.

You may arrange to purchase a desk and chair of a similar type from the firm which supplied the equipment which you delivered to the Mission Bay School. It is hoped that you can obtain a desk and chair at approximately the same price, or cheaper if possible, and have it delivered to the residential school.\n\nWhen forwarding the account in duplicate, which should be certified by you, you should state that the desk and chair are for the use of the Mission Bay Indian Day School. We desire to charge the expenditure to that school, in view of the fact that the expense for the previous desk and chair was charged against the residential school. Please give the matter of the purchase of this equipment your early attention and forward the voucher, properly certified, as directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He also recommends that some pictures be placed on the walls to overcome this condition, and you might report on this matter, stating whether some inexpensive pictures of subjects suitable for a classroom could be obtained, and, if so, the approximate cost.\n\nThe Inspector also states that if the teacher were supplied with a can of paint, she would arrange to paint the upstairs floor. Please consult the teacher in this matter, and arrange to supply her with the paint required for the purpose.

Would it not serve the purpose if the walls were calcimined or murescoed instead of being painted? Please inform the Department further regarding this change in the materials to be used. I may say that our funds are very limited this year, and, if calcimining would be satisfactory, you should give an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required. When we have this information, further consideration will be given as to whether any work can be authorized or not.\n\nRelative to the pictures, the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $10. You should consult the teacher as to what pictures she requires and arrange for the purchase of same. However, they should not be placed on the walls until after it is decided what decorating will be done.

You should arrange for the purchase of the quantity of paint required and of the colour considered by you to be suitable. You should also arrange for the labour and have the work done before the school reopens. When this work is finished, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and labour.\n\nWe note that Miss Lavelle, the teacher, will not resume duties until the end of September. As she closed this school for the summer holidays about the middle of July last, it is considered that she should, in order to complete the ten teaching months in the next school year, open this school about the middle of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Voucher No. 142-32 of June 9th, 1926, amounting to $25.00, in favor of Mr. B. Gerry, Westfort William, Ont., for supplies furnished the Mission Bay Day School, Fort William Reserve.\n\nI beg to advise that Mr. Gerry just phoned me, to say that a cheque covering the above mentioned supplies has not been received.\n\nWould you kindly advise if this account reached Ottawa, as Mr. Gerry is anxious to have this account settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 1, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th September, I beg to say that official cheque No.1342 for $25.00 went forward on the 16th June to Mr. N.B. Gerry, of West Fort William, in payment of voucher No.142-32. I may say the Department is prepared to consider the question of the issue of a duplicate cheque if Mr. Gerry and two sureties execute a bond of indemnity on the form herewith enclosed. The form when completed should be forwarded to the Department, and, if it is found satisfactory, a duplicate cheque will issue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Bennett on the Mission Bay Day School - dated October 5th, 1926.\n\nSupplies needed:\n\n- 2 lbs. of red knitting yarn for mitts and stockings.\n- 1 \" Black \"\n- 12 pair of strong knitting needles.\n- 10 yds. of white cotton cloth.\n- 1 Axe.\n- 2 Brooms\n- 12 bars Lifebuoy Soap.\n- 4 Yds. Towelling.\n\n1. The white plastered walls of the classroom are quite dirty. A buff color should be placed on them.\n\n2. The school has no bell. This community is without clocks and it is the only way to call the children to school and to have punctuality. It is the only day school without a bell.\n\n3. Basement of school still leaks. I guess little can be done.\n\n4. Teacher's room walls need attention.\nOttawa, October 13th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mission Bay Indian Day School, on the Fort William Reserve, recommends that certain material be supplied.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 2 Lbs.

Furnace couldn't be used since chimney was too small and the pupils were smoked out. A box stove had to be placed in the class-room.\n\n\"2. At least 6 inches of water has been in the cellar. It is used for wood only so it doesn't matter. Besides the teacher has her own house.\"\n\n\"1. This reserve does not possess any clocks in their homes; besides, if they did they wouldn't keep time. Consequently, there is need of a school bell (as on other school buildings) on the reserve. Can you supply one?\n\n\"Miss Lavelle is doing well for you. She accomplishes more with these children than I have seen in many other day schools. However, in spite of their progress, the deficiency in imagination in the Indian race is seen - Mental arithmetic, and kindred tests.\"\nOttawa, May 7th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mission Bay Indian Day School, states that the furnace in this building could not be used as the chimney is too small, and, as a consequence, the room fills with smoke. To overcome this difficulty he states a box stove had to be used in the classroom. Please furnish a report as to whether you would recommend any alterations be made in the chimney, or whether the present arrangement for the heating of this building by a stove is satisfactory.\n\nThe Inspector also states that there is considerable water in the cellar, which is used for the storage of wood only. Please report regarding this matter and state what steps you would recommend be taken to provide proper drainage, and the cost of having the work done.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that a school bell be installed on the school building. Please state whether there is any tower or other place on the roof in which a bell having a weight, with mounting, of approximately 275 pounds could be installed.

The furnace in this school was not used last winter as it would invariably smoke when the draft was turned on full. Consequently I thought it advisable to install a box stove, which is far more satisfactory and does not burn one quarter of the wood. The teacher informed me the box stove gives much more satisfaction than the furnace as the children are able to dry their mittens in the winter time.\n\nPersonally I would not recommend any alterations to the chimney as the present arrangements for heating this school are very satisfactory.\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your letter regarding the water in the school basement, the cost of installing a drain would be approximately $25.00, as the formation of the ground is very rocky.\n\nPersonally I would not recommend this expenditure as the water only seeps through the basement in one corner for a few weeks in the spring and seems to dry up very quickly.\n\nReferring to the third paragraph of your letter regarding a school bell installed on the school building which would weigh approximately 275 lbs I wish to advise that a special stand could be erected on the school grounds for approximately $20.00.

In this connection it is noted that you do not recommend any alterations to the chimney or to the present heating arrangement at the school, which you state are satisfactory, also that you do not recommend any expenditure in connection with drainage of the water in the school basement. No further action need, therefore, be taken regarding these matters.\n\nRelative to a school bell, we are obtaining prices here and will place the order for a suitable bell. The weight of the bell and mountings which we will supply will be approximately 200 pounds. The bell on which we are obtaining prices is 22\" in diameter, and will be satisfactory for the purpose for which it is required. You may arrange to have a special stand erected on the school grounds for this bell, and when the bell arrives it can be installed thereon. We note that you estimate the cost of erecting this stand to be approximately $20. It should be built in a position on the grounds convenient to the school and not interfering with the playground activities. The Department will pay any expenses in having the bell installed, and you may forward properly certified vouchers in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred in the building of the stand and installing of the bell. We will inform you in a few days of the name of the firm from whom the bell will be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

The lamp the teacher has in her residence is a gasoline one and the teacher considers it rather dangerous to carry it from one place to the other.\n\nMiss Lavelle just informed me the children have to walk a considerable distance to the school and the teacher deems it advisable to give them a hot drink of cocoa just before leaving and a hot drink at the noon hour.\n\nConsequently I would strongly recommend purchasing the cocoa and the other necessary supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

These classes are generally held during the winter months when artificial light is required.\n\nA great number of school concerts are also held in the school house during the winter months, which is a great source of entertainment for the school children and their parents. These concerts also encourage the parents to send their children to school.\n\nConsequently I would recommend purchasing this lamp as it will undoubtedly assist the teacher in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He further states that the plaster in the classroom is broken off in different places. You should arrange to have any repairs required to the plaster carried out and the windows washed.\n\nThe Inspector states that the doors of the outside closets need to be fixed. You should have any repairs required to the closets carried out, and they should be cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition. This work should be attended to before the cold weather sets in.\n\nIt is further stated that the school is at present heated by a stove as the furnace does not work satisfactorily. Please state what repairs are required to the furnace in order to place it in a satisfactory condition, and you should also give an estimate of the cost.\n\nAfter you have carried out the above authorized work, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThese matters should receive early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The plaster in the classroom will also be repaired.\n\nReferring to your 3rd paragraph regarding the furnace, the school is heated by a box stove which gives wonderful satisfaction. The teacher advised me she would prefer using the stove, as the school children require same in connection with their noonday lunch. The cost to repair the furnace would be approximately $15.00.\n\nDuplicate accounts will be forwarded to the Department when the minor repairs have been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G.

If you consider that the furnace should be repaired in order to be ready in case of need, you may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $15 in having the work done. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the furnace repaired or not as you consider advisable.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of April 10, No. 210-4A, drawing the Department's attention to the 3 school toilets directly back of the Mission Bay school and residence, which are in a frightfully dilapidated condition caused by a very severe windstorm several weeks ago. Unfortunately the buildings are too old to repair. Consequently 3 new toilets should be erected, which will cost approximately $25.00.\n\nRecommendation was also made for kalsomining the kitchen, living room, and bedroom of the Mission Bay school residence. This school is heated by a wood stove, and the walls have become very dark, which no doubt was caused by smoke.\n\nI would also strongly recommend that the kitchen, sitting room, and hall floors be painted. The teacher informed me she would be very pleased to do the kalsomining, also the painting if the Department would purchase the necessary material costing approximately $15.00.\n\nThe curtains in the sitting room of the residence have not been replaced for a great number of years. Consequently I would recommend purchasing inexpensive curtains for the sitting room.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 210-4A of the first instant, relative to the condition of the toilets at the Mission Bay Indian Day School. It is noted that they are in a dilapidated condition and that you recommend having three new toilets erected, at a cost of approximately $25. In this connection I have to request that you will furnish further information as to the type of toilet you recommend. Also please state why three are required. The Department considers it doubtful if new toilets could be erected for the amount stated by you. Therefore, I shall be pleased to have full information as to what work you recommend be carried out in regard to these toilets.\n\nWith reference to the calcimining of the kitchen, living room and bedroom of the residence and the painting of the kitchen, sitting room and hall floors, I have to say that the Department will approve of your incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately $15 in the purchase of the calcimine and paint required for this purpose. It is noted that the teacher will perform the work of calcimining and painting without cost to the Department. Further, you may arrange for the purchase of inexpensive curtains for the sitting room. After you have purchased the above authorized supplies, please forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., No. 9-13-5, with reference to voucher No. 64-7, amounting to $4.00 covering coal oil supplied to the Mission Bay Indian Day School. In reply I beg to report that the oil is used in the teacher's residence both for cooking and lighting purposes. With reference to purchasing oil for cooking purposes at various schools I find the oil is more economical than wood for cooking.\n\nWith reference to the Mission Bay Day School I wish to report this school is equipped with a 3\u00bd foot camp heater which supplies sufficient heat for the school residence. The teacher does considerable cooking on this stove, but is also obliged to use the oil stove for baking, etc.\n\nIn conclusion I would refer you to official letter of June 6, 1932, No. 9-3-8, in which the Department advised it would be in order to continue supplying Indian Day schools with coal oil for both lighting and cooking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The one in use at the present time is badly burned and as a drum type heater is required, I would recommend that same be purchased from the Piper hardware Co. in Fort William, who have several of this type now on hand, that were purchased from the Fort William band and which were manufactured last year at the Factory which was operating on the reserve at that time.\n\nAs the season has now set in I would urge that authorization be granted to make these purchases as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

School\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th ultimo, file No. 9-13-5, with regard to a letter received by the Minister in connection with the condition of the above noted school, I beg to report that at the present time, the teacher's residence and the school classroom are two separate buildings. The teacher's residence is a two-story building, of four rooms with concrete foundation. The classroom is a one story building consisting only of one room, this also has a concrete foundation. Both buildings are of frame construction and are heated with heaters. They are very old buildings and in a very dilapidated condition and would cost a considerable sum of money to even put them in fair condition. I would not recommend spending any money in repairs as, due to their age, they would require a considerable expenditure from year to year in maintenance.\n\nFor the past two years, the amount of $5,500.00 has been placed in our estimates, for the construction of a combination school and residence, similar to the schools now in use at Gull Bay, Mobert and other day schools in the agency. Owing to the sharp increase in the cost of materials during the past few months, however, I have had a new estimate made and find that to construct a building of this type, at the present time, the cost would be around $6,700.00. This figure is based, however, using all white labour and I believe would be reduced to about $6,000.00 using Indian labour wherever possible.\n\nThe type of building, we have in mind is outlined by Departmental plan No. 532 and designated as \"Plan of Oka Indian Day school, Oka, Que.\" This type of building is far more economical with regard to repairs and maintenance, as well as being more convenient for the teacher and pupils.\n\nI will take this matter up with Mr. Burk, the agent, on his return and if a more detailed report is required, the matter can be given more time, with regard to details of material, labour etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nClerk, P.A.

You will note for the past five years the sum of $5,500.00 has been included in the estimates for the construction of a combination school and residence, similar to the schools at Gull Bay and Mobert. This type of building is shown on Departmental plan No. 532, designed as \"Plan of Oka Indian Day School\" Oka, Que. If funds are not available for the construction of a combination school, would it be possible to build a small teacher's residence costing approximately $3,000.00?\n\nThe school house could be repaired and painted for approximately $135.00 as this building is in fairly good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the Mission Bay School and teacher's residence.\n\nNo funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school or teacher's residence at any point in Canada. You will therefore realize that it is impossible for the Department to consider building a teacher's residence at Mission Bay this year.\n\nIt is noted that the school could be repaired and painted for an amount not exceeding $135. Please let me have detailed information regarding material required, in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector Greening's report on the Mission Bay Indian Day School visited on May 12, 1942.\n\nI feel, however, that with the increasing scarcity of teachers, it will become more and more difficult to keep a really good teacher at this school unless some kind of a decent residence is provided, in which connection I would draw attention to my last report on this school.\n\nIn my opinion it would be a waste of money to try to put the old residence into any kind of habitable condition. It would cost a good deal, and, after the money had been spent, there would be little to show for it. Moreover, the actual school classroom building's wall has the plaster badly broken and needs other repairs. As I have said, the classroom is now kept beautifully neat and tidy, but a teacher can have little heart in trying to keep it so, when the main wall, the one she is facing most of the time, is \"plastered\" with old cardboard cartons.\n\nWhile the external appearance of the school is not too bad, the old residence is really an eyesore, which is the more to be regretted since the buildings are within easy distance of Fort William, with the result that a good many people pass them, especially during the warmer weather. I have, myself, heard disparaging remarks made of the buildings which are a poor return to the Department for the interest it takes in its schools.\n\nThe ideal solution would be to build a new combined school and residence and tear down both the old buildings. (They are adjacent to the new hospital and add nothing to its attractiveness.) However, it is realized that, during these times, strict economy is vitally necessary, and that all unnecessary expenditures must be ruthlessly eliminated. The foregoing remarks, however, are submitted so that the situation may be fully understood.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune 16, 1942.\n\nAttention-Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAuthorization was received last year to expend the amount of $135.00 in making temporary repairs to the Mission Bay school but owing to the large building programme at the Head of the Lakes it was impossible to secure the services of a carpenter consequently the repairs were not carried out.\n\nAs I have previously pointed out the building is practically beyond repair and if it is at all possible a new combination school and residence should be constructed. Would you kindly advise if anything has been allowed on our estimates for this year for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the Mission Bay School.\n\nI am under the impression that the second paragraph of your letter refers to the teacher's residence and not to the school itself. In your letter of July 12, 1941, you stated that the school house could be repaired and painted for approximately $135.00, as this building is in fairly good condition.\n\nI note from your letter that you did not expend the amount authorized last year and, therefore, we will make available the amount of $135.00 this year. Please forward immediately a requisition for any materials required in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This building is in a fairly good state of repair but is very badly in need of paint as well as some repairs made to the windows, doors, the flooring and interior. This could be done for approximately $135.00.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in such condition that last year the Insurance Companies refused to cover it with insurance. The department was informed of this at the time and the recommendation for a new building sent in at that time. Realizing that it is practically impossible to obtain appropriation for the construction of a new building I have had an estimate made as to the cost of repairing this building temporarily, so that it would be habitable for a few years. This can be done for the sum of approximately $285.00. This would cover repairs to the building only and a further expenditure would be necessary to supply some equipment, such as dishes, rugs, curtains, bed and mattress, etc. If repairs to the building can be authorized the cost of the equipment can be estimated and forwarded you.\n\nI would be pleased if you would advise, as soon as possible if this work can be started as it is very difficult at the Lakehead at the present time to secure the services of a carpenter, and at the present time there is one available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

It will be necessary, however, to purchase the paint through the Departmental Purchasing Agent and a requisition for the amount of paint required should be sent forward at the earliest possible date. It is, to the officials here, a source of regret that this work has not been undertaken until this comparatively late date.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher's residence at this school is in a dilapidated condition and that approximately $285.00 will be required to undertake the necessary repairs. I doubt very much the wisdom of spending this amount of money on an old building. Would it be possible to make a few minor repairs to this residence on the understanding that the funds necessary to construct a new building will be provided in next year's estimates? Your recommendation on this proposal will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.G.

A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our verbal conversation of September 23rd, in connection with authorization to make repairs to the Mission Bay Indian day school and residence at the Fort William reservation, and to expend approximately $550.00, I would be pleased if you would forward an advance of $200.00 to cover the cost of labor in this connection.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, a requisition covering materials required for both the school building and the residence. I should like to point out, however, that it is very difficult to estimate accurately just what materials will actually be required, for as you are no doubt aware, unforeseen repairs invariably develop in a project of this nature, as the work progresses.\n\nIn order to carry out these repairs as soon as possible, would it not be possible to permit the purchase of these materials as they are required, from local firms. Several local firms are advertising paint at reduced prices, at the present time and it may be possible to make some saving in this material by taking advantage of sale prices. A separate requisition is enclosed covering the paint required for the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach requisition for materials required for repairs to the teacher's residence at the Mission Bay Indian Day School in the Port Arthur Indian Agency. This building is in very bad condition and immediate repairs are necessary. Labour is very scarce but the Agent states that he can secure a carpenter at the present time. In view of what has just been said the Agent requests authority to make local purchase of the materials required in order that the work may proceed immediately. I should appreciate receiving this authority.\n\nIn regard to the paint, the Agent states that several local firms in Port Arthur are advertising paint at reduced prices at the present time and he believes that it might be possible to make some saving by taking advantage of the sale prices.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I am requesting the Purchasing Branch to authorize local purchase of the materials required for repairs to the Mission Bay Indian Day School. As soon as I hear from them I will advise you. In the meantime arrangements are being made to forward to you a cheque for $200.00 to cover the cost of the labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.
