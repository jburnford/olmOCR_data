The explosion caused considerable damage to the building; and it appears that the explosion was caused by stray bullets from a 2-pounder cannon. The cause of the explosion is unknown, but it is believed to be connected with the recent revolution in Quebec. We understand that the explosion was caused by a bomb planted in the building, and that it was not caused by any other means. The explosion was heard throughout all parts of Quebec, and it is feared that it may have caused injuries to some of the bystanders. The explosion has caused great consternation among the inhabitants of Quebec, who are now on the alert for any further outbreaks.\n\nORDER IN COUNCIL.\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, OTTAWA.\nMonday, the 15th day of September, 1884.\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR-\nGENERAL IN COUNCIL.\n\nWHEREAS the disease of pesteux ponans - mange in swine has become prevalent throughout the Western cities of Illinois as well as in many Eastern cities of the United States, and whereas the disease is communicable from swine to swine as well as to man, and whereas the disease is highly dangerous to the health and welfare of the people of these states, it is hereby ordered that the importation of swine into the United States for sale shall be prohibited effective immediately.\n\nAt Scioto, Indiana, on the 3rd day of October, 1884.\n\nTENDERS FOR FLOUR.\nMcManus and Sons, March 1st, 1885.\nAt BATTLEFORD, March 1st, 1885.\nAt PCH PADDY, March 1st, 1885.\nAt CARLTON, December 1st, 1884.\nShould tender be required before date expressed above, the same will be given under such conditions as may be made.\n\nPESTUOUS MANGE: THE DISEASE OF THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.\nBy the Honourable Mr. Secretary, Minister of Agriculture.\n\nCanada has recently been visited by a disease known as \"pesteux ponans\" or mange.

What we desire to make plain at the present stage of events, is the folly of refusing to acknowledge the true state of things, even in the event of their turning out to be highly unfavorable to us. Owing to the amount of competition and rivalry in the matter of securing immigration, which naturally exists between the widely separated points of the Territories where the most promising fields of enterprise have already formed, there has arisen a sort of spasmodic sentiment, which stigmatizes as dishonorable or undesirable the utmost exertion with regard to any particular locality if it be unfavorable to it, by any of its residents. There does no doubt under certain circumstances exist an appreciable difference in the immediate effect of a suppression of the truth and a deliberate assertion of a falsehood, but after all that difference is one of degree rather than of kind. It has always been, as we have often stated our own desire, to avoid the appearance by burying in the verge of falsehood exaggeration with regard to the capabilities of our own neighborhood to enticing settlers of rose-colored prospects doomed to be disappointed and to add that the merits of this moderation is much lessened by the fact of our conviction that the statement of the naked truth with regard to our vicinity would offer such an alternative as may serve as the least degree likely to prove a profitable addition to our community. Should the result of this year's harvest unhappily render it necessary to go to the field to rake up some mention, we are glad to feel that we will be spared the unpleasant dish served up to those who have to eat their own words, nor shall anything inherent in the nature of false hopes fall into that of suppression of the truth. To put aside the question of morality, and apply the standard of expediency, it still seems to us that the adage \"honesty is the best policy\" meets the case in our present circumstances. It must seem only natural to reasonable minds to expect occasional reverses even in places where the general conditions are like our own exceptionally favorable, and, therefore, the slightest suspicion of such as might naturally occur, can only serve to excite suspicion. Should we have at last to chronicle a year of failure, that fact instead of detracting from the desirability of our district, as a place of settlement by farmers, can only be most favorably contrasted with the sufferings and misfortunes known to the whole world, which have happened repeatedly within the time that we have spent in this country, and almost every part of our country is now suffering from railway communications, and the consequent cost of conveying flour and grain for seed to this place if necessary will make the failure of our crops a matter of serious concern, and to have a significance which really in no way bears upon the capacities of our country. Just as we attempted to explain in our last statement, we believe that this should be accepted as depending upon the general prosperity of a community after an exhaustive examination of all attendant circumstances, so must the relation of the condition of the community to the peculiar local capabilities and resources of any district, be used for decision. Therefore, it can be clearly demonstrated that our natural advantages are so great, that only the mistakes of the farmers themselves have left them without comfortable reserves against the inevitable rainy days, then it becomes due to the honesty to expose these errors. We trust in view of this that we should be under the necessity of taking this course, and that the judge has acted in the spirit of John's comforters, or trying to aid wisdom which always comes so easily after the event.\n\nAUCTION SALE.\nOf Valuable Town Property.\n\nNEW SPRING AND SUMMER MILLINERY.\nAND FANCY GOODS.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.,\nAT THE SHERRIFF'S OFFICE, PRINCE ALBERT.\n\nPUBLIC AUCTION,\nON WEDNESDAY, THE 22ND INST.,\nAT THE SHERRIFF'S OFFICE, PRINCE ALBERT.\n\nFURNITURE.\nFancy Parlor and Bedroom Sets.\nSideboards, Bureaus, Bedsteads, Couches, Sofas, Chairs of nearly all descriptions.\nBradles & Cribs for the Babies.\nRocking Chairs for the Ladies.\nMattresses Single & Double to suit Customers.\n\nC. & C.

I am very sorry to have the story go about among the public that a stolen cow was found in my possession and that the law had me called in to make up damages.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that I bought a cow about three weeks ago from Mr. Carter, and paid him his usual price (45\u00a2 in cash), which I considered was fair value for an animal of its size. I held the cow until June. The cow was steady through the summer, and every pasture along the road could be seen being milked, and I may say the produce was excellent. I must say regret that I cannot at any real distance, although I recognize the name Carter, but I could not find Mr. Carter or his wife, who was the servant of Mr. A. Kennedy in said and said the cow was her property. As he could not produce any authority from Mrs. Kennedy, nor any evidence of her owning the cow, I refused to let her take the beast, as I thought that if I gave it up to her, she would be liable to be charged with theft. I could not ask Mr. Carter to refund my money. However, I thought it best to try to get the cow back, so that I could give it up myself, and be glad to get it off my hands, if Mrs. Kennedy would look at it herself, and claim it. I thought by this course of conduct that I was justified in keeping it until it was identified by the owner or some one who knew it. Next day I saw it was served with a writ, and the cow taken by the deputy sheriff. This, for all I know, may be law but it is not justifiable, and the treatment of a civilized person by another.\n\nJAMES WHITE.\n\n[We quite sympathize with Mr. White's annoyance at having an animal taken away from him without his having been served with a warrant, but believe he has acted within the natural bounds of his rights.]\n\nFourth Judicial District Court\n\nDIVISION NO. 2.\n\nNotice is hereby given that sitting of the Court will be held at Prince Albert, on Monday, November 3rd, 1884, at 10 o'clock a.m., all parties interested are respectfully invited to attend the proceedings accordingly.

The number of sheep in the course of this time was nearly 3,000, being the total in the vicinity of 600 in the last six weeks. The only other lambing which extended in a heavy storm of rain three days before planting out on the plains north of the fifth day, during which several head of cattle were killed. Between the third and seventh Creek was within a short distance of all the mountains, and the quartz floor of the creek was high above the mountain side.\n\nMr. Steel, though he did not lose his load of sheep, but obtained them back at the end of six weeks, when the snows came down again, has returned to his own district. The sheep which were brought in from Mr. Steel's district were, mostly, of native breed, and the number was not as large as usual.\n\nMr. Steel, who had been among the herdsmen since the spring, but very late in the season, has since returned to his own district.\n\n**THOS.
