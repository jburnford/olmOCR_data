The cost will not be more than $10.00 for boards, glass, hinges, etc. I would recommend his request be granted.\n\nFurther, while it might be early, yet I would draw your attention to the fact that next year we will need more school accommodation. At present there are 27 pupils in the building, rather too crowded; and next year by a casual observation, I figure six or more will be added.\n\nI went over the situation and concluded our present building could be extended back 12 feet, and a cellar for wood put underneath. This is only a layman's idea, but perhaps if one of the architects or builders of the Indian Affairs Branch is in the near vicinity he could visit here and give a better idea of what can be done. Or, if approved, a local builder might be asked to look over the situation and report back to your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB. B. Fox,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\n\nT. R. L.

We are receiving so many demands for school accommodation in places where no schools are located at the present time that I doubt if it will be possible to provide funds in our appropriation for the year 1939-40 in order to enlarge the Millbrook School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. B. Fox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\nSir:\n\nYour letter No. 47-1-5, dated Sept. 22, 1938 received and the second paragraph in reference to enlarging the Millbrook School noted.\n\nWhile I regret that there is doubt funds will be possible in the appropriation for the year 1939-40 for the suggested work, after conference with the teacher, Mr. MacKinnon, I believe we have found a solution to our problem, if it is approved by the Department.\n\nThe younger children coming to school are void or lacking in English speaking and not only has the teacher to educate them in the regular way, but in many cases really has to teach the child to talk and understand English.\n\nThis takes so much of his time that it deprives the higher grades of the attention that they really require. Our suggestion is that the morning session, perhaps extended for a half or an extra hour be wholly given to the lower classes and the afternoon be wholly given to the higher grades. Mr. McKinnon, is willing to give the extra hours each day and I would recommend that an increase in salary to meet the extra hours would greatly encourage him to carry on the excellent work he is doing in our school.\n\nHis method of teaching is of the most up-to-date in the Province and marked improvement is shown among the children of the Millbrook Reservation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I have carefully considered the suggestion contained in your letter but I am inclined to feel that some difficulties would probably occur and consequently I do not feel able to favourably consider your suggestion.\n\nIn your letter of the 15th instant you stated that an extension could be made to the building and that a cellar could be placed under this extension. Please let me have an estimate of the probable cost of carrying out the work that you suggest. This information should be furnished at the earliest possible date in order that we can consider providing it in the appropriation for the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

S.\nNovember 15, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nFollowing advice received in a recent letter from you re my petition for addition to our school, I beg to say that I got Gordon Hayman, a local contractor, to go over the matter and he gave me an estimate.\n\nFor an addition of 20 feet to the present building full width, which is 22 feet; and a cellar approximately eight feet deep, together with proper drainage and including a furnace, properly installed, at a total of $1350.\n\nIf he gets the contract, he assures me he will employ Indian labor wherever possible.\n\nAt present you will note the average attendance at the school is 27 daily, with an enrollment of 30, nearly double that when I first took over the Agency here.\n\nThis is too crowded even now and next year several more children will be ready to attend, with none of the present scholars to stop.\n\nFor the building such as the proposed enlarged one, the present heating system will not be sufficient, and the cheaper method besides a more healthy and sanitary one would be a furnace.\n\nHowever, if it should meet the approval of the Department, I believe I could do the job much cheaper than the figure submitted. That is, I would undertake to supervise the alterations, with Indian labor all through, at only the cost of mileage for the trips it would be necessary to make. As I have to make a living otherwise than by the salary I receive, I could not stay on the building job continuously, unless additional remuneration was allowed.\n\nThis figure submitted by Mr. Hayman is only a basis for you to consider having money placed in the estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nTrusting this information meets your requirements and sincerely hoping the money may be found available to continue our special attention to education of the young, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

C. Nurse, we had the children weighed. After two months with the milk, eggs, and cod liver oil, today the Teacher, Mr. MacKinnon again weighed the children. The result showing is so satisfactory that even some of the Medical men with whom I conversed tonight marvelled.\n\nI am happy to submit the weights taken by Dr. Kent and the nurse and the weight taken today of each of the children. I wish, however, to point out that with Dick and Martin Silliboy, they had much more clothing on today than at the time they were weighed by Dr. Kent. Also to make special note of Mary Marshall, who evidently has not made any gain. I am going to take her case up with Dr. Kent tomorrow to see if there is not something to be done for this child which gives every evidence of being in very poor health.\n\nThe report is as follows on separate sheet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnis,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nR. P. Fox,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is returning your voucher No. 730 unpaid. As you are aware Edward Paul is employed as school janitor of the Millbrook school at a salary of $50.00 a year. Under these circumstances we cannot understand why Emily Paul was employed.\n\nYou may submit another account covering the cost of the broom, soap, scrub brush and bon ami.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. B. Fox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\nOttawa, January 1st, 1939.\n\nThe Honourable T. A. Crerar, M.P.,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nRe: Indian Affairs.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the situation with respect to the Indian day schools in my constituency.\n\nOn the Millbrook reserve the accommodation is most inadequate for the number of children and there are at the present time five or six who are unable to attend school for this reason.\n\nThe situation at Shubenacadie is even worse. At that point there are some twenty children of school age and no school facilities. However, the building still stands, but no teacher has been employed for a number of years.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department to give the Indian children some education the Millbrook school be enlarged and that at Shubenacadie repaired and a teacher employed.\n\nWill you please favour me with your advice in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. T. Purdy\nSir:\n\nYour letter No. 47-1-5, dated January 20, 1939 received and noted. In explanation I beg to say that a general scrubbing and cleaning of the school twice a year has been the order for several years. This is done during the summer and Christmas vacations.\n\nOn other occasions the work was done by a woman as in this instance, and a relief order given. However, material for the last cleaning was obtained from our regular grocer instead of a hardware store as formerly and I asked him to make separate accounts for the school. When Emilie Paul came to me for a relief order in December I told her if she would give the school a thorough cleaning I would give her an order. She did so, and when I gave her the order I marked on the slip \"for cleaning school.\" Mr. Brenton placed this order in the school account and I let it go through that way.\n\nThe janitor keeps the school clean daily, but I believe a thorough house cleaning twice a year is essential. Especially where we have the stove in the centre of the room and manual training all in the same room, dust covers the blackboards and walls during the sessions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N.

Johnson, artesian well borer residing in this locality and he advised me that we could strike a good flow of water on our school property at about seventy-five feet. He would bore the well and case it at $2.00 per foot. A suitable pump, he estimates, could be installed for $25.00, and $25.00 more would cover the cost of erecting a small shelter for the well and pump which I would order locked up by the School Janitor every night.\n\nThis well in Mr. Johnson's opinion would supply sufficient water for a large number on the Reservation as well as give the school kiddies a pure water for drinking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N.

The former Agent advised that the following work was required:\n\n\"An addition of 20 feet to the present building, full width, which is 22 ft.; and a cellar approximately 8 ft. deep, together with proper draining and including the installation of a furnace\".\n\nWith the above information you should be able to obtain quotations from the three men mentioned in my letter of June 7.\n\nYou should have each one of them outline what he intends to do and include a quotation.

McKinnon, teacher, Millbrook Indian Day School, Truro, N. S., dated June 30, 1939.\n\nI wonder do you agree with a suggestion I'd like to make. Since no Indian is allowed work on any construction job in Truro, always being removed on some pretext or other, then it would be only fair that any money spent on the reserve for labour should stay there. I have in mind the remodelling of the school, which I hear, is going ahead. I have my doubts whether anyone man (Indian) is carpenter enough to superintend the job (I am not familiar with their ability as carpenters) but I hope the Dept. has in mind to utilize all the labor from the reserve that it is possible to use. However, this is, I suppose, none of my business, but I do think it's a good idea.\nHelp of Indian affairs\nTo go with Mike Thomas\n2030 qts of milk for Charlie Marshall at 10\u00a2 = 3.00\nMike Martin ... ... = 3.00\nStephen Yloade ... ... = 3.00\nCharlie Bevans ... ... = 3.00\n30 pints ... ... = 1.50\nJohn Martin ... ... = 1.50\nMrs E.

Concrete base will be supplied under the furnace only.\n\nFLOOR JOISTS will be 2 x 8\n\nCEILING JOISTS - 2 x 6\n\nRAFTERS - 2 x 6\n\nWALL CONSTRUCTION will be 2 x 4 studding, grooved and tongued boards covered with 10 lb. felt and CLEAR WALL, New Brunswick Cedar shingles.\n\nROOF CONSTRUCTION will be 2 x 6 rafters covered with grooved and tongued sheathing, 10 lb. felt and EXTRAS, best grade New Brunswick Cedar shingles.\n\nINTERIOR WALLS will be covered with 2\" Spruce V Joint to match the present walls and ceiling of the present school.\n\nThe present partition between the school will be removed and what stock can be used will be used in the construction of the new addition.\nMr. John R. McMullen - 2 - July 12...39.\n\nFive new windows will be installed on the South side of the addition. These windows will correspond with the windows at present in the school.\n\nOne entrance door will be installed at the back, complete with all hardware.\n\nFinish floor inside will be hardwood.\n\nInterior finish painted two coats - ceilings and walls and all exterior finish painted two coats.\n\nIt will be necessary to remove the present buildings now at the rear of the school. The cost of moving has been taken care of, but if concrete wall is required under the building when moved to the new site, add $25.00\n\nConstruction includes furnace and chimney installed as specified in your letter.\n\nEvery attention will be given the construction of this building and work completed in time for use when school opens.\n\nYour word to go ahead with this will be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

It is of the utmost importance that agents should realize that only work for which provision has been made in the annual appropriations can be undertaken during the fiscal year.\n\nA few days ago you sought information, in a telegram, with respect to the desirability of placing hollow tile around the school.

S.\nAugust 18, 1939.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMrs. Wardle:\n\nRe: Drainage, Millbrook Indian Day School, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn reference to my memorandum of the 16th instant in regard to the above I quote the following report received from our engineer in amplification of his previous wire:\n\n\"I visited the school after getting in touch with the Agent, Mr. John McMillan.\n\n\"At the site work was under way on an extension 20'x22' at the rear of the present building. Basement excavation had been taken out, footings placed and forms for the concrete walls were being erected. Soil is a heavy, red, gumbo type of clay, and quite wet below the surface, there appearing to be many springs in the vicinity. Water had collected in the excavation so that footings were completely covered. Under the circumstances drainage of the basement is necessary, and I would recommend following the usual practice of laying farm tile around the outside of footings together with a carry off drain from the basement floor with catch-basin this drain to empty into the large drainage ditch through the Reserve, which would be at a lower enough level about 15 feet from the new basement to carry off the water. Excavation of a trench through the type of material encountered in the basement would be very slow and it is difficult to estimate a cost in this connection. However, basing costs on the work at the new basement, of which only a rough idea is available, the following estimate of cost has been prepared for the proposed installations:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Excavation, 100 c.y. @ $1.00 | $100.00 |\n| Backfill, 100 c.y. @ $.25    | $25.00  |\n| 68 lin.ft. farm tile in place| $15.00  |\n| 150 \" sewer pipe in place    | $65.00  |\n| Catch basin, concrete        | $25.00  |\n| Contingencies               | $20.00  |\n\nTotal - $250.00\n\nI would suggest that the Indian Affairs Branch be furnished with this data for their information.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

Davidson\nActing Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe Vilas Furniture Co., Limited,\nCowansville, Que.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRe Millbrook Indian Day School,\nColchester Indian Agency, N.S.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 3rd instant, we understand that Mr. William A. Hingley, R.R. No. 3, Truro, N.S., has submitted an offer to complete the well at the price mentioned in your memorandum, namely $2.50 a foot.\n\nIf necessary it will therefore be satisfactory to engage him to do the work. His offer would, of course, include the necessary five inch casing.\n\nIn view of the proposed survey that is being made of the Indian Agencies in Nova Scotia, might it not be well to postpone incurring this expense until Mr. Arneil has personally examined into the situation? It may be that when the final decision is reached as to the general Indian administration in that Province the Indians at this Agency will be moved to some other location, in which event the well would be of no further value.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, May 2, 1941.\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of March 25 in connection with drilling a well at the Millbrook Indian Day School.\n\nIt is intended to have a survey of the Indian Agencies in the Province of Nova Scotia within the next few weeks. Until this survey is completed I believe it advisable to postpone drilling a well at the Millbrook School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.R. McMullen,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe School Desks - 47-1-5\n\nI regret very much having made a mistake in this matter, and will do everything in my power to carry out the wishes of the Dept. and have the desks installed without delay.\n\nWill you kindly advise if this will be satisfactory?\n\nYours truly,\nJohn R.

The windows had to be done, a few panes of glass installed, the floor scrubbed, the boards cleaned etc., and I considered that it would be very unfair to the new janitor to insist that this be done for the usual salary. The other janitor had left the reserve temporarily. All this work was done for the allowance provided.\n\nI feel that to expect a janitor to scrub a school of this size once a month or even once a quarter along with the usual labor of making kindling, fires, making the usual repairs around a school, etc for a fee of five dollars per month that you are getting one hundred cents out of every dollar. The school in question is approx. 20' x 44' which is a great deal of scrubbing. It is also heated by a furnace, not the usual small school stove. I have been expecting the janitors to keep order and trespassers away from school property, mow the grass occasionally, etc which involves a great deal of time and labor. To supplement the small fee I, occasionally, give the janitor a load of wood. Were it not for this there would be no janitors available for at least two of our day schools.\n\nH. C.

Purdy, Esq.,\nTruro, N.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th re Mrs. Brooks. She never advises me when she requires anything, but seems to run to you with all her troubles. I have about 125 cords of wood cut on what is known as the rifle range lot back of the Millbrook reserve. This was cut last year but on account of having no snow it was impossible to get it out. The first snow this winter I arranged to have a team start hauling it out and up until the snow failed us they were hauling steady and distributing same to the Indian families on relief. Mrs. Brooks received two loads of this wood, and from what I can understand her son Charlie stole quite a bit of this from her. Have been waiting for more snow so I could get the balance of this wood out. I am up against the same proposition on this reserve and short of wood because of unfavourable hauling conditions. Will try and get her a load from here to keep her going at the earliest possible date. The school was closed down for one day on account of water in the cellar, that was at the time of the big rain. This place has been ditched a good many times, but cannot seem to overcome it. To have it fixed properly it would incur quite an expense which the Indian Affairs Branch do not feel like spending on this school.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. C. Rice - Indian Agent\nTRURO, N. S.,\nFeb. 17/47.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nThe portion of the enclosed letter dealing with\nthe school was in reply to one I wrote regarding a report in\nthe local paper that the school had been without fire for several days.\n\nPersonally I believe this was far more than one\nday.\n\nHowever, the point is that as the school is\nlocated in a good place for drainage there is no reason for\nthe condition not being corrected. Will you please try and\narrange for same.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. T. Purdy\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFebruary 17th, 1947.\n\nTo the Acting Deputy Minister\n\nAttention Director of Indian Affairs\n\nAttached please find letter to myself, dated Feb. 17, 1947, from G. T. Purdy, M.L.A., Truro, N.S., enclosing letter from H. C. Rice, Esq., Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S., with particular reference to the portion concerning the closing of the school because of water in the cellar, and requesting that this situation be corrected as the school is in a good place for drainage.\n\nPlease have a letter prepared for my signature to Mr. Purdy.\n\nW.

Purdy, Esq., M.L.A.,\nTruro, Nova Scotia.\n\nDear Mr. Purdy:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 17th.\n\nIn July, 1939, an addition was erected on the Millbrook Indian Day School by Mr. Howard Hayman, Contractor of Truro, Nova Scotia. In the course of excavating for the addition it was found that a great deal of water collected in the hole thus made. On August 18, 1939, an engineer of our Surveys and Engineering Branch reported as follows:\n\n\"At the site, work was under way on an extension 20'x22' at the rear of the present building. Basement excavation had been taken out, footings placed and forms for the concrete walls were being erected. Soil is a heavy, red, gumbo type of clay, and quite wet below the surface, there appearing to be many springs in the vicinity. Water had collected in the excavation so that footings were completely covered. Under the circumstances drainage of the basement is necessary, and I would recommend following the usual practice of laying farm tile around the outside of footings together with a carry off drain from the basement floor with catch-basin, this drain to empty into the large drainage ditch through the Reserve, which would be at a low enough level about 150 feet from the new basement to carry off the water. Excavation of a trench through the type of material encountered in the basement would be heavy work and it is difficult to estimate a cost in this connection. However, basing costs on the work at\nthe new basement of which only a rough idea is available, the following estimate of cost has been prepared for the proposed installations:\n\n- Excavation, 100 c.y. @ $1.00 = $100.00\n- Backfill, 100 c.y. @ .25 = 25.00\n- 88 lin. ft. farm tile in place = 15.00\n- 150 lin. ft. sewer pipe in place = 65.00\n- Catch basin, concrete = 25.00\n- Contingencies = 20.00\n\nTotal: $250.00\n\nIn accordance with his recommendations, he was authorized to carry out the construction of the necessary ditch and the installation of the whole tile.\n\nSince that time we have received no complaints concerning the flooding of the basement at this school. Therefore, it would seem that the water mentioned in your letter, is the result of the unusually heavy rains which we understand have occurred in that vicinity recently. This has evidently caused the above rise in both the ground water level and in the water flow from the many springs which our engineer reported in the vicinity of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.J.F.

Since taking the school I have suffered many inconveniences in respect to boardinghouse. The location of the Reserve makes it impossible to obtain a suitable boarding house. Will you please grant me a Pass from here to my home at Collon, a distance of ten miles. By doing this you will greatly favour.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJessie Scott.\nOTTAWA, 27th January, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMiss Jessie Scott, who has been teaching the Millbrook (N.S.) school for nearly three years writes stating that during all that time she has suffered many inconveniences on account of the difficulty in securing a suitable boarding place, and asks the Department to grant her a pass to her home which is ten miles from the Reserve. She evidently thinks that as the Intercolonial railway is a Government road there would be no difficulty in complying with her request. I do not see that the Department could very well ask for a pass but it is quite certain that it is next to impossible for a white teacher to find a decent place to board on an Indian reserve.\n\nThe only way I see to overcome the difficulty would be to add two rooms to the schoolhouse, which was only put up in '98 at a cost of $269.00. I would suggest that the Agent be asked to state the probable cost of this work.\n\nI suppose a cheap rate commutation ticket could be obtained from the Railway but the teacher would naturally expect to have her present salary of $300.00 increased to meet its cost.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 28th January, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Indian school on the Hillbrook reserve says that she has great difficulty in securing a suitable boarding place on the reserve. It is thought that this difficulty might be overcome if an addition were made to the schoolhouse, which would provide two rooms. The Department would like to have a report from you as to whether an addition could be made to the present building, and if so, what would be the probable cost entailed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas B. Smith, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N.S.\nReceived a letter from the Dept. of Indian Affairs dated Ottawa, Jan. 19th, wishing me to report, as to the probable cost of an addition of two rooms to the school house.\n\nTwo rooms added to the school house say about 12 feet square properly finished would cost in the neighborhood of $500\u2014 one hundred and fifty dollars. It would be necessary to have the building insured, which it is not at present. A two roomed cottage would cost from $250 to $300 more and not be so much risk on account of fire.\n\nI asked Miss Scott the teacher what the matter was as she has a nice boarding place about 250 yards from the school house. There did not seem to be anything the matter except the board like an imaginary illness.\n\nH. B. Smith\nIndian Agent\nPoveshell\nExtract of letter from Mr. Superintendent Boyd, dated April 26th, 1920, on file #27047 (Survey Colchester Co.)\n\nOriginal on file # 27047.\n\nThe allotment of locations on the Creelman property in question was made, as you suggested, by the Indians particularly interested drawing tickets bearing numbers corresponding to those on a plan of the locations, with which Mr. W. F. Jennison, M.E. provided me, and which was perfectly understood by all present at the meeting. This method had the approval of both Halifax and Truro Indians. However, in the end, those who got the better locations were well satisfied, while those getting inferior ones were not.\n\nWith regard to lot 12, which contains the Creelman dwelling and other buildings, I suggested to the Indians the advisability of using it as a teacher's residence, and they were very favourable impressed with the idea. I recommend that it be retained by the Department for that purpose, because it seems to be something of a bone of contention among several of the Indians, and if none of them get it, I believe that all concerned will be well pleased.\nExtract from letter of J. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary, addressed to A. J. Boyd,\nIndian Agent, dated May 3rd, 1920.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nOriginal on File # 27047 (Survey\nColchester Co.)\n\nIn regard to your suggestion that lot No. 12\nwhich contains the farm buildings of Mr.\nCreelman which were sold with the property,\nthat the house and buildings should become\nthe residence of the teacher, this arrange-\nment appears to be satisfactory as all the\ninterested Indians expressed themselves as being\nagreeable.\nSir,\n\nJoe Julien (Chief) is living in the original house on the Creelman portion of the Micmac Reserve having been placed there by Mr. Boyd. The Chief is anxious to know if he is to continue to occupy this house and he also asks me to inform you that it is in need of extensive repairs. I find a stone wall under the house, part of which has fallen down and part of it will soon follow. The entire wall under the older portion seems to be taken down and rebuilt. The wall under the newer portion of the house seems to be in good order. Also the entire roof would require reshingling.\n\nThe house has already settled with resultant damage to plastered walls and if it is to be saved it must have attention this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, May 3rd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the house on the Creelman portion of the Millbrook Reserve, which is at present occupied by Chief Joe Julien.\n\nIn reply, I have to request that you will be good enough to furnish an estimate of the approximate cost of having this building put into a good state of repair. You should state the cost of having the stone wall under the house taken down and rebuilt, also the cost of re-shingling the roof, as well as any other repairs necessary.\n\nIn connection with this building, I may say that Mr. Superintendent Boyd suggested to the Indians the advisability of using this building as a teacher's residence, and he recommended that it be retained by the Department for that purpose. The Department understands that the present teacher is living at home, and that there is no need of this building being utilized for a teacher's residence at the present time.\n\nRegarding the Chief continuing to occupy this house, I have to request that you will be good enough to consult Mr. Superintendent Boyd in the matter, and if he is agreeable to the Chief remaining in the house, the Department will have no objection.\n\nAs soon as you have furnished full information as to the cost of making the repairs, the Department will be in a position to consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N.S.\nSir,\n\nThe \"Creeksman\" house on Millbrook Reserve is badly in need of repairs as to roof and cellar walls but as I plan to go to Ottawa to attend the D.C.R.A. meeting I will try to arrange a visit to the Dept. and take the matter up on the spot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI feel obliged to again call your attention to the need of repairs to the \"Creeleman\" house (occupied temporarily by Chief Julien) on the Michelbruch Reserve. It requires about 8 # shingles to put the roof in order and if a little more work falls down in the main house will settle into the cellar, this is too good a house to allow to go to destruction in this way and I would recommend that the roof be repaired and enough pillars be erected under the walls to prevent further settling. Some jacking up would be required as the house has already settled and twisted.\n\nAs the Chief is occupying this house no doubt he can furnish a part of the labor required.\n\nThe expenditure to save this house need not exceed $100.00 but the repair should be made promptly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR. H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nThis house can be Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nTell us teacher's name.\nWrite out his name.\nInform him at once.\nK.H.T.\nOttawa, Sept. 13, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the \"Greelman\" house on the Millbrook Reserve, which it is proposed to use for the purpose of a teacher's residence in connection with the school on this reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately $100 in having the repairs required undertaken to this building. You may, therefore, arrange to have the roof repaired, the house jacked up and sufficient foundation put under to prevent further settling.\n\nIn purchasing any material needed, competitive prices should first be obtained and the goods procured from the firm quoting the lowest price. If you consider it would be more satisfactory to have this work done by contract, you should obtain prices from a number of competent contractors and give the work to the one quoting the lowest price. The contractors are to furnish all material and labour required.\n\nWhen the work is completed you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, and, if you make the purchase of the material, a memo should be attached showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. If the work is done by day labour, proper time sheets should be furnished.\n\nThe Chief who is occupying this house should furnish a part of the labour needed.

Kennedy\nSir,\n\nHerewith Voucher No. 2 in connection with the repairs to the Bremer's house for authority 47-1-8 of Sept. 13, 1922. I found on closer examination that it would not be necessary to shingle quite so much of the roof as I at first thought to do. I did one side of the main house and one side of the ell and patched the remainder so that I think it will be OK for a couple of years. This completes the repair to the roof but the foundation is yet to be gone over. I did not get any labour out of the Chief on the roof job but expect him to contribute on the remaining work after repairing the roof of a shed where we keep our farm implements. I will have about 1/2 of shingles on hand and these will come in handy on another job which will have to be done this fall and on which I will report later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing my list for repairs to the foundation of the Creeman House on Millbrook Reserve per June 47-1-8 of Sept 13/22. Not being able to secure the services of a stone mason last fall I was obliged to lay the matter over. It is all Indian Labour, Claude doing the mason work.\n\nWe took down the wall (where it had not already fallen down) on three sides of the main building and rebuilt it without mortar using the same stone. The remaining side and the wall under the ell have been started by the frost but I think will stay up for a time, owing to the nature of the soil it leaves badly with the frost and is a hard place to keep a stone wall up.\n\nThere is some cleaning up and grading to do yet but I am hoping to get the Chief to do this without charge sometime during the summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.H. Keecey\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nChief Joe Julien who is living in the Creelman House on Millbrook Reserve is afraid that the chimney is unsafe and expects that the Dept. should take it down and rebuild it. As far as I can see there does not seem to be any break in it, but unless some of the plaster and brick was removed it is impossible to say just what condition it is in. As Julien is not paying any rent for the house it would look as if he should do the job at his own expense, at least I would say if the Dept decide to have the work done Julien should do the tearing down and clean the brick ready for a mason to rebuild.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR.H.

You will therefore be kind enough to advise Mr Campbell accordingly and, when informing Miss Boyd of her appointment, to advise her that it is the custom of the Department, when a teacher takes charge of a school in a term during which the summer vacation occurs, to make payment for the actual number of days the school has been open. If, however, such teacher continues in the employ of the Department a year and makes up the total number of school days required, the balance of the year's salary will be paid.\n\nThe Certificate of Mr John Langley, an applicant for the position of teacher of the Salmon River school, is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

There is no school open in his own section owing to the fact that a new school house is being erected and will only be completed at the end of the school term. The land owner is quite satisfied to have two or three white children come, assures me that their attendance would not interfere with the practical work of the school. Can I give the permission asked for?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nInd. Agent\nOttawa, 11th November, 1898.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, stating that a white man residing near the Salmon River Indian school has applied to you for permission to send two of his children to that school until the neighbouring white school is re-opened, which will be when the new building at present in course of erection is finished.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as the teacher of the Indian school is willing to receive these children, and is satisfied that their admission will not be of any disadvantage to the Indian children, the Department has no objection to their being allowed to attend on their father agreeing to pay the customary fee of 50 cents each per month. Such fees are paid to the Department, and are not a prerequisite of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Dear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 10th inst., in reference to the payment of Provincial Government grants to teachers in Indian Schools; and in reply, shall explain the situation as briefly as possible.\n\nIt appears there was question of employing a teacher for the Indian reservation at Sydney, and it was sought to secure for her the Provincial grant. In the course of correspondence the Superintendent wrote me, in part, as follows: (I only quote the most relevant points.)\n\n\"In McKinnon's inspectorate, it was found that provincial aid was given to a teacher in an Indian school who had a Provincial license. The Dominion Government Agent considered it strange, and so did I, from the other point of view. The only case in which I authorized the Provincial aid to be paid a teacher was when the school was taken under the charge of the trustees of the school section.\"\n\n\"Several members of parliament have been approached, asking the grant to be given if it is possible. Now, it is possible only on condition of the schools being assumed by some Board of Trustees of the public schools. If the Dominion Government can thus subsidize an Indian...\"\nschool, I think the way is clear for us\u2014possibly not. But there is no possibility of an giving a grant to a teacher not engaged in a free public school.\n\n\"What has been the practice in your Inspectorial district? And do you think an arrangement can be made to bring the Indian school under one of our school boards.\"\n\nYou will observe that the above possible concession presupposes an Indian school established in a public school section organized under our school system.\n\nTo this I replied that in my district, there were two Indian schools, one in each county. That when I assumed office, I found the practice had been to pay the provincial grant to the teachers in both, provided they were regularly licensed teachers; that I had followed the practice ever since, placing the names of the teachers in my paylists, and entering the Indian sections in the County Fund Sheets for purposes of statistics, but apportioning to them no share in the County Funds, and that such sheets had always been approved by the Education Department.\n\nNext, I received a letter containing the following:\n\n\"You should inform anyone teaching in an Indian school that they need not expect any provincial grant from the Province of Nova Scotia unless they are regularly under a school board and are in every respect carrying out the Nova Scotia law as well as the Dominion laws. The Dominion authorities should be notified in the case you specify, and requested to make good the loss of the Provincial grant to the teacher.\"\n\nI am, Dear Rev. Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nM.J.T. Macneil\nInspector\nD. Peter's Indian Agency\nRichmond Co., Vt.\n250062\n\nBrook Village Oct 17th 903\n\nFrank Redington\nDeputy Chief General Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose here-with a letter from School Inspector Macmillan regarding Provincial aid to Indian schools. The letter speaks for itself.\n\nThe Dept. of Education of this province\u2014Dr. MacKay\u2014appears to deny the right of Indian school commissioners aid on the ground that these schools do not comply with the laws and regulations of Massachusetts School Acts. Owing to the complexity of Indian schools and the manner of their support, compliance in every particular to N.S. school law is not necessary or possible. For instance, the N.S. school law provides that an annual meeting be called every year to elect school board and vote money for school purposes.\nIncluding rentals, fuel &c &c and\nfor implementing Provincial\ngrant in hiring teachers. In case\nof certain schools, the Dept. supply\nwhat the school laws require\nof school sections and the Indians\nare not yet sufficiently advanced\nin intelligence to form a school\nBoard and control school.\nAs far as the school in my charge\nis concerned I have always\nendeavored to comply with\nthe provisions of the N.School\nlaws as far as possible. A\nfully licensed teacher has been\nalways engaged, the school\nhas been always open to normal\ninstructors and the required\nannual school returns have\nbeen submitted. I do not consider\nit fair for N.S government\nto withdraw provincial aid\nfrom on the ground that the\ndept. supply what is required\nby law of the school section\nof provincial aid be with-\ndrawn the dept. will either\nbe obliged to advance their\ngrant or close down the\nthe schools. No qualified trained teacher can be induced to teach in our schools, there has been less salary than has been hitherto given. I hope the Indian schools will not be deprived of competent and our technical knowledge. I do not think it would be fair. They to suggest why to consult with Hon Mr. Fielding about this matter. His opinion has great weight with H.S. Government. I have recently hired a teacher for school in Salmon River reserve, with the full understanding that she would get $250 from both and the usual provincial aid.\n\nI believe we will be able to arrange matters satisfactorily.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Turner\nInd. Agent\n\nFrank Redden\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 27th October, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Agent Fraser of St Peter's Nova Scotia forwards a letter from Mr Public School Inspector McNeil on the subject of Provincial aid to Indian schools.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Government has decided to withdraw the grant previously paid to qualified teachers employed by this Department on the ground that such schools do not comply with the requirements of the Nova Scotia School Law (Sec.68, page 19). Our Agent states that the teacher lately engaged by him to take charge of the Salmon River school was employed on the understanding that her salary would be supplemented by this grant and he asks the Department to use its influence with the Nova Scotia Government to have the grant continued, or provide the difference.\n\nI do not see that this Department has any claim on the Government of Nova Scotia for a grant towards the salary of its teachers, and as it will not continue payment without compliance with its School Law, which is impossible, the only thing to be done is to increase the salaries if qualified teachers cannot be found for the amount now paid by the Department, and I would suggest that an all-round rate of $300.00 be paid in Nova Scotia.\nIf there are any reserves near enough to white schools for the children to attend, it would be well to try and arrange with the trustees for their tuition; in which event the Indian school could be closed and the Provincial grant to the teacher supplemented by a tuition fee for each child in attendance.\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nAs the Government of Nova Scotia has withdrawn its Indian school grants, I think the only course open to the Department is to make up the deficiency. In order to make the rate of pay $500 to all schools, we will have to increase the appropriation next year by $400. For the current year it will be possible to give the increase from existing appropriations. At the end of the fiscal year 1902-1903 there remained $1,700 of the vote unexpended, and I think it will be safe to count on a surplus for the current year. More than one-quarter of the current year is already past; we will be called upon to make good the deficiency for the whole year.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOTTAWA, October 29th\u2014\n\nDept. of I.A.\nOTTAWA, 29th October, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn further reference to the question of Provincial aid to Indian schools in Nova Scotia I beg to say that for the following reasons, the teachers of such schools are not entitled, under the Education Act of Nova Scotia, to receive any amount provided in Section 68 of the above Act:\n\nThe Indian schools in this Province are situated on Indian reserves which are exempt from all taxation. By the British North America Act, Indians and lands reserved for Indians are dealt with by the Dominion Government and not by the Provincial Government, which has power to make legislation respecting education, and the Indians are exempt from the provisions of the Education Act as wards of the Government.\n\nA teacher in Nova Scotia, who wishes to draw the aid provided by the Provincial Treasury, must first be legally qualified and the school must be conducted according to the Provincial Law, which provides that each school shall be under the control of a Board of Trustees who are elected by the rate-payers. As there are no rate-payers on the reserve, a Board of Trustees cannot be elected according to this Act. Teachers of Indian schools on reserves are therefore ineligible for Provincial aid.\n\n[Signature]\nW Benson\n\n\"Passed like a court\nvacation statement having\nin what respect the\nteachers in Indian\nschools is W.S. do not\ncomply with the Provincial\nregulations.\"\nOTTAWA, 30th October, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant enclosing a communication from Mr Public School Inspector McNeill on the subject of Provincial aid to Indian schools; and in reply I beg to inform you that although the Department did not take into consideration the question of a Provincial grant to Indian school teachers in Nova Scotia when fixing its salaries, it will, in view of the increased cost of living, pay the teacher of the Salmon River school at the rate of $300.00 a year.

McDonald, Salmon\nRiver reserve is not behaving himself so\nwell of late and has become restless\nand careless in conducting the school.\nI have therefore decided with your approval\nand permission to discontinue his services\nand have the school closed for the\nnext quarter and have the teacher's\nsalary converted into a relief fund\nfor poor destitute Indians of the reserve.\nThe country down here is in a most\ndeplorable and distressing condition\nthis year owing to the great failure\nof crops last summer and the Indians\nwill require help to keep them from starving.\nBesides the assistance rendered our\nprevious years, Besides the Indian\nSchool is out of repair and must\nbe shingled and painted as soon as\nThe weather will permit. Again the attendance at school during the last quarter\u2014owing to seed time\u2014is always small and very little writing will be done by having the school closed during the next three months while $75 can be saved to help relieve fund and the repairing of school house kindly let me know at once by bring some if you approve. Having school closed under the circumstances I am arranging signing with the teacher's contract and may be even compelled to dismiss him at once owing to his conduct\u2014and in this case the school will necessarily be vacant for the next quarter as no other teacher will be available until the end of the school year.

Your proposition to use the salary for relief cannot be entertained, as money voted for schools cannot be used for any other purpose and special application will have to be made for the relief needed, giving full particulars.\n\nIf you feel justified in suspending the teacher, it will be necessary for you to make a special report in his case.

I called this matter\nto your attention last\nfall and I am sure\nyou considered it was\ntoo late in the season\nto make the necessary\nrepairs. The school has\nto be shingled and painted.\nWith some smaller remarks, I do not know what it will cost to have all the necessary work done, but I think $60 or $70 would be sufficient. Regarding small attendance in school for the last few years I may submit this explanation. A few years ago you are aware one of the Indians John Johnson became violently insane. He made a desperate assault upon the school, breaking windows, doors etc., and terrifying almost to death the Indian teacher Miss Boyd and her pupils. The Indians of the reserve with their children left the reserve.\n\nTerror threatened by the same conductor Johnson Miss Boyd resigned shortly afterwards. The children ever since seem to have an aversion to attend school and the young men who succeeded Miss Boyd although they gave promises of good service in the beginning did not exercise the zeal that I expected of them to draw the children back to school. I have no doubt however that through a little patience and time the difficulty of getting the children to attend will be overcome. I think as a rule female teachers will do better.\nOTTAWA, 7th April, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr Joseph L.

Macquill, Inspector Schools\nLacovici enclosed.\n\nAm,\nHospitality cordially,\n\nHarrietta O'Shaile,\n\nSecond New School Trustee, C.B.,\nMay 30th, 1907.\nDear Father Fraser,\n\nIf you are in a position to do so, and if it suits you, I would suggest, please, to let me know at any time whether Miss Sarah O'Neal intends heading off to the Indian School at Baie Verte. Her sister, Miss Henrietta, who has been our teacher for the past two years, has just agreed not to continue here for another year, but she refuses to sign any agreement at present. It seems to be a very serious situation, and I think the rumor is well founded, that Miss Sarah O'Neal prefers teaching at the missionary school in the cold autumn air, which would make her less valuable as a teacher. She seems to be an excellent teacher, and I believe she would be very valuable as an auxiliary to the work of a parish priest, and I would be very pleased to have her as a good teacher, with a good strong character. I do not want the position to go to someone who does not have the necessary qualifications. The mission is very important, and we need someone who can give their best to the work of the church.\n\nPlease let me know whether Miss Sarah has resigned, and whether Miss Henrietta is an applicant for the position. Be assured that the source of any information you may choose to give will never be disclosed. Believe me,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n314140\n\nLac des Rues Inhabitants\n\nFeb 28, 67\nPicton No. June 27, 1907\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss Sara O'Neil has notified me that after the present quarter she will give up teaching the Indians at Salmon River reserve. Her sister Miss Henrietta has applied for the school\u2014and she is the only applicant. You will notice by the enclosed letter from Rev. Nathan Thompson that her services as a teacher are appreciated where she taught last year and she is pleased to sign an agreement for the coming year. But she prefers to teach at Salmon River.\n\nShe is a good young lady and I think we had better have her appointed at once, beginning with the 1st of Oct., next. Unless we secure the services of a teacher now, it will be impossible to get a teacher in Oct., as all the teachers will be employed in other schools by that time.\n\nI trust you will see your way clear to make an appointment at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn Fowler\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 609, file 257-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 2, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ult., advising the Department of the resignation of Miss Sara E. O'Toole as teacher of the Salmon River school and enclosing an application from her sister, Miss Henrietta O'Toole for the position, together with her certificate and a communication addressed to you in the matter by the Rev. Father Tompkins.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to accept the services of Miss Henrietta O'Toole, and you will be good enough to advise her accordingly. Her salary will be at the rate of $300 per annum and she should take charge of the school on the reopening after the summer holidays, about August 15 next, not on October 1, as suggested by you.\n\nMiss O'Toole's certificate is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Tule that the teacher at Salmon River R. Richmond Co. that she be given an increase of salary. Mr. Hgt says the teacher is concerned that she does her work faithfully. He suggests however that if the pay has not sufficient information in regard to Mr. O. Tule's note that we get a receipt from him. I think he signed.\n\nFor Lie.\nOttawa, November 19th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nApplication has been made on behalf of Miss O'Toole, Teacher of the Salmon River School, for an increase in salary, and I have to ask you to be good enough to proceed to the reserve at your earliest convenience and make a thorough inspection of the school, dealing not only with the class work but also with the condition of the school-house, outbuildings, grounds, fences, etc.\n\nIn case you should decide to recommend that Miss O'Toole be granted an increase the Department would like you to take up with her the question of teaching sewing and the making of simple articles of clothing for the children in the school, and also to ascertain whether she would be willing to conduct a garden, provided suitable ground is available in the neighborhood of the school.\n\nThe Department will await your report on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, December 14th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant advising the Department that the salary that you have agreed to pay Michael Paul as janitor of the Salmon River school is $18.00 for the school term, he to furnish all necessary fuel.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. D. McMillan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJohnstown, N.S.\nOttawa, December 16th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 19th ultimo in which you were asked to make an inspection of the Salmon River school at your earliest convenience with a view to reporting upon the request of the teacher for an increase in salary, and to ascertain whether she would be willing to take up the teaching of sewing and gardening.\n\nThe Department is very anxious to have your report as soon as possible as it wishes to deal with the matter promptly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nMy report going forward in reference to your letter of nineteenth ultimo recommends that Miss Otoole teacher Salmon-River reserve be granted an increase of salary.\n\nA J Boyd\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I beg to say that on a recent visit to the Salmon River Reserve, I took occasion to carefully examine the school conducted by Miss Henriette O'Toole, Indian Teacher, both with regard to class work and to the condition of the buildings, grounds, fences, etc., and, as a result of my inspection, I have to submit the following report:\n\nI requested Miss O'Toole, who is a normal School graduate, to give lessons and exercises to the five classes that were present at the time, which she did with alacrity; and her method of teaching showed proficiency of a high order. In my estimation her capability as a teacher of her class cannot be questioned; and her all-round qualifications which she uses in the performance of her duties to the best advantage, under the circumstances, as demonstrated to me, entitle her to an increase of salary, which I respectfully recommend.\n\nShe had unwittingly the Department's idea of teaching Indian girls attending school to sew and to make simple articles of clothing. Having already given them sewing to her school instructions in useful needlework, at which she is an expert. She informed me that her pupils showed particular aptitude and much interest in acquiring knowledge of that kind, and that she would be much pleased to continue such instructions on a more extended scale. She also expressed her willingness to conduct a garden in connection with her school, providing suitable ground can be obtained.\n\nIt is to be regretted that Miss O'Toole's efforts as a teacher have been paralyzed to a serious extent for\nwant of proper accommodations, the school-room itself under present circumstances being very uncomfortable, and I shall endeavour to show. It is supposed to occupy the whole building whose dimensions are 16' x 24', and in the past or walls but part of it is used as a store-room for fuel, the wood shed having been yet provided. Besides, there is no porch or entry to the house, and every time the only door is opened the occupants of the school get the benefit, to a certain extent, of weather conditions outside.\n\nAccepting a fair supply of books, slates, maps, etc., the school-room is practically void of suitable furniture. The seats are long benches 22 inches high, made roughly of deal planks, and they extend from side wall to within eighteen inches of the centre of the room, leaving but one alley or passage, 3 feet wide between the door and the teacher's platform. The desks correspond in length with the seats and are made of deals and inch boards. They are 2 ft. 9 inches high at the back and 5 inches lower in front, with a flat top 3 inches wide and a slant face one foot wide.\n\nThe arrangement of seats and desks in two rows, beginning near the front or entrance of the school-room and stopping close to the teacher's platform, is the only one possible with such seats and desks, and is a source of constant annoyance to a pupil anxious to take or leave his seat without disturbing all the others occupying the same bench. Therefore, condemn these seats and desks as unsuitable in every particular\u2014dimensions, form, and arrangement\u2014and strongly advise replacing them with new desks of proper dimensions, and of modern pattern.\n\nThe teacher's desk is a common board table.\nthree feet square and should be discarded for something more appropriate. The book case, or cupboard, is simply a small box fastened to the wall and hardly serves the purpose intended.\n\nThe interior of the school house has never been finished, the walls having received but one rough coat of plaster. The floor is defective, allowing the cold air from beneath to come through, and increasing the difficulty of keeping the school-room warm and comfortable. These conditions require to be improved. Stone windows also should be provided.\n\nIn my judgment the area of school grounds at Salmon River does not exceed one fourth of an acre, and it is not fenced. In fact, no fence is necessary unless the grounds can be enlarged by the acquisition of other land. Suitable ground for a garden adjoins the school premises, but whether the owners will dispose of it or not I have been unable, so far, to ascertain.\n\nNow, having run over our duties, I think that a porch or entry to the school house, and a wind-shed, should be provided as soon as possible. Other improvements could not well be undertaken till the spring.\n\nIn connection with the school, there are two good aboats, in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Boyd,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 8th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Miss O'Toole, teacher of the Salmon River School, to $350.00 from the first of the current quarter.\n\nMr. Superintendent Boyd, who recently visited this school, reports that suitable ground for a garden adjoins the school premises. The Department would like to take up the teaching of gardening at this school next summer if a small piece of this land could be obtained, and you will be good enough to make the necessary inquiries and report as to the terms on which it can be had. It is thought that a quarter of an acre would be ample ground for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) S. Stewart\nClerk Secretary.\n\nW. D. McMillan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJohnstown, N.S.\nAgain thanking you for your kindness in looking after me.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\n\nJanuary 24, 1910\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10), Volume 6049, File 257-1, part 1)\n\n[Seal]\n\nJanuary 24, 1910\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\n\nJanuary 24, 1910\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\n3.\n\n2 yds.

The other repairs and the supplying of proper furniture will have to stand over until the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) S. Stewart\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver B\u00e9arnois, N.S.\nOttawa, January 8th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a very commendatory report on your work at the Salmon River school from Mr. A. J. Boyd, Indian Superintendent, and, as a recognition of your services, has decided to increase your salary to $350.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter. Mr. McMillan, the Agent, will be so advised.\n\nIn regard to the teaching of sewing the Department will be very pleased to have you take up this work, and I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether you can purchase the necessary supplies, such as flannel-ette, needles, thread, etc., and what the probable cost would be.\n\nThe question of obtaining land for the purpose of conducting a school garden will be taken up with the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) S.

S.\nExtract from teacher's report on the Salmon River school for the year ending March 31, 1910.\n\nMigration, at certain seasons, from the Reserve, causes non-attendance. When at home, irregularity is caused by insufficient food; for instance, some children go home at noon intermission to find no dinner has been prepared for them. In such cases they remain at home. If luncheon could be served at the school-house at noon-hour, it would not only keep the Juvenile Band together, but would induce them to attend regularly.\nOttawa, March 10th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your report on the Salmon River school for the current year I beg to say that your suggestions in reference to a mid-day meal have been noted.\n\nFor your information I may say that in a number of Indian schools a simple mid-day meal, costing about 2 cents per pupil each day, is now provided and prepared by the teacher and older girls; the object not being to furnish a full meal but rather to supplement the lunches brought by the children, and give the girls an object lesson in preparing a meal. Provisions such as beans, rice, bacon, etc., are supplied by the Department, as well as the necessary utensils.\n\nYou will be good enough to let the Department have your views on this matter and state whether you would be willing to undertake the work of preparing the meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Henrietta O'Toole,\nTeacher,\nBarra Head, N. S.\nvery much interested. During\nthe coming season, the amount\nof work will be small,\nowing to migration of families\nfrom this Reserve.\n\nAgain assuring you\nthat I shall be pleased to\ndo anything in connection\nwith preparing and serving\nthis\u50a8\u5907 meal to my\npeople.\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nBelieve you,\n\nDane Head, W. S. Henrietta O'Keefe\n\nMarch 30, 1910.\n\nSir, I am in receipt of\nyour of the 26th inst., which\ninforms me of the supplies\nto be served at breakfast to\nselect children on the Reserve.\nIn reply, I wish to\nsay I am unable willing to\nprepare this meal for my people.\nThis may be, however, circum-\nstances, which I am about to\nmention, that are against\nme in the preparation of this meal\nfrom the provisions you have\nmentioned, viz.: beans, rice, bacon,\n&c. I have no place\nto store provisions indefinitely.\nAgain, the season during which I am not provided with fuel or fire, could we not have cheese or better sandwiches (croakers) instead? I am only suggesting these things that they may assist you in helping the poor children until such time as our school house will have the proper equipment to serve the best you referred to. No. 1977.\n\nI am pleased to say that the members of my evening class are doing very well. Some of them are apt pupils, and all are\n\nSecondly, I am not provided with fuel or fire from May 1st to Nov. 1st of every year.\n\nThirdly, the store is for teaching purposes only, and will not be used.\n\nThere are the obstacles at present; but to overcome them, I would suggest that when the proposed necessary repairs (June 24th) are being made to this school house, that a closet in the building, for the keeping of provisions, be included as a necessity, and consequently constructed.\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in reference to the mid-day meal and suggested improvements at the Salmon-River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion to give, during the summer months, a light lunch, which will not necessitate the making of a fire. You may, therefore, purchase some biscuits and cheese.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the need of a cupboard are noted and when the other repairs are being made to this school during the summer season this matter will be attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Henrietta O'Toole,\nTeacher,\nBarra Head, N.S.\nSecond Class Certificate\nReturned to\nMr. Boyd\nMiss Henrietta O'Toole,\nBarra Head, Richmond Co., C.B.\n\nDear Miss O'Toole:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., and I am indeed very favorably impressed with the fair and cogent manner in which you have presented your case on behalf of the party you mention. I may say at once that your dismissal never occurred to me for a moment, nor had it ever entered my mind. I will be very glad indeed to do what I can to secure Miss Devereaux the position provided she has requisite qualifications. You had better tell her to see the Rev. R.L. McDonald P.P. at St. Peters in this matter as his certificate will assist very materially.\n\nYour reference to the political affiliations of the late Mr. Devereaux were entirely unnecessary. He had a perfect right to think politically as he pleased and act accordingly at least while he kept within legitimate limits, and this I think he always did. In any case the past should be forgotten. I will be pleased to do anything I can to secure for his daughter the position mentioned provided she be qualified to fill the same.\n\nI thank you cordially for your kind expressions in your letter towards myself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nLest thou be my concern,\n\nSincerely,\n\nRecommended by Mr. Macdonald, a\n\nYoung lady whose character is absolutely\n\nabove reproach.\n\nS.

She is not trained in all the subjects required to undertake such a task.\n\nWe will not undertake to overrule her own rule to advise you in this matter.

A. Gillies\nOttawa, September 3, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn December, last, Miss Henrietta O'Toole, teacher of the Salmon River School, sent in her resignation, which was forwarded to the Department by Mr. Boyd, Indian Superintendent, who recommended the appointment of Miss Charlotte Mary Devereaux in her stead. Mr. Agent McDonald also endorsed Miss Devereaux's appointment and there is a letter on file from Mr. Gillis, Barrister, of Sydney, Cape Breton, addressed to Miss O'Toole in which he states that he will be very glad to do what he can to secure Miss Devereaux the position, provided she has the requisite qualifications. Miss Devereaux is the holder of a Second-class certificate, which was forwarded to the Department and approved, and she was appointed at a salary of $350.00 per annum.\n\nOn the 26th ultimo Mr. Gillis sent the following wire to the Department:- \"Present teacher Indian School St. Peters not satisfactory and must not be re-engaged. I recommend the engagement of Mr. Ernest McNeil Barra Head near St. Peters as teacher of this school. Please see that\n\"he be engaged immediately your agent St. Peters knows him\n\"well he is most competent in every respect.\" and on the\n27th he was informed that the Department would not be\njustified in summarily dismissing Miss Devereaux without\ncause. He wrote the Department of the 27th confirming\nhis telegram and stating that complaints are continually\nmade against the efficiency of the school as conducted\nby the present teacher and that it is absolutely necessary\nthat there should be a change. He recommends Mr. Ernest\nMcNeill of Barra Head for the position and asks the Depart-\nment to see that his suggestion is carried into effect with-\nout delay. Another telegram has been received from Mr.\nGillis, dated the 31st ultimo, which reads as follows:-\n\"Letter twenty-seventh just received. If present teacher\nbe engaged it will be great blunder. I am personally\naware of the situation and I protest against her re-\nengagement. Please carry out my advice and engage Ernest\nMcNeill.\"\n\nThe Department has had no official complaints\nagainst Miss Devereaux's management of the school, in\nfact Mr. Agent McDonald's reports show that the school is\nprogressing favourably under her charge and I doubt if the\nDepartment would be justified in summarily dismissing her without notice, especially at this time of the year when it would be a difficult matter for a teacher to obtain another school. It is for the Department to say what action is to be taken on Mr. Gillis' telegram.\n\nSince the foregoing was written a letter has been received from Mr. Gillies in which he again insists upon the dismissal of Miss Devereaux, as he says for good and sufficient reasons. As I pointed out there are no reasons shown and the Agent has made no report confirming Mr. Gillies' statements. I consider that Miss Devereaux is still the teacher of this school and would be justly entitled to demand pecuniary compensation if she were dismissed now. If her services were unsatisfactory Mr. Gillies should not have waited till the time for the re-opening of the school came to bring this matter to the Department's attention. I think it all fairness to the teacher further inquiries should be made.\nOttawa September 5, 1912.\n\nEXD.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram and letter of the 31st ultimo in further reference to your demand for a change of teacher on the Salmon River Indian school and in reply I beg to say that it is the rule of the Department that teachers of Indian schools are retained in office so long as their services are satisfactory. Summary dismissal only takes place when good and sufficient cause to justify it is shown, which has not been done in this case.\n\nShould the Department, for any reason wish to dispense with the services of a teacher due notice is given.\n\nThe monthly reports on this school, sent in by the Rev. Mr. McDonald, our local agent, do not indicate that Miss Devereaux's services have been other than satisfactory.\n\nThe Department will call for a full report on Miss Devereaux conduct of this school and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ.A. Gillies, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister,\nSydney,\nCape Breton.\nOttawa September 5, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to request that you will report fully in regard to the way in which the Salmon River school has been carried on since Miss Devereaux has had charge of it.\n\nThe Department wishes to have more detailed information than is contained in your monthly reports on this school.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter you prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. H.L. MacDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nSt. Peters\nCape Breton.\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to write you with regards St. Anne's Indian School in which I am at present employed as teacher.\n\nIt has recently come to my notice that my dismissal is being considered and on inquiring into the matter, I find that no fault had been found with me or my teaching that would occasion the above said consideration.\n\nIn view of the fact that it was Mr. J. A. Gillies (who carries the patronage of the country) who agreed to my appointment last nine months ago, with a recommendation from Rev. P. L. Macdonald, Agent at present, I cannot understand on what grounds my dismissal-to-be stands.\n\nI have written the said gentleman, Mr. Gillies, before any final steps are being taken in the matter, to find out wherein lies the difficulty; and I humbly ask\nthe Department of Indian Affairs\nto kindly consider the proposition I\nhave presented as well.\n\nHaving held the position for such a\nbrief period, I am wholly unprepared\nto meet the dismissal considered, par-\nticularly at such a season as this when\nPublic Schools leave us suitable\nVacancies if any at all.\n\nI did not intend teaching any longer\nthan the present term ending June 30,\n1913, at which time you would have\nreceived my resignation.\n\nBeing a female orphan in the\ninfancy of womanhood, I must nec-\nessarily resort for my living in the patter\nin which I began. My appeal then is\npersonal, and I thank you for your\nkind interest and information if may\nplease you to favour me with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharlotte M. Dewey\n\nSt. Peters, N.S.,\nSept. 27th 1/2.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, October 3, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo I beg to inform you that the Department has no intention of dispensing with your services as teacher of the Salmon River Indian School so long as they are satisfactory. I may state, however, for your information that Mr. Agent MacDonald has been asked for a report on the manner in which you conduct your school and I can assure you that you will not be dismissed without sufficient cause.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

This School\n(School District No. 1) has been\nclosed because of the shortage\nof teachers in the district. The\nfollowing are the details:\n\n1. School closed due to lack of teachers.\n2. School closed due to lack of funds.\n3. School closed due to lack of students.\n4. School closed due to lack of facilities.\n5. School closed due to lack of equipment.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any\nother information you need to\ncomplete this report.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa November 11, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant I beg to enclose herewith a copy of the quarterly return of the Salmon River school for the quarter ended September 30th, last. This is a correct copy of the original return as received by the Department which was signed by the teacher and certified correct by yourself, as agent.\n\nI also enclose a copy of the requisition for the teacher's salary for the same quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. MOLAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. R. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent\nSt. Peters,\nC.B.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Sept. 5th, 1912, requesting me to forward you more detailed information than is contained in my monthly report relative to the way in which the Salmon River School District has been carried out since Miss Demarest has had charge of the same. I have gone into the matter very carefully and examined the case thoroughly. I have arrived at certain conclusions more or less definite which I shall now state herein. These may give you an indication of my actual answering.\n\nIn the first place, there has been between the leading Indians on the matter of school funds, considerable difference of opinion. They claim that the children do not own the property under them that they did when they had men. By examination of the old records, I find this was not true. Since 1874, when Lady Macdonald was here, I find that only three chiefs reached the standard. While knowing that the chief letter, however, by far was more than is ever likely done, and the habit has continued as the legislation for the Six Nations from an administration of legislation, the above surely borders.\nSir,\n\nIn the second place, I find that a goodly number of the Indians who attended school say fifteen or fourteen years ago and before that time are able to read and write. Some of them subscribe for the newspapers. I have received letters from them written in fair English. I have heard by word of mouth that they are taught the influence of the last year's teacher. The late teacher was Mr. William Murphy, a bachelor. He was very attentive and clearly instructed. Many of the class Indians continued their attendance to me their successor at the fort in late years, having had teachers whom they liked. Their words are so different from those of the male teachers of years ago.\n\nIn the third place, I find that the Indians show great confidence in the ability of my teachers to stand and exercise discipline. The Captain of the Band who is the spokesman of the band assured me that he found it necessary not to engage a lady teacher that the teaching time and other discipline were not kept but it was all right. You may have anything to do with the teaching for less than you can easily understand that the child very readily learns what its parents' opinion of the teacher is.\nSir,\n\nIt is most impossible to advance the children under the teacher's care in any of the subjects and studies which should be taught in this school. The teacher has been unable to find that there was any sympathy between himself and the children. He has been obliged to be absent from school for a long time due to his own personal affairs. It is not possible to have a good attendance by having only three teachers present at all times.\n\nThe children have been left without proper supervision during the day. The schoolhouse is located at least two miles from the nearest town. I have never advised what quantity was needed, but it is evident that quite a considerable amount was sent to the school. The programme while other things may be said in the opinion of the Superintendent, none of them are neglected.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that among many of the whites who come to the Reserve, Miss Smith's teaching and learning hours are regarded as a joke. Her boarding house is three quarters of a mile from the schoolhouse. She is known to have left her boarding house as late as 9:30 AM, but at the Post Office she had to go back at another\nSir,\n\nanother house which we may call hers on her way to school. In fact she seems so much of her time at home and playing that she finds it very hard from the white habit that the Indian children would not get their grade this year but that new little world. I have tried again and again to make her go to school but she has only been in the last two weeks. I furnished her with some circulars \"Sunday School Regulations\" as soon as they came out last year. She has the school hours to be kept before her in black and white but what does she find? On the 29th October last I wrote the school after 10 AM and the teacher wrote back that she had not seen her since the 28th. Another man received the child at 10 AM. The child was not there. On another occasion after 10 AM she was not in school. No excuse on the 29th let alone that all the clocks in Bursa town were astray. She could not walk. She was in St. Peter's that day when she could have got the true time and surely her watch would not lose one hour in twelve. Many of the white people\nSir,\n\npeople now tell me of the poor house she keeps and how she talks about it. They do not wish their names disclosed as it is nothing to them whether the Court maintains her or not.\n\nIn opening school in September, she could not go back to her boarding house at least I don't why? You do not speak for the truth? This did not hurt it direct from her last year's boarding expenses but she continued to have said that under no circumstances would she have been able to board an account of the trouble she gave in office setting down to present date after P.M.M. She certainly never got back to her former boarding house but looked on time as cleaned out yet a place at all.\n\nDoes she consider this sufficient for just to get up? I desire you assist in making recommendation before me and accordingly make note. Should like to remind you that that Indian School is about eight miles distant from here. Cannot always have money in the school. Whether have a teacher there who\nSir,\n\nWho shows some willingness at least to keep proper school hours that I cannot always force him.\n\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that he would benefit you more than I can in the matter of this child before me.\n\nThe Chief Superintendent is an authority and as such he is authorized to deal with family matters as he sees fit.\n\nI have no doubt that you will understand the importance of this report and that you will take action without delay.\n\nI have received your message today and understand that you have been instructed to send the child back to his home.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 21, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nOn the 26th of August, last, Mr. Gillies of Sidney, N. S., wired the Department forbidding the re-engagement of Miss Devereaux, teacher of the Salmon River School, and recommended the appointment of Mr. Ernest McNeill. Mr. Gillies was then informed that the Department would not be justified in summarily dismissing Miss Devereaux without cause. His letter of the 27th of August confirming his telegram above referred to was even more peremptory and he sent another telegram and letter on the 31st of that month to the same effect.\n\nMr. Agent McDonald was written to on the 5th of September and asked to report fully in regard to the way the Salmon River School had been carried on since Miss Devereaux had charge of it and Mr. Gillies was so informed.\n\nOn the 27th of September Miss Devereaux wrote the Department saying she had heard that her dismissal was being considered. She appealed to the Department's chivalry as \"a female orphan in the infancy of womanhood\" not to dismiss her at such a season as this when vacancies in public schools are all filled. She will be prepared\nto give up the school at the end of the school year, 30th of June, 1913.\n\nMr. Agent McDonald has now sent in his report. He says that the Indians are absolutely opposed to a lady teacher, claiming that their children do not make the progress they did when men taught. The last male teacher employed in this school left in March, 1903. Mr. McDonald, after comparing the old registers, finds that pupils reached a higher standard then than now. The Indians claim that men are better disciplinarians and that the child knows its parent's opinions and is, therefore, more difficult to manage. The Agent says that many of the whites living near the school look upon Miss Devereaux teaching and teaching hours as a joke. He states that she is habitually late for school and he gives day and date for this tardiness on three occasions.\n\nAgent McDonald's report shows that Miss Devereaux has not carried out the Indian Day School Regulations, which require the school to be opened at 9 a.m. and, unless this is considered sufficient cause for her dismissal, I do not see from his report that she has failed to comply with them in other respects. She is not responsible for the backwardness.\nness of her pupils, as she has not been long enough in charge of the school to be blamed for that. She will be leaving of her own accord on the 30th of June, next, and it would be a great hardship to dismiss her in the winter when she could find no other opening. If she is kept on it should be on the distinct understanding that the school hours must be strictly observed and that her services will not be required after the end of the current school year.\n\nThis will give the Department time to secure a competent male teacher.\n\n[Signature]\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA. November 22, 1912.\n\nThe Schools Branch,-\n\nWill you please let me have a memo. with reference to the school teacher at the St. Peters Indian reserve. I understand there are complaints to the effect that she is not performing her duties satisfactorily.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\n\nMr. Pedley,- My memorandum of yesterday's date hereunder deals with this matter. Miss Devereaux is the teacher referred to.

McNeil for the position of teacher of the Salmon River School, I beg to say that the Department would be pleased to have an application from Mr. McNeil, in which he should give full information in respect to the certificates held by him, his experience, if any, in teaching, accompanied by testimonials. The amount of salary to be paid will be dependent upon Mr. McNeil's qualifications and experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Gillies, Esq., K.C.,\nSydney, O.B.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA. December 12, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nPlease have the necessary action taken for the appointment of Ernest W. McNeil, of Barra Head, Richmond county, Nova Scotia, to the position of teacher for the Indian school at Salmon River, to succeed Miss Devereaux, whose services have been dispensed with, remuneration to be the same as was paid Miss Devereaux.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nSt Peters Hill\nDec 17th 1912\n\nErnest L. McKeen Esq.,\nSir,\n\nI am asked me for a certificate of character as well as one of competency insofar as teaching in the Indian School is concerned. So far as first I am happy to state that for the time I have known you\u2014how big genius\u2014without nor any knowledge to my knowledge can say that your character has had other than that of a perfect gentleman.\n\nI might add to this more writing to a third person at this juncture, but I consider the above sufficient.\n\nAs regards competing, I may say that it is experience is a hard school and no man yet has graduated from it having day of our life added to our experience so, if we will, dare it and to our competition. Consequently \"the will is do\" is my way of competing without concern that sufficient education is had. That your education is sufficient for this school no one can doubt, and the fact that by your own efforts alone and unaided you have achieved the education which today you claimed to be sufficient to convince any one who knew you that you have \"the will to do.\" In this account I predict for you success.\n\nI have but very busy schedule will be sometime however shall try to make time to write the Dept myself about you.\n\nIf you may note what use you please of this letter.\n\nSincerely Yours\n\nE. L. Macdonald 1912\nBarra Head, Rich. Co., N.S.\nDec. 26th 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for the position of teacher of the Salmo River Indians School. In 1908 I secured a Grade C pass in the N.S. provincial examinations. I studied a year in the University of St. Francis Xavier in Antigonish, passed the matriculation examinations and entered at the end of the scholastic year into the Sophomore class. This means much higher work than is required for Grade B.\n\nI enclose certificate of character and competency from my Parish Priest, the Rev. P.J. McDonald who is Indian Agent.\n\nMy actual experience in teaching is nil but I consider that the year spent in Antigonish under the very best professors has given me more insight of real teaching than a score of years' experience in a country school would do. My age is 21.\nTrusting that my application will be favourably received,\n\nI remain Yours Truly,\nErnest L. McNeil.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of S. Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your favor (no. \"9707\") of the 3rd inst., in which you state my services as teacher are to be dispensed with at the close of the present quarter, Dec. 31st.\n\nMy motive in replying to this is to expose the baseness on which my discharge is founded viz; the non-observance of the\nopening hour was done away with and that 9 A.M. was the new hour hereafter. To these their actions responded in coming as usual between 10 and 11 A.M. I notified the agent, Rev. R. L. Macdonald, in the matter, and his instructions were: \"Continue the old hours, and if any riot comes, I'll see what can be done.\" Then all following the advice of your official here, I am being dismissed; or rather, let truth speak because in the liberation of my dead father, and to satisfy the understanding that the old Indian Day school Regulations with regards opening school at 9 A.M.\n\nWhen the said rules were given me, I complied with them and continued to do so to the present time, but custom very often reigns supreme, despite rules, not only among Indians but whites as well.\n\nIn the past the opening hour was 9.30 A.M. in summer and 10 A.M. in winter. When the New Rules came into force, I did my duty in trying to have the children understand that the old...\nConservative name of a young man scarcely out of his teens, an orphan, is robbed of her means of livelihood.\n\nYou will respectfully inform me who reported the error which was none of mine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharlotte M. Neerney.\n\nSt. Peters, N.B.\nDec. 9th, 1912\nOttawa, December 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department would like to have you take charge of the Salmon River Indian School, which is now vacant, and would be glad if you could take up your duties there on the 3rd of January, next. Your salary will be at the rate of $350.00 per annum, payable quarterly, and the Indian Agent, Rev. R. L. Macdonald, will give you information respecting the making out of returns, etc.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will find the work interesting and that you will succeed in obtaining a good attendance of the Indian children. In connection with this work it is very necessary that the teacher should get the confidence of the parents, who are in many cases inclined to be careless in the matter of sending their children to school, and it would be well for you to visit them in their homes and thus become personally acquainted with them. It is not considered necessary to give you instructions in regard to the class-room work.\n\nYour school will be inspected by the Public School Inspector and at intervals by the Indian Agent.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nErnest W. McNeill, Esq.,\nBarra Head,\nRichmond Co., N.S.\nOttawa, December 19, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department has offered the position of teacher of the Salmon River School to Mr. Ernest W. McNeill of Barra Head at a salary of $350.00 per annum, payable quarterly.\n\nThe Department would esteem it a favour if you would give Mr. McNeill such instructions as you consider necessary in regard to his duties. Kindly draw his attention to the regulations governing day schools, a copy of which is in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, C.B.\nOttawa, December 24, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to your discharge as teacher of the Salmon River Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the action taken by the Department was based upon a report received from the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Charlotte M. Devereux,\nTeacher,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nOttawa, December 26, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant applying for the position of teacher of the Salmon River Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 19th instant the Department wrote you offering you this position at a salary of $350.00 per annum, your duties to commence on the 3rd of January, next. The Department notes that apparently you have no professional qualifications; nevertheless it is hoped that you will meet with success in the school work, upon which it is trusted that favourable reports will be received in the future, as your retention in the position will depend upon the success with which you meet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nErnest L. McNeill, Esq.,\nBarra Head, N.S.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of last month, allow me to say that I have seen Mr. Smith who told me that his application for the Indian School at your place had been approved. He must have approved the school, as he wrote me to notify you of his acceptance of the offer.\n\nI have just received his name and address, and I shall forward him the necessary forms in his own handwriting. However, his first name was not recognized by the Public School Board. I have written to Mr. Smith to see if he has heard from the Board regarding the acceptance of his application. I shall keep you informed of any developments.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the letter I sent to Mr. Smith, which I believe will be helpful in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\nSir,\n\nThat what I have intimated is not true, and should like to see the steps pursued against any such attempt.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Macdonald\nAgent.\nOttawa, January 4, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has already received a formal application from Mr. McNeil for the position of teacher of the Salmon River School and accepted it.\n\nI may add for your information that it is the practice of the Department to refer to the Public School Inspectors in the various provinces for recommendations for teachers when they are in a position to give the same, but they have no say in the final appointment. I may also add that the Department regrets to learn that Mr. McNeil has no professional qualifications whatever and he has been informed that his retention in the position will be dependent upon the success with which he meets in the school work, which will be inspected by the Public School Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nSir:\n\nI am glad to say that the new teacher is working good. One day at least he had twenty five in attendance without any coaxing of cheese and crackers. If I am able to judge, the Department has made no mistake in engaging him.\n\nRev. R.L. Macdonald.\nAgent.\nCase of Miss Devereux.\n\nThere would not appear to be any national union of teachers to defend the profession; but the case of the dismissal of Miss Charlotte Devereux\u2014referred to in this column yesterday under the heading, \"Woman's Place in Politics\"\u2014is strong evidence in proof of the need of some such organization. Charges are made respecting the competence of the teacher by the Rev. R. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent at St. Peters, and serious reflection is cast upon the ability of women as teachers by the Rev. Father, who offers the opinion of \"the true educationist.\" The charges were made by the Indian agent in a report at the request of the government. No inquiry was held as to the foundation of the charges against Miss Devereux; she was dismissed from her position as teacher at the Salmon River school on the report made by the Indian agent. The statistics of the department show that the attendance during the last four years, under the teaching of women is quite equal to that of any other period in the school's history. The public school inspector for the county sent a protest to the department of Indian Affairs in which he states: \"I have just been informed that the teacher of the Salmon River school, this county, Miss Devereux, has been dismissed by the Indian agent, a man having neither license, experience, nor professional training, whereas the deceased teacher is an experienced and competent Normal School Diploma\u2014a young lady of irreproachable character\u2014in every respect. I believe that this does not count an ordinary fact, therefore, I feel it too much to ask the reason for this change in the management of the school. Because if it is as commonly reported, I would like to say that I am very much afraid to have nothing to do with those schools if they are to be controlled by political influence. The schools in this county are not managed on those principles.\"\n\nOther documents, including statutory declarations, and the annual report of the department of Indian Affairs, were produced in defense of Miss Devereux; but as the Rev. Father, Indian Agent, might say, in his opinion of the true educationist, \"she held no warrant,\" where departmental judgment was concerned. Mr. Scott, the Superintendent of Indian Education, states in his report of the Salmon River school:\n\n\"Miss O'Toole, who conducted this school successfully for a number of years, has been dismissed this past year and Miss Devereux was appointed as her successor. Miss Devereux has the normal school second class certificate and is meeting with success in her work. She also teaches sewing to the girls.\"\n\nThe former teacher deposited a statutory declaration in defense and support of Miss Devereux; also a very important report by Mr. A. J. Boyd, the Superintendent of Indian Agencies for the Maritime Provinces, included along with the report of Mr. Scott, in the annual report of the department of Indian Affairs. After referring to the fact that employment in most of the occupations in this country today is more remunerative than teaching, and drawing the inference that the department will soon be unable to advance its \"minimum wage\" for teachers if it wishes to continue in its employ those worth retaining or to engage others whose services are worth having, Mr. Boyd states:\n\n\"Experience forces me to the conclusion that females succeed better than males as Indian teachers. At any rate there can be no doubt that the schools at Truro, Sydney, Bear River, and the school at Glasgow, which have always been conducted by women, and by ladies are distinctly ahead in the matter of education, of those that have always been conducted by men and the most backward of the Indian schools are those conducted by means of a male teacher. The standing of the best school in the Maritime schools taught by Mrs. Annie McNeil and Miss Charlotte M. Devereux represents the highest degree of the best school taught by a male teacher; so that there seems to be very much in favor of the ladies as teachers. The preponderance in that respect has impressed me from the beginning of my experience with Indian education. There is still filling vacancies that will be done away from time to time on the department's staff of teachers in Nova Scotia, and I urge the selection of ladies who possess the necessary qualifications.\n\nThe statutory declarations of two women teachers regarding the faithful carrying out of instructions, the departmental records regarding attendance, and the report of the deputy minister of the department that the department has no intention of dispensing with your services as teacher of the Salmon River Indian school so long as you are satisfactory,\" is the protest of the Inspector of Schools for the county, the testimony of the Superintendent of Indian Education, and the high commendation of the Superintendent of Indian Agencies for the Maritime Provinces are all selected in favor of a report full of village gossip by a clerical gentleman\u2014and without inquiry into the report\u2014by the government. A qualified woman teacher with a normal school diploma has been discharged, and an inexperienced person possessing neither license nor professional training has been appointed to the position. It is a matter of grave affecting the teaching profession. It also reveals the existence and curse of political patronage.\nThe Cost of Living\u2014Report by Labour Department.\n\nPilotage Commission\u2014Report presented.\n\nOntario Superior Courts Bill\u2014Discussed and Passed.\n\nThe Duty on Ditching Machinery\u2014Discussion.\n\nThe Fenian Raid Bounty\u2014Discussion\u2014Statement by the Minister of Militia.\n\nDismissal of Charlotte Devereaux, Indian School Teacher.\n\nCommittee of Supply.\n\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\n\nFriday, March 28, 1913.\n\nThe SPEAKER took the Chair at three o'clock.\n\nTHE COST OF LIVING\u2014REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR.\n\nHon. T. W. CROTHERS (Minister of Labour): Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are called, I would like to table a special report just issued by my department, which seems to be particularly opportune at the present time. Its subject is the important one of the rise in the cost of living, in which everyone is interested and naturally so in view of recent developments. This is not the first report on the subject to be published by the department. A report issued in 1910 gave a review of the course of prices in Canada from 1890 up to the previous year. Since then annual reports have been issued bringing the statistics up to date, the first covering the year 1910, and the second the year 1911. The present report covers the year 1912. I think I may say that it is a much better document than any of its predecessors. During the past year I have very materially strengthened the statistical branch of my department, which is in charge of Mr. Coates; and the result has been a marked increase in the efficiency of its work, as will be seen by comparing the report with its predecessors.\n\nIt is a comprehensive field, I may add, that it is only the precursor of a considerable increase in statistics which the department is mapped out.\n\nThe report gives a detailed review of the movement of wages, salaries, and retail prices in Canada during the past year. Altogether, nearly three hundred articles, selected on account of their representative character, have been covered. The movement as a whole has been analyzed from various points of view. For each article a considerable mass of information has been assembled, covering such points as production, demand, trade conditions, &c., &c., and indicating the actual prices and the causes of the recent advance. Grains, live stock, meats, dairy products, fish, groceries, textiles, leather, lumber, fuel, house-furnishings, and chemicals are only some of the classes of articles discussed. The retail prices given in the report are collected from every locality in Canada having over 10,000 inhabitants. There is an appendix to the report which treats of a similar movement in Great Britain, the United States and Australasia, and another appendix in which statistics and other matters indicative of the general condition on prices have been brought together.\n\nI might say that the general result of the inquiry shows that prices went up by probably over six per cent. in 1912.\n\nFor the first six months the advance was due chiefly to short world supply of food-stuffs on the back of which came a severe winter. There was a recession from this in the summer due to the crop prospects that proved fair, but in the autumn the rise set in again, being due this time to increases in materials rather than foods, and being indicative of the widespread prosperity of industry which prevailed not only in this country but in Great Britain and the United States.\n\nHon. members may have noticed in the press recently that the question of the cost of living has been actively debated in the Ontario legislature, and that the opinion was expressed that the subject was one that could be more effectively handled by the Federal Government. My own personal view is that the problem is one that is world-wide in its extent, and that what is really required is an investi-\nMr. DOHERTY: I have to confess that I am not from the action of the Attorney General and the government of Ontario that there were cases which made such legislation necessary, and I may say that a case has been heard by the Court of Appeal under the law conferring jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal of Ontario.\n\nSir WILFRID LAURIER: The explanation is not very satisfactory. I shall not press the point, because, if we err we can correct it. But I think my hon. friend will agree that it is not satisfactory to go into it without information, as we appear to be doing in this case.\n\nMr. DOHERTY: I do not know that any doubt arises in view of the position of the Attorney General and the judges of Ontario. I admit that it would have been more satisfactory to have verified the facts.\n\nOn section 3\u2014commencement of Act:\n\nSir WILFRID LAURIER: I see you are making the Act effective. Is that necessary?\n\nMr. DOHERTY: That is necessitated by the fact that one case has been actually taken and argued before the Appellate Division.\n\nMr. GUTHRIE: I have not followed this Bill very closely. I understand that quite recently the point was raised at Osgoode Hall in the argument of a case under the Divorce Act that the new division of the Appellate Court had no jurisdiction. It is the interpretation of the statute that affects the rights of litigants in litigation. If the court has not the proper authority I think that litigants should have the benefit of the law they have already taken. Would it be right of this Parliament to pass a clause that is retrospective in its effect to affect decisions of the law affecting a particular case now pending?\n\nMr. DOHERTY: Unless it would be considered desirable to attach to the mere change of the name of the court a deprivation of the right to appeal, I do not see that anything would be gained by the concession. Because of the fact, that any doubt whether the giving of a new name to the court, or the section conferring jurisdiction of that court, should be removed. I do not see that anyone would have any advantage from the change. It should be considered that this legislation modifies the position of any litigant. I have doubt that the court, as far as the juris-\nof costs is concerned, would feel perfectly free to deal with that matter equitably. But, if it should be considered in the change of name, that would result in the court under its new name of jurisdiction, the result would be that unless we do this, and give the Court of Appeal in Ontario the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal in Ontario, he would destroy all the right which has been given to the courts in the designation of the court. As I have said, the judges of the courts in Ontario have shown it conclusively that any question should be removed by legislation.\n\nMr. GUTHRIE: Under the legislation of this House tribunals have been prescribed in which certain proceedings may be had as the courts of admiralty, the courts of the Dominion Winding Up Act. It is prescribed under the legislation of this House that the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In Ontario, the Court of Appeal, as formerly constituted, has been abolished, and instead a new tribunal has been established under the jurisdiction of the courts of the province of Ontario. By the Act constituting this authority, it is provided that all matters which heretofore were dealt with by the Court of Appeal shall now be determined by the new appellate court. The Court of Appeal was reconstituted by the recent legislation in Ontario. I do not know that there is any question raised by the legislation; it changes the whole of the original intention of this House when it created the jurisdiction and the nature of the appellate division of the Superior Court in the province of Ontario. However, it is evident that complaints have been raised in the province of Ontario regarding the jurisdiction of the new courts to hear appeals in cases provided for by Dominion legislation. I do not think it will be necessary for me to go into the question on that question by the introduction in this Bill of a retrospective clause. That clause should be thought to take effect in the ordinary course, from and after the date of the passing of this Bill, so that clause had been inserted simply to overcome some difficulty which has been brought to my attention by the Government by the Attorney General of the province, or perhaps some other person connected with Toronto. There has been a good deal of criticism in Ontario by the bench and by the bar against the legislation concerning the Ontario courts, as has been done during the past year. It follows that notwithstanding, I do not think, in the absence of more information than we now have, that it would be desirable to insert a retrospective clause and validate something which is wrong, if there be anything wrong. If the Minister of Justice were good enough to tell us the precise reason for inserting such a clause in this Bill, and the Act, we would be in a better position to deal with the matter, but, to use a commonplace expression, there must be a nigger on the fence somewhere, and as such unusual clauses are considered to constitute very unreasonable legislation, the minister ought to have a plain statement, before the clause passes in Committee, as to why it was inserted in the Bill.\n\nMr. DOHERTY: As I understand it, the reason why that clause has been inserted is that it quite affects the law in Ontario within which the change in the designation of the Court of Appeal in Ontario became effective, all parties concerned in the appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario have not been left with no tribunal to which that appeal could be directed, whereas they have been deprived of their rights to appeal. Our legislation as it stands clearly provides that the Court of Appeal to which it refers, the Court of Appeal of Ontario, shall be given jurisdiction near the time of January until the day following the name of the Court of Appeal of Ontario has been changed, it is true, and the court has been differently organized, and the court referred to that court is the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and therefore, it is a court contemplated by our legislation. It would seem to me to be a greater evil to concede that a tribunal which has been constituted by the Ontario legislature\u2014namely the deprivation of parties of the right of appeal during that period of time, and while I do not desire to make a little legal argument, I think that the provincial authorities have probably made a substantial objection, and now urging this Government to let them out of the error into which they have fallen. Perhaps it is a question which might be induced by the insertion of this clause, and while I have no great objection to the Bill in its form, this particular clause can be taken to this particular section.\n\nMr. DOHERTY: I think the greatest justification for the retrospective clause would be to allow the legislation of Ontario\u2014which certainly is not intended to produce this result\u2014to operate in the same substantial rights which our laws gave them during that period of time. The result then would be that the courts of appeal which Ontario furnishes are not deprived of their jurisdiction by legislation provided for an appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and the purpose of the clause is to prevent that party being deprived of their right in regard.\n\nMr. CARVELL: I presume that this legislation has been based upon representations made to the minister of the Crown body. The hon. member for South Wellington says that the only justification for the legislation is that the matter was raised in court by some litigant. I can understand quite distinctly that the minister of Justice is to make perfectly clear the right of parties to whom friend will remain hereafter. Naturally, when such legislation is proposed, men ask why it is necessary, whether there is any private interest involved or the machinery of Parliament would not be in motion to pass such legislation. The question we have to decide is: Is it fair and proper to all parties concerned that this legislation should be passed? The Minister of Justice argues that it is necessary, and if we are to accept his argument, probably every member of the House would agree that had this matter come up in December, we would all have agreed that this legislation did not become effective until the 1st of January. Evidently since the question of this objection has been taken in the court and my friend the minister, who was a prominent barrister at the time, says that the barrister does not like to have an important point taken away from him by the legislature without experience; but I think if I felt that I could win a case and if I saw the legislature legislating in this case, I would consider it an unwarrantable interference with my affairs. That point should be looked into carefully. Personally I doubt if it would make much difference. I believe that the courts would hold the parties to the right to apply to whatever might be the proper appellate court. It seems to me that the only thing that might be done is to change the name of a court would take away the right of appeal. When the legislature Act was introduced in Parliament two or three years ago a great many of these technical appeals and objections were handled in a very easy and simple difficulty whatever in brushing them all aside. One of the difficulties which came up after the Appeal Court came in was an application made by a very prominent barrister to a court of a matter which was interested on the ground that I had improperly designated the court, but the court did not see fit to say that it could not see me to answer the argument; they simply brushed it off and said they would not stand on such trivialities as that. I am of opinion that that would be the case here also. I do not think it would be necessary legislation to pass a retrospective clause to a Bill which even now must be imposed by some public or private interest. You may say that it works out to the public good in the end; but there is no doubt that we are dealing with a man who is out of a difficulty in which he finds himself, and if we do decide to pass this away from another barrister or solicitor a right to which he thinks he is entitled. Therefore, I think that the House should consider carefully before asking Parliament to pass retrospective legislation such as this.\n\nMr. PARDEE: I was thinking of the courts rather than the barristers.\n\nMr. PARDEE: It appears to me that the whole trouble might be overcome by providing in the Act of incorporation of the Bill a retroactive saving clause providing that nothing herein shall affect pending litigation or any litigation which may arise the whole ground. This is ex post facto legislation and consequently something that neither the House or anyone else cares ba-\nMr. DOHERTY. The only purpose is to prevent their being an interregnum during which no right of appeal would exist and we introduced this clause so as to ask that it would be passed to produce the result that there would not be an interregnum and therefore all pending cases.\n\nMr. PARDEE. I suppose such a technical question has been raised. It is raised by this to take away from whoever may raise that question his right to raise it or to stand on it by passing such legislation as this?\n\nMr. DOHERTY. I think it is right to prevent anyone who has a right to interpretation of a law which law was never intended to give him any such right and I think that the substantial right of appeal is to be given to every person who has a right of a person to invoke that unintended consequence to relieve him of his action and that intended it should be susceptible of appeal.\n\nMr. PARDEE. There has hardly ever been a statute passed on which different interpretations have not been placed. Surely you cannot make a law in which the interpretation is as in this bill but that would enact such a clause as I suggest. If you put such a clause as I suggest it is a matter of construction and it should be left to the court.\n\nMr. DOHERTY. We want to give them their rights as they were prior to the 1st of January.\n\nMr. CARVELL. I have always felt that too many appeals are proceeded for Canada, I do not think we will do much harm to litigants and perhaps not much harm to solicitors because if we take away a lot of the rights of appeal which are given not to litigants but to solicitors and counsel, then we shall have a better system and if we curtail to some extent the possible right of appeal by refusing to pass this retrospective legislation.\n\nMr. GUTHRIE. Let us understand the effect of this thing. I have no objection to clauses 1 and 2 of the bill. I think they are very proper. Such a provision is made in the Revised Statutes of Canada which provides for an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that it is now comes of some consequence to consider what the Court of Appeal for Ontario was last it was a judicial entity which we all recognized. It was abolished, as a matter of fact, by the legislation which is to-day no court of appeal for Ontario.\n\nMr. PARDEE.\n\nconsequently in all Dominion Acts where the expression \"appeal to the Court of Appeal\" before which appeals ought to be taken has gone out of existence. Now, a new arrangement has been made under legislation of the province of Ontario where new appellate courts have been constituted. The names have been changed. \"Court of Appeal of Ontario\" to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. This is not a new court. It is with objections to clauses 1 and 2, giving to the Appellate Division the jurisdiction formerly possessed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which has gone out of existence. But I know that within the past three weeks a case was heard on two important directions, and during the argument of the appeal, a very able counsel in the province, Mr. McKenzie, who had been appointed an now constituted, had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The judges, however, who constitute that Appellate Division, should have decided that point I believe that if they had jurisdiction it would have been that they would have jurisdiction, or it may be that they would have decided that they did not have jurisdiction and they did not come to a decision on the point. But it is more than that. It is more than that, it is well defined knowledge on the part of the Bar in the province of Ontario that on the part of the people that the present rearrangement of judges throughout the province is extremely unacceptable. It is supposed that it is not a very great improvement on the former system. It is supposed that it is due to such a scheme was evolved in the first instance as to its objects. A good many questions have been offered as to what, certain it is, that some correspondence has been published within the last five or six weeks, which lead me to believe that we have more judges in the High Court in the province of Ontario than we have for performing that duty. What it was that in the face of the opinion of the judges themselves that the matters which were demanded by the Ontario legislature and appointed by this Government, I cannot agree with him at all.\n\nMr. McKenzie. I am sure the Minister of Justice is not going to defend me. It is perhaps a little regrettable that he should be so unwilling to defend me in any way he has been transferring them to-day. There is no question but that when jurisdiction was conferred by this Parliament, all matters were referred to that jurisdiction, and when there was a change of name, if the act creating that court had shown that it continued to have the old jurisdiction over every matter with which up to that time it had had to deal, no judge in Ontario would say that that jurisdiction did not exist. So I am entitled to any sympathy from the hon. Minister of Justice when I make that statement.\n\nMr. DOHERTY. I did not understand that I had expressed any sympathy for my hon. friend.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier. The contention that has been made from the bench (Mr. McKenzie) is certainly, in my humble judgment at all events, a proper one. We have an entirely new court of the province of Ontario; the other courts are under provincial jurisdiction. I think that if a provincial court changes by an interpretation of laws, and that court afterwards changes the interpretation of laws, we have a new court. We are proceeding to a deficiency in the Ontario Act. But the one practical point in this matter is the point raised by my hon. friend from South Wellington (Mr. Guthrie). The Act is made retroactive. I understand from his statement that the proceedings at the present time in which the very question is raised whether or not the court as constituted now has jurisdiction, certainly in view of the circumstances, is my hon. friend the Minister of Justice prepared to override the provisions of the Act and will give satisfaction from the first of January, when the point is at issue in the courts now.\n\nMr. DOHERTY. There may be two opinions as to whether this legislation is desirable, but its purpose is to make it clear that from the first of January, when this court has been created, I understand that one of the reasons why this legislation was necessary was to prevent the pending reserved capital case, and argument has been heard before the appellate division of the province of Ontario. I understand that the hon. member for Wellington (Mr. Guthrie) said that there is pending a case in the appellate division of the province of Ontario. I understand that the question has been raised as to whether jurisdiction existed or not. This may be the reason why the hon. member declined personally. I am speaking offhand, without examination of the question, to say that the question that arises by the change of name did not modify the jurisdiction. But the question which this House has to deal with is, is it more important to make sure that a man who had a substantial right of appeal in this Parliament, and deprived of that right by an intended effect of the legislation by accident, is placed in a position where he cannot go to go before the Court of Appeal? In my humble judgment the first evil is the greatest and most serious that can result while, no doubt it is not desirable to enact retroactive legislation, except where a substantial right has been deprived. I submit to this House that this is a case where there is a substantial evil to be remedied and if it could be held that the change in designation and the division of courts in the province of Quebec and Ontario has constituted an entirely new court, the legislation is unnecessary, but that if it has not been decided, our legislation is unnecessary. But when we are dealing with a case where the judgment that will be rendered will be final and the man who had given to him by this Parliament the opportunity to appeal will have suffered the injustice of having had it finally determined that the legislation that the contemplated effect of the legislation of the province of Ontario has been to deprive him of his right of appeal. There\nappeal case. Do hon. gentlemen contend that it is desirable to remove any doubt as to the jurisdiction which a man who has been sentenced, or is liable to be sentenced to punishment, may appeal from at all? If it should be held that this appellate division of the Supreme Court of Ontario had no jurisdiction in such cases, there would be an appeal and there would be no court which had jurisdiction. This is a pretty serious matter from that point of view. I presume that as it happens to be an existing case, but I do not think that there is any doubt as to whether a man has lost the substantial right of appeal, I think that is pretty clear. But I think that the question is justified. As regards the power of the courts of Ontario to make provision so that all jurisdiction which the court of appeal previously had, including the jurisdiction which it had under the former law, passed to the new court, I had no intention in expressing myself in that connection with my hon. friend from Cape Breton North (Mr. McKenzie), to do it by any disparagement of his views. I am willing to give the right hon. the leader of the Opposition as much credit as he deserves in respect which I have for his opinion. I still adhere to my view that the jurisdiction which was conferred upon the Parliament only could be transferred by this Parliament. If it had been otherwise, legislation it would not be because the legislation of Ontario gave it in the creation of the courts, but it would be because of the fact that the legislation of Ontario chose to designate it under a new name, the courts which suppose Ontario made, and that legislation would not deprive that court of jurisdiction which was originally conferred upon it. But to my mind, if legislation is necessary to confer any jurisdiction upon the original courts, this amendment upon the newly designated court, then this amendment must be made. Even conceding that there should be some doubt upon the question, I confess that the proposal made by my hon. friend ought to be removed and the purpose of this legislation ought to be to remove any doubt as to whether the law would not in any event be altered by the newly designated court. But after all, if it is true that the result of this legislation will be what we say our saying anything, I think it is pretty safe to say that things that will come about a little better and, at all events just as well, if you do say something. The whole purpose of this legislation is to remove any doubt on the question.\n\nMr. CUTHRIE: I am going to test the thing by a question.\n\nThat section 3 be amended by striking therefrom the words \"and that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to litigation now pending except for proceedings under the Criminal Code Act, 1902, and amendments.\"\n\nMr. DOHERTY: We will let it apply to the criminal cases.\n\nMr. GRAHAM: Perhaps I may be allowed to introduce into this debate a few words which I will call things by their real names with less delicacy than Mr. Cuthrie. First, there is the question, the change of which I am aware; second, it prevents the court under its new name from having jurisdiction, then on the first day of January the court was deprived of their rights. The purpose of this Bill is to remove any doubt as to whether this legislation was intended to prevent people, to whom this Parliament has given rights, from the exercise of privileges which are intended consequence of an Act passed by the Ontario legislature.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: My hon. friend from South Renfrew (Mr. Graham) has expressed his conception of the motives for passing the present legislation which has given rise to this Bill.\n\nMr. GRAHAM: I said this was the result; I did not say anything about motives.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: The result is that we ought to remove any doubt as to whether this legislation was intended to prevent people, to whom this Parliament has given rights, from the exercise of privileges which are intended consequence of an Act passed by the Ontario legislature.\n\nMr. DOHERTY: I have been requested by the Ontario Government to enact this legislation. The Ontario Government gives reason sufficient for the same. I have given myself, that in its judgment and in the judgment of the Ontario Government, it is desirable to remove any doubt as to whether the legislation changing the designation of the courts of Ontario has deprived of jurisdiction which it formerly had. I would thoroughly agree with what was said by my hon. friend from South Renfrew (Mr. Graham), if this was a question of retrospective legislation which was intended to deprive people of their rights. This, however, is legislation intended simply to prevent people from being deprived of their rights, which unquestionably they had on the 31st of December, the Ontario Government, bringing this law into effect. If the bringing into effect of this law in Ontario prevented the court under its new name from having jurisdiction, then on the first day of January the court was deprived of their rights. The purpose of this Bill is to remove any doubt as to whether this legislation was intended to prevent people, to whom this Parliament has given rights, from the exercise of privileges which are intended consequence of an Act passed by the Ontario legislature.\n\nMr. BORDEN: If my hon. friend who moved this amendment had given a little consideration to the principles which govern the interpretation of retrospective construction of the statute, he would hardly have thought of introducing into the amendment. There is a very clear distinction which I think is known to most people that when a statute is construed retrospectively with regard to the rights of parties, they are construed as\napplying to the pending actions if they relate only to the practice and procedure of the courts. I am not at all sure that this clause which Mr. Minister of Justice has inserted in this Bill is necessary, but whether it be necessary or not, it is carrying out a principle which ought to be adopted in such cases. A statement made by the late Member for St. John Wellington is in direct abrogation of the principles which Mr. Justice Borden, as he was a judge, used to put forward. It is a principle which I think I have heard ever since I was a student, and I believe it is a principle which is necessary. I would quote the last edition of Maxwell on \"The Interpretation of the Statute Law,\" and I would quote the authorities on this subject in which this is laid down.\n\nIn view of the above cases, however, the construction, though fatal to the enforcement of a vested right, does not necessarily prevent the courts from taking away any such right; and therefore it seems to me that the general principle that the presumption against a retrospective construction should apply to the interpretation of the law only the procedure and practice of the courts, makes it advantageous to one of the parties making the application for the purpose of dealing with the question of whether that which, at the time when it was done, was a vested right, is still a vested right under the principle; a law which merely alters the procedure may be applied prospectively, be made applicable to past as well as future transactions; and no secondary meaning is to be given to the word \"vested\" so that if a person has a vested right in any course of proceedings, the court will not be able to defend or defend in the manner prescribed for the purposes of the proceedings in which he sued; and if an Act of Parliament alters the law, then the court will be obliged to proceed accordingly to the altered new law.\n\nSo, if this provision were not in the statute, then from the time the statute is passed, there is no protection for the courts according to the law as it has been altered. Therefore the provision which my hon. friend Mr. Borden introduced by his amendment would interfere absolutely with the principle of the law.\n\nMr. GUTHRIE: My right hon. friend says that this clause will interfere with the law. What the Minister of Justice is doing is to make it applicable to litigation from the date the new law was passed in the Ontario courts. He is not extending the retrospective effect of the new principle to an earlier date, because these cases now pending in the courts of Ontario would be affected by the revision of this enactment from the very day it received the assent of Parliament and of the Crown. So, there is no violation of any principle. Further than that, it seems to me purely a formal matter. The legislature of Ontario, acting absolutely within its jurisdiction, has the power under the constitution of its courts and to give certain courts a new designation. It is necessary to prevent confusion, and in order that parties may not lose their right of appeal, which we do not want them to lose, to reform the statutes of Ontario. If this had not been a federation, if there had only been one legislature, then this would not be a matter, it would be dealt with in one Act. But, notwithstanding the division of powers over criminal matters and Ontario jurisdictions over certain matters of procedure, it is thought that the legislature of each government of Parliament as well as of legislation. I cannot see that any objection could be raised to the legislature adopting this statute at the date at which the constitution of the courts in Ontario was altered and at which the titles were determined by which these courts are known to the law are known to the world. If this statute did not in the slightest way affect the rights of any suitors, those courts but was merely for convenience in calling them by the law.\n\nMr. GUTHRIE: If I understand, my right hon. friend's argument is that it is merely in the nature of a change of procedure, and therefore it would be treated as a matter of course, retroactively and prospectively, it would be made applicable to the practice of the courts, even if clauses 3 were not in the present Act. That being so, there can be no necessity for clause 3.\n\nMr. BORDEN: There can be no harm in it.\n\nMr. GUTHRIE: It validates that to which exception has been taken in the pending litigation. This is the principle which I think the hon. member for St. John does not altogether agree with my right hon. friend in his interpretation of the matter; but I think that the hon. member for St. John suggests to him that, on the strength of his own opinion, which is a strong, boldly well-put forward opinion, he should cut clauses 1 and allow clauses 1 and 2 to go into operation. It is right all the difficulty is overcome.\n\nAmendment negatived.\n\nBill reported, read the third time and passed.\n\nDUTY ON DITCHING MACHINERY.\n\nOn motion of Hon. W. T. White (Minister of Finance), for Committee of Supply.\n\nMr. A. B. McCOIG (West Kent): Before you leave the Chair, Mr. Speaker, I have a matter of considerable importance to consider, and to the people of the province of Ontario generally to refer to. It has been brought to my attention by the House by the resolution I placed on the Order Paper some time ago. I refer to the duties of tile drainage machinery. I would like to occupy the attention of the House for a few moments, in an endeavor to explain why it behooves Government should relieve the people of this unnecessary charge.\n\nMr. SPEAKER: I would remind the hon. member that there is a notice on the Order Paper in connection with this matter, and it is not the proper place for him to take up and discuss it, as he has been participating a notice on the Order Paper.\n\nSir WILFRID LAURIER: There is no notice on the Order Paper today.\n\nMr. SPEAKER: The attention was drawn to this matter, and I find that a notice was on the Order Paper yesterday. This brings up another matter, which, it seems to me, is a question of much importance, that is, with regard to the right to drop notices from the Order Paper. I have been called in the House. If I understand it correctly, where a notice is put on the paper, it is only when the consent of the House, or, after it is called, on the request of the hon. members who have put it there to have it dropped, which requires the consent of the House. I do not know whether there is a rule on the Order Paper with regard to this matter, but it seems to me it would be in violation of the rules to discontinue a notice thereafter put into Committee of Supply. The rule with regard to the matter is very plainly set out by the rules.\n\nThe rule which requires a strict adherence to the Order Paper is absolutely necessary to prevent confusion. It is a rule enforced in the Imperial Parliament that even when a notice is put on the Order Paper, it has been named by mistake, and no one has objected to the appointment of an earlier day, the order of business, and perhaps it is quite irregular, even if a member proposes to continue the debate. It is a gross attempt to debate a subject which stands on the Order Paper.\n\nMr. NESBITT: The notice on the Order Paper was not withdrawn.\n\nMr. SPEAKER: No, because we did not reach the notice by motion yesterday, and consequently it could not be dropped after having been called. It seems to me that the only way in which the matter could be dealt with would be with the consent of the House.\n\nMr. BORDEN: If it is to be as short a discussion as possible, and from the other side of the House it will be I shall suggest that the consent of the House be given to the hon. gentleman to discuss the matter.\n\nThe consent of the House having been granted:\n\nMr. McCOIG: Owing to the fact that prior to members day was withdrawn by the government before we reached this motion, it was impossible for me to bring it to the attention of the House yesterday, and I am glad to have at the present time the consent of the House to direct the attention of the Government to the existence of granting the request which I am about to make. The resolution placed on the Order Paper on December the 16th last by myself was as follows:\n\nThat whereas tile drainage machinery is extensively used throughout Canada and more particularly in Ontario by the farmers of the southwestern portion of the province, and whereas the same is not manufactured in Canada, but is imported from the United States in spite of a heavy duty and whereas on account of the scarcity of laborers and the consequent shortage of rural communities to dispense with the use of tile drainage, it becomes a matter of supreme necessity for the proper tile drainage of land in connection with successful farming.\n\nWhereas tile drainage, therefore, it is the duty of this Parliament to put the said resolution into effect, and that it be done at least as it is manufactured in Canada.\n\nThe traction ditches, in respect of which I am speaking, are the ones 27 per cent. be removed, are not manufactured in Canada, and all implements which are manufactured in Canada are subject to a duty of 174 per cent. It really seems to me that it is a matter of this implement, which is so badly needed for the tillage of tenants and for the purposes of tile drainage, should be freed from this unnecessary tariff, in view of the fact that it is manufactured in Canada.\n\nMr. BLAIN: Does my hon. friend intend to move a motion in regard to this matter?\n\nMr. McCOIG: No, it is not my intention to conclude with a motion, but I desire to have a friendly discussion in regard to the matter. I believe my friends will have the hearty endorsement of members on both sides of the House, and I am sure it will consequently be dropped after having been called. It seems to me that the only way in which the matter could be dealt with would be with the consent of the House.\nattention of the Government. That is one of the reasons why I do not propose at the present time to divide the House on this question, as I think it is a matter which should be dealt with in a more logical manner in another way, and I believe that, before this discussion is closed all hon. gentlemen interested in this important matter will join with me in trying to influence the Government to grant this exemption. Not only have I received letters from scores of prominent farmers, but I have also received resolutions which were presented to the members of the Corn Growers' Association in the city of the West End. These resolutions came from representatives from the counties of Essex and Kent. These resolutions heartily endorsed the sentiment in addition to which there was a resolution presented by the County Council of the county of Essex, which warned us two resolutions to the hon. Minister of Finance, so that he can see how important this matter is to the southwestern part of Ontario. Almost every municipal council in the western part of the province, as far as the eye can see, have received copies of other resolutions, and I am sure that the members of the farmers, I am not in a position to present them to the hon. Minister of Finance. During the Fall session, in the city of the capital city of Ottawa, Mr. W. H. Marcell, a prominent farmer in the township of Essex, who was very anxious to have his farm tile-drained, and who had purchased tile drainage equipment last fall, went to the last fall to obtain the necessary help to do the tile draining, and he assured me that, although he had paid $250 for help to do the work, he was unable to do so. He had to purchase equipment for himself, and the cost of the equipment was $250, and the duty paid thereon amounted to $500 or $600. Here we have a situation where the hardships under which this gentleman laboured, carrying his own tile to have his farm tile-drained. This is only one instance of many which I desire to utilize in order to impress upon the Government the importance of having this duty removed. I have been assured by many men who have been engaged in securing these traction ditchers that if the tax is removed, they will be able to purchase the equipment, and then proceed with the work badly needed in different sections of Ontario. No, not only do I desire to have this duty removed, but I notice that the agricultural press are advocating this measure. Shortly after the petition appeared on the order paper the Farmers' Advocate published the following article, dated January 19, 1913:\n\nThe movement for the removal of the duty on tile drainage equipment in Canada, is steadily gaining support, as readers of \"The Farmer's Advocate\" are aware. It is satisfactory to note that the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, which formerly took the attitude of simply 'not opposing' the movement, has now decided to 'recommend the removal of the duty'. During the past several months, a number of prominent farmers have written to me expressing their views on the subject.\n\nThey have found it impossible to manufacture in Canada and they have decided to join with the farmers in asking for the removal of the duty.\n\nThe fact was brought out the significance of which should be carefully borne in mind in connection with the working of our local farms. The farmers who make their own Canadian manufacturer or capitalist with whom they deal, are not only purchasing the probable results, determined the price by bidding against the duty (27\u00bd per cent) to the Canadian Stone Company, but they would have no competition. Under these conditions it appears that establishing a factory here would mean the loss of the machines to any appreciable extent.\n\nMr. BURNHAM: Do you not think that if, as you assert, you could build drainage equipment here, you could be able to possibly build these ditching machines?\n\nMr. McCOIG: I said that I hoped this matter would be dealt with in a non-partisan way, and I shall do my best to help the House. The question is of great importance to the people whom I represent and I am afraid that, Mr. Chairman, gentleman, you may not realize but drainage work in his mind will have to wait until the importance of the matter becomes known to the hardworking farmers of Canada or elsewhere comes up for consideration. The article goes on:\n\nIt is further pointed out that the number of Canadians who might be employed in the manufacture of tile drainage equipment is larger than the number of men who would be employed in producing the increased number of acres of land drained. It is also stated that the cost of drainage equipment is lower than what would be required. Persons in all sections of the country who are engaged in this all-important work of drainage would benefit by the removal of this duty.\n\nMr. J. A. Fletcher, of the county of Kent, is quoted as follows:\n\nThe soil of the county (Tilbury East Township) is on a fair road to improvement. Farmers are beginning to realize the need of drainage, and the number of farms being drained is increasing. In the year 1910, I completed harvesting one 18-acre field of corn, which gave me the handsome return of over $500.\n\nI know that the Minister of Agriculture will be glad to know that on the Tilbury East Grand Farm, near Tilbury, Essex, gives an experience which I think will be of interest to the members for North Essex.\n\nPart of my seed-corn plot this year was in drainage, while the rest was not. The results were as follows: Stalks, per acre, 1,500 lbs. on drained and 1,400 lbs. on undrained; Shelled corn, per acre, 82 bushels on drained, 297 bushels on undrained. In my general corn crop I had the following results: Stalks, per acre, on drained, 2,270 lbs., on undrained 1,420 lbs.; Shelled corn, per acre, 1,600 bushels on drained and 1,850 bushels on undrained.\n\nSo the House will see the advantages that are offered to the farmers who take the initiative. There is no question that it is extremely important that every possible encouragement be given to the farmers to encourage them in this important work. An article appeared in the Farmers Advocate, August 8, 1912, which shows the importance of this work. This article appeared on August 8, 1912, in the Farmers Advocate.\n\nCareful and long-continued work done by the drainage authorities at the Great Agri-cultural Exhibition has demonstrated that taking into consideration both wet and ordinary farming, the average increase in average crop increase valued at a trifle over $20 per acre, or about $400,000 annually for each acre of land in what is known as \"Old Ontario,\" urgently needing drainage, and probably covering 3,000,000 acres of swamp or waste land, of which at least 5,000,000 acres might be reclaimed. Such an expenditure of which, added to the increases from lands already under cultivation, would give an annual total increase of $100,000,000 per year. Such an investment would solve the problem of the cost of living problem and materially benefit all classes of people. The reclaiming of swamp or swamp land would also prove of greater benefit from a sanitary standpoint, removing many sources of disease, filth, and other such as those of a tubercular nature. What is true of Old Ontario is probably to some extent true of the other provinces of Canada, and certainly of the United States.\n\nSo you see that this is not entirely a provincial matter. It is extending from one province to another, and the arguments of the farmers and the agrarian interests of this country, that once the importance of tile draining, they will all...\nthe appalling scarcity of labour, are unable to get their crops in. In many parts of the country, valuable land is reverting to pasture, and but little is realized from some of the best farms. The situation is probably the most favourable situated in the world.\n\nThe same causes are promoting prosperity everywhere, and everywhere weeds are gaining ground for the same reason. Time was when in every locality there was plenty of cheap, unskilled, untrained, and unskilled labourers have been drawn away by the better wages offered by the mines at the expense of the soil. Tillage and harvesting are now being done by farmers who have overcome some of their obstacles with less annual labour, but ditching has not been so relieved to any extent.\n\nLack of tile is not the real impediment. Clay from the clay belt is abundant, and is found in nearly every township, or at least in every county. The difficulty is that it is difficult to transport, difficult to process and operate. In Ontario alone there are more than 15,000 acres of land, the number and capacity of which might be vastly increased along with the related industry of tile-making. If the one nor the other will be developed under the present system, it is practically impossible to make. Labour for this work, as we have stated, is practically impossible to obtain.\n\nThis is practically true in every province; we have been unable to get sufficient labour to do the ditching. We have in the province of Ontario, for example, 160 tile-making plants which in the last five years have increased their output from 15,000,000 to some 30,000,000 tiles per year, notwithstanding the fact that the farmers cannot get the tiles they need. The number of these factories has continued to increase in the county of Kent. Last fall when driving over the township of Monkton I saw four or five plants starting up to build tiles for the farmers. Lowes & Sons, Harwich, have spent thousands of dollars in establishing a plant, and last Saturday, the second day of the session, I went to the office to find out whether there was any likelihood of the duty on traction ditches being reduced, as the farmers cannot supply the tiles. Then at Tilbury, a plant has been started by Mr. Armstrong, a young man of the name of Armstrong, and in the township of Dover, Mr. Montgomery, a young farmer, has started another.\n\nSo that, there is no question that plants can be established very easily. In having a large number of tile plants, the farmers would very easily get the tiles, and, consequently, the farmers of the country are concerned, it would mean additional employment. In removing the duty of seven and a half cents on traction ditches, which are not manufactured in Canada, it would not be establishing a precedent. We have had our own tariff many articles which are not manufactured in this country, and yet they are allowed to come in free of duty.\n\nMr. McCOIG:\n\nmight just instance printing presses costing over $1,000 each are admitted without duty, and there are many machines, in fact in general articles that are not manufactured in this country are admitted free.\n\nI think it would be of such universal benefit that I do not see how the Government can refrain from doing something to meet with the endorsement of men irrespective of political affiliations, who are interested in the farming men and the agriculturists of the country, and it is not opposed by the farmers of the country. I have sympathy with the scheme. I sincerely hope that the Government will give this matter their most favorable consideration and have this tariff removed so as to give encouragement to the tile manufacturers, and then the important work of tile drainage will be done to a greater extent than has been done in the past.\n\nHon. W. T. WHITE (Minister of Finance): A matter of this kind relating to the tiles is generally discussed in connection with the budget debate, but of course it would have been quite in order if the hon. friend had his notice of motion with respect to it been reached. I may say for the record that the hon. friend has indicated as indicated by the right hon. the Prime Minister, that he is glad indeed to acquiesce in a brief discussion of the subject this afternoon in connection with the budget. Surely, my dear friend (Mr. McCole) refers to the item of traction ditches, or to machinery which is used for constructing ditches under the tariff, and he has correctly stated that the farmers cannot get them under the general tariff. These traction ditches are purchased from the United States, and I believe that I have heard that only a comparatively small number of them are purchased here. I believe about sixteen were purchased. The question of the effect upon the revenue is therefore of very great importance. These large ditches are very powerful machines. On ground where they are used, and where they come, they will ditch one hundred rods, or one-third of a mile and on stoney ground probably half that distance.\n\nMr. BELAND: To what depth?\n\nMr. WHITE: To what depth? There are machines that will ditch to a depth of seven and a half feet. There are varying widths, but the average width of the machine will ditch to a depth of seven and a half feet for any width, but I know that the hon. friend is interested in a piece of work that I have indicated to a depth of seven and a half feet, and that is the width of the ditch and the sides are sloping. Altogether, it is a most ingenious piece of machinery, and it is used extensively on the farm. This discussion does more particularly belong to the budget debate due to an occasion of this kind, although, as I have said, the hon. member would have been quite justified in having brought this matter to the House to bring the subject up and have it discussed in the House before the budget is introduced. It is only fair to say that this is one of the matters that, during the past year, the Ministry of Agriculture of Ontario also brought the matter to the attention of the department. I think that is all I can usefully say at the present time.\n\nMr. O. J. WILCOX (North Essex): Mr. Speaker, I desire to refer to my hon. friend (Mr. McCole) represents a rural constituency, and for the reason that the district which we represent, from its physical and geographical position, is one of the finest from an agricultural point of view, I desire to make a few remarks on this question. My right hon. friend, the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Wilcox, came to our part of the country, to use his picturesque language, and always spoke on him in southwestern Ontario and that nothing would suit him better than to spend the latter part of his life in that southwestern part of Ontario. I assure my right hon. friend that if he tell him that we will get him with us among the tall corn, and when we have got him there, he will be very comfortable, we will be perfectly happy.\n\nI agree with my hon. friend the Minister of Finance (Mr. White) that it is a rather unusual thing in this House to discuss a question of this kind before the budget speech is brought down. I will not, upon this occasion, deal with the question of the tariff generally as I would like to do, and will possibly do, upon a later date.\n\nI desire to say that I have never been connected with any corporate interest and that if I were biased in any way, it would certainly be in the interest of the agriculturists. I am not connected with any corporation, and I can see no reason in this particular case why the duty should not be removed from ditching machines. I remain respectfully yours, Mr. Speaker.\n\nHon. Mr. Speaker: A little experience in this House to which I have referred and I do not think I shall ever forget it. The experience of my hon. friend (Mr. McCole) of the great grievance that the farmers of Essex and Kent were suffering because of certain duties which had been retained by the Canada Company, which was a special trip to the Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce, and I find that not only was the public opinion in favour of that legislation to the farmers of southwestern Ontario. It was evident before the election, and before the election its panels were Jasper, its frame was of pure gold, and it died the day before the election, and it died the day after, I must say to the leader of the Opposition that it was a splendid effort.\nSir WILFRID LAURIER: Not quite enough.\n\nMr. WILCOX: Possibly not quite enough to meet the views of my right hon. friend. Of course, I am bound by the rules. I am not permitted to discuss the motive that actuated me in bringing this resolution in this way and to bring it up under the conditions in which it was brought up a little while ago. Therefore the Minister of Finance brought down his budget but I think he did not derive this particular benefit. This is the resolution which Mr. McCoig proposed.\n\nThat whereas the ditching machinery is very extensively used in the whole of Canada, and more particularly in southwestern Ontario.\n\nMr. HAZEN: What is the date?\n\nMr. WILCOX: I took it from the Order Paper of December 10. That is to say, we have the same resolution this time. The first part of the resolution says: \"That the resolution that I referred to earlier ought to be put on the table today. We have a new resolution that is very similar to the one that was passed last year.\"\n\nMr. TURRIFF: Why do you not put the duty on again?\n\nMr. WILCOX: Are you in favour of putting the duty on?\n\nMr. WILCOX: When the time comes for dealing with that question, I shall give it my earnest and careful consideration.\n\nMr. TURRIFF: I believe that the farmers would be willing to pay the reduction of duty on coal oil. When I first came into Parliament, I was told that the price of binder twine had been reduced by the Imperial Oil Company almost forty years ago. Now, with regard to the particular item of ditching machinery\u2014there is no doubt that it is used extensively in Canada of machines of this kind. And there is not likely to be a demand for them in this country because the demand for that machinery in this country is very small. I am informed, however, that the Imperial Oil Company has established a branch here that supplies machines for use as well as oil out of the Canadian crude as was formerly imported made from the crude of the Imperial Oil Company. I do not think the consumers have anything to grumble at because the Standard Oil Company has been importing American oil into this country. Returning to the question of ditching machinery, the Minister of Finance has already stated that work is done. The use of these machines would enable the farmers to ditch a great deal more land than they could do for them to ditch now. This use of ditching machines is a tremendous help to farmers in this country, until four or five years ago they were not used. They come into more extensive use now.\n\nMr. E. W. NESBITT (South Ontario): I fully endorse what my hon. friend (Mr. McCoig) has said. He has gone into the question of the effect that the removal of the duty might have upon the farmers' interest in the manufacture of these machines. There is not enough demand to warrant manufacturers in establishing their industry in this country. It should not be surprising if before long some agricultural implement manufacturer were to undertake the manufacture of ditching machinery in Canada. The manufacture of these machines is a large profit in the goods at the prices charged in the American market, and a manufacturer working at a large profit even without the protection\u2014certainly it is not necessary to have any protection. Answering a question recently from Mr. Essex (Mr. Wilcox) with reference to binder twine, I am not going to wander off into a long argument, but I declare that the present Government or any other government might exist in Canada would dare put a duty on binder twine. I believe that the benefit to the people at large in taking the duty off binder twine was greater than would have come from the imposition of a duty that might have been established. I doubt if any person could manufacture binder twine in Canada and sell it at a price lower than the Imperial Oil Company says it was increased in price in the future. In the case of the Standard Oil Company, a branch, it is generally understood, of the great Standard Oil Company of the United States, the price to the consumer has been reduced by the establishment of a Canadian Imperial Oil Company. It is a remarkable fact that for I had the pleasure of selling coal oil for many years\u2014that we could get our first shipments of American oil in order to provide consumers with a first-class article, and we paid a bounty on the article being sold. But since the Standard Oil Company have established a branch here they have been able to supply us as well as oil out of the Canadian crude as was formerly imported made from the crude of the Imperial Oil Company. I do not think the consumers have anything to grumble at because the Standard Oil Company has been importing American oil into this country. Returning to the question of ditching machinery, the Minister of Finance has already stated that work is done. The use of these machines would enable the farmers to ditch a great deal more land than they could do for them to ditch now. This use of ditching machines is a tremendous help to farmers in this country, until four or five years ago they were not used. They come into more extensive use now.\n\nMr. SMITH (South Ontario): How are you going to get men enlist in the navy if you cannot get them to dig ditches at those wages?\n\nMr. NESBITT: I am sure the House, and you, Mr. Speaker, will excuse me if I do not enter upon a discussion of the navy question. I trust the House will not think that I am discourteous to him, because that is not my desire. At the time, therefore, the adoption of these machines would save the labour of ditchers. These machines would certainly be of immense benefit to the farming communities not only of that section of the country, but also to the county of Kent, but that particular portion of it from which I come. These machines were\nused with a great deal of success last year in my section of the country. I will not go into the matter of the tariff, and will not endeavour to answer any question of the hon. member for North Essex in that regard. With my hon. friend from Kent, I thank the right hon. Prime Minister for giving me an opportunity to discuss this matter at the present time, but I am sure he would not have done so had he other matters.\n\nMr. W. S. MIDDLEBROO (South Grey): I think everything should be done that can possibly be done with a view to alleviating the great difficulties of existing conditions in the matter of ditches. In that connection I think that the admission of ditching machines into Canada free was a very good thing. In my own riding I have been consulted by many agricultural societies connected with the drainage of land, and the county of Grey passed a unanimous resolution, signed by the county council, requesting that the Government remove the duty on these ditching machines. I believe that the right hon. member for West Kent (Mr. Colby), in his speech, spoke of the difficulties of the farmers in my county in regard to this matter. The county council forwarded me a petition asking me to support any resolution for the removal of this duty, and I have received several petitions from the township councils in the county of Lambton also, and I should do so. We recognize the fact that there must exist a revenue for the purpose of carrying on the duties of the House; but I do think, as the hon. Minister of Finance said this afternoon, that the House shall be in no way affected by the imposition of moderate protection for home industries, because, as I understand it, the principal object of the protection is to encourage the manufacture of goods in the Dominion of Canada. As the primary object of the protection is the protection of home industries, and as we have no home industry concerned, I do not think it would be violating our principles if we were to remove the imposition of this duty, which involves nothing more nor less than a tariff for revenue purposes. If the imposition of this duty will have the effect of opening up our richest districts in Ontario, where the soil is so fertile, it is well known that many of the lands which are now absolutely useless could be brought under cultivation in the country if they could be given tile drainage. They are practically in a state of nature, owing to the poor fertility of the richest lands, and for that reason, and for other reasons, we should be anxious in removing this duty. I have also had presented to me a petition from the Farmers' Institute in the county of Grey, signed by William Bunt and James Gardner, committee. In this petition are sufficient to warrant hon. members coming to the conclusion that this duty should be removed. I have also a petition from the West Derby Farmers' Club, signed by Mr. Dalphus, and others, and also giving other reasons for the removal of this duty, and also a petition signed by A. F. Donald, secretary of the North Grey Farmers' Institute. These represent practically all the agricultural societies in my riding, and I have received many such petitions\u2014although I know the Government cannot at this time make any announcement in regard to the raising of the tariff. How the hon. member for North Essex could make such an announcement I do not understand, and I think it was made wholly in ignorance of the subject he was discussing.\n\nMr. F. F. PARDEE (West Lambton): I desire to endorse what has been said with regard to the duty on ditching machines, particularly the remarks of the hon. member for West Kent (Mr. Colby), and the county council of Lambton forwarded me a petition asking me to support any resolution for the removal of this duty, and I have received several petitions from the township councils in the county of Lambton also, and I should do so. We recognize the fact that there must exist a revenue for the purpose of carrying on the duties of the House; but I do think, as the hon. Minister of Finance said this afternoon, that the House shall be in no way affected by the imposition of moderate protection for home industries, because, as I understand it, the principal object of the protection is to encourage the manufacture of goods in the Dominion of Canada. As the primary object of the protection is the protection of home industries, and as we have no home industry concerned, I do not think it would be violating our principles if we were to remove the imposition of this duty, which involves nothing more nor less than a tariff for revenue purposes. If the imposition of this duty will have the effect of opening up our richest districts in Ontario, where the soil is so fertile, it is well known that many of the lands which are now absolutely useless could be brought under cultivation in the country if they could be given tile drainage. They are practically in a state of nature, owing to the poor fertility of the richest lands, and for that reason, and for other reasons, we should be anxious in removing this duty. I have also had presented to me a petition from the Farmers' Institute in the county of Grey, signed by William Bunt and James Gardner, committee. In this petition are sufficient to warrant hon. members coming to the conclusion that this duty should be removed. I have also a petition from the West Derby Farmers' Club, signed by Mr. Dalphus, and others, and also giving other reasons for the removal of this duty, and also a petition signed by A. F. Donald, secretary of the North Grey Farmers' Institute. These represent practically all the agricultural societies in my riding, and I have received many such petitions\u2014although I know the Government cannot at this time make any announcement in regard to the raising of the tariff. How the hon. member for North Essex could make such an announcement I do not understand, and I think it was made wholly in ignorance of the subject he was discussing.\n\nMr. J. W. EDWARDS (Frontenac): I also have received petitions from my county in regard to the duty on ditching machines. If the discussion had been deferred until the bringing down of the budget speech, it would have been easier to bring the matter to a conclusion. While I may be a little premature in bringing it up at the present time, I do not think it would be premature to bring it up at the present time, and not evidence any of those signs of interest when his honour proposes to bring it up at the present time, then of course the duty on these machines reduced or removed, but he did not say anything about it. It was Abraham Lincoln who, in pressing his views with regard to protection, said, \"A man who does not pay $100 for a machine in the United States gets the machine and pays $500 for the same thing. If we make that machine in the United States, and pay for it here, we have both the $100 and the $500.\" That argument I hardly apply in this case, because at the present time the manufacture of machines is encouraged in this country, and no industry can therefore be affected by the removal of this duty. However, I endorse the sentiments which have been advanced by the previous speakers, and I think that the House, in bringing this matter forward, should give very early consideration to the fact that labour on the farms in Ontario and in the Dominion of Canada is extremely scarce, and the fact that this machine is a labour-saver, and is, therefore, an argument in favour of the removal of the duty on it. Personally I have no reason to oppose the removal of this duty, and I should like to see the House take a favourable view towards the reduction or removal of the duty upon these machines.\n\nMr. J. G. THOMPSON (Toronto): In the discussion this afternoon there has been some suggestion that the hon. member for Kent (Mr. Colby) had brought up the matter prematurely and should have waited until the Minister of Finance had brought up the matter. If the hon. member had brought up the matter if he had waited until that time it would have been rather too late for the minister to bring it up. But I think to-day hon. gentlemen on both sides of the House have been afforded an opportunity to express their views, and the Minister of Finance will be able to give the matter fair consideration before he reaches a decision before\n\n61.\u20141913\u20142;\nfortunately I cannot place my hands upon the answer which he gave to that which is to be found among them. My recollection is, I think that it is a fair inference from the answer given, that it was the intention of the department that only the bounty should be given to those who had active participation in the events of the Fenian Raid. Recent developments have led me, in believing that the department were interested in this particular point; not, perhaps, so as to include a great number of possible applicants, and in the prompt Nova Scotia militia and others, who had never seen active service themselves, demand a bounty, there has been some confusion of thought. This fact is evidenced by the fact that recently there seems to have been a certain amount of misunderstanding with regard to those persons who were entitled to the Fenian Raid bounty, even at this day. While it may be true that such persons were entitled to them before their receiving it, under the provisions of the Voluntary Bounty Act, it seems that if they are entitled to it, it should be made known in the manner in which I have done by my personal knowledge. Nova Scotia militia, who had been called out to the front, and who had, in reality, not been engaged in the fighting, have been placed in a position where they are entitled to receive the bounty.\n\nMr. H. A. MACKENZIE (Halifax).\u2014I understand that in the province of Nova Scotia practically all the regiments canteens because one can easily say hey, it might be used for some political effect by friends of the Administration. While that may not be the intention of the minister, and while there is reason to doubt that there is some force and validity in the statement which he makes and the attitude which is adopted, it is certainly a matter of regret that Parliament has quoted the words of the statute that: Volunteer means any person who was engaged in the Fenian Raid, or in any military corps which the Government of Canada in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick may grant any bounty; in the province of Nova Scotia so that this information can be determined in a proper way, to give it to every person who could possibly be entitled to it.\n\nMr. J. H. SIMONAR (Gagetown) said: Before raising this question, I must bring to the attention of the Minister of Militia, in regard to which I desire from him a statement, or that, up to a very recent date, had been detained, there must have been an error, or that such persons were entitled to the Fenian Raid bounty and they were not called out, no records being able to prove it. While it says that if they are entitled to it, it should be made known in order that those who are now doing nothing, but who have never seen active service, may be entitled to this bounty.\n\nAccompanying this form of application is a document stating that it has been signed by the Dominion government of Canada, and it states that this bounty is in accordance with the provisions of the Fenian Raid Volunteer Bounty Act. The basic requirements are as follows:\n\n1. The applicant must submit a declaration setting forth his name, address, occupation, and other details relevant to his application.\n\n2. The applicant must present proof of residence in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\n3. The applicant must provide a sworn affidavit attesting to his involvement in the Fenian Raid.\n\n4. The applicant must agree to pay a portion of the bounty as a fee for processing the claim.\n\n5. The applicant must submit a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of the bounty.\n\nThis form of application is consistent with the spirit of the Fenian Raid Volunteer Bounty Act, which provides a means for veterans and their families to obtain compensation for their service during the Fenian Raid.\n\nThere has been no change whatever.\nmentioned Militia Act. This was a special proclamation, issued because of the alarm that was felt and to ensure a proper and prompt response by those who responded to that special call should secure the proper application of the provisions of the Act in accordance with requirements, and forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nThat statement was published in the local papers in Nova Scotia, and there have been very large numbers of letters written to members. I have received a large number of letters from members for an examination as to whether these people who had performed drill at that time are entitled to any consideration that can be given, namely: Mr. J. C. Walker, Mr. H. H. Macdonald, Mr. Joseph Harvey, and Colonel Walter Clarke. I think the last-named gentlemen is well known, the late Minister of the Ministry of Militia. These four men actually went to the front and performed active service during the Fenian Raid in 1869. They came to Canada in 1861 or 1862 with the British regiment which was stationed at the time in the Trent affair. They continued in Canada and were stationed at various places until about the time of the outbreak of the Fenian Raid in 1866, when they were at once sent to the front. After performing active service for a period of time and after putting in their time, they obtained a discharge from their service and remained in Canada as native settlers. In Canada, they have resided here ever since and are, to all intents and purposes, Canadian citizens. I am informed that the reason why they have been refused the bounty is that they do not comply with section 3 which prescribes:\n\nVolunteers means every person who was regularly enrolled or otherwise enlisted in militia, or in which the Government of Canada, or of Nova Scotia, or of New Brunswick has always been free from partisanship. The fact that an hon. gentlemen supports the government does not mean so far as I know, given him any advantage whatever in regard to matters carried on by the Militia Department. I have some reason to enter our protests if it be true that information has been handed out to the minister opposite that he has not been given to us on this side. I should like to join my hon. friend from Halifax (Mr. Maclean) and say that the Fenian Raid will tonight make a clear and distinct declaration in regard to this question. We are informed by the House and the country what persons have a right to this bounty, so that there may be no misunderstanding, and we will assure you that the friends of hon. gentlemen on this side of the House will treat them in exactly the same way as the hon. gentlemen opposite.\n\nMr. HUGH GUTHRIE (South Wellington): I think there is some misapprehension in the part of the province of Ontario from which I come, as to the interpretation which should be put on the Volunteer Fenian Act. There is a rumour that some relaxation of the conditions has been or is contemplated. I desire to state that under the fixed reading of the Act would not be entitled will in the near future. It is not now, nor will it be then, bounty. In my constituency are four worthy citizens who are entitled to any consideration that can be given, namely: Mr. J. C. Walker, Mr. H. H. Macdonald, Mr. Joseph Harvey, and Colonel Walter Clarke. I think the last-named gentlemen is well known, the late Minister of the Ministry of Militia. These four men actually went to the front and performed active service during the Fenian Raid in 1869. They came to Canada in 1861 or 1862 with the British regiment which was stationed at the time in the Trent affair. They continued in Canada and were stationed at various places until about the time of the outbreak of the Fenian Raid in 1866, when they were at once sent to the front. After performing active service for a period of time and after putting in their time, they obtained a discharge from their service and remained in Canada as native settlers. In Canada, they have resided here ever since and are, to all intents and purposes, Canadian citizens. I am informed that the reason why they have been refused the bounty is that they do not comply with section 3 which prescribes:\n\nVolunteers means every person who was regularly enrolled or otherwise enlisted in militia, or in which the Government of Canada, or of Nova Scotia, or of New Brunswick has always been free from partisanship. The fact that an hon. gentlemen supports the government does not mean so far as I know, given him any advantage whatever in regard to matters carried on by the Militia Department. I have some reason to enter our protests if it be true that information has been handed out to the minister opposite that he has not been given to us on this side. I should like to join my hon. friend from Halifax (Mr. Maclean) and say that the Fenian Raid will tonight make a clear and distinct declaration in regard to this question. We are informed by the House and the country what persons have a right to this bounty, so that there may be no misunderstanding, and we will assure you that the friends of hon. gentlemen on this side of the House will treat them in exactly the same way as the hon. gentlemen opposite.\n\nMr. E. M. MACDONALD (Pictou): It is most desirable that the Minister of Militia should take steps to settle misunderstandings which have certainly arisen in regard to this matter. I desire to refer to a certain phase of the question. I would like to refer to a letter which I have received from Mr. Hugh Wellington (Mr. Guthrie). Certain hon. members in the province of Quebec are anxious to do something in anticipation of this matter coming up, to call to mind the services of about twenty men in some of the border counties, who formed themselves into a volunteer corps and who actually performed active service in connection with the Fenian Raid. I am free to say that I think just the men who actually performed active service at the time of the invasion of Canada would be considered, even if those who were called out were prepared to go. If the minister considers that there are any cases, such as I have mentioned should come under his particular consideration.\n\nWith reference to the alleged misunderstanding as to the meaning of the Act, I am bound to say that I cannot see any necessity for the circular letters that have appeared in the press of Nova Scotia to explain the terms of the Act. An attempt to make political capital out of a question in which there is no real question. The wording of the Act is very clear and there cannot be any misunderstanding about the terms of the Act. I am informed by my hon. friend from Guysborough (Mr. Macdonald) and by friends from Halifax (Mr. Maclean) and by friends from Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) that the men who were called out for active service and who were members of the militia were entitled to receive that bounty. That language, which was used by the minister, anybody who knows anything about militia work or anything about active service, will admit, was all evident, namely, that the man who is going to receive this bounty must be a member of the militia. I personally never had any misunderstanding in regard to the subject; and I have never heard anyone in regard to the matter in my own constituency or other constituency say anything to the contrary.\n\nI was therefore surprised to find that some hon. gentlemen alleged lately that the minister was not doing anything in getting the Militia Department to put some new interpretation on the Act. I thought at first were not entitled to receive bounty. The efforts of these gentlemen were supporting the Government were not to get the minister to change the interpretation of the Act. We knew that the minister was bound by the terms of the Act and could not pay a bounty to anyone who did not come within this section 2; and all the influence of all the hon. members of the Government did not have succeeded in getting the minister to give a bounty to a single man who did not come within this section 2 of the statute. Consequently, all these letters upon this subject have been entirely unnecessary. We are delighted in revealing a large number of people in the province of Nova Scotia who came there. I believe that there were certain friends of this Government in Ottawa who, by some superhuman effort, had succeeded in creating a condition of affairs that would enable some to claim this grant who could not otherwise have received it. The result is that a large number of men in the province of Nova Scotia who were not called out for active service, but who attended the Fenian Raid in 1869, according to hon. members of this House on the subject. I am sure the Department of the Militia is a reasonable application from these men in good faith and relying upon these letters and the series of hon. gentlemen opposite, that something had been done by which they were entitled to receive $100. The Guysborough Times contains a statement by a constituent of mine who stated that he had applied for a bounty under the terms of this document he is entitled to the money. The special part of this question is to dispose of that act which is the letter of the hon. member for Annapolis (Mr. Davidson). The Guysborough Times contains a statement by a constituent of mine who stated that he had applied for a bounty under the terms of this document he is entitled to the money. The special part of this question is to dispose of that act which is the letter of the hon. member for Annapolis (Mr. Davidson).\n\nWe are glad to note from the letter in the Spectator of Mr. Davidson that the Annapolis Valley militia were drilled in 1866 and again in 1870, for the Fenian Raid scare are still remembered. Mr. George T. MacNutt has written several communications.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: Has the hon. gentleman the letter of mine which appeared in the Annapolis papers?\n\nMr. MACDONALD: Yes.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: The hon. gentleman, then, will notice that no such representation was made.\n\nMr. MACDONALD: I will come to that. After reading the statement of a paper friendly to the Government as a result of the letter of my hon. friend from Anne Arundel (Mr. MacNutt), referred to was the candidate of the Conservative party for the legislature two years ago. (Resigned)\n\n\u2014along this line to the Truro News, and no doubt the same thing will be said by the other papers. We hope all the veterans in the county of Guysborough will have their papers in order to get their bounty from the Militia Department at Ottawa.\n\nThe Fenian Army veterans are in precisely the same position as the veterans of Annapolis county. The Fenian Army veterans were, like the hon. friend the Minister of Militia that all the good old gentlemen in those counties of Nova Scotia who were drilled in 1866 and who are going to send in their applications to him, and his department will consider them under the terms of this Act. Only a certain percentage of the volunteers of that province were called out for active service, because at that period in our province there was practically compulsory ser-\nvice, and almost every man of twenty-one years or over went out to annual drill. My hon. friend from Yarmouth has at-\ntention to his honour. What does he say?\n\nDear Sir,\u2014As your readers are doubtless aware, an Act was passed at the last session of the Nova Scotia legislature entitled \"The Fenian Raid Volunteer Bounty Act,\" which provided that all men who had volunteered in the year 1866 were entitled to a bounty of $100. As first interpreted, the Act appeared to apply only to volunteers in this province, who were merely called out for drill in 1866, and who did not actually encounter the enemy.\n\nYou will notice that that statement is very generous. For interpretation does not cover the men called out for drill in 1866. (Headquarters.)\n\nGovernment members from Nova Scotia, however, have brought to the attention of the government that in the spring of March, 1866, a proclamation was issued by the Governor calling out the militia, and the department is now indicating the view that there was a call for a compulsory militia service, who turned out to oblige the administration, and who were entitled to receive the bounty.\n\nHe goes on to ask the people in his county to send in applications to certain who are named gentlemen.\n\nI am sure the minister will agree with me that there must have been but one interpretation to this Act; that those who were called out for active service, and who alone were entitled to receive the grant, have been excluded. The hon. representative for Yarmouth writes to his county a circular letter, calling upon the county of Yarmouth who went out to drill in 1866 and 1870 to believe that the claim of the erroneous supporters from Nova Scotia, all he had to do was to go to the office of the Minister of Militia, and back would come $100. Of course, this is poor politics. It is also bad policy. The policy of the department on this question has been settled, and there can be no further discussion. The only result will be that many will be disappointed who ought not to have been. The men called out for drill only to drill in 1870 could not possibly be considered in this connection because the proper procedure was carried out for active service in Nova Scotia was the one issued in 1866. But if I am not mistaken, the minister will state whether I am right or not\u2014no matter who drilled in 1866 so long as they were called out, he was not called out for active service. The only men Nova Scotia who should be entitled to receive the bounty of $100, were those who came out in response to the proclamation in the spring of 1866. The men who drilled in the autumn of that year, or any other year, in that province, but who did not come out in response to the proclamation, were entitled to nothing. It is not the case that the men who responded to the call for active service in 1866 were entitled to anything. It is not the case that the men who responded to the call for active service in 1866 were entitled to anything. It is not the case that the men who responded to the call for active service in 1866 were entitled to anything.\n\nMr. MACDONALD.\nagain. We waited for orders nearly all of Saturday. We were in Fort Erie until about noon. We got to Fort Colborne that evening about eight or nine o'clock in time to see some of the Fenian regiments come from the right at Ridgeway. That is what occurred. I am speaking now not of the battle but of the regiments that turned out on that occasion, were the 9th of Foot, the Queen's Own, the 6th of Foot, the 13th of Foot, and the 7th of London. They were at Ridgeway. The battle was not there. The battle was over; I want to admit that. The fight was over before our train arrived at Fort Erie. In fact, two or three days after Sunday morning we were again called up and at four o'clock we were ordered to go to Ridgeway. We supposed the enemy was and we got to Ridgeway on Sunday afternoon. We knew by evening that we were wrong when I was an officer marched over what was called the Fenian line and found no bodies of Fenians lying there. After an hour's rest we went on to Fort Erie and arrived there early next morning.\n\nWe saw there a battery of the regular artillery and the regiment of the Queen's Own. We were all assembled there and the Fenians were on a Government steamer which came out that day. That is all the fighting that was done. We returned on Monday night to London, having since then met together within the last week, from men who were there and if there was any excitement, I could make about the minister's management of this question, which is a very difficult one. The Fenians were there and men who I firmly believe were there and who are in correspondence with me today are not Fenians because they happened not appear on a pay-list. I doubt very much if we had a pay-list in those days. Doubtless a pay-list would be found. My recollection is that the regiment did not have a pay-list until the appointment of Justice MacMillan, at one time a member of this House, was appointed paymaster. I need only say that New Brunswick had been invaded.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Oh, yes, New Brunswick was.\n\nMr. BARKER: I am not disputing. I am only saying that at that time we heard nothing of any invasion there. There seems to be a misunderstanding somewhere. Several weeks ago, in the month of January I think, I took advantage of the opportunity to be supplied to people who thought they came under this Act, and were entitled to the Fenian Raid bounty. Forms were supplied to me, twenty-four or twenty-five of them, and I sent them to the minister in person, and asked for them. One person in particular, a gentleman who lives in the town of Grand Falls, has never yet come out under the proclamation of the Governor of Nova Scotia in 1869, made an application for a bounty. I have heard that form is implied that no person will get this bounty unless he holds a Fenian Raid medal. That is the point, mark of the form and part of the affidavit which had to be signed. Now, the gentleman who does not have a Fenian Raid medal. He sent his application to the department, and shortly afterwards received a reply saying that he could hardly receive the bounty because his name did not appear on the pay-list of the province of Nova Scotia or elsewhere. Now, at that time I do not think there was any such examination in the province of Nova Scotia, and yet for the reason I have mentioned this man does not have a Fenian Raid medal. He refused to receive his bounty. I think that 'active service' under the terms of the Act refers to persons who came out under the proclamation issued in Nova Scotia in 1869, and I believe there should be some clearer legislation.\n\nHere was a man who came out under that proclamation. He was in active service, which had been turned down for the reasons that he could not swear to certain parts of the affidavit, in that he did not serve in the militia, and secondly that he was not enrolled. Personally I would be in favour of every man belonging to the regular militia organization in the province of Nova Scotia of that date being entitled to this bounty. I do not think that the Act as it stands now entitles them to it. There seems to be some misunderstanding, and I know a town in the county, which I have the honour to represent, where a gentleman is going out asking them to call at his office in order that they may fill out forms for the Fenian Raid bounty. Up to the present time, two hundred people have made applications, and I believe that I have fault to find with that at all, but that gentleman seems to use a certain sort of pressure on the people who notifies to make application. The fact is that these has been no attempt made by anyone so far as I know, and who shall not get this Fenian Raid bounty. As was pointed out in Nova Scotia, there was an annual drill, and I have not met a gentleman down there who has been entitled under this Act to receive this bounty. I try to be fair and just to everyone. If I try to be fair and just to everyone, I believe that the interpretation placed on the Act by the Minister of Militia that it applies only to those who served in active service. Of course, it is a matter of opinion as to what active service really means. That is why I raise the difficulty. I have nothing more to say regarding the matter except that the department should make an application which I understand that the applications and affidavits should be understood, and applicants would not be turned down because their applications are not filled out properly. I believe that every person who was called out in Nova Scotia under that proclamation and enrolled under the Act; I believe the Act will bear that interpretation. Like myself, I hope the minister will make some public announcement concerning this matter in the future as to who is entitled to receive this aid.\n\nMr. PIUS MICHAUD (Victoria, N.B.): I live in a country which extends on the state of Maine for a distance of one hundred miles, and I remember well hearing people speak of the Fenians as a force to take Maine to invade the northern part of New Brunswick. When that organization took place, Mr. Micahud, a company was organized at Grand Falls in the coun-\ntice of Victoria and Madawaska, under Capt. Ross\u00e9. Grand Falls is also north of four miles from the northern part of the state of Maine. I have here the names of some citizens who were under arms for a certain length of time, and they are for a notable reason. There are such names as Robert Malcolm, Adam H. Caldwell, Bernard McLaughlin, Mary McGarry, Joseph Girou, Archibald Pelletier and James P. Kelly. Mr. Kelly is a magistrate at the town of Grand Falls. The reason why I say what I could mention, such as Alexander Marquis and Theodore Maximus who went to Canada as a certain number of those who went to Niagara Falls. These gentlemen feel that they are entitled to a statement. If they are not paid, the Minister does not permit the Minister to pay them $100 bonus, there should be another Act so that these people may be compensated for the services which they performed at that time. Mr. Robson, the minister will give earnest consideration to the representations which have been made to him, and he will do everything possible to assist their country when it was threatened by invasion.\n\nMr. J. W. EDWARDS (Frontenac). I want to take exception to regard to this matter inasmuch as there have been a number of claims sent to the Department of Militia and Defence from residents of the county that they had been neglected and ignored and which claims have been disallowed on the ground that the names of the men who had received the federal Government his medal, has himself taken a declaration of service, and has been backed up with affidavits from two or three others that he was out at that engagement. I think that reputable citizens in my county, are entirely mistaken in regard to having served. I know a great many men who have a distinct recollection of having been engaged in the fighting service in 1866 or 1870, whose claims have been disallowed on the ground that their names appear on no pay list. I can only conclude that there is something wrong with regard to these particular cases, because if they are not paid, they pay lists in the department. I know of a number of cases in my own county which have been disallowed. One thing which makes the matter a little more difficult is that a great many Fenian Irish veterans were granted medals by this government and this is regarded by these men as an acknowledgment by the Federal Government of the services which they claim. Therefore, if a man presents his claim to the government for his bounty and is refused, then that is not fair. The fact that the government has given him this medal is an acknowledgment of the services which he rendered, and must be regarded as very strong evidence that he was at the front at that time. He may not be on the pay list but not. Another thing that I think is a little harsh in this: A man who has been called out for active service and has made a statement of one or two comrades certifying that he was out in the engagement, and if these people refuse their claim because they say their name is not on the pay list. Then, these men should be paid immediately, and therefore further evidence. He may produce one or two affidavits of reputable persons and still have his name not on the pay list, incident that occurred in 1866 or 1870. It seems to me that this is carrying the matter a little too far. In looking over the pay list, I am sure that there will be many more cases in which claims have been disallowed on the ground that the names of the men who had received the federal Government's medal, has himself taken a declaration of service, and has been backed up with affidavits from two or three others that he was out at that engagement.\n\nMr. H. B. MORPHY (North Perth). Mr. Speaker, I come with what the hon. member for Frontenac (Mr. Edwards) has said. I have a gentleman in my county, living in the city of Stratford, a gentleman of the name of Walter Ramsay, who was called out to the front at the time of the Fenian invasion, under arms with other gentlemen. I have heard that they have received their pay, they stood in the ranks with this man, and yet they have been disallowed, not because his name is not on the pay list. This is one isolated instance of paying a man for doing no list. Probably some one, whose duty it was to put that man's name on the pay list, has done so. These probabilities are taken against the man although indubitable evidence can be given. I believe, to the department, that he was at the front, swore to it, compared with his fellow men, he has received his land grant from the Ontario Government, but he cannot get a dollar from the present Minster of Militia and Defence (Mr. Hughes). It is rather hard that the Minster of Militia is subjected to attack from both sides of this House. I confess myself, say, that such an attack is altogether just, but from the instances which have been given to me, it would be reasonable to ask that some amendment be made to this Act to get rid of them once more, failing in dealing with these cases.\n\nWhile I am on my feet, I desire to point out another matter. We have here a unit of the Queen's Rangers, in the city of Stratford, there was a well organized, fully equipped company, which became known as the Trunk Railway Brigade. It is true that it was only a company, but in the engagements which I have just upon the Queen's Rangers, I have just spoken of, they were called out for active service by some authority\u2014perhaps by some political authority\u2014but were sent to the front. When I speak of the front I understand the battle front. They performed their drill and other exercises in this manner, and were called out in that way. In the village of Millbank, in North Perth and in the adjoining villages of Crosshill, there was a company known as the Crosshill company, about which I may apply practically the same statement as I have already referred to in favour of the Grand Trunk Railway Brigade. They were called out separately, at their own expense. In this latter case, they performed the drill, and they took the stations that they were assigned to in the engagements. The commandant was thought at the time that the stations which they took were just as hazardous as any other stations which a soldier was asked to go. Therefore it seems to me that the spirit of the Queen's Rangers, of the national spirit and patriotism, to volunteer and serve, should be recognized in some way, and that the companies which they distinguished themselves in doing their duty, although they never came under fire. The Act as it stands is peculiar in some respects. In the city of Toronto in connection with the Toronto Rifle Corps, now known as the Toronto University Company, was called out. Practically every company that was most of a military centre, had better military organization than other centres, and yet the Queen's Rangers had the facilities and the officers to do things properly and regularly. They were called out under the Act, called out legally under the Queen's regulations, but often in that company, the firing line and the companies behind the firing line. They happened to bury the dead after the engagement. That was a military service lustfully performed, and I think the country was entitled to pay for any such services. Why have we not so heard in regard to the non-payment of one man who was at the front, whose companions have certified to the fact, who is unable to prove that his name was on the pay-list of the Militia Department? We find that there should be no hesitancy in doing anything to meet every reasonable honest, decent claim. This country can afford, in a case of that kind, to show sympathy, humanity, in this its day of expanding bountiful return. The Act should be extended to include the fellows who lost their lives in victorious battles of that campaign. There are many, too many widows who are dependent upon a cold world for the charity which will give them a name. I think every Canadian, no matter what his political views may be, will support this proposal. If this Act is largely extended so as to be generous rather than parsimonious.\n\nMr. D. D. MCKENZIE (Cape Breton). Mr. Speaker, I should like to call the Minister of Militia's attention to a point in section 2 of the Act, which says that two classes of persons are recognized in the Act, volunteers and those who enlisted in the militia and those who enlisted in them together. If they were militia men altogether that were recognized, then the Act would say, 'in their entirety,' in the section. The word 'in' is not used, but the word 'with.' This is the way the section is written.\n\nIn this Act volunteers means any person who was regularly enrolled or enlisted and who had served with any militia regiment or battalion of any province or of Nova Scotia or of New Brunswick called out for active service by the authority of the Governor General of Canada called out for active service by the authority of the Governor General. The two battalions of riflemen formed for service in the North-West.\n\nPossibly the language is understood by military men in a different way, but serving in a battalion and serving in a battalion is quite a different thing. I should like the Minister of Militia to give us some idea as to what he considers the two classes of men in this connection.\n\nI should like to call his attention further that there are different forms of application which are issued from his department. I think I am justified in saying that nothing is issued from his department without the sanction and approval of his head. I have under my hands some applications, one of which, the first one that was issued by the department, is altogether in compliance with the Act. The other, a more resis-\nMr. F. F. PARDEE (for Hamilton): I wish to refer to two or three of the applications that the department has received, on which it has not issued bounties. At the same time I desire to say to the member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker), that at the time the volunteers were called out in 1866 and again in 1870, in that connection I refer particularly to one James MacMillan, who was called out in 1866 and again in 1870. His application was received; it was practically all right except that he had not been called out to be paid when the department directed that he was to be paid for the active service performed for which he claimed the bounty, and that therefore he was not entitled to it. I think it highly probable that the very same circumstances applied to Mr. Molloy and to Mr. MacMillan, who served with the company with which the hon. member for Hamilton was connected.\n\nThere are other papers. But when all the other conditions have been complied with, as they should be, there will be nothing for the department to accept other evidence than that the man has actually seen active service. It does not seem to me that it should be a condition precedent that the man should have shown himself there. I asked for the papers in this case, and they have been returned to me. It is not because of the refusal to pay the bounty. It seems to me that the hon. member for Hamilton spoke properly when he said that the Act should be enlarged so that it would be possible to show that he was forced to give up what he was then at to go out in the service, and that he did not know whether he saw active service or not, surely the statute should give him the bounty. There are many cases where men have been left with the department and the department has not so far taken any recognition of them at all. There are the cases of Brown and Blundon and John Blundon. These men were all out in the field. They were called out to duty, and served with their company, patrolling the shore of the lake and the Chair River. However, what they were called upon to do as good Canadians was done by them. They were entitled to what the Act calls for without regard to minute details of their particular duties by which they are declared. I would call the attention of the minister to another case. Mr. MacMillan was employed as surgeon or medical officer at Sarnia and on service for a considerable time. He was appointed December 1865, and served as medical head officer until the end of December 1866. He was compelled to call out to duty\u2014so he writes the department\u2014and has given a statement of what he did. The smallpox broke out and he was called out to be surgeon. He was employed as surgeon for a time and was compelled to provide his own uniform, and he thinks he has given a statement under the Act. The only other person from my section who has been called out for whom I know is John MacMillan. He was with Grand Trunk Company number six which was ordered to the Eddy River lake above. He was captain, and the commanding officer wrote that the company drilled daily and patrolled the lake and river shore, and on one time they were ordered to enter the woods as far as Canadache sixteen miles up the line, because the Indians were reported to be about to land on the lake shore and raid the country. I am not finding fault with the department, but I think it is evident that they have a great number of claims and a great number of difficulties. In the mind of the minister that I do not think this Act ought to stand on any other basis than the one on which these claims are concerned. The whole spirit of the Act was to assure the men that those claims were valid, that he was called out and responded to repel any raid, who gave up his liberty and his comfort, and who had performed service for Queen and country, is entitled to have the claim paid. In that attitude, the minister is quite right and I feel satisfied, knowing his broadmindedness and his sympathy, that he will see to it that the men who can show that they respond to their country's call, shall receive this grant.\n\nHon. SAM HUGHES (Minister of Militia): I am very much pleased with the manner in which evidence has been given by members in this matter. I can assure them that this is a difficult matter to manage.\n\nMr. MCKENZIE:\n\nMany of these claimants are very old, and their memories, even under the best of circumstances, are not as acute as they were. But let any one try to recall what transpired five or five years ago, and we will find it not easy to say who was present with us on such an occasion. The men of the department allow every reasonable latitude in this matter. We have heard of gentlemen who have been criticizing the department that we have had scores of men, which, dear me, are not gentlemen by my hon. friend from North Perth or my hon. friend from West Lambton, who came here to face the music in every instance, who have been proven to be wrong or to need to be corrected. We have the list of volunteers coming to the department, good Christian Tories, and the simply decent. In order to avoid all unnecessary matters, in order to make sure, on one or two occasions, I have gone with them to the place where they say, \"I will go,\" and I found that the men had gone there, and we were being condemned for what was really due to his inability to perform the duties of that kind of work. We have the pay sheet in almost every instance. One instance is that of two men who were enrolled. One of these gentlemen has since died, and a third brother, who was also enrolled, has been cut. What are we to do? There are two brothers, and surely if the one is not paid, the other cannot be paid. In such a case it is strange that this other man was on the payroll, and that such a case is justified in such a manner. And surely, if we are justified in such a case, we should be justified in every more evident case. We must have evidence, and I declare, let me say in all fairness, we intend to demand the evidence. This money is not going to be paid out of the purse of Canada. But where indubitable evidence is furnished there is not a case where a warrant is not given. We are getting from the archives and from the various authorities in connection with the matter. Some fault has been found by the gentlemen, but some circulars or forms have been issued among their constituents. We, this House know the circumstances under which the volunteers went into the field in the spring of 1866. On the 17th of March of that year there was a rumour abroad that a French vessel had landed at the United States ports and were about to invade the coast of the province. The hon. member for Perth (Mr. Macdonald) brought up some cases. One case from the eastern townships was brought up, and there the matter was left for further investigation calling out the volunteers of that province. The actual service on the lists was had only twenty-four hours notice, but the men turned out who were enrolled and when the Fenians crossed, they found these fellows ready to meet them. When the Fenians crossed the boundary, they found these men ready to meet them. These men thought they had not been sworn in as volunteers, and I understand that some militiamen, at least four or five, thought that some militiamen, at least four or five, thought that they were doing themselves because these farmers had already repelled the Fenians through their own exertions. The farmers and the poor old fellows were afraid to admit that they were content with the result of the battle. This is a case in which I think payment should be made, but by the law does not appear to be the case. The militia company, all the volunteers declared that they were at the point, and although the militia was in order of enrolment or organization was apparently not in order. This matter has been dealt with only upon the due receipt of proofs.\n\nMr. SINCLAIR: The hon. minister referred to the fact that the name of the applicant was supposed to appear on the pay-lists.\n\nMr. HUGHES: No.\n\nMr. SINCLAIR: Then I misunderstood him. In the province of Nova Scotia there were no names at all, as the volunteers were not paid, but there would be some part of a list of the men enrolled in the different regiments and companies. Can the minister tell us if these lists for the province of Nova Scotia are in his possession?\n\nMr. HUGHES: They are in the hands of the minister.\n\nMr. SINCLAIR: Wherever there is a pay-list, and the minister says was in the company, we take it as evidence that he was not in the company if he was not paid, and we therefore ask him to furnish collateral proof. In every instance where the volunteer furnishes the man is given his warrant. We are getting from the archives and from the various authorities in connection with the matter. Some fault has been found by the gentlemen, but some circulars or forms have been issued among their constituents. We, this House know the circumstances under which the volunteers went into the field in the spring of 1866. On the 17th of March of that year there was a rumour abroad that a French vessel had landed at the United States ports and were about to invade the coast of the province. The hon. member for Perth (Mr. Macdonald) brought up some cases. One case from the eastern townships was brought up, and there the matter was left for further investigation calling out the volunteers of that province. The actual service on the lists was had only twenty-four hours notice, but the men turned out who were enrolled and when the Fenians crossed, they found these fellows ready to meet them. When the Fenians crossed the boundary, they found these men ready to meet them. These men thought they had not been sworn in as volunteers, and I understand that some militiamen, at least four or five, thought that they were doing themselves because these farmers had already repelled the Fenians through their own exertions. The farmers and the poor old fellows were afraid to admit that they were content with the result of the battle. This is a case in which I think payment should be made, but by the law does not appear to be the case. The militia company, all the volunteers declared that they were at the point, and although the militia was in order of enrolment or organization was apparently not in order. This matter has been dealt with only upon the due receipt of proofs.\nin large numbers, and drilled for a few days until the season opened. At the time of the Act I supposed I had not heard the proclamation, but my attention was drawn to it by the hon. member for Halifax (Mr. Tremblay); and the hon. member for Antigonish (Mr. Davidson) drew my attention to the fact that the Fenian raids were actually called out for active service. Every man, therefore, who was on the list before the proclamation that he turned out under that proclamation for active service, is, under the law, entitled to a bounty.\n\nMr. Maclean (Halifax).\u2014I would like to tell the hon. minister that this information was in his department years ago. It was once brought up in the House by a person most prominent in Nova Scotia in asking the government for the Canadian Bounty based upon claim. The hon. minister will find that the correspondence and records are in the hands of his department quite a number of years ago.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014We knew the proclamation when it came out, but we did not know that its terms were so general. These men have only to prove their claims under the law; they have been no charge to the regulations of the militia. The junior member for Halifax spoke of some questions which were asked by the hon. junior member last, and I now desire to read them and the answers thereto, from page 825 of Hansard:\n\n1. What is the interpretation of the Departmental instructions regarding the provisions of the Fenian Raid Volunteer Act, 1892, as to what services qualify a person for the bounty?\n\n2. If an enlisted volunteer of a militia regiment was called out for active service elsewhere than in Nova Scotia, did he undergo drill, but whose company or regiment was called out for active service elsewhere? In other words, does the Department consider such a man as having undergone drill?\n\n3. What is the departmental definition of \"active service\" as used in Section 2 of the Fenian Raid Volunteer Bounty Act?\n\n4. Mr. Hughes.\u2014The volunteer must have been enrolled in a corps called out for active service, and has been engaged in such corps during the period of a raid, in pursuance of the order of the Governor-in-Council.\n\n5. If the corps was called out for active service and the volunteer was engaged in connection with such calling out, yes; but the order for more ammunition, etc., or the order with regard to orders for active service does not count. Verification must be by declaration of applicant, and must be signed by him, and the name must appear on the service or pay roll, and the applicant must give satisfactory evidence must be given.\n\n6. Active service must have been performed in response to the order or proclamation which called out the corps for the purpose of repelling invasion.\n\nMr. Hughes (Victoria, Ont.)\n\nThese are the answers that were given on that occasion, and they are the identical answers we give today. No change has been made in the regulations. The hon. member for Antigonish (Mr. Davidson) has correctly interpreted them. The consideration of the subject involves the question of whether the Fenian raids were actual drill. The orders for the annual military must state explicitly that the men are ordered to attend drill and training, but when these officers and men were called out in 1869, there was no provision for active service, the object being to repel an invasion. Accordingly, under the law, any man as a volunteer, regardless of age and who can prove their case will be entitled to their bounty.\n\nMr. Macdonald.\u2014What about the 1870 men in Nova Scotia?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014If they were called out for active service, then of course they were not they are entitled to the bounty, but if they were called out for annual drill, they are not. So far as I know, there was no order issued in 1870 calling the men out for active service.\n\nMr. Macdonald.\u2014Your question, sir, is that the claimant is a bounty by reason of any claim based upon his action in 1870?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014I have never seen any proclamation issued in 1870 in Nova Scotia. Some reference has been made to very distant matters, but I am not prepared to say anything about them.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014I think 10,000 or 12,000.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014I understand that there are claims for bounty in the order in which they are received.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014Yes.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014In case a claim is rejected, does the department correspond with the party making the claim to that fact and the reasons on which the rejection is made?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014I understand so.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014Is the minister sure of that?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014The instructions are and to any knowledge the practice is in many cases to send out such information, because the men's friends can be heard against them.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014I myself filed a good many claims for my constituents. Some of those claims have been paid, some have not, and I have received no information whatever. They have not been paid complaining that they had no information whatever.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014If a hon. friend will be kind enough to ask me a question, I am sure that the officer in charge, Mr. Panet, will satisfy him in a few minutes. While it is not necessary to show lists, I have given\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014Much as we would like to see members of Parliament around the Militia Department, I am satisfied that they would gradually become convinced of the importance of this or that man was on the list, and we would require to increase our staff by five or six. The only compensation that we could make to the men, is that the man knows whether he was called out for active service or not, and should be called to prove his case. If he cannot prove it, and there are some who cannot, it affects the whole case. We will go as far as possible to assist him in proving his case. In many cases, where the men have been old men, very well able to attend to the matter for himself, we have written to him, telling him to see if he is on the list, and if he is not, then the man is justified in the claim he makes or if he is on the list, then he is entitled to the bounty. Now, we have performed annual drill. Now and then, I am sorry to say, there are found men who are not on the list, and then, I am sorry to say, they are not entitled to the bounty, but if they were called out for annual drill, they are not. So far as I know, there was no order issued in 1870 calling the men out for active service.\n\nMr. Macdonald.\u2014What about the 1870 men in Nova Scotia?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014If they were called out for active service, then of course they were not they are entitled to the bounty, but if they were called out for annual drill, they are not. So far as I know, there was no order issued in 1870 calling the men out for active service.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014I think 10,000 or 12,000.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014I understand that there are claims for bounty in the order in which they are received.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014Yes.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014In case a claim is rejected, does the department correspond with the party making the claim to that fact and the reasons on which the rejection is made?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014I understand so.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014Is the minister sure of that?\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014The instructions are and to any knowledge the practice is in many cases to send out such information, because the men's friends can be heard against them.\n\nMr. Beland.\u2014I myself filed a good many claims for my constituents. Some of those claims have been paid, some have not, and I have received no information whatever. They have not been paid complaining that they had no information whatever.\n\nMr. Hughes.\u2014If a hon. friend will be kind enough to ask me a question, I am sure that the officer in charge, Mr. Panet, will satisfy him in a few minutes. While it is not necessary to show lists, I have given\nWoodstock. I believe that the Charlotte county militia, around St. Stephen's and St. Andrews, was called out in response to the threat. At the same time that those three or four corps were actually taken to St. Andrews there were corps in New Brunswick under arms performing their drill. I do not say that they were called out by the Governor of New Brunswick, but they were called out by some proper authorities to go under arms every year. By an accident perhaps, the militia of Nova Scotia answered the call of the ordinary militia men does not know the difference. The ordinary militia men from Nova Scotia answered the call of the proper authorities to go under arms, just as the militia of New Brunswick did, and the militia of Nova Scotia, and were possibly left out as regards Nova Scotia. That is to say, he has created a condition of things which is not fair and which was not the intention when this legislation was passed. I think that the Minister was actuated by proper motives, and that he did not intend to create a condition of things which would be contrary to the spirit of the Act. I do not think it is too late to remedy the difficulty or to introduce during this session an amendment to the Act so that all persons are entitled to participate in this bounty. There is no use of the hon. member for Hamilton saying that he would be willing to pass a law, he would be willing to enforce it. We know that it has been done, and we say that it is on this side of the House, or on the other side, for that matter, an attempt to introduce legislation to this end without the consent of the minister. The only way we can have this matter dealt with is to have the minister agree to it. I know that if the minister introduced a Bill it is pretty certain to be carried by the Government, and therefore I am sure that the minister will agree to it. It is a question about the minister's credit. If he does not agree to it, he will lose his credit. Therefore, I think my hon. friend the minister must take the responsibility of saying whether this law gives the authority provides for any volunteer who was, particularly called or enlisted in and served with any militia corps which the Government of Canada, or the Government of Nova Scotia, called out for active service in the year, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, or any militia corps of Canada called out for active service in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy.\n\nThe only people who were called out in 1870 and who are entitled to participate in this bounty are those who were called out by the Government of Canada and not by the Governor of Nova Scotia, or by the Governor of New Brunswick, so that I think we can dismiss that branch of the matter, so far as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are concerned.\n\nSome question has arisen as to the difficulties connected with the Act. I quite appreciate that. I can well understand the minister having plenty of difficulties. No doubt there was a man in this province whose conscience permits him to make statements which are not true, and which ought not to be regarded as being not exactly true. But I think the minister has tried to meet every difficulty and has tried to maintain his credit. So far as my province is concerned, I do not think that any great attention has been paid to matters connected with the passage of the Act last June, an old military law which had been repealed, and the entire control and enforcement of the Act in New Brunswick, but he was not mistaken in doing what he thought best for his province, and I found that I was able to set replies to my allegations, and we were treated just as if we were in Texas. It also seems to me that he has given credit where it is due, or has not given credit where it is not due. Therefore, I think my hon. friend the minister must take the responsibility of saying whether this law gives the authority provides for any volunteer who was, particularly called or enlisted in and served with any militia corps which the Government of Canada, or the Government of Nova Scotia, called out for active service in the year, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, or any militia corps of Canada called out for active service in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy.\n\nMr. HUGHES (Minister of Militia): All get it.\n\nMr. CARVELL: The hon. member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker), seems to be able to give evidence in which they cannot get it, and the hon. member for Perth also points out some cases where the men who are entitled to participation in the bounty to a far greater extent than the ordinary militia men of Nova Scotia who answered the call to perform their annual drill.\n\nMr. HUGHES: My hon. friend says annual drill.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Yes.\n\nMr. HUGHES: I agree with him.\n\nMr. CARVELL: I see the distinction, and I venture to say that in the province of Nova Scotia there was not one militiaman out of one hundred who knew the difference between being called out annually and being called out to active service. Since this discussion started this evening, hon. members have informed me that in a great many cases when the militia are called out in Nova Scotia they are called out for active service. I do not know that that is what I am told. The point is that the ordinary militia man does not know the difference. The ordinary militia man from Nova Scotia answered the call of the proper authorities to go under arms, just as the militia of New Brunswick did, and the militia of Nova Scotia, and were possibly left out as regards Nova Scotia. That is to say, he has created a condition of things which is not fair and which was not the intention when this legislation was passed. I think that the Minister was actuated by proper motives, and that he did not intend to create a condition of things which would be contrary to the spirit of the Act.

As I have stated, I have received letters and communications stating that vessels had left on a particular date for the northern parts of the province of Nova Scotia, and therefore the Government at that time called out all the militia of the province to man the forts in every part of the province. They turned out on the morning of the 17th all over the place. Just as the clansmen of the Highlands of Scotland used to turn out in response to the call of the Great Chieftain of Nova Scotia rallied at once to repel the invader. I just mention that in passing.\n\nMr. LAWRENCE JAMESON (Dartmouth): I may also state in connection with the hon. member for Carleton, New Brunswick, (Mr. Barker) that the militia of Nova Scotia knew, at the time they were called out in 1869, whether they were called out for the purpose of repelling invasion or not. At that time, as I have been informed by those who participated in the movement, they knew that throughout the province of Nova Scotia that there was an invasion going on, and that it was expected by privateers and vessels which were being fitted out in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the idea of having to repel an enemy. They were for a number of weeks under arms at almost every town and in the country that I have the honour to represent in this House, and they were very active in making the necessary preparations to repel the expected invaders.\n\nMr. CARVELL: The hon. gentleman say that he had failed to find that, in so far as his experience went, there had been any difficulties in connection with the Militia Department in regard to this particular matter. I may say that the hon. member on the other side of the House who preceded him, however, seemed to think that there had been some difficulties in connection with it, so far as Conservative members were concerned. I think that perhaps there is some slight misunderstanding on the part of hon. gentlemen opposite in regard to the position of hon. members from Nova Scotia upon\nthis side of the House with respect to this matter. That is to say when this proclamation of the 17th of March, 1866, was rediscoveered, it became necessary, in the opinion of some members on this side of the House, who had consulted together, to have a special form of application made out for the purpose of obtaining the signatures which resulted from the form of proclamation of the Governor of Nova Scotia. I think that in fact that this was necessary, it was not unnatural that, in consequence of the circumstances which were interested in this matter, we should have desired to lay before the department what form was available and that we should send them a draft of this form of application.\n\nMr. JAMESON: The hon. member has said that he thinks there should be and one set of regulations and one form of application. I might point out to him that it is impossible there should be only one form of application because the circumstances were different in Nova Scotia from what they were in New Brunswick. We have here a proclamation calling out the militia for active service in New Brunswick, whereas there was none in Nova Scotia. We have here a proclamation calling out the militia for active service in New Brunswick, whereas there was none in Nova Scotia. We have here a proclamation calling out the militia for active service in New Brunswick, whereas there was none in Nova Scotia.\n\nMr. CARROLL: I did not say that there was no such call in New Brunswick. I said that I have no knowledge of it. It seems to me a whole thing is thrown into mystery to some extent. We know that the militiamen were out and ordered their departure or their return but whether they were called out or not, we do not know.\n\nMr. JAMESON: In Ontario, at all events, I understand that the hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker), who spoke a few moments ago, that there was no proclamation calling out the militia.\n\nMr. MACKENZIE: The hon. member refers to me as speaking about the uniform regulations.\n\nMr. JAMESON: It was the hon. member for Cape Breton, South (Mr. Carroll) referred to.\n\nMr. MACKENZIE: I said the same thing and I am sure the hon. member will agree with myself. I sent to the department for a form two or three days ago, and I received the form which is entirely different from the form that has been prepared for the province. I cannot understand why the latter form should not have been sent to me in order that I may make application in my province. I was given the old, or rather the new, and was given the old, or rather the new, which was made to comply with the declaration of the Governor.\n\nMr. JAMESON.\n\nof the 15th of March 1866. That is what I thought should be regulated as far as the province of Nova Scotia is concerned.\n\nMr. JAMESON: The form which I have sent on has been approved by the military authorities on this side of the House. It was drafted by our own members from the department. It is true that it contained only the allegations which were made in the case that they did not conform to the proclamation issued by the Governor in 1866.\n\nMr. SINCLAIR: May I ask the hon. member if the form which was drafted by hon. gentlemen opposite will be acceptable to the department if used?\n\nMr. JAMESON: I have no reason to suppose that the form which I have submitted contains all the necessary facts and proves the claim. It will be rejected unless it does. If it does not, the claim returned and decided under the new form. The form included in the original petition can still be essential of the form that the department has given out and it includes the allegations which were made in order to show that these people claimed to have been out on active service. We have here a proclamation of the Governor of 1866.\n\nMy hon. friend from Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) said that hon. members on this side of the House were unwilling to make any statement out of this matter. I would be sorry to think that there should be any impression of that sort. As far as I am concerned, I have studied very closely everything which might be considered. The first person whom I examined was a claim which was paid to Major John Daley, who was for thirty years the chief of the Fenian organization in the county. He was a very active opponent of mine in the last election and I never vote for me, or any other Conservative candidate. Yet, he was the first person whom I examined. I might point out to the hon. member that I have been very careful not to introduce politics into this matter, that it is not so very long ago that they were in charge of the political affairs of this country, and that it is a matter of regret that the Conservative party when in opposition, to the effect that this relief or some compensation was given to the survivors of the Fenian raid.\n\nMr. MACDONALD: An certain hon. gentlemen have given a wrong impression to Nova Scotia as to who were entitled to receive this money. I asked the military authorities for a statement as to who were and who were not.\n\nMr. JAMESON: I am glad that my hon. friend will limit his criticism to that. If that is the only criticism he has, I have no fault to find with him whatever. But I do not think, taking the circumstances as they have been in my county and as far as I know, that there was anything to prevent the money legally from the government, and therefore I am able to obtain it for them. We studied the records, and we found that we could make our case good.\n\nIn the course of which we consulted the officials of the department. They were of the opinion that the men of Nova Scotia were not qualified, because they had not been called out for active service. Later on, however, they told us that even though the Nova Scotia militia had been called out for active service by a royal warrant, they could not get that information, we went to work to make it as public as possible. We have done our best to get the matter into the matter. The hon. gentleman from Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) has been very careful to address himself to his constituents. I defy him to find there a single line which shows that he has been doing anything in politics in any way. Had I wished to make political capital out of this matter, I could have pointed out to my constituents in Annandale that this matter was due to the efforts of the Liberal-Conservative party and deprived the hon. members on the other side of the House.\n\nMr. MACDONALD: Who opposed this last year?\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: I was referring to the Parliament of 1871, when the same principle was involved, when hon. gentlemen opposite came in to put forward an amendment of this kind and refused to do so, but voted down a resolution proposed by members of the then Opposition.\n\nMr. MACDONALD: You said we opposed the Act.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: Opposed the principle of the Act.\n\nMr. SINCLAIR: We did not oppose the principle of the Act.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: My hon. friend from Pictou is altogether too suspicious. He ought to be ashamed of himself on this side of the House. We have still got to learn the American Bank Act in the same manner as the hon. member opposite for our model. During the time that he has sat in this House he has not turned to political account. The Department of the Interior has nothing to do with the children of Canada. Hon. gentlemen are aware that any school child or any person can apply for that atlas and get\nMr. MACDONALD: Will my hon. friend have the kindness to read the letter if he has it?\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: I did not regard the letter as valuable enough to treasure.\n\nMr. MACDONALD: You are speaking from a very bad memory.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: Will my hon. friend deny that such a letter addressed to school children of Pictou, due to his efforts, they could obtain such an attestation from the Department of the Interior.\n\nMr. MACDONALD: If my hon. friend wants information, why not write to the press in the county of Pictou stating that school trustees in that county had made a complaint to the department. They did apply. Many hon. gentlemen, myself included, who have sat on the other side of the House, have done the same thing. My hon. friend from North Ontario (Mr. Sharpe) probably did so himself.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: My hon. friend said that it was due to his efforts as member for Pictou that certain party policies were not introduced into the Militia Department in the days of old. I have never been a member of the House, and I think the records will show that I have done the hon. gentleman's work. He thinks that there is a construction of what he said was that he wanted to find out if there was any pay-lists. I thought that he could refer, so that he could tell his constituents whether it was safe for them to rely upon the commission. The hon. lieutenant wants to know whether there were pay-lists. He is anxious to ascertain that fact.\n\nMr. DAVIDSON: It may be wrong, but I am sure the hon. member for House, and I think the records will show that I have done the hon. gentleman's work.

It is one thing to try being a good teacher of Indian children, but to chase an cracker; it is quite another thing to lead Indians into boarding schools, where they forget their knowledge. After two bills were rendered you this year, your department made a provision for the board of trustees of the institution to purchase land at the cost of the state. I thought this an admirable scheme, but after looking up what quantity was considered allowable, but it is evident that it is opposite. As far as this matters paid to this part of the program, while the board thought best, let us imagine what opinion the true educationist were gasping the fourth place I must say that among many of the whites constituting the community Miss Devereux makes teaching hours regarded as a joke. Her beading hours is that she is active in that school but she is not shown in how much of her work was done by her. She is known to have left her head dressing before the school opened, she often stay out all day and departs that she makes dragging her feet even down the streets. She is known to speak only few words of her own language, when she was sent to school the same year, her father was educated in Europe where he had learned to read. Now, since I began to make inquiries, I have found that Miss Devereux made in her first six months there, that she taught from the third to tenth grade, but no preparations were made that for only one month did she keep proper fasting for many hours and each week she could go home. She has returned school standards and teaching hours, all the whites constituting the community would regard as a joke. Her teaching hours is that she was recommended to teach Indians because she spoke their language. My experience inadequate is that my experience with Miss Devereux shows that she is not able to teach Indians effectively. I find her unwillingness to work properly, and her attitude towards her students' work, which revealed herself in the manner in which she treated her pupils, in particular when she punished them for misbehavior. The Indians are given insufficient food and the rooms are often very hot.\n\nThat measure was conceived by Miss Devereux to take care of the children until such time as they could be placed in suitable homes. The proposal was approved by the Board of Trustees at a meeting held on January 14th, 1932. At about noon Miss Devereux informed me that she would be unable to attend the meeting due to illness. I then instructed her to appear before the Board again on the following day and presented the matter to the trustees. They agreed to approve her request and she was released from her duties effective immediately.\n\nMr. KYTHE.\n\nRev. R. L. Harrodchurch.\nIndian Agent.\n\nYou will observe Mr. Speaker, that the child spoke against this most dear and well known friend, who ever watched the child with maternal fondness, often crying and shrieking over her childhood wrongs. She repeatedly came to my house to see him, but I always fasted him that it would make matters worse. I could not persuade her to believe that he had been ill for several days, that his long sickness was due to the excessive. Her malicious spirit, which has brought her such happiness during these weeks, I can hardly believe is real enough. Having heard such slandered her, I have more reason than ever to believe that there will never cease being many victims of defamed reputations. With these words, Miss Devereux continued to speak highly of Mr. Kent and the late Mr. Harrison, both esteemed friends, and strongly condemned the present administration of the school. To do this was very kind, for now I know that they thought of me as much as of any other person except for the fact that I knew them not so well as I should have liked. They did not like me then or ever, but I am sure that now they would have liked me better. For instance, Mr. Hull was asked for a statement against us but he refused to sign it. And there wasn't any one who would sign it, but Mr. Anderson, and he did it because of his warfare with Mr. Cantwell, who had previously made him believe him too weak to do anything of importance. So Mr. Anderson could not fight back while Mr. Kent helped him fight.\n\nNow, Mr. Speaker, I have obtained from Miss Devereux's former board-pupil, Mrs. Smith, an affidavit that she will declare in the House of Assembly for the purpose of ascertaining what respect the situation has actually been made. This affidavit states that, in December, 1874, she visited the school, where she knew Miss Devereux for thirty-four days, and that she spoke highly of her then as she does now. But there are also three letters written by Mr. Specter, a former student of Miss Devereux's, dated May, July and September, 1875, wherein he refers to Miss Devereux with great kindness and esteem. Also she had had the privilege of hearing from Miss Devereux's former friends, Mrs. Brown and Mr. Chappell, who gave the most excellent recommendations regarding Miss Devereux. They all spoke highly of her kindness and patience, and of the way she conducted herself as a teacher.\n\nIn the matter of the dismissal of Charlotte M. Devereux, the agent of the Indian school at Salmon River Reserve, Richmond county, N.S., I have been asked to obtain, from the charity many of the whites constituting the community, some information about Miss Devereux from reliable sources. I have been assured by Miss Henrietta Cameron, the teacher who succeeded Miss Devereux, that Miss Devereux discontinued her regular attendance at the school on June 24th, 1902, without any reason assigned for why she did not attend. Miss Henrietta Cameron, St. Peters, declared before me today that Charlotte M. Devereux was our teacher for two years prior to 1902 and that we missed her by her own wish.\n\nIn the matter of the dismissal of Charlotte M. Devereux, the agent of the Indian school at Salmon River Reserve, Richmond county, N.S., I have been asked to obtain some information about Miss Devereux from reliable sources. I have been assured by Miss Henrietta Cameron, the teacher who succeeded Miss Devereux, that Miss Devereux discontinued her regular attendance at the school on June 24th, 1902, without any reason assigned for why she did not attend. Miss Henrietta Cameron, St. Peters, declared before me today that Charlotte M. Devereux was our teacher for two years prior to 1902 and that we missed her by her own wish.\n\nIn the matter of the voluntarily dismissal of Charlotte M. Devereux, Hearty agent of the Indian school situated at Salmon River Reserve, Richmond county, N.S., I have been requested to research and discover what it contained. That he then terminated his services with Miss Devereux. I was told that he had gone back to England for the winter, and that Miss Devereux had been dismissed. Since that date, I have heard nothing further regarding Miss Devereux or the school.\n\nThe original source document contains a detailed account of the instruction given at the school at Salmon River Reserve between 1874-75, including the names and ages of those attending.\nI have here a letter written by the department on October 31st in which he forwards me by Miss Deveroux stating that she had learned from the Indian agent that the school was doing well and that she could not be dismissed in order to save her reputation from being harmed by the fact of her being dismissed. The letter is as follows:\n\nOttawa, October 3, 1912.\n\nMadam,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo I beg to inform you that the department has no intention of dispensing with your services as teacher of the Salmon River Indian School. If you are satisfied, I may state, however, for your information that Mr. Agent MacNeil has been instructed to make such arrangements with you conduct your school and I can assure you that you will not be dismissed without your consent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Charlotte M. Deveroux received the following:\n\nMadam,\u2014I have to inform you that it has been decided to dispense with your services at the end of the present quarter, December 31, 1912. You will therefore be required to leave the school to be opened at 9 A.M. and it has been shown conclusively that you are not competent to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThat completes the documents which I have, but I have here under my hand the last annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs, in which Miss Deveroux's competence and success as a teacher is commented upon, not only by Mr. J. D. McLean, but also by Mr. Scott, in his report of the Salmon River school says:\n\nMiss O'Toole who conducted the school during the summer of 1911, resigned in December of last year and Miss Deveroux was appointed to take her place. Miss Deveroux is a holder of a second-class certificate and is meeting with success in her work. She also assists in the girls' class.\n\nHere is the report of Mr. A. J. Boyd:\n\nIt seems to be no easy matter to get good teachers now for any of our Indian schools. While, at one time Indian schools were in favour with the majority of our teaching profession, the Department of Indian Affairs is conducting an ill-conceived policy. The reason of the teacher at present employed there not being qualified. I have here the reply of the department to Mr. J. D. McLean's letter:\n\nSir,\u2014Your letter of reference to Indian schools has been lying on my desk so long unanswered that I owe you an explanation.\n\nA good many years ago, I visited the school at Truro, Sydney, Bear River, New Germany, and New Glasgow. In each case I found that I had little or no influence over them or control over their management. In recent years, I was under the impression that the schools were doing the necessary inspection.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the department. Recommendations for the appointments of teachers must be made by the proper inspectors, as stated above; final decision rests with this department.\n\nWith regard to the discharge of Miss Deveroux, I beg to state that the action was taken by the department on a report made by its agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. J. T. Macneill,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S., Dec. 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\u2014I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the inspection of the Salmon River Indian School. In reply I beg to say that the department does not have any schools inspected by you under the arrangement specified with the Department of Education of Nova Scotia. In reply to your statement that you say that the duty of the public school inspector is to inspect the schools, I beg to say that your letter to me of June 29 last, report fully upon the condition of the building, the teacher and condition of the building, &c., under your charge. It is not within my purview to make recommendations regarding the purpose, a supply of which is being sent you. While the teacher is not directly responsible for the management of the school, the school is conducted and managed solely by the teacher. It is the duty of the teacher to carry out the instructions of the Inspector of Schools, and to see that the management of the school, and any failure to do so will result in a report to the department.\n\nWith regard to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the department.\nNova Scotia, I would strongly urge the selection of ladies who possess the necessary qualifications.\n\nYou will observe, Mr. Speaker, that one of the complaints made against the Indian school was that Miss Devereux was a lady teacher, and it is said that the man teachers were very much more successful than female teachers. I have before me a qualified teacher Miss Devereux having a Normal school diploma, by common consent, and she has had other qualifications, namely, professional training. The agent refers to the fact that one of the captains of his band recommended the dismissal of Miss Devereux, and that he wanted a man. It would appear from the report of the agent that the Department of the Interior is to be set aside upon the suggestion of one man, and that he is to be guided by the fact that the well-qualified and highly paid Superintendent of Education of the Indian Department was not willing to accept and experienced Superintendent Indian Agencies in the Maritime provinces, both recommended Miss Devereux on account of her superior training and all the success which had attended her conduct of the school. I have not much fault to find with the Department of the Interior, but I do think there ought to be no criticism to make against the hon. gentlemen who is in charge of the Department of Indian Affairs. I do not believe that an inquiry as to the truth or not the decisions made against Miss Devereux in the agent's report were well founded. Had that been done, an opportunity might have been given to bring before the commissioner appointed to investigate the charges brought against Miss Devereux to determine whether or not Miss Devereux's conduct of the school was a success. The commissions have been issued authorizing the summoning before him the inspector of schools for the county of Richmond who testified that the school was run under qualifications of Miss Devereux I have read here this evening. He would have been able to support Mr. Hayes, the superintendent of Indian agencies for the Maritime provinces, in his statement of the opportunity of learning that the young man who was appointed to take the place of Miss Devereux was dismissed and therefore ought not to be employed by the department. However, an inquiry was not made against the minister of the Interior, who is here to-night to give this matter his serious consideration and to see that justice is richly rendered that has been perpetrated upon Miss Devereux. The letter which I have before me indicates that Miss Devereux is an orphan that is true. Her father and mother are both dead, and she has no immediate relatives to whom she can apply for succour should she be unable to obtain other employment. According to the statement made by Miss Devereux in her statutory declaration, she was dismissed, or at all events her dismissal was still uncertain, because her relatives were all Liberals. I stated a moment ago that her father is said to have been a Liberal although dead, and she has no brothers who ever polled a vote up to the time this report was written, nor any nearest relative, Miss Devereux, who ever polled a vote, and they lives are her second concern, and I can say from personal knowledge that the majority of votes cast recently for the Conservative party and not for the Liberal party. I believe that the Department of the Interior would knowingly dismiss Miss Devereux because her relatives were all Liberals. I believe that Miss Devereux is better than I believe they are capable of going, I have some knowledge of the prejudices that exist in Nova Scotia, and that during the last fifteen months with regard to dismissing Miss Devereux, and I do not believe now that they would be disposed to dismiss her merely because her relatives happen to be Liberals. Miss Devereux was dismissed at a time when the public schools were all taken up for the school year, and the school year begins on the 1st September and ends on the 31st July. Any teacher who runs a school in the town of New Waterford who does not apply for one at the beginning of the term, is liable to be without employment during the whole of that term. Miss Devereux was dismissed about the 1st January, as far as I could learn, and the schools in Nova Scotia are closed to her. She cannot get any position that is worth having except in the town of New Waterford in Nova Scotia, owing to the fact that all the good schools were taken up for the year, and she could not get a position that she could be dismissed because her relatives were all Liberals, according to the information given me by the minister of the Interior, she was dismissed upon the recommendation of Mr. J. A. Gilles, and of the Indian agent.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: Do you say that he told her that she was dismissed because her relatives were Liberals?\n\nMr. KYTE: That is the effect of it. She made her statutory declaration that that was the effect of what he told her. I stated a moment ago that I refused to be put into a position where the injustice which she was dismissed. I am somewhat familiar with the length to which the minister will go to secure the dismissal of a liberal official, but I refuse to believe that he would go to such a length to secure the dismissal of an orphan girl still uncertain of the result of her election. I have heard that the minister has been very active in this matter, and he has no brothers who ever polled a vote up to the time this report was written.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: Are we to believe that the minister, Father R. L. Macdonald, parish priest, entered into a conspiracy with Mr. Joseph A. Gilles to secure the dismissal of Miss Devereux? Is that the substance of the charge.\n\nMr. CARVELL: It looks very much like it.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: The hon. gentleman (Mr. Carvell) says it looks very much like it. Why do you not come out in the open and charge Mr. Father Macdonald with having been guilty of that crime?\n\nMr. KYTE: I have read his report; I have read the evidence that the House drew its own conclusion.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: I am going to read some of it, too. I am informed that the minister had an opportunity in the Department of the Interior to read the whole of this file which is in my hand, and he has for some purpose declined to read some of the important parts of it. As a matter of fact, Mr. Joseph A. Gilles is the minister whose influence this young lady, Miss Devereux, was apparently in this affair.\n\nMr. K.A.: That is possibly true.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: I understand that a young lady named Miss O'Toole who, I understand, was engaged to be married to a man named Cameron, taught that school in 1911 and that, on behalf of her friend, Mr. Joseph A. Gilles, wrote to Mr. Gilles. She had resigned herself and she was writing to Mr. Gilles on behalf of her friend. This was answered that Mr. Gilles sent to Miss O'Toole on the 8th December, 1911, that her friend very respectfully declined to read.\n\nMr. KYTE: I had no opportunity to read anything. If I had had the minister's report, and his minister was good enough to let me have it.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: I was informed that this file was placed at the disposal of my friend in the Department of the Interior and that he had an opportunity of looking through the same file.\n\nMr. KYTE: I had not. I was given an opportunity of looking at the report of the Indian agent. I did not ask for another report, but I thought that I might read them. I did ask for the letter that work in connection with this school from political influences which influence the Indian agent. Who is the Indian agent? The Indian agent is the Rev. Father R. L. Macdonald, parish priest, of whose church the young lady is a member.\n\nMr. KYTE: And of whose church I am a member.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: Are we to believe that the minister, Father R. L. Macdonald, parish priest, entered into a conspiracy with Mr. Joseph A. Gilles to secure the dismissal of Miss Devereux? Is that the substance of the charge.\n\nMr. CARVELL: It looks very much like it.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: The hon. gentleman (Mr. Carvell) says it looks very much like it. Why do you not come out in the open and charge Mr. Father Macdonald with having been guilty of that crime?\n\nMr. KYTE: I have read his report; I have read the evidence that the House drew its own conclusion.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: I am going to read some of it, too. I am informed that the minister had an opportunity in the Department of the Interior to read the whole of this file which is in my hand, and he has for some purpose declined to read some of the important parts of it. As a matter of fact, Mr. Joseph A. Gilles is the minister whose influence this young lady, Miss Devereux, was apparently in this affair.\n\nMr. K.A.: That is possibly true.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: I understand that a young lady named Miss O'Toole who, I understand, was engaged to be married to a man named Cameron, taught that school in 1911 and that, on behalf of her friend, Mr. Joseph A. Gilles, wrote to Mr. Gilles. She had resigned herself and she was writing to Mr. Gilles on behalf of her friend. This was answered that Mr. Gilles sent to Miss O'Toole on the 8th December, 1911, that her friend very respectfully declined to read.\n\nMr. KYTE: I had no opportunity to read anything. If I had had the minister's report, and his minister was good enough to let me have it.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: I was informed that this file was placed at the disposal of my friend in the Department of the Interior and that he had an opportunity of looking through the same file.\n\nMr. KYTE: I had not. I was given an opportunity of looking at the report of the Indian agent. I did not ask for another report, but I thought that I might read them. I did ask for the letter that\nMr. KYTE: Why not ascertain the facts by the investigation I asked for?\n\nMr. CROTHERS: The hon. gentleman did not ask me the investigation shall after the hon. member said that her services had been dispensed with.\n\nMr. KYTE: What was the date?\n\nMr. CROTHERS: The hon. gentleman wrote on the 5th of December, and she was notified on the 3rd of December.\n\nMr. KYTE: Did the minister\u2014\n\nMr. SPEAKER: The hon. member had approached to speak, and when the minister is on his feet, it is not permissible to interrupt.\n\nMr. TURRIFF: The minister asked him a question.\n\nMr. CROTHERS (reading): I find that necessary sympathy between parents and teacher continues by its absence.\n\nIs that statement true or false? If it is true, that would be the teacher's dismissal; if it is not true you have a charge against a man who has been there for years, and even more than that, and amongst all of all who know him, as I am advised.\n\nIt is one thing to say we show good attendance by keeping our clocks and crackers.\n\nI was surprised to find that it was the custom there to provide the Indian children with lunch.\n\nMr. KYTE: It is the custom in all the Indian schools in Nova Scotia and has been for twenty years.\n\nMr. TURRIFF: I never heard of it before. I have no doubt you could get a good attendance for a short time each day by having crackers and crackers.\n\nIt is quite another thing to lead Indian children along the flattery paths of knowledge.\n\nAfter the school closed at this point your department brought to my notice through the Indians that this book was purchased, at least at one time. I was never advised that the book was purchased, but it is evident that quite a considerable attention was paid to this book. It is one of those things more necessary in the opinion of the true educationists.\n\nIn the fourth place I must say that among many of the whites sentiment is the reverse.\n\nThe evidence does not come from the Indians alone.\n\nMiss Devereux's teaching and teaching hours are not kept as a joke.\n\nIs the true, or false? It comes from the white people who are looking on.\n\nHer boarding house is three quarters of a mile from the school. She is known to have left her boarding house as late as 9.29 a.m., call at the post office after that, and often go to another house which she may call Mr. A's on her way to school. In fact she spent so much of her time at Mr. A's that when she did come to her own place she was the white people that the Indian school would be closed. The evening Mrs. A. very likely would.\n\nNow, since I began these inquiries, the Indians have begun to school me that only one month did she keep proper school.\n\nShe began the 1st of January and this report was made on the 4th of November.\n\nI furnished her with circulars, Indian Day School Department, as soon as I knew she had the school hours to be kept before her there in black and white, but what was the result? She did not keep them, I found out afterwards, and the teacher was not there. On the 2nd of December she was not there.\n\nThis next hearsay. Is there a gentleman within the sound of my voice who is more prepared to believe the statements of Miss Devereux than the Rev. Mr. Gillies? Does he tell her she was not to begin school before ten o'clock? Did he purposely visit the school two or three hours later? This would not be there, according to the declaration she have had, but then she could not have been there.\n\nOn another occasion after 10 a.m., she was not in school. Her excuse on the 29th October was that she could not get the clocks in Burin Hall.\n\nThe Rev. Father Macdonald telling the truth, he says that on the 29th October she had told him, what\u2014that he had told her she need not be there before ten o'clock, but that she could not get all the clocks were wrong. Is he telling the truth or is he putting words into Miss Devereux's mouth, which is not true? First from the very calling of the Rev. Father Macdonald, who has such high character I hear of him, and from what he has put in writing, a cheque for $200, which in preference to any statutory declaration gotten up and read before this House.\n\nThis held no water. The 28th was Thanksgiving, and the Rev. Father Macdonald seems very determined to use every possible means to blocken the character of Mr. Gillies. I have read from Mr. Gillies' letter to Miss O'Neil, where she appeared to him on behalf of his friend Miss Devereux, and it is there stated that Mr. Gillies was not actually in any political matters. It should be remembered that nothing was overlooked in that letter, as Miss O'Neil's letter to Mr. Gillies, and her letter to Gillies. The writing of that letter on the part of Mr. Gillies does him great credit, and I believe that he has exercised any political influence to get rid of this young lady. I do not believe any man in this House will entertain such ideas; it is inconsistent with the letter he wrote in the first instance.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Have I not the right to ask a question, if the minister is willing to answer it?\n\nMr. SPEAKER: No, I think not. If I recollect the rule correctly, it states that when a member is speaking, no member shall interrupt him except to a point of order.\n\nMr. TURRIFF: Will you apply the same rule to members of the other side of the House if they ask questions of hon. gentlemen on this side when they are speaking?\n\nMr. SPEAKER: Order.\n\nMr. TURRIFF: It will never do\u2014\n\nMr. SPEAKER: The hon. member has no right to reflect upon the Chair.\n\nMr. TURRIFF: The Chair should do what it ought.\n\nMr. SPEAKER: Order.\n\nMr. CROTHERS: The whole matter was reported upon by the deputy superintendent of Indian Affairs, Mr. Pedley, but the report has not yet been placed before the House. The action taken by the department in dispensing with Miss Devereux's services was based upon the report made by the Indian Agent at the request of the department, and I think on consideration of the circumstances from the time of Mr. Gillies' first recommendation that this young lady until now services were dispensed with on the strength of the report of the Indian agent.\n\nI have read from Mr. Gillies' letter to Miss O'Neil, where she appeared to him on behalf of his friend Miss Devereux, and it is there stated that Mr. Gillies was not actually in any political matters. It should be remembered that nothing was overlooked in that letter, as Miss O'Neil's letter to Mr. Gillies, and her letter to Gillies. The writing of that letter on the part of Mr. Gillies does him great credit, and I believe that he has exercised any political influence to get rid of this young lady. I do not believe any man in this House will entertain such ideas; it is inconsistent with the letter he wrote in the first instance.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Have the Minister now presented the letter written to the department which caused them to ask the Indian agent for this report?\n\nMr. SPEAKER: The hon. member has already spoken on the motion before the House that the Speaker leave the Chair.\n\nMr. KYTE: Just a moment\u2014\nMr. SPEAKER: The hon. member has already spoken.\n\nMr. KYTE: When I rose to put some questions to the hon. minister your Honour told me I was not in order, but I would insist except that Your Honour informed me that I should have the right to reply.\n\nMr. SPEAKER: The hon. member is entirely mistaken; I made no such statement.\n\nMr. KYTE: I simply wanted to make an explanation with reference to the date of my letter to the Minister of Agriculture. The minister stated that it was too late to have an investigation, inasmuch as the letter had been received late December. My question was on December 4th and the answer I received from the minister indicated that communications had been received from Mr. Smith regarding complaints against her. There was no indication that she could be dismissed, but if she had been dismissed we are not without precedent of inquiries being made into the truth of charges even after officials have been dismissed.\n\nMotion agreed to.\n\nSUPPLY.\n\nHouse in Committee of Supply. (Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair.)\n\nCivil Government\u2014officers of the Conservation Commission. (See series 128-860-36.)\n\nMr. BORDEN: When this item was up the other evening I proposed to bring down information to the worthy of the Commis-\n\nsion. With the permission of the House, I shall hand in a statement which has been prepared.\n\nWork of the Commission of Conservation in 1912.\n\nA review of the work of the Commission of Conservation must necessarily be a fragmentary statement; its functions are wholly investigatory and advisory. It does not appear to be necessary to mention the services of our inspectors to protect men engaged in mining operations, nor the services of our engineers to carry out public health regulations, nor the services of our inspectors to grade grain, nor officials to administer fishing regulations, nor the care and supervision of methods of protecting the forests, methods of preventing loss of fish in the lakes, methods of preserving and preventing the spread and dissemination of dangerous pests, methods of controlling water-powers, and methods of increasing the yield of the fisheries. All these matters are, at the same time, conserving the fertility of the soil.\n\nMr. KYTE:\n\nIf the commission undertook administrative work, it would be impossible for any administrator to stand aloof and occupy the position of impartial critic, it would be impossible for any administrator to subject without being hampered by any administrative acts of its own or of any allied body.\n\nTo get a comprehensive view of the work of the commission, it is necessary to review the work that is being carried on under the various divisions.\n\nCommittee on Lands.\n\nThe agricultural survey was continued throughout Canada on thirteen counties in order to secure an accurate diagnosis of agricultural conditions. The results of these surveys will be published during the present year.\n\nCommittee on Fisheries.\n\nIn Peterborough and Hastings counties an investigation of forest conditions has been carried on under the direction of Dr. B. E. Fenton. This work has been conducted on a large area of cut-over territory, and the results indicate that there is a great extent of reforestation which is possible, and to what extent reforestation of such territory can be profitably put.\n\nThe report of a forest survey of Nova Scotia conducted under the direction of Dr. Fenton, at the expense of the province, has been published.\n\nAn investigation of forest revenue and taxation was carried on in British Columbia to determine what extent existing methods of taxation are sufficient to provide adequate private owners. Taxation in the United States has been investigated for comparison, but no attempt has hitherto been made to ascertain its effect in Canada.\n\nCommittee on Mines.\n\nThe investigation conducted last year in the province of western Canada, to ascertain the possibilities of the utilization of by-products and the safety of the mines, was extended this year to the coal mines of eastern Canada. Mr. Duff, who has been engaged in this work, visited all the principal coal mines, coal-burning plants, and coal-burning plants in New Brunswick during past summer. The results of these investigations are now being embodied in a report which will be available for publication early in 1913.\n\nA report on the mining industry in Canada has been printed. Until recently, whether the establishment of mine rescue stations. The report was based upon the experience gained in organizing this work. A protective force was organized in the northern provinces, and has done effective service. Although the experience of only one summer, the railway companies are anxious to acquire the measures of fire prevention. While conserving a great natural resource, they do not interfere with the operation of the railways while preserving what must always be considered the first duty of the railway.\n\nTo avoid any clashing or overlapping of interests, the work of the commission should, upon recommendation by the department of the Interior, be appointed assistant fire inspectors with authority to carry out the provisions of the Railway Commissioner's regulations, the chief fire inspector giving a special supervision to the railway companies.\n\nIn Peterborough and Hastings counties an investigation of forest conditions has been carried on under the direction of Dr. B. E. Fenton. This work has been conducted on a large area of cut-over territory, and the results indicate that there is a great extent of reforestation which is possible, and to what extent reforestation of such territory can be profitably put.\n\nThe report of a forest survey of Nova Scotia conducted under the direction of Dr. Fenton, at the expense of the province, has been published.\n\nAn investigation of forest revenue and taxation was carried on in British Columbia to determine what extent existing methods of taxation are sufficient to provide adequate private owners. Taxation in the United States has been investigated for comparison, but no attempt has hitherto been made to ascertain its effect in Canada.\n\nCommittee on Public Health.\n\nThe public health work of the commission has been directed toward the collection of reports and data in respect to the sewage disposal and water supplies of the chief cities of Canada.\n\nAn examination of the Chicago drainage system, similar to that made in connection with the same by the Calumet-Sag channel, was made by Mr. Denie, who acted as medical adviser to the commission.\n\nFor the past two years the commission, through its medical adviser, took over the management of the health work of the Dominion.\n\nThe most important public health question discussed on the public platform, in different parts of the Dominion, the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and Nova Scotia.\n\nPublications of the Commission of Conservation.\n\nSince January 1, 1912, the Commission of Conservation has issued the following reports:\n\n1. The Game Resources of Canada.\n\n2. Third Annual Report of the Pollution of Canadian Surface Waters.\n\n3. Report of the Commission of Nova Scotia.\n\n4. Protest Against Further Diversion of Water from Lake Michigan for the Chicago Drainage Canal.\n\n5. Report Relating to the Application of the Sanitary District of Chicago for Permission to Divert Water from the second branch of Lake Michigan. (This report was published by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, but was compiled and edited by the Commission of Conservation.)\nMr. HUGHES: Yes.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Perhaps the minister would explain why there is such a substantial increase in the amount. In the salaries of the water works in division subdivision B there is an increase of $1,000 and in the second division, subdivision A, there is an increase of $3,000 and $4,000. In the next subdivision there is an increase of almost $5,000. I think that this is a very large increase in Canada, especially in the matter of military and naval expenditure, but we certainly get something.\n\nMr. HUGHES: I have not the detailed information at hand tonight, but in nearly every case there has been an increase.\n\nMr. CARVELL: There are a few appointments of extra clerks. In the second subdivision there are two new clerks in the staff and in the second division subdivision A there is an increase of two. In the third division there is an increase of three. We have had to add a large number of clerks for the lumber district and the mining camps. Perhaps my hon. friend will take notice of motion No. 16, which deals with the increased provisions for the production of papers, and perhaps he will give the information when the estimates are before us another time.\n\nCivil Government\u2014Department of Militia and Defence\u2014Salaries and Contingencies, $18,500.\n\nMr. CARVELL: What is the explanation of the increase in the former numbers? It is almost double what it was before?\n\nMr. LEMIEUX: Is it for the private car?\n\nMr. HUGHES: No, it is not the details of this item, as I do not expect it to come up. I think however, that it is connected with some transport, not in connection with the car I may say.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Does it not occur to the minister that it is a pretty substantial increase?\n\nMr. LEMIEUX: I am very glad my hon. friend has added to his staff. I have purchased a new car and I have a letter from an old clerk of mine who is a claimant under the Act. For a number of years he has been unable to get any compensation for his services. This old soldier served first in 1861 in the church of the Holy Church of Rome, and after that he went to Quebec during the time of the War of 1812. He has friends here all the details in his department. Last year the minister appointed a new clerk to do the work as he now does, and this old soldier, having written him, the minister has answered him. But he says \"I have sent my application, but I never received a letter.\" I understand that my friend is not a proper staff to look after the Fenian Raid claims, but now that he has been appointed he will consider the claim of Louis L\u00e9tourneau of Mont-Louis, in the county of Gasp\u00e9. He has written me and I believe he made his relations in the department, and the attitude of my hon. friend to this case.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Perhaps I am transgressing, but I find it difficult in answering hon. friend's attention to a matter which I placed upon the Order Paper some weeks ago, but which, unfortunately, we did not come back to. I believe it does not come under the item under discussion. I wish to remove from the order paper the claim of a gentleman by a horse concerning the distribution of the land in the camp. Perhaps my hon. friend will take notice of motion No. 16, which deals with the increased provisions for the production of papers, and perhaps he will give the information when the estimates are before us another time.\n\nMr. BURRELL: Last year there were twelve, and now there are thirteen officials attached to the live stock branch, Mr. W. T. Macoun who has been in the service as Dominion Horticulturist since 1887 and who has gone into the A class.\n\nMr. CARVELL: There seems to be a very large increase in subdivision B. There is an increase of more than a clerk and an increase of nearly $1,000 in salaries.\n\nMr. BURRELL: We have five promotions there and four new appointments\u2014Mr. T. R. Atwood, from the Dominion seed experts; sheep expert attached to the live stock branch; an assistant pathologist; Mr. J. M. Macdonald, as assistant to Mr. Macoun; M. A. E. Eastham as seed analyst in the seed branch, and Mr. F. C. Eldred poultry branch at the farm.\n\nMr. McKENZIE: How are these gentlemen transferred from the outside to the inside service?\n\nMr. REID (Minister of Customs): After they have been three years in the outside service, they are eligible to be transferred to the inside service according to the Act of 1908.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Does that take the place of the examination?\n\nMr. REID: Yes, that saves the examination; that is the way they get in.\n\nMr. CARVELL: Take the next item, second division of subdivision A. Are all those increases correct?\n\nMr. BURRELL: In the second division we had forty-seven clerks last year. There were seven vacancies during the year, and there were eight appointments received this year. There were a number of promotions from 2A to 1B and eight new appointments from 1B to 2A, etc., followed by a dairy expert, a poultry expert, for the live stock branch. Mr. Eldred has also been appointed to this position from the outside service, an assistant to the Dominion breeder, assistant to the Dominion breeder.\nMr. CODERRE: Some of them are typewritten for the benefit of a few members. About five requests have been received from members of both sides and from outside of the House that the lists in force should be typewritten. Mr. Foley has been ordered to do that as soon as possible.\n\nMr. PARDEF: Can any member have the list printed by merely making a request to the Secretary of State?\n\nMr. CODERRE: The list should be printed every year; but as a general rule, printing is not expected this year, of course, we shall follow the custom. If there is a custom, it is that, if a member needs a list, it can be typewritten by order given to Mr. Foley.\n\nMr. BELAND: Would it be the list of one county or the whole list?\n\nMr. CODERRE: One county.\n\nMr. BELAND: Do I understand that anyone who asks for a copy of the list for his constituency may get it now or thereafter?\n\nMr. CODERRE: We know beforehand that every member will ask for a list and it would be better to have it printed. That is not what I said. I said that a few members had asked for it and the department had decided not to have them printed as that would be too costly, but to have them typewritten.\n\nMr. SINCLAIR: It would be very convenient for members, who are seminarians or literature, to their constituents, to have a list printed and paying for it. I was not aware that you could get a list free of charge until the department had decided to print the whole list.\n\nMr. PERLEY: The hon. gentleman is quite right. It has not been the custom to print the whole list except in the event of a general election.\n\nMr. CARVELL: As I understand the minister, each member has to do is to apply to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery for a list and it is typewritten at the expense of the House.\n\nMr. CODERRE: The House will understand that what I have said, list printed, would cost some $75,000. It has always been the custom not to print it, except of course when a gentleman has asked for it. I wish to mention names, but Mr. Fisher, for instance, has asked for a copy of the list. I have been allowed to request Mr. Foley to have the list printed for this gentleman. There are two or three others that I could name.\n\nMr. VERVILLE: Has the Government received lists of different cities which are supposed to be in force on the first of April next?\n\nMr. CODERRE: I could not answer that question just now. They must be here, because the clerk of Montreal, for instance, has obliged according to law to send me a list as soon as possible after the coming into force of the list. I could inquire, and give an answer.\n\nMr. VERVILLE: If I was to ask the Secretary of State tomorrow for a list of the 40,000 electors in my riding, would he be good enough to give it to me and include the other members? If so, I shall ask him for it now.\n\nMr. CODERRE: The hon. member had better see me.\n\nLegislation\u2014House of Commons, 8469-326.\n\nMr. PERLEY: In reference to item 39, in connection with the Banking and Commerce Committee, there will be some expenses of witnesses coming here and returning between the committee and also expenses of other committees. I think it might be as well if we could pass item 39 or part of it at all events, for the purpose of providing for that expense. This item is simply to the expenses of the House of Commons, the salary of the Deputy Speaker, expenses of committees, and publishing the Debates. If this item were passed I think it would be in the public interest.\n\nMr. LEMIEUX: I would agree to that, with the understanding that we may come back to it.\n\nProgress reported.\n\nMr. PERLEY moved the adjournment of the House.\n\nMr. LEMIEUX: What business does the gentleman intend to take up on Monday?\n\nMr. PERLEY: I think the intention is to sit up supply again. If there is anything different, the leader of the Opposition will be notified.\n\nMr. LEMIEUX: What supply?\n\nMr. PERLEY: We will go on with Civil Government.\n\nMotion agreed to, and House adjourned at 12:37 a.m., Saturday.\n\nOTTAWA: Printed by C. H. PARMER, printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, 1913.\nExtract from Agents Report on the Salmon River Indian Day School for the month of June, 1913. Original on file 119707-7\n\nThe progress of the school since January has been by far the best since I have known the school. The raising of the school from 2 pupils in Standard III, to 4 in III and 3 in IV, is evidence of the teachers success. You cannot expect to hold in the employ of the Department a man like that for $350.00 per year. You may employ so called teachers for that amount or even less, but they should be gauged by their works. Looking over the work done since January, I would urgently recommend an increase of salary to the present teacher.\n\nSgd. R.L. MacDonald,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Salmon River Day School for the month of June in which you recommend an increase in salary to Mr. Ernest L. McNeil, the teacher, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to make any increase in his salary at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. L. MacDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, O.B.\nSir,\n\nMasles having appeared on the Reserve, the School Principal Officer Mr. Donald has ordered the Indian School to be closed until danger of contamination is feared.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR. L. Donald,\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 27, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant informing the Department that the Salmon River school has been closed by order of the Medical Officer on account of measles being on the reserve, and in reply I beg to say that this action is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. R.L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peter's\nN.S.\nExtract from Hansard Dated April 6, 1914.\n\nIndian Education #948,115.\n\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: Who is the Indian teacher at Malagawatch reserve, Nova Scotia?\n\nMr. Roche: I am not able to give the information just at the moment. I understand the school is closed at the present time.\n\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: Was there a teacher there last season?\n\nMr. Roche: I can get the information for my hon. friend later on.\n\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: I will come to the rescue of the minister. My information is that a young Indian teaches there and I would like to know whether he has the necessary qualifications.\n\nMr. Roche: I will get the information.\n\nMr. Carroll: I would like to refer to a matter that has been brought up in this House before. I refer to the teacher at St. Peter's Provincial Inspector of schools, Mr. T.J. McNeil refused to visit or have anything to do with the school on the ground that the teacher was not qualified. This young man was appointed after Miss Devereaux's dismissal and I would like to know whether he has the necessary qualifications now.\n\nMr. Roche: I cannot tell the hon. member.\n\nMr. Carroll: It is a rather peculiar state of affairs if we are to pass estimates for Indian education all over the country without being in a position to know whether the teachers are qualified. I think the minister should be in a position to tell me whether licensed teachers or backwoodsmen are teaching the children in the Province of Nova Scotia in which I am interested.\n\nMr. Roche: I understand that no teacher is employed in any school unless he is properly qualified.\n\nMr. Carroll: Last year it was proved to the hilt in this House that the young man succeeding Miss Devereaux was not qualified under the Provincial Education Act of Nova Scotia.\n\nMr. Roche: I have a hazy recollection of having read the papers in connection with that and of the discussion that took place. I understand that Miss Devereaux was dismissed for very strong reasons, opening school after ten o'clock in the morning.\n\nMr. Carroll: I am not finding fault with her dismissal, but with the fact that the person appointed in her stead was not qualified. The provincial inspector of schools refused to visit the school on that account. Has the department seen to it that that school has now a qualified teacher?\n\nMr. Chisholm\nMr. A.W. Chisholm: I think the minister will find he has something to attend to with respect to the qualifications of teachers for Indian Schools. It is all very well to say that a teacher is qualified because somebody else says so, but there are certain qualifications required by the Provincial Education Acts, and the minister cannot hope to have Indian schools in their proper condition unless he sees that every teacher possesses the recognized qualifications. I cannot understand how this Malagawatch teacher can have the qualifications. I had the opportunity of recommending a couple of men myself as teachers at Indian schools, but I took very great care that the persons I recommended were qualified under the provincial law.\n\nMr. Roche: I understand that teachers are appointed on the recommendation of the Indian agents and inspectors. Personally I am not aware of any complaints having been made to the department with regard to the qualifications of those teachers, except the case that came up last year, and I am not sure whether that particular teacher is still employed. Perhaps he is better qualified by this time. It is not so very unusual a thing to have an Indian teacher.\n\nMr. A. W. Chisholm: I quite recognize that. I am not reflecting on his appointment because he is an Indian, but I know this man very well and I can hardly see how he could possess the necessary qualifications. That is just the point. Men are sent out to teach without the necessary license. It is quite possible that that may be done successfully in some cases, but it is opening the door to a very dangerous practice. It is quite possible that politics may enter into this thing and that an inspector may be induced to recommend a person who has not the necessary qualifications, but if that practice is to be followed there will be a great deal of trouble.\n\nMr. Roche: We have adopted a rule to have qualified teachers wherever possible, but in some cases we are not able to get qualified teachers for Indian schools, then we get the best qualified person we can.\nMemo,\n\nRe appointment of Ernest L. McNeil as teacher at Salmon River Sch.\n\nThe following is an extract from official letter to Mr. McNeil:\n\nOttawa, November 26th, 1912\n\n\"The Department notes that apparently you have no professional qualifications, nevertheless it is hoped that you will meet with success in the school work, upon which it is trusted that favourable reports will be received in the future, as your retention in the position will depend upon the success with which you meet.\"\n\nSince the appointment of Mr. McNeil, the Agent has reported each month that the school is showing good progress.\n\nInspector MoJ.T. Macneil reported on the school under date of May 9th, 1913.\n\nUnder the heading \"Success\" he said,\n\n\"I can scarcely judge with fairness from one visit. I should therefore prefer to reserve comments under this head till another time when I should have a basis for comparison.\"\n\nThe inspector has not reported on the school since May 9th, 1913 but there is nothing on file to show that the inspector ever refused to visit the school.\nThe Secr.,\nDept. of Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to inform you that there are two boys attending my school who have not missed a day since Jan. 1. I consider this a good record for Indian children. In view of this I am giving the Premier Mayo Gift, from which they kept quiet today. I think the other is justly deserving of a reward however trifling. They both apply themselves well and are forging ahead. I wish you would pull some small gift for this boy before the 3rd of June. I cannot get it myself. Will you write how it came to be kept?\n\nYour obedient servant,\nErnest L. McNeil\nS. Teacher.\nOttawa, June 17, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant stating that there are two boys attending your school who have not missed a day since January 1st and that to one of these boys you gave the Princess Mary's Gift Book and asking the Department to send a small gift for the other boy.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is sending you, under separate cover, a book entitled \"Walter Gibbs, The Young Boss\" to be given to the other boy you refer to as a reward for his good attendance. Kindly let the Department know the name of this boy.\n\nIt is hoped that the other pupils at this school will follow the good example of these two boys and attend school regularly in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The attendance at this school during three quarters of the year averaged seventeen, while the September quarter shows a considerable decrease owing to the pupils not having returned after the summer holidays.\n\nIf Mr. McNeil is kept on he should be entitled to at least $400.00 a year, as he is the lowest paid teacher.\nteacher in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI am informed that Inspector & School Mr. McNeil after his examination of the Indian School at Barriefield assured the teachers that he was going to recommend him for an increase in salary. Has he yet done so?\n\nI learned over a year ago that he was wanted in an inquiry and recommended to be sent. I am happy consequently that the inspectors views of the teachers ability have changed considerably since then.\n\nIf Inspector McNeil had recommended him for an increase, it is certainly a vindication of his appointment by the Dept. and also a vindication of your timely service in the stand he took in Dec. 1912 although such course of action was made to blame the Dept. for his appointment and his predecessor's dismissal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

I am able to report that his pupils are making fair progress - much better than I at one time expected.\n\nMr. McNeil complains, and I think with reason, that his efforts are hampered at times on account of insufficient accommodation for the number of pupils in attendance, the seating capacity of the school room being inadequate, which makes matters inconvenient, if not embarrassing, for both teacher and pupils.\n\nI have already directed the Department's attention to the fact that the Salmon River school house is rather small to meet all the requirements of the situation, especially from a hygienic point of view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

MACNEIL ON THE SALMON RIVER DAY SCHOOL.\n\nIn order to overtake this school before the closing for the Christmas holidays and make the semi-annual inspection required of me before the end of the calendar year, I made a special trip down there, fifteen miles, arriving at 9.15 A.M., to be informed that there would be no school that day, because the school room was to be prepared for a Christmas celebration. And this on Thursday. This was done by order of the Indians, themselves, without previously consulting or notifying the teacher, who had, therefore, no responsibility in the matter. The teacher was present at the school house but the scholars had been notified that they need not attend that day or next except at the celebration. I stayed till 10.10 taking notes and working as above stated with some preaching, when, no scholars appearing I took my departure. I would suggest that the school should not be closed at any time without the teacher receiving notice in advance so that he, in his turn, could notify the Inspector and prevent possible disappointments.\n\nWe have a regulation requiring all teachers to notify the Inspector on the opening of school and also when for any reason the school is to be closed for any period. This rule should be imposed on the teachers of Indian schools, as well.\n\nDate of Inspection,- December 21st, 1916.\nOttawa, February 5, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Macneil in a recent report on the Salmon River School states that he visited this school on the 21st of December, last, and found that there would be no school that day because the school-room was to be prepared for a Christmas celebration. He says that the school was closed by order of the Indians without previously consulting or notifying the teacher.\n\nThe Department would like to know what authority the Indians had for closing the school on that day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. L. McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI hereby tender my resignation as teacher of the Salmon River Indian School. I write in the hope that the war, in which we are at present engaged, is so prolonged that my services can be better utilized in some other work, military or agricultural. I consider it my duty to resign. My resignation takes effect the 31st of March.\n\nI may say that for the four years during which I taught here, although some of the Indians appeared indifferent as to the advantages of an education, others took a keen interest in the education of their children and they now have the pleasure of listening to their children read quite intelligently.\n\nAlthough I am resigning, I shall still care for the welfare of the Indians at heart and trust my successor will take an interest in the uplifting of the Indians as I have tried to do.\n\nD.

McNeil, teacher of the Salmon River Indian School, tendering his resignation to take effect on the 31st instant.\n\nThis resignation has been accepted and I have to ask you to be good enough to take steps to secure the services of a competent teacher to take charge of this school when Mr. McNeil leaves. Any applications you receive should be forwarded to the Department with full information as to the age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc., of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Brennan of Alton, Colchester County, N.S., has made application to me for the position of teacher in an Indian school.\n\nShe is a duly qualified teacher holding a Second Class License, with Normal School training, as the enclosed documents will show.\n\nI am writing her to ascertain if she is prepared to take charge of the Salmon River Indian school at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSecond class license and certificate qualifying as instructor in Physical Training and Drill in Public Schools Grade B.\nOttawa, April 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant stating that Miss Maud E. Brennan of Alton, Colchester Co., made application to you for the position of teacher in an Indian school and that you are writing her to ascertain if she is prepared to take charge of the Salmon River School at once and enclosing documents showing her qualifications.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if Miss Brennan will accept this position you may place her in charge of this school and she will be paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum for her services. She should begin her duties as soon as possible. Kindly advise the Department as to what action you take in this matter.\n\nThe documents enclosed with your letter are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 5, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in regard to securing a teacher for the Salmon River Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you state that you do not think it probable that a teacher will be available before the summer vacation, this school may remain closed until after the holidays. Kindly advise the Department as to whether Miss Brennan would be able to take charge of this school then.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J.

Boyd Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\n\nSir:\n\nI hereby make application for the position of teacher of the Indian School at Salmon River in this county.\n\nI hold a teacher's Provincial License of the Second Class and a Normal College Diploma.\n\nI have three and a half years practical experience as a teacher, and can furnish you with\ntestimonials of competency from the School Inspector and other school officials under whom I have taught in religion. I am a Roman Catholic.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nHattie Jane Bourne\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent.\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.,\nJune 7th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nSince I wrote you on the 29th ultimo, I have received the enclosed application for the Indian school at Chapel Island reserve, N.S.\n\nI am personally acquainted with Miss Fougere, who has the reputation of being quite a successful teacher. She was one of two in her class (a large one) at Normal College, who graduated at the time with honours.\n\nI would strongly urge the acceptance of her application by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 12, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant enclosing an application from Miss Hattie Jane Fougere for the position of teacher of the Salmon River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if Miss Brennan is not able to take charge of this school after the summer holidays, the Department will be prepared to appoint Miss Fougere as teacher. Kindly state whether Miss Brennan will be able to take charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th. inst., and to advise you that I sent an application to the Department a few days ago from Miss Hattie Fougere of this place for the school in question.\n\nMiss Fougere is a native of this (Richmond) County, and, therefore, I daresay it would be well to give her the preference over an applicant from outside, other things being equal.\n\nHaving experience with her work in our district schools here, I can recommend her as a successful teacher, whereas Miss Brennan is a complete stranger to me, she being a resident of Colchester County, and I cannot say anything of her standing as a teacher in a practical sense.\n\nI should like very much to see Miss Fougere get the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th inst., and to say that I believe Miss Brennan would take charge of the Indian school at Salmon River after the summer holidays, providing the situation would be acceptable to her, at least, I infer that from her letter to me of recent date.\n\nI am writing her today, advising that she visit Salmon River at her earliest convenience so as to be able to form her own opinion of the place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

The situation pleased her very much, and, having succeeded in getting a suitable place to board, she decided to take charge of the Indian school there after the summer holidays.\n\nTherefore, this matter is finally disposed of for the present, I presume.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

You will be good enough to inform Miss Sutherland and Miss McDonald that this vacancy has been filled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. L. McDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nAlton, Ont., Oct. 19th, 1918\n\nTo The Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI hereby beg leave to tender my resignation, as teacher in the St. Anne's School of Salmon River Reserve, my resignation to take place the first of January 1919.\n\nI wrote my resignation in November only I was under the impression that a dwelling house was to be put on the Reserve for the teacher, but as nothing has been said or done to that effect of late I am compelled to send in my resignation.\n\nIf at any future date such a building is put on the Reserve, kindly consider me as an applicant for the School.\n\nI am, dear sir, respectfully yours,\n\nMaud E. Brennan.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed attached letter of resignation of the teacher of this reserve. If the teacher cannot secure a boarding house at such a distance from the school that her strength would not be overtaxed in getting there particularly in winter, her resignation should not have been given. But this she could not get, neither can any one else.\n\nIt seems to have been your policy in Newmarket to provide them with a dwelling on the reserve for the teacher although the idea of converting an old woodhouse into a dwelling house was not one that would recommend itself in my opinion were asked. The time is approaching when it may be necessary when a teacher from outside the district cannot get a suitable boarding house and at a reasonable distance from the school. So if you want to maintain a school here, you had better get ready to build a house there!\n\nI have checked the condition of your place for the last six or seven years. It is likely that I should know them a little better than anyone else, so your information in the case,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nMarch 4, 1918\nOttawa, March 8, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing the resignation of Miss Maude E. Brennan as teacher of the Salmon River Indian School, and stating that, if a school is to be maintained there, a house for the teacher will have to be built.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Brennan's resignation is accepted. Kindly instruct her to make out a return showing the number of days she taught during this quarter and the attendance and forward it to the Department through your office and a cheque for the amount of salary due her will be sent.\n\nAs you have already been informed, the Department is not prepared at the present time to erect a residence for the teacher of this school.\n\nYou will be good enough to take steps to try and secure a suitable teacher to take charge of this school. Any applications you receive for the position should be forwarded to the Department for consideration and the applicants should give full information as to their age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Donald,\nSt. Peters, C.B.\n\nReverend and dear father,\n\nHearing of a vacancy in the Chapel Island Reserve school I decided to apply for the position.\n\nI hold a second class Normal Diploma and my experience as teacher is four years, in religious school at a Roman Catholic Trust. Hoping to receive a favorable reply.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMary M. Donald.\nSir,\n\nPlease find attached application for position of teacher in the Indian School. I know the applicant personally and her merits. She has given splendid satisfaction in the schools in which she has taught.\n\nI would strongly recommend her appointment to the position and you may well consider it fortunate that her services are available now.\n\nI wish to remind you that the opportunity of engaging Miss Donald had not passed without the obligation of building a residence for the teacher for this purpose in the near future. The fact that she lives near the reserve and can board at home does not prove that you are always going to be so fortunate in securing teachers who can board at home or who can secure houses in which board can be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 32, 1918\nOttawa, April 11, 1918.\n\nRev.

Williamson\nSir,\n\nLast week Mumps appeared in the house nearest the school house and as a consequence the school was closed for a few days.\n\nPoveshell Creek\n\nR. L. M. Smith\nOttawa, July 14, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. J. T. Macneil, Inspector of Schools for the Province of Nova Scotia, in his report on his recent visit to the Salmon River Indian Day School, states that he found the school closed on account of an outbreak of mumps. This was reported in your letter of the 20th ultimo.\n\nThe Inspector states that he found the place in a fairly good condition, except that the door of the schoolhouse porch was wide open for lack of a lock. You should have a lock placed on the door and it should be kept securely fastened when the school is closed.\n\nThe Inspector also stated that the cattle of the neighborhood are using the school grounds as a cattle yard. This should not be permitted and you should inform the Department as to the cost of having the fence repaired and placed in good condition, in order that this work can be done at an early date.\n\nThe Inspector, in a previous report, stated that the teacher is not very enthusiastic in the work and that the progress, especially among the younger children, is not what it should be.\n\nIt is noted from the returns that this school was only open a total of 158 days during the past school year, out of 200 teaching days.\n\nIf it is the intention of Miss McDonald to resume duties you will be good enough to inform her that it is expected that she will take more interest in her work and that the school should be taught regularly. The school should not be closed on account of epidemics on the reserve unless by direction of a doctor and a report to that effect should be forwarded, as payment of salary cannot be made unless this is done.\n\nThe Inspector stated in a former report that the school was in need of more desks, also that two more chairs and a teacher's desk were required. You will be good enough to furnish a report regarding the desks and, if you consider the ones at present in use in the school, should be replaced by new ones, kindly give the number and sizes of the desks required. If you are unable to give the sizes you should state the ages of the children for which they are required. If any other supplies are needed you should furnish a list of the same.\n\nYou will be good enough to give the various matters enumerated in this letter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. R. L. McDonald,\nIndian Agent\nSt. Peters, N.S.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMr. Sutherland,\n\nIt has been reported to me that Miss McDonald, the present teacher of the Indian school on the Salmon River Indian reserve, is about to resign her position, and George J.

J. Coffey, of St. Peters, to take charge when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, and we are writing the Inspector as to the qualifications and experience which he possesses.\n\nYou should obtain from Miss McDonald her written resignation, and forward the same to the Department.\n\nAs soon as we receive word from the Inspector regarding Mr. Coffey's qualifications, you will be advised as to whether he receives the appointment or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have, therefore, to request that you will endeavour to obtain a suitable teacher for this school. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. It would be advisable for you to consult Mr. Superintendent Boyd regarding this matter, and it is hoped that a qualified teacher can be obtained in time to begin duties when the school re-opens.

Coffey, who occupied the position during the past two years, having tendered his resignation to the Department, which has been accepted.\n\nMr. Coffey's sister, Annie Laura, has applied for the school, and sent me the enclosed official documents which indicate her qualifications. I am well acquainted with Miss Coffey, and can vouch for her good character. She taught three years with success in the common schools of Nova Scotia, and I recommend her appointment as teacher of the School at Salmon River Reserve. I may say also that she is the choice of Mr. Geo. W. Kyte, M. P., for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 26th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, nominating Miss Annie Laura Coffey for the position of teacher at the Salmon River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department approves of the appointment of Miss Coffey as teacher at this school. She will be allowed salary at the rate of $500 per year, plus the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus will be made on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year. Please inform Miss Coffey and Mr. Agent Boudreau accordingly. The Department trusts that Mr. Boudreau will give Miss Coffey every possible assistance. This school should be re-opened on or about the 2nd proximo. The certificates forwarded are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\n\nEnc.\nSir,\n\nRegards teacher for Chapel Island Indian Day school & left the matter to Mr. R.J. Boyd who advised he would have a teacher in due time.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nClerk\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, September 4th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to inform you that, upon the recommendation of Mr. Superintendent Boyd, the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss Annie Laura Coffey as teacher of the Salmon River Indian Day School, Chapel Island Reserve. She will be allowed salary at the rate of $500 per year, plus the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus will be made on a basis of ten teaching months in the school year. Mr. Boyd was requested to arrange with Miss Coffey to begin duties on or about the 2nd instant.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give Miss Coffey every assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLeo A. Boudreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peter's, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 15th instant I posted to you reports on the Indian schools at Salmon River Reserve, Richmond County, and Big Harbor Island, Inverness County, with my accounts for the same. I would ask you to kindly send me a few blank forms for such reports.\n\nIn these reports we are asked to make such suggestions on existing conditions as we deem proper. I ventured to make, in one of my reports, a suggestion on the matter of the salaries of the teachers in these schools. I should like to amplify the remarks referred to by a few further observations, which space in the report did not permit.\n\nOne of these teachers gives her salary as $500, with an expected bonus of $150. The other gives hers as $750. I presume it is the same in both cases. This, boiled down, comes to $2.50 per month, or $2.08 per day.\n\nCompare this with almost any other calling. An office girl, living under comfortable conditions, commands anywhere from $65 to $150 per month. A common sailor gets $50 and upwards, with board. An ordinary charwoman gets $2.00 and upwards, with two or three meals per day. These teachers have to exist on $2.08 per day and \"find themselves\"!\n\nThen look at the living conditions. Boarding in an Indian house on the reserve being out of the question, they have to live at an inconvenient distance from the school while they have to reach as best they can in all weather, and in winter time by well nigh impassable roads.\n\nThe school house at Big Harbor Island has living rooms for the teacher. A girl cannot be expected to live there alone, miles away from white people and surrounded by half civilized Indians.\n\nI understand that the teacher at Big Harbor Island contemplates staying at the school house at least a part of the winter, in which case she will require a companion to stay with her. This, of course, is a personal matter, but\nI think it is worthy of consideration. It seems to me that the resources of the Indian Department are not so cramped that it cannot treat its employees with fairness, if not with liberality and generosity, and I respectfully submit these remarks to those in authority, trusting they will receive favorable consideration.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nJ. W. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nAnnual report on Educ. Status in Can.\nOttawa, December 30th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with general reference to the salaries of the teachers at the Salmon River and Malagawatch Indian Day Schools. I have examined the last available Annual Report on Education Statistics in Canada and the April, 1924, Journal of Education for Nova Scotia, and I believe that the salaries allowed the teachers of Indian day schools in your province compare quite favourably with those allowed in the public controlled rural schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 30th,\n\nNo. 60-1-1. I notice that, naturally enough, you base your estimate of teachers in Nova Scotia on the lists published in the Journal of Education. You overlook the fact that these are minimum prescriptions, lower than which teachers are not permitted to accept, and the further fact that these salaries, provided by the school sections, are supplemented by the Provincial Aid paid to the teachers direct by the Governments.\n\nEven then, I am free to admit that the salaries of your Indian teachers compare favorably with those of many of our lower classed teachers. If this Province could secure its rights in the matter of the Western school lands, it would not be robbed of its best teachers, as well as of the means of paying them. But what I wish to emphasize is the conditions under which the teachers in the Indian schools have to live and to work. I never visit their schools without experiencing a feeling of sympathy, if not of pity, for them. I have two daughters engaged in teaching, and I would not have one of them employed in these schools for three times what they are receiving, and their salaries run well into four figures.\n\nI have no personal interest to serve in this connection. I have probably visited these and the other schools for the last time, but I should be glad, before retiring, to do something to better the condition of persons whom I consider very inadequately paid. If good teachers are to be secured for these schools, and held, when they are, the remuneration will have to be more attractive.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, January 10, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the salaries paid teachers of Nova Scotia Indian day schools. I note that it is because of the living conditions on the reserves that you recommend a higher scale. I wish to assure you that the Department is grateful for your interest, and when funds are available, the successful teachers will be offered a stipend which will compensate them somewhat for the circumstances in which they are working.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. J. T. MacNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\n73 Coburg Road,\nHalifax, N. S.\nExtract from Report of Inspector d'Entremont on\nthe Salmon River Indian Day School - dated June 1st, 1926.\n\nOnly six pupils present and attendance poor. To my\nmind these children should be compelled to attend school.\nThe truant officer is not acting.\nOttawa, June 7th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Salmon River Indian Day School, states that only 6 pupils were present at the time of his inspection and that the attendance at this school has been very poor. The Inspector also states that the truant officer is not performing his duties and that a strong effort should be made to have the children of school age attend school regularly.\n\nPlease report regarding the matter of attendance at this school, and state whether there is a truant officer and if he has been attending to his work. I should also be pleased to have your views as to what you would advise be done to enforce a more regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. A. Boudreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nIn answer to your letter of June 7 regarding the attendance at the Salmon River day school, I beg to say the class of Indians that are working are hard to do anything with & almost impossible for me to make them send their children to school. Now the constable officer is Andrew Alex & is quite old & does not very smart & I hate to say so but he is badly fitted for the position & I would recommend to give the position to Tom Maracle as he is the constable & seems to have more interest in the reserve that any other Indian & then the teacher could report to him daily if necessary & he could investigate & make the reason known why such children is not in school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL. W. P. Bandman\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the attendance at the Salmon River Indian Day School and the services that are being performed by the truant officer, Andrew Alex. In reply I beg to say it is noted that as Andrew Alex is an old man, he has not been attending to his duties, and his services should, therefore, be dispensed with.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Tom Marshall, the present constable for the Reserve, to take up duties as truant officer for this Reserve from the 1st of September, next, the date on which the school will reopen after the summer holidays. It is expected that he will attend to the duties as truant officer faithfully and see that all Indian children of school age, who are in good health, attend school regularly each day it is open. The teacher should furnish a report to the truant officer each day regarding the absentee pupils, and he should then visit the homes and endeavour to have them brought to school. It is thought that if a strong effort is taken by the truant officer there will be a marked improvement in the attendance. The salary allowed Marshall for his services will be at the same rate as was previously paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. A. Boudreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nSt. Peter's N.S.\nAugust 29th, 1927\n\nMr. A.J. Boyd, Indian Agent,\nRiver Bourgeois,\nCape Breton.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI had intended to open the Indian School on September 1st, but a physician whom I consulted advised me not to for the present. So I ask you to kindly obtain a substitute for the first half year of the school year ending June 1928.\n\nAnd oblige,\n\nAmos L. Coffey.\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed letter explains itself. Considering prompt action necessary, I engaged Mr. John H. Landry to substitute for Miss Coffey until her health improves. He is well qualified to take charge of the Indian Day School at Salmon River Reserve, as the Certificate of Scholarship herewith shows, and I do not think it does him justice in one subject, namely, English, because I know that he has a better knowledge of English than of French or Latin.\n\nMr. Landry is a young man of the very best character, and his fine physique can hardly fail to command the respect of his pupils. He will take charge of the School on the 6th inst., and I hope that my action in this case will receive the Department's approval.\n\nKindly return the enclosed Certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 8th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you advise that Miss Coffey is unable to resume her duties at the Salmon River Indian Day School and recommending the temporary appointment of Mr. John H. Landry. In reply I beg to say that your action in placing him in charge of the school is approved and he will be allowed salary at the same rate as was paid Miss Coffey, namely, $65. a teaching month.\n\nI enclose Mr. Landry's certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that Miss Gibson has no professional qualifications.\n\nIt is considered that it would be advisable to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher for this school, and I shall be pleased if you will give the matter further consideration and endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher with professional qualifications. You should submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you. The salary we would allow would depend on the qualifications which the teacher obtained possesses.

I would like to inform the Dept. that since I can remember there was only one perhaps the 2nd who had professional people to teach. Not saying that the last was not suitable as he was certainly a good man. I would like to inform the Dept. that the said Miss Gibson is a real smart girl & is worthy capable of the position so far I have no applications from any teachers for the position.\n\nYours Truly,\nGeo.

I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Gibson of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 3rd, next. Please inform the Department as to whether she accepts the position as teacher at Salmon River or not and if she will be prepared to commence duties on the date mentioned. I may say that the Department has received no other application for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLeo A.

I would advise that you forward your application to Mr. C. J. McNeil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Antigonish, N.S., stating your qualifications and experience. There is no special form of application for this purpose. We have been allowing salary at the rate of $65 per teaching month at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMiss Katherine MacKinnon,\nSoldier's Cove,\nN.S.\nAntigonish, N.S.,\nAug. 24th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report to you that Dr. J.A. MacDonald of St. Peters, N.S. has asked me to have Miss Tina MacDonald of Soldier's Cove appointed teacher at the Salmon River Indian Day School in place of Miss Ethel Gibson who taught there during the past two years.\n\nAs you may know, Dr. MacDonald is the Medical Attendant at the reserve and is also in charge of the patronage for Richmond County.\n\nI understand that Miss Gibson does not want to resign and I have not received her resignation. Although Miss Gibson has taught at the school for two years she only has a Grade IX certificate, with no Normal training, no other teaching experience and no License to teach from the Council of Public Instruction. Her work as a teacher has not been satisfactory. When I spoke to the Provincial School Inspector for the district concerning her ability as a teacher, he stated that she would not be allowed to teach in any of the white schools. If that is the case, then I do not think it reasonable that she should be a satisfactory teacher for an Indian school.\n\nIn reference to Miss Tina MacDonald's qualifications, I beg to say that she has a \"B\" certificate and fifteen years experience as a teacher. Mr. Benoit, local school inspector, states as follows: \"I wish to say that Miss MacDonald is not musical, and I do not know her qualifications from the artistic standpoint; but in all other respects I feel satisfied she would be eminently satisfactory.\"\n\nIt would appear then that Miss Gibson's services should be discontinued in view of the foregoing facts and a new teacher appointed for this school.\n\nAs Miss Tina MacDonald's qualifications are satisfactory to the local school inspector, I would therefore recommend her appointment as teacher at the Salmon River Indian Day School, her duties to commence about September 1st, next.\nWith the school season approaching, I should be pleased to have your ruling in this matter as soon as possible.\n\nI wish to say, in connection with this matter, that I have waiting to receive Miss Gibson's resignation before taking action in this case; but now I feel that steps must be taken at once in order to have a new teacher for next term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.J. McNeil,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, recommending a change in teacher at the Salmon River Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department does not consider that it would be fair to Miss Gibson to discharge her at such short notice. If you consider her services unsatisfactory, you should have reported early in July. I may add that a review of the recent reports of Inspector Benoit does not show that he considered her services so unsatisfactory as to warrant the Department writing you in the matter.\n\nIn view of your present recommendation that Miss Gibson be dismissed, you may advise her at once that her services will not be required after September 30th. You should also forward for our consideration an application from Miss Tina MacDonald and copies of her references.\n\nYou should instruct Miss Gibson to prepare and forward the usual quarterly return at the end of September, and, on receipt of this, the salary due her for September will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter No.60-I/I of August 27th, which arrived while I was on my vacation, I beg to report that Miss Gibson has been notified that her services will not be required after the 30th instant. She has been instructed to prepare and forward the usual quarterly return at the end of September.\n\nAttached therewith is an application from Miss Tina MacDonald of Soldier's Cove, N.S., as teacher in the Indian Day School at Chapel Island Reserve. It is noted that Miss MacDonald holds a \"B\" certificate and has had fifteen years experience as a teacher and her application has been forwarded at the request of Dr. J.A. MacDonald, ex M.P. for Richmond County. And, as stated in my letter of August 24th, Miss MacDonald is recommended by School Inspector Benoit as being \"eminently satisfactory\". A copy of Mr. Benoit's recommendation is attached also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSoldiers Cove West, N.S.,\nJuly 1, 1931.\n\nMrs. B. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nAntigonish.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease consider my application for Salmon River Indian Reservation School. I hold a \"B\" certificate and have had fifteen years experience as teacher.\n\nMy home is located about one and a half miles from the school. This application is forwarded to you at the request of Dr. J.A. MacDonald ex-M.P. of St. Peters. An early reply would be much appreciated.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nTina Mac Donald.\nArichat, N.S., August 2, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. MacNeil:\n\nReferring to our conversation of last Wednesday I wish to say that Miss MacDonald is not musical, and I do not know her qualifications from the artistic standpoint; but in all other respects I feel satisfied she would be eminently satisfactory.\n\nThe supply of a phonograph to the school - records can be borrowed - would doubtless do much to brighten the school life.\n\nWith kind greetings,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Alphonse Benoit.\nOttawa, September 19th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that you notified Miss Gibson that her services would not be required after the 30th instant as teacher of the Salmon River Indian Day School and enclosing an application from Miss Tina MacDonald for the position as teacher to succeed Miss Gibson. The qualifications which Miss MacDonald possesses have been noted and are satisfactory. The Department will be pleased to approve of her appointment as from October 1st, next, with salary at the rate of $65 per teaching month. Please inform Miss MacDonald of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties on the date mentioned.\n\nYou should, also, inform the local Indian Agent of the approval granted for the appointment of Miss MacDonald and request him to give her any assistance he can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N. S.\nSeptember 18th, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRepresentations have been made to Honourable Mr. Rhodes that Miss Ethel Gibson who has been re-employed in charge of the school at the Indian Reserve at St. Peters is not properly qualified and it is understood she is not satisfactory to the Captain of the Indian Reserve who states that no progress has been since she was placed in charge of the school.\n\nIt has been further represented to Mr. Rhodes that Miss Tena MacDonald of Soldiers Cove, an applicant for the position and who it is represented would be quite satisfactory has been instructed to report for duty on October 1st.\n\nI shall appreciate it if you will let me have a statement of the facts in this case for the information of Honourable Mr. Rhodes.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 25, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Lamb:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the teaching services at the Salmon River Indian Day School, near St. Peters, N.S. Early in September, our local representative reported that Miss Ethel Gibson was not a satisfactory teacher. He was immediately informed to give her notice. Subsequently, Miss Tena MacDonald, of Soldier's Cove, received the appointment - duties to commence on the first proximo.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJ. J. Lamb, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary,\nThe Minister of Fisheries,\nHunter Building,\nOttawa.\nAntigonish, N.S.,\nDec. 29th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWould it be possible to have the salary of Miss Tina MacDonald, teacher at the Salmon River Indian Day School, raised to $70.00 per teaching month. I am pleased to say that Miss MacDonald is proving herself to be a more competent teacher than her predecessor was and she is doing better work. The average attendance at her school for the quarter just ended was the same as the attendance at the Sydney Day School where the teacher receives $85.00 per teaching month. I think that where the conditions and qualifications of teachers are the same, Miss MacDonald should receive at least $70.00 per teaching month. Then her salary would be more in proportion to the salaries paid to other teachers.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend that she be paid at the rate of $70.00 per teaching month as from the first of October 1931. I might mention that this is a matter which is of interest to the local representative.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo recommending an increase in the salary of Miss Tina MacDonald, teacher of the Salmon River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, while the Department has no funds to make any general increase in the salaries of teachers, we will approve, in view of your special report in Miss MacDonald's case, of an increase in salary of $5 per teaching month as from the 1st instant. This will make the salary allowed her from that date at the rate of $70 per teaching month. I have to request that you will inform Miss MacDonald and the local Indian Agent accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nC. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nMinister's Office\n\nFebruary 8, 1932.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWill you please note the attached letter from the Acting Private Secretary to the Minister of Finance, and return it to me together with a memorandum which may be passed on to the Honourable Mr. Rhodes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, February 10, 1932.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nWill you kindly let me have a memorandum which may be forwarded to the Honourable Mr. Rhodes.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nFebruary 10, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD.\n\nWith reference to the inquiry of the Honourable Mr. Rhodes, I may say that teachers of Indian day schools are considered temporary employees and are engaged from year to year. The usual practice is to request the church interested in any particular school to nominate the workers. Appointments are then confirmed by the Department.\n\nWith particular reference to the Salmon River Indian Day School, near St. Peters, N.S., I may say that no church takes an active interest in the management and therefore the appointment of a teacher rests with the Department of Indian Affairs. The present incumbent is Miss Tina MacDonald, who was favourably recommended in Mr. Lamb's letter to me of September 18th, last. Miss MacDonald's services have been satisfactory. The Department expects that she will ask to be continued in our employ during the next academic year.\n\nDuncan C.

Also painting is needed all over.\n\nWood shed is O.K. and water closet also, all belonging to Indian department.\n\nThe school and equipment does not compare with those of Malagawatch and Whycocomagh. It has been neglected, and very much so.\n\nAs you may not know we are having a backward spring, cold and damp weather. No fire at school since the last two weeks for the janitor is away after pulp wood. It was far from being comfortable this morning.\nOttawa, June 7th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Salmon River Indian Day School, states that the schoolroom needs repairing, and that the windows, desks and cupboard, also the interior, should be painted. He also states that this school and the equipment do not compare with our other Indian schools in Cape Breton which he has visited, and that this building and equipment have been neglected and very much so. He further states that, as the janitor had been away, there was no fire for two weeks previous to his visit and the school was far from comfortable.\n\nI have to request that you will forward a report regarding the repairs and painting required, giving an estimate of the cost of any work which you would recommend be carried out.\n\nYou should also enquire as to whether the janitor has been attending to his duties, as there does not appear to be any reason why the children should suffer from want of heat. If the janitor was absent, it is thought that the teacher could have arranged to have the older boys light the fires and see that sufficient heat was provided.\n\nYour early report on the above matters will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Boudreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N.S.\nOttawa, Sept. 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss MacDonald, travelling nurse for this Department for the province of Nova Scotia, has strongly recommended that a hot midday lunch be supplied the pupils of the Salmon River Indian Day School each school day. She states that such meal should consist of hot soup or broth with biscuits, milk, cheese, sugar and cocoa. She also says that the actual preparation of the lunch in the school would serve a very useful educational lesson; that it would be of great benefit to the health of the children and encourage a more regular attendance.\n\nPlease discuss this matter with the teacher and ascertain whether she, with the assistance of the older girl pupils, could prepare this hot lunch and arrange for the serving of same. If arrangements can be made for its serving, it will be necessary to furnish the appliances and you may purchase a number of enamel cups, one kettle, one large saucepan, a dishpan and a small quantity of dish towelling as well as sufficient biscuits, cheese, cocoa, sugar and condensed milk sufficient for the serving of the meal. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in the purchase of the supplies. We will expect to hear from you, stating whether you have been able to arrange with the teacher for the serving of this hot lunch.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the supplies. This lunch is to be served to the pupils during the fall and winter months only, from October first to the middle of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

In this connection I would refer you to your letter of June 28th last, giving a statement of the repairs required to this school. It may be possible to arrange to have these repairs made early next spring, and you should draw the attention of the Department to same, and also to the need of a toilet for the teacher, at that time.

You should give full shipping directions. Please obtain an estimate from a local dealer for the supplying of a teacher's desk and chair, if same are required, and this you should submit for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRelative to the draining of the school lot and the erection of a fence around same, I shall be pleased if you will give full particulars as to the type of drainage you would recommend and the cost of same.

I did not answer as it was impossible for me to get any clue. To-day I was called down to the School house that every pair of glasses was broken last night by a drunken Indian & the result is that I got the man named every thing in readiness for his arrest for tomorrow. I am taking authority to purchase glasses & the necessary to repair the School at once so it is impossible to have School till it is repaired. I know this fellow will not pay the damage which will be no less than twenty-five dollars plus thirty-three cents for city expenses for rent & witness fees. If you have any advice to offer I would kindly do you & mine an Inquest this that will take place.\nSir,\n\nMonday. I must say I have been having a lot of trouble with the school & I did not get the back boards or teacher desk just on account of the making in & the result would be that it would be destroyed.\n\nHowever I am doing my best & I am sure this fellow will be landed in good order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nAllahta.\nOttawa, November 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department of the damage done to the windows of the Salmon River Indian Day School, and also regarding the stealing of the classroom supplies.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you have obtained the name of the Indian who was responsible for the breaking of the school windows and that you are taking steps to have him prosecuted. It is hoped that an example has been made in his case and that, as a result, there will be no more vandalism at this school. I shall be pleased to hear the result of the trial of the Indian referred to. Your action in having the broken windows repaired is approved.\n\nThere are also other repairs which require attention at this school. The Public School Inspector, in his report on his recent inspection, states that steps are required at the front entrance, also that the blackboards are in an unsatisfactory condition. You should have the steps repaired or new steps built at the front entrance and you should furnish information regarding the blackboards as asked for in official letter of July 3rd, last. The department has received no information from you regarding the draining of the school lot and the erection of a fence around same. It may be too late to consider carrying out any drainage this Fall, but you should bring this matter to the attention of the Department again early next Spring, and also report regarding any fencing required.\n\nYou should also give the matter of the purchase of a teacher's desk early attention. If a teacher's chair is required, you may supply same. A certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded, also an account covering the cost of installing new window panes and for any other repairs necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLeo. A.

The school building itself is in a fair state of repair although being a little on the small side. There should be three new desks installed to take care of a full attendance properly. The teacher also should have a new desk. There should be a new heater installed. The present one is a wood stove and it is badly in need of repairs. The great fault to be found with stoves of that type is that students sitting near the stove are too warm while those sitting in a more remote part of the room do not get an equal amount of heat.\n\nI would suggest that a new heater of the \"air circulator\" type be installed in this school. Other things that are required for the school are: 2 dozen drinking cups, 2 wash basins, 6 towels and one water pail.\n\nThe attendance here is fair. In the past there has been a great amount of loitering about the premises by the young people at night. This practice, on several occasions, has been the cause of much damage being done here. Strict orders have been issued to all the Indians of that reserve that the school grounds are out of bounds to all during the hours that the school is not in session and the teacher has been instructed to report any further complaints of this kind. Thus we hope to improve conditions eventually. I trust that you will see fit to authorize the above recommendations please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 3, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of 3 desks, a teacher's desk and a new heater for the Salmon River Indian Day School.\n\nYou may also purchase 24 cups, 2 wash basins, 6 yards towelling and 1 water pail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This account contains an item covering the cost of thirty-six (36) lead pencils to an amount of $1.08.

In connection with this work would you kindly authorize the purchase of the following articles:\n\n- 2 webs flannelette\n- 3 doz spools white thread\n- 5 pkgs needles\n- 5 lbs. 4 ply knitting yarn\n- 15 sets knitting needles\n\nThe ground outside the building needs several loads of gravel.

As she will undertake the instruction of the pupils in sewing and knitting, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following materials: 2 webs flannelette, 3 doz. spools white thread, 3 packages needles, 5 lbs. 4-ply knitting yarn and 15 sets knitting needles.\n\nYou may also arrange to have several loads of gravel placed around the grounds outside the building. This gravel should be properly graded.

Reals\nAgent.\nSecretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFather L.J. Keats of St. Peters, B.C. has given me permission to write to the Department requesting supplies for the pupils of the Salmon River Indian Day School on condition that no extraordinary expense be included.\n\nA repetition of last year's supplies would be much appreciated. These were:\n- Lunch during the winter months consisting of milk toast, cheese, 3 qts. of milk daily, cocoa and sugar.\n- 4 oz. skein of yarn for each pupil - 6\u00a2\n- A pair of gum shoes and stockings for each\n- 2 webs of flannel\n- An allowance of $10 with which to purchase Xmas candy and fruit for the children.\n\nTrusting that this order will meet with your approval, I am, sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTina Mac Donald\nAgent\nSalmon River Ind. Day School,\nSoldiers' Love Nest,\nB.C., No. 8.\n\nApproved\nLeo J. Keats\nAgent\nOttawa, November 16, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the communication which you forwarded from Miss Tina MacDonald, teacher of the Salmon River Indian Day School, requesting that supplies be furnished for the midday lunch to the pupils.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, it will only be possible to authorize an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $8 per month during the period from December 1st, next, to April 30th, following - five months. The supplies for the lunch should consist of milk, cocoa and sugar, and if funds permit, biscuits and cheese. Itemized accounts, in triplicate covering the expenditure incurred should be obtained, and these you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment from time to time.\n\nRegarding the teacher's request to be allowed a grant to purchase candy and fruit for a treat for the pupils at Christmas, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure which must not exceed the sum of $8 for this purpose. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of 6 pounds of yarn, to be made up by the pupils. An account, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering this expenditure.\n\nRegarding the request that a pair of gum shoes and stockings for each pupil and two webs of flannelette be supplied, I have to request that you will state the number of pupils for whom the shoes and stockings are absolutely necessary. If any of the Indian parents are able to supply the shoes and stockings required, they should do so. If possible, you should furnish an estimate of the total cost involved in supplying the shoes and stockings, also the cost of two webs of flannel-ette. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether approval can be granted for the expenditure or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Leo J.

R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJohn H. Langley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBarra Head, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of October No. 60-1-5 I wish to inform you I visited the Salmon River Indian Day School on Nov. 9th and looked over improvements suggested by Inspector J.A. Bennett.\n\nIn order to place two additional windows in the south wall as proposed it will be necessary to rearrange the windows there now so there is not room to place an additional window between those already there. This means that this wall will have to be stripped, studding moved to accommodate new windows and probably new studding may be needed. This is an old building and it is difficult to say just what may have to be done.\n\nOther windows are removed it will be necessary to plaster - the interior of this building is plastered.\n\nThis new work will have to be painted and for that reason you will have to paint the entire building both interior and exterior. The painting is badly needed anyhow.\n\nI also find the wall under the building is in very poor condition.\nSir,\n\nI would like to suggest that if you go on with the other repairs that a cement wall be placed under the building. In connection with moving the windows I forgot to state that new sashes will have to be purchased and possibly window frames.\n\nMy estimate for the carpenter work including material, replacing the plaster including necessary material ($200.00) two hundred dollars.\n\nTo put a cement wall under building sides and material ($50.00) fifty dollars. To paint building inside and out, all new wood to have two coats labor and material ($50.00) fifty dollars.\n\nOf course you will understand I am not an expert at estimates and as I said before it is difficult to know just what you may run into when you start repairs on a building as old as this\u2014perhaps find a better bill. However, I think this estimate will come very close to completing this work.\n\nWill you kindly tell me in what year this building was constructed?\nSir,\n\nNow I believe the time to do this work is when school closes for the summer vacation\u2014July 1937.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nJohn W.

The amount I think was three hundred dollars.\n\nThe next item is the road. Last year we repaired or rather rebuilt nearly all the bridges and culverts and cleaned the ditches. This year it shall have to be gravelled for the purpose is completely worn out. The doctor, Dr. H. Bickert, experienced considerable difficulty getting down there last fall on slick bales.\n\nMy estimate for this work is eight hundred dollars.\nSir,\n\nThe next thing to consider is building repairs. Last year I had only four hundred dollars about two-thirds of the amount I asked for.\n\nThank God we have had a very mild winter down here otherwise there would have been a lot of suffering from poor housing conditions. My estimate for repairs and completion of unfinished houses is one thousand dollars.\n\nI trust you will give this matter your careful consideration.\n\nI am not going into details concerning the condition of some of the shanties those few Indians have to live in as I think I did so on several occasions since my appointment as agent in June 1936.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn D.

Bissett.\n\nOwing to the fact that I was very busy on this Reserve and as I had arranged a meeting with the Indians at the school, I did not have an opportunity of discussing the school work at any length with the teacher. However, I had a short chat with her.\n\nThe school building (18' x 25') is in poor condition, and I came to the conclusion that it is very doubtful if it is worth repairing. It was built many years ago and as far as I could make out the foundation is pretty well gone, as well as the sills under the floor. However, I could not properly examine the foundation, as there is no basement under the school. I would suggest, if any requests come in for extensive repairs, that the Department first ascertain whether or not the building is really worth spending very much money on in the way of repairs.\n\nThe ceiling is badly in need of paint, as I do not suppose it has been painted for years.\n\nI noted that the seats are very old and rickety.\n\nMore blackboard space is required at this school.\n\nThe average attendance is 23 - Grades from I to VI.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nST.

The $50.00 is for possible repairs to Coal Shed and toilet. They will likely have to be shingled in 1939.\n\nOn October 1936 Inspector Benoit recommended some changes made in the lighting of the Classroom of the Palmer River Indian Day School. An estimate was made of the cost and submitted to the Department.\n\nThis building is more than 50 years old and it is very doubtful if it is worth remodeling. I think we should have a new school building and use the old building for a hall. As you know their Council House is on the Island where their Church is and it is not always convenient to go over there.\n\nI have felt for some time that my\nIndian Affairs should have a community hall centrally located on the main land. The old school building would fill the bill very nicely. I did not make an estimate of the cost of a new school would be. I pray that you give this proposition every consideration.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the old building is very unsatisfactory and I sincerely hope the estimates for the next fiscal year will include an appropriation for a new school on this reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn H. Langley\nBarra Head\nN.S.\n\nMr. M. Christianson\nGeneral Agent of Agencies\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in which you recommend the erection of a new school on the Salmon River Reserve.\n\nYour recommendation has been noted and will receive consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40. At the present time I am unable to advise you whether or not it will be possible to provide the funds that will be required.\n\nIf it is decided to erect a building I presume that accommodation for approximately 24 children would be required. You might let me know what you consider it would cost to erect a new school at Salmon River.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. H.

The Department favours a one-roomed school with full basement in which there would be accommodation for manual training. It is understood that a teacher can obtain boarding accommodation reasonably close to the school and under these circumstances it is not considered necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher.\n\nIf you recommend construction by day labour you should state whether or not there are Indians on the Reserve who could be employed and, if so, state their trade or if they could only do ordinary labour.\n\nOne section of the form requires you to state the number of pupils for whom accommodation is required in the class room. From the quarterly returns it would appear that seating capacity for approximately 30 pupils is required. However, you should give definite information in this regard and at the same time state if in your opinion the number of pupils is likely to increase or decrease within the next few years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I may say that a variation of 5 pupils can readily be made by eliminating one row of seats and reducing the length of the classroom by 2'6\". I would be pleased, therefore, to be advised whether accommodation for 35 pupils will be satisfactory in place of the 36 requested. If not, it is recommended that a building of the size shown be erected.\n\nThe cost of the building providing accommodation for forty pupils is estimated at about $5,100.00, and for 35 pupils at about $4,800.00.\n\nWith regard to the sketch plan submitted with the building data form, it is noted that there is, at present, a school building on the site. As there is no mention of this building on the data form, I would be pleased to be advised whether or not it is to be removed and the site used for the new building.\n\nWill you kindly forward these sketch plans to the Indian Affairs Branch for their consideration and if the layout, as shown, is satisfactory, request them to return one set of the plans, duly signed as approved, to this office for our records.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

I would, therefore, suggest that you give the matter further consideration and let me have your views. If you still think that a community hall is desirable you might let me know the approximate cost of moving the building.\n\nDo you recommend that the new school be erected on exactly the same location as the present school or could it be erected on some other part of the school site? Incidentally you might let me know the approximate size of the school site.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H. Langley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBarra Head, N. S.\n\nR. A.

This will be satisfactory to this Branch.\n\nWith reference to the disposal of the school building at present on the site I am writing to the Indian Agent and on receipt of his reply I will advise you further.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 10th, I have looked over the school site at Indian Reserve and I believe the old school building can be left in its present location and the new building be erected a little to the South of present building using a part of present lot and part of field of Andrew Francis.\n\nMy reasons for wishing to retain the old school building for a Community Hall is because the Council House is so situated, on an island, and at certain seasons it is difficult often impossible to get there. It is customary for the Indians to meet at certain times for prayer particularly during the Christmas and Easter Season and this building owing to its central location would be ideal.\nfor this purpose. It is also necessary from time to time for the Agent and occasionally for some official of the Dept. to meet with members of the Band and here again it would serve another useful purpose. I have no fear of it becoming a nuisance.\n\nYours truly,\nJohn H. Langley\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. R. L.

They can use any material that is of value for repairing their own homes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. H. Langley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBarra Head, N.

I am still firm in my belief that this building should be given to the Indians as a hall. I realize the necessity for such a building on the mainland of this Reserve only I feel that this old school building would fill the bill at least for a time.\n\nI have talked to Rev. H. J. Heato of St. Peters who is the priest who attends them and he was very much in favor of the idea.\nI believe I can have this building removed from the school lot by the Indians free of cost to myself if it is given to them.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nBarra Head\n\nW.R.C.

In view of this fact, therefore, we believe that the old school should be dismantled and the lumber distributed among the Indians for the repair of their houses.\n\nIt is just possible that on your recommendation, from time to time, the new school might be used for a certain number of band meetings. The attitude of the Department, when requests for the use of the school reach us, will depend almost wholly upon your recommendation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I, therefore, presume that no midday lunch has yet been served.\n\nIf you consider it necessary you may expend an amount of $5.00 a month for midday meal supplies for the months of February and March, 1940.\n\nOwing to lack of funds it is not possible to consider purchasing the oil burner mentioned in your letter.\n\nWith reference to your other letter of the 20th instant regarding new desks required these cannot be secured at the present time as no funds are available. However, if you renew your request after April 1 further consideration will be given to supplying the desks that are necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. H. Langley,\nIndian Agent,\nBarra Head, N.

Mr Scott informs me that $300.00 could be paid if you authorize that amount.\n\nOut of the ten schools in Nova Scotia, only four teachers receive as high a salary as $300.00; three are paid at the rate of $200.00 and three at $250.00. If any more than $300.00 were allowed for the Sydney school, it would be likely to cause dissatisfaction among the other teachers.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, July 21st, 1903.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nThe amount provided for a school teacher's salary for Sydney School is $200.00, but we could pay $300.00 out of funds that would be available, if it is decided to increase the salary to that amount.\n\nD.

These Indians have about 25 children of school age and provision is made for the salary of a teacher at the rate of $200.00 per annum, this being the lowest amount paid in the Lower Provinces and $300.00 the highest. The average salary is $250.00.\n\nMr McLean, in his report on the Indians of Cape Breton, states that Father McAdam, the Agent, could obtain the services of a lady who would be willing to devote her life to uplifting the Indians, and he placed the salary at $200.00, which seems a small amount for the weight to be raised. As however, $300.00 is the limit to which the Department has seen fit to go, I do not see how that amount could be exceeded without creating a precedent for the payment of larger salaries to all of our schools.\n\nThese Indians lives in miserable shacks and are said to be in a very wretched condition, although there is plenty of work at good wages to be\nIf the Department desires to pay the teacher more than $300.00, the only way that I can see that it could be equitably done would be to give her additional duties outside of the school similar to those performed by a Field Matron in the United States, and pay her accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss Kelly Connolly of New Glasgow, with the consent of the Department, will undertake to conduct the School on the Sydney Reserve for the sum of $40 per annum.

MacAdam,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\nSydney, December 3rd 1903\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 225-264, received today, I beg to say that the request to have the School Commissioners of Sydney undertake the supervision of the Indian Reserve School came originally from the teacher, Miss Connolly, and I communicated her request to the Board. Some arrangement of this kind would be advantageous both to the teacher and to the school. It would enable Miss Connolly who has a first-class Provincial diploma to draw about $110 per year Provincial Grant. On the other hand it would secure for the School the supervision of the district Inspector and also of the city officials.\n\nIt would be in Miss Connolly's interests to have the arrangement made as soon as possible for if not done before the end of the year she will lose the first half-year's Provincial Grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.M. Macdonald\nIndian Agent\nthe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 9th December, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the letter of the 17th ultimo from the School Commissioners of the Town of Sydney, in which they state that they have been asked to undertake the supervision of the Indian school on the Reserve there, I beg to say that Rev. Mr Macadam, who was asked to state who made this request, and what form the supervision is to take, reports that it originated with Miss Connolly, the teacher, who would benefit by such an arrangement to extent of an additional $110.00 in her salary out of the Provincial grant. The school would, however, have to be placed virtually in the hands of the School Commissioners as, under the Public Instruction Act of Nova Scotia, the provincial grant cannot be paid to the teacher of any school which does not come under the control of a board of trustees.\n\nIf the Commissioners are willing to assume the control of this school, I do not see that there ever was any necessity for starting it as the Indian children could have gone to a white school upon payment of tuition. The Department has the benefit of the Public School Inspector's visits in Nova Scotia for which we already pay, and it seems to me that the proposed arrangement is solely for the benefit of the teacher. Of course this school is peculiarly situated\nbeing in the town of Sydney and it might not form a precedent for other teachers to ask to have their schools placed under the control of white trustees, but as there is already a good deal of dissatisfaction at the withdrawal of the provincial grant from Indian teachers, they may be expected to do their best to have the terms of the Provincial Act met, so that they might get the benefit of the grant. Miss Connolly is now receiving a good deal more than any of the teachers in the Lower Provinces and the others are likely to complain of unfair treatment if a further increase is made to her salary.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 1st December, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the communication received from the School Commissioners of the Town of Sydney, in which they state that they have been asked to undertake the supervision of the Indian school on the Reserve there; and in reply I have to inform you that the Department cannot consent to hand over the control of this school to the Commissioners, and you will be good enough to inform the Secretary of the Board to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nRev.

I have been trying to secure another teacher, and I think I have succeeded in getting one to take charge on the 1st of April. A Miss McDonald from Pictou County, Nova Scotia.

If she accepts the school I expect her to arrive this week as I expected the school to be opened by the 1st of April.\n\nThe family Steven John is ill with pneumonia with very small chances of recovery.

McIntyre,\nIndian Affairs.\nSydney,\nJan. 18, 06.\n\nTo Sir,\nThe Secretary Dept Ind Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nI hereby beg leave to call the attention of the Dept. Indian Affairs to a few matters. First in regard to the salary I am receiving for teaching the Indians in Sydney. When I came here last April it was with the understanding that my salary would be much larger than I really\nreceive Mrs. Donovan the former teacher, in addition to getting $1000 extra from the Dominion Government for doing extra work outside of school affairs was also receiving the Provincial Grant according to her licence. That was what I expected to receive when I made the engagement to take this school, but was disappointed in both.\n\nEver since I came here I have devoted quite a lot of extra time to matters outside of\nschool affairs as I find it would very hard for the pupils to make much progress in order, cleanliness, neatness etc., in the schoolroom, if they saw nothing but the reverse of affairs in their homes. Now I consider $300.00 per year a small salary in regard to the work I have to do. I therefore ask the department to reconsider their withdrawal of the Fulmination ship grant.\n\nAs around are teachers\nholding the same licence and doing more satisfactory work; these teachers are in all cases receiving a salary exceeding mine by something over $50.00 and upwards.\n\nIf the dept. sees fit to renew this fellowship grant, I will do the best I can for these people.\n\nPlease notify me of your decision in this matter as soon as possible.\n\nSince the first of quarter starting\nJune 6th, I have nine pupils in Standard I; four of these are under six years of age and the others are under ten. My standard II pupils, four in number, are also under ten years of age. Now I think if I would be supplied with a few dollars worth of kindergarten material quite a lot of good could be done with it in teaching colors, form, number etc.\n\nThe Steinberger Hendry Co.\nkeeps a fine supply of kindergarten material. I am sending a list of the articles I would require and if the department decides in favour of getting these supplies the order can be forwarded to\n\nThe Steinberger Hendry Co.,\n37 Richmond St., West,\nToronto, Can.\n\nThe total cost of material including postage will be over $400. Respectfully,\n\nRachel Macdonald\nSydney Q.T.B.\nOttawa, January 27, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMiss Rachel McDonald, teacher of the Indian school at Sydney, B.C., has made application for an increase of salary. Her predecessor, Miss Willie Connolly, received an addition to her salary of $100 for acting as field matron. When she resigned, the Department decided to continue the office of field matron, and Miss McDonald was engaged on the distinct understanding that her salary was to be at the rate of $300 per annum, which she accepted.\n\nShe has been less than a year in charge of the school, and unless it is the wish of the Department to revive the sinecure which was created solely for Miss Connolly's benefit, I think that Miss McDonald should be held to her agreement.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 20, 1906.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., applying for an increase of salary, and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot accede to your request.

This is all the money appropriated, and the Department must hold to its arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Rachel Macdonald,\nTeacher Indian School,\nSydney, C.B.\n27 Rue Gill College Avenue\nMontreal, Que.,\nApril 19th 1906\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose school returns of Miss McDonald, teacher of the Indian School at Sydney Cape Breton, which she forwarded to me here. I am very uneasy that shortly after I left home, Miss McDonald had word that her father was very ill and she was called home to nurse him. She did not return to Sydney and she has forwarded me her resignation as teacher of the Indian School. The school is now closed, but I am returning home next week, leaving here on Thursday 25th and as soon as possible I shall secure a teacher and have the school opened up again. I am sorry Miss McDonald was compelled to resign as she was a very good teacher and the little Indians were getting on very well under her direction.\n\nYours very respectfully,\nD.K.

The salary received by me at present, is less than that received by the lowest paid teacher of the Sydney staff, while I consider my work in the school-room, of quite as (lower)\nlabourious a character as that of\nthe teachers of the common school\nwork in the other schools.\n\nMoreover, the rate of board etc.\nhere is far in excess of that in\nthe other places in which Indian\nschools are situated in this\ncounty; hence the necessity of\nreceiving a salary in proportion\nto the cost of living.\n\nIn view of these considerations,\nI trust you will give the matter\nyour prompt and most careful\nattention,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMargaret A. McLellan.\nOttawa, February 18, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., enclosing a communication from Miss Margaret A. McLellan, teacher of the Sydney school, in which she applies for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, before the department can consider this application, it will require an answer to its letter of May 14, 1906, in which you were asked to state the qualifications, experience, etc., of the teacher. Apparently no reply was received to this letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nD.K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\nD. K. McIntyre\nPhysician and Surgeon\nCITY MEDICAL OFFICER\n\nSydney, C.B., Feb 27th 1908\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 25564 of dated Ottawa Feb. 18th 1908, I beg leave to say that Miss Margaret A. McCollum teacher of the Sydney School holds a Grade D licence with a Grade B scholarship that is to say she holds the rank of a Second Class Teacher in this province, but would only draw the Provincial allowance of a Third Class Teacher on account of her not having had any Normal School training. She has taught school for a period of five years and has been very successful. I feel almost sure I gave you this information before in a reply to your letter of May 14th 1906, but there is a possibility that I might not have.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nD.K. McIntyre\nIndian Agent\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMiss Margaret A. McLellan, teacher of the Sydney school, has applied for an increase of salary. She is at present in receipt of $300 per annum and has been in charge of this school since May, 1906. Miss McLellan holds a second-class non-professional certificate and third-class professional.\n\nThe Indian Agent, Dr. McIntyre, states that he considers the teacher's request a reasonable one, especially as, having charge of a city school, board costs her considerably more than it would in the country. He says she pays $3.50 per week for board.\n\nThere is an enrolment of 30 pupils at this school, and the Inspector in his last report states that Miss McLellan is doing very excellent work.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, I would suggest that, if funds can be spared, her salary be increased to $350 from April 1, next.\nOttawa, March 28, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 37th ult., I beg to say that the Department will increase the salary of Miss McLellan, teacher of the Sydney school, from $300 to $350, to take effect from the 1st of April.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise Miss McLellan accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nD.K. McIntyre, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI desire to recommend an increase in the salary of Miss McLellan, teacher of the Sydney school, from $350.00 to $400.00 from the 1st. of October. I inspected the school at Sydney and found the results of Miss McLellan's work gratifying. She is a competent teacher for any school and particularly for an Indian school as she is specially interested in the work and has a real capacity for it. A salary of $400.00 is not large for the City of Sydney. The school teacher must board in the City and the expenses of living are higher than in the country. The ordinary teachers in Sydney white schools receive about $390.00, and I do not think it would be out of the way to increase Miss McLellan's salary to $400.00.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, September 31, 1908.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to advise you that, as a recognition of your successful services as teacher of the Sydney Indian school, the Department has decided to increase your salary to $400.00 per annum from the 1st prox.\n\nThe Indian Agent will be advised to this effect.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. McLellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney Indian School,\nSydney, C.B.\nOttawa, September 31, 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Miss McLellan, teacher of the Sydney Indian school, from $550 to $400 per annum, to take effect on the 1st prox.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. M. MOLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nDeK. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\nSydney, C.B.,\nOct. 4, 1909.\n\nThe Sec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ult., and to extend to the Department my sincere appreciation of, and thanks for, the increase given me in my salary.\n\nThe increase in each quarterly cheque will amount to $12.50 which will be $87.50 for the term, the increase beginning as it does with the December quarter. May I hope that the Depart-\nment will arrange to make it an increase of $50.00 for the school term by sending a cheque for the $12.50 which it lacks of this amount with the regular quarterly cheque for the December quarter, thus making salary for present school term $400.\n\nAgain thanking the Department for the action already taken by them in this matter, I am,\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nMargaret A. MacLellan.\nOttawa, October 12th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will make the increase in your salary date from the beginning of last quarter, July 1st. A supplementary cheque for $12.50, being the amount owing you under this arrangement for the September quarter, will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. MacLellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, C. B.\nTeachers' Normal Institute\n\nFOR THE\n\nSix Eastern Counties of Nova Scotia.\n\nSydney, C. B., December 20th to 23rd, 1909.\n\nThe fourth session of the Teachers' Normal Institute for the Six Eastern Counties of Nova Scotia will be held in the City of Sydney commencing on the 20th day of December, 1909. This date has been selected as, perhaps, when everything is considered, the most suitable in the term. It is a time when school work is somewhat relaxed and when the closing of the schools for a week will not interfere appreciably with the progress of the pupils. On account of Christmas falling this year on Saturday there will be only three days for Institute work and it will in consequence be necessary to have a teaching session on one of the afternoons. But it is hoped that by extending the sittings a little and by shortening the lessons to a small extent nearly as much ground can be covered in three days as used to be covered in four days on former occasions.\n\nThe work of the Institute will again consist mainly of teaching exercises as the time-table indicates. For these the very best teachers obtainable will be secured. By means of a question box or similar arrangement all those present will be given opportunities to make any inquiries they may wish regarding teaching, school management, school law or any other matter in any way connected with school affairs. Times, of which ample notice will be given, will be set apart for the answering of these inquiries. It is expected that this feature of the session will prove of great value to everybody concerned and all are strongly urged to avail themselves of it. It would be a good idea for teachers from now onward to make notes of the points regarding which they may require advice or enlightenment. A number of the most prominent Provincial educationists will be invited to attend and to assist in this and other departments of the work. On one of the evenings a meeting open to the public generally will be held at which addresses on educational topics will be delivered by competent persons.\n\nIt may not be amiss to remind the teachers of the Counties interested that this Institute has been devised and is maintained solely for their benefit. The Inspectors who have charge of it are obliged, as one of their duties, to have a session held every second year. Their single purpose in the whole matter is to assist the teachers of their Divisions and, this being so, they expect that every teacher will render all the aid possible, in making every meeting a success. A few teachers will be entrusted with the conduct of the specimen lessons. A few will have to attend to the providing of classes and of accommodation for visitors. But of the great majority of teachers in the territory concerned nothing is asked except their attentive presence at the sessions. Teachers with no training or little experience are urged to attend, if at all possible, in order that they may learn; those whose ability is recognized are asked to come mainly that they may help along a worthy cause. But it may safely be predicted that every teacher whether of great or little experience, who shall come determined to play an earnest part in the work, will find ample opportunity for profitable employment.\n\nThe time necessarily lost from their schools by those who attend will, as usual, be allowed as regards payment of Provincial Aid and Municipal Fund. It is hoped that school boards will encourage their teachers to be present as improved work during the balance of the term will compensate many times over for the four days lost.\n\nThe usual arrangements respecting reduced fares on railways and steamboats will be made, if possible. Those who travel by the I. R. C. should get single tickets and a standard certificate. On small local lines, stage, rail or boat, it would be well for teachers to ask their own inspectors to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nThose who wish to have accommodations provided for them in Sydney will save themselves probable inconvenience by communicating with Mr. A. W. Woodill, Principal of the Central School, Sydney, C. B., Chairman of the Local Committee, at least a week before the opening of the session. Teachers who travel by the I. R. C. will be met at the station Monday evening.\n\nA. G. MACDONALD,\nChairman of the Executive Committee.\n\nT. M. PHELAN,\nSecretary of the Executive Committee.\nThe subjoined Time Table is proposed to be followed at the session of the Teachers' Normal Institute to be held at Sydney, C. B., beginning on Monday, December 20th, 1909.\n\nFor the teaching exercises four rooms will be used, two in the Academy and two in the Central School Building. These exercises will be conducted during the forenoons of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and the afternoon of Tuesday.\n\nThe first meeting, for organization purposes, will be held in the Assembly Hall of the Central School on Monday evening at 8.30, or about an hour after arrival of the early express from the West.\n\n| ROOM | A.

G. MacDONALD, Antigonish,\nChairman of Executive Committee\n\nT. M. PHALEN, North Sydney,\nSecretary Executive Committee.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe fourth session of the Teachers' Normal Institute for the Six Eastern Counties of Nova Scotia is to be held in this city during the three days preceding the regular date of closing of the schools for the Christmas Holidays, the first session being held on the evening of December 20th.\n\nAll the schools in the city are to be closed on this date to enable the teachers to attend the Institute. I am very desirous of attending these meetings and would ask the Department to sanction my closing school also on this date.\n\nThe enclosed circular and time table explain in detail the nature of the work.\nto be carried on during the Institute, which should prove very helpful to those attending.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable reply at an early date, I am,\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nMargaret A. MacLellan\nTeacher\n\n355055\nOttawa, December 4th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, asking permission to close the Sydney Indian school for the last three days of the school term to enable you to attend the meeting of the Teachers' Normal Institute.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the department is pleased to grant your request. You will be good enough when sending in the return to state thereon the reasons for the closing of the school on these days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. MacLellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, C.M.\nExtract from teacher's report on the Olsebockt school for the year ending March 31, 1910.\n\nThe women, with very few exceptions, go out to work by the day, with the result that the older children are kept at home to look after the younger ones. Children invariably attend school very irregularly after their twelfth year, or just as soon as they are strong enough to work.\n\nThe awarding of prizes of money ranging from fifty cents to a dollar or so, monthly, to children attending greatest number of days, might improve attendance. Another suggestion, I would make, is that the Department have circular letters sent to heads of families on reserve who have children of school age, warning them that if they do not send children to school a certain number of days each month (say 75% of school days) that a fine will be imposed.\nOttawa, March 10th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your report on the Sydney school for the current year it is noted that you consider the awarding of money prizes to children would prove an incentive to regular attendance.\n\nThe Department would be pleased to know the number of prizes you think ought to be given and the value.\n\nThe matter of compulsory attendance will be taken up with the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. MacLellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, C.H.\nOttawa, March 10th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss Margaret MacLellan, teacher of the Sydney school, in her report for the current year, suggests that compulsory attendance be enforced on this reserve. The Regulations relating the education of Indian children provide for the compulsory attendance of those between the ages of 6 and 15, and also for the appointment of a truant officer, if considered necessary for the enforcement. I am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of these Regulations, and the Department will be pleased to have your opinion as to the wisdom of putting them in force on this reserve.\n\nIt is also noted from Miss MacLellan's report that the Chief and other Indians of the Band take very little interest in the work of the school, and the Department would be glad if you would use your endeavours to have them take more active interest in the education of their children, as much can be done by the Chief and prominent Indians who have influence with the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nD. K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\nSydney, N.B., March 22nd, 1910\n\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nReplying to your letter No. 225264 dated Ottawa March 17th, 1910, I desire to acknowledge receipt of copy of regulations regarding Compulsory attendance of Indian children at School. While it is most desirable that Indian children attend school where schools are provided for them, and while I regret very much that the attendance is not better at the Sydney School, which affords every facility being only a few hundred yards from the children's quarters away from it, yet I fear that the putting in force of the Act would not have the desired effect. In the first place, I find that my Indians are not inclined to turn a finger without being paid and a Trust Officer would have to be employed at a Salary, and his work might not be very satisfactory after all. There are various reasons for irregularity in School attendance at the Sydney School, for the past year or so labour around Sydney has been scarce and the Indians own have no chance to earn much, as a consequence the...\nIndian women have to go out to wash and scrub in order to make a living, and when there is a baby or one or two very small children, the school going children have to stay home to mind them. The Indian women on this reserve are more industrious than the men but that they have to go out to work has a bad effect on the children as well as on the housekeeping generally. I believe that if the payling that would necessarily be paid to a truant officer were offered in the shape of small prizes for regular attendance at school, that the result would be better. I shall do you suggest endeavor as much as possible to stir up more interest in the parents and impress upon them the importance of sending their children regularly to school, and if those efforts fail, then it might be judicious to give the Compulsory Act a trial.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 30th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant in reference to the enforcement of the school Regulations on the Sydney Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is also of opinion that it might be better to consider other means to obtain a good attendance before putting the regulations into force, and trusts that your efforts with the Indians will have the desired effect.\n\nPrizes will also be offered and in this connection I may say that on the 10th instant the teacher was asked to state the number of prizes she thinks ought to be given and the value. No doubt a reply will be received from her in due course, if not you might kindly take the matter up with her.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to use a more substantial paper when corresponding with the Department, as that used in the communication above referred to will not stand filing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nD. K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\nSydney, C.B.\nApril 2, 1910.\n\nThe Sec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter No. 225264/1 would pay that I consider a donation of a dollar and a half ($1.50) monthly to be distributed in prizes would be the least amount that would do.\n\nThis amount would be divided equally among those attending the same number of days during the month, and a smaller amount given to the child attending the second largest number.\n\nIn suggesting the giving of prizes as an incentive to more regular attendance, I wish it understood by the Department that my idea is to have it done as an experiment. Should they follow the suggestion, I shall be\npleased to inform them, after a two or three months' trial, as to whether or not it has brought about satisfactory results.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nMargaret A. MacLellan.\nOttawa, April 11, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the giving of prizes to the pupils of your school monthly.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to try this experiment. You may, therefore, purchase for each of the months of this quarter prizes to the value of $1.50 to be distributed as you see best. You will be good enough to watch carefully the result of this and report at the end of the quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. MacLellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, C.B.\nSydney, N.S.\nMay 21, 1910\n\nThe Sec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th. No. 225264 advising me that the Department had decided to act on my suggestion regarding the giving of prizes to the children of my school.\n\nI wish to bring to your notice that when I made this suggestion, I specified that the prizes given should be prizes of money. My reason for this is that such a prize appeals to the children very much more than anything that could be purchased for them for the same amount of money.\n\nI, therefore, for the month of April, distributed among the deserving ones, prizes of money to the amount of $7.50 and enclose\nherewith, the bill for same. If convenient,\nwhen forwarding to me the amount for it,\nI think it would be as well to make\nout the cheque for the whole amount to\nbe given in prizes during the quarter,\nnamely $4.58, and thus save the trouble\nof having to send three separate cheques.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nMargaret A. MacLellan\n\nPay.\nSydney, 6th May 21, 1910.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nTo Margaret A. MacLellan, Teacher.\n\nTo each given to school children in prizes - $1.50\nOttawa, 10th June, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn view of the report contained in your letter of the 21st ultimo, I beg to say that the Department will allow you to give prizes to the value of $6.50 per quarter to the Indian pupils attending the school of which you are in charge. It is observed from your letter that you have already awarded prizes in cash to the value of $1.50. You may make out a voucher in detail and in duplicate which should be certified to by you and by the Indian Agent for the amount which has been expended. The voucher may be made to cover not only the cash distributions, but the amount required for prizes for one quarter. Payment of the prize money may be made quarterly in future upon requisition in the form of a certified account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. McLellan,\nTeacher, Indian School,\nSydney, N. S.\nSydney, C.B.,\nNov 16, 1910\n\nThe Sec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing printed slips acknowledging receipt of the pictures of their Majesties the King and Queen. In regard to having the framing of the same done by the school children I would say that the children attending school this term are too young to be able to frame pictures of that size properly. With the approval of the Agent, Mr. MacIntyre, I have had the pictures framed at a small expense, and the bill for the same will be forwarded to the department by the Agent.\n\nI beg to acknowledge also the receipt of the book on \"Calisthenics in Indian Schools.\" I may mention that during the past two terms I have been giving the children Calisthenics (over)\nalong these lines, having taken the prescribed course in \"Physical training and Drill in Public Schools\" in January, 1909, and received a Grade B certificate for same. Since receiving the book on Calisthenics from the Department, I have, when giving the exercises to the children, adhered to the rules set down in it.\n\nIn my School Report last March, I suggested to the Department, the giving of prizes of money to the children, which the Department acted upon. I stipulated at the time that, after a fair trial, I should report whether the giving of the same had the effect of securing a better attendance. There was a slight improvement but not sufficiently marked to warrant the continuance of prize giving. What I consider now, might bring about more regular attendance, would be the giving of a small treat of fruit or confectionery (preferably fruit) once a week or fortnight. The treat would be given on any afternoon during this period, and the children, anxious to receive it, and not known...\non just what day to expect it, would, I think,\nnaturally try harder to come to school regularly.\nA dollar a month, (which would be fifty cents\nless than the amount given in prizes last term)\ninvested in fruit or something equally nutritious\nwould be quite enough for four such treats\nfor the number school children enrolled. I\nmerely offer this as a suggestion and leave\nit entirely to the judgment of the department\nas to whether it shall be carried out or not.\n\nPlease accept thanks for the copy of the\n\"Report of the Dept. of Indian Schools,\" which I\nreceived some two weeks ago. I am,\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nMargaret A. MacLellan.\nSydney, N.S.,\nNov. 17, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to apply to the department for an increase of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) in my salary for the present school term, namely the term begun with the September quarter and ending on June 30, 1911.\n\nThe increased cost of living, in Sydney, compels me to ask for this increase. I am paying, at present, for board alone, almost half the amount I receive in salary. This is considerably more than I have had to pay during the past terms, but is the least for which board can be obtained.\n\nThe salaries paid to teachers in this city are higher than those paid in any other town in Nova Scotia, and the principal reason (over)\nfor this, is, that the cost of living (board etc.) is considerably more here than in the other towns. The lowest paid teacher on the Public School Staff of the city receives more in salary than the amount received by me at present.\n\nI trust, then, that the Department will give my request your usual kind and careful consideration. I beg to thank the Department most sincerely for the courtesy and kind consideration with which you have treated any requests or suggestions I have made during the four years I have had charge of the Sydney School. I shall, so long as I have the honor to be in your service, continue to discharge my duties as faithfully and well as lies in my power.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMargaret A. MacLellan.\nOtterburn, November 24, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reference to your suggestion as to the giving of prizes I beg to say that the Department will try the experiment and allow you $1.00 a month for each of the school months to be expended in the purchase of a weekly treat in the way of fruit, etc., for the children. You will be good enough to report the results at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. MacLellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, N.B.\nOttawa, November 24, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in which you apply for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Sidney Indians school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances related by you and the fact that your services are satisfactory, the Department will grant you an increase of $50.00 to date from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. Maclellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, N.S.\nOttawa, November 24, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to grant Miss Maclellan, teacher of the Sydney school, an increase of $50.00 in her salary from the first of the current quarter and she has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your No. 2152647 dated Ottawa Nov. 23rd 1910, I have to say that I thank the Department for having increased the salary of Miss Lee Zeller, teacher at the Sydney School, by the amount of eight dollars. She is a diligent and faithful servant and is doing good work among our Indians and I have no doubt the increase in her salary will induce her to make greater efforts still in the direction of perfecting her work.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nD.K. McKeague\nIndian Agent\nSchools\n\nSydney, N.S.,\nDec. 9, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., No. 225264/1, advising me that the Department has approved the desired increase in salary. I wish to thank the Department most sincerely for your action in this matter.\n\nI am also in receipt of your communication of the same date to the effect that the Department is willing to give an allowance of $1.00 to be expended in buying weekly treats for the school children. I have decided to begin to give this treat during the first week of the quarter beginning Jan. 1st, 1911.\nI shall make arrangements to buy the fruit, etc., for the treat at one store and the bill for the same can be forwarded to the Department at the end of the month, through the Agent for the School, if these arrangements will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to report the results after it has been given a reasonable trial.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nMargaret MacLellan,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, December 13, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply I beg to say that you may commence giving the weekly treats to the children attending the Sydney school after the Christmas holidays and forward the accounts each month to the Department through the local agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Margaret A. Maclellan,\nTeacher,\nSydney, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI write concerning the Indian School at Sydney.\n\nMiss McKeown, the present teacher, had always understood that if she intended to leave at any time, she was to give me three months' notice in advance. She went away at the beginning of vacation and on her return when all the schools were reopened and practically all the teachers available were engaged, she informed me that she was in poor health and would have to resign but suggested I look for a substitute a younger sister of hers who holds only a Third Class provincial license but who has taught school for one year. I told Miss McKeown that I was not disposed to take a teacher who held only Third Class and expressed my displeasure at her not giving me timely notice. I told her also to finish this quarter which ends August 1st and that by that time I would probably have another teacher.\n\nNow, at this very time all the experienced teachers are engaged as the school year begins Sept. 1st. But there is a young lady living quite close to the Indian School (Miss Edna Gough) who took a first class license at the provincial examination last July. She is about nineteen years of age and a very clever girl, she never taught a public school, but she graduated from the Convent here in Sydney last Summer with high honors. She is willing to teach the Indian School for the same salary that Miss McKeown was getting viz., four hundred and fifty dollars a year. I think she would probably take four hundred if I said so, and I feel quite confident from my knowledge of her that she will give general satisfaction.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible if I may engage her.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.K. Robertson, Indian Agent\nOttawa, September 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant advising the Department of the resignation of Miss McLellan, teacher of the Sydney School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn the loss of Miss McLellan's services and you are hereby authorized to engage Miss Edna Gough, the holder of a First-class certificate at a salary of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S.\nExtract from Agent's Report respecting the Sydney Indian Day School for the month of June, 1912. Original on File\n\nWe have tried almost all kinds of methods to keep up the attendance but we have failed. I do not think, however, that it is the fault of the children as much as it is the fault of the parents. The Chief is practically no good and his captain on the reserve, may easily be ranked as second to that, so that the children are allowed to play about the reserve when they ought to be at school. I am truly tired of the whole business.\n\nSgd. D.K. McIntyre\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Sydney Day School for the month of June I beg to say that your remarks with regard to the non-attendance of children have been noted.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report to the Department whether you think the services of a truant officer would be of any benefit on this reserve. If so, one might be appointed and steps taken to put into force the school regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour favour No. 225264/1 dated Ottawa July 18th 1912 was duly received and would have been answered without delay only that the Indian School is now closed for the summer holidays and will not open again until the first week in September. I should strongly recommend that a trained officer be appointed on the scene when the School re-opens. Every other effort has been put forth both by myself and the teacher to get the children to attend school and when it is a fact that there are 25 school going children on the reserve, all of whom are within gunshot of the school house and the average daily attendance over two years higher than 8 or 9, it is clear that efforts of ridicule have failed to produce satisfactory results. Therefore it is that I believe in some stringent measures being taken, the parents of these children are in most cases fairly comfortable and could easily without inconvenience themselves pay a small fine if they incurred the penalty.\n\nAnd an example of this might come from a very palatable lesson.\n\nI believe all the more that the children do not attend school because at school I have continued in former efforts. The boys who attend the school and they attained to the 4th grade, are giving a good account of themselves by being industrious, ambitious and of good conduct. This being the case I regard it as unfortunate that so many of the young Indians, boys and girls, are growing up in ignorance where the facilities for giving them such education as they require are so abundantly provided.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in reference to the appointment of a truant officer at Sydney.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department quite agrees with you and is prepared to allow a salary for this service to some efficient person and I have to ask you to nominate an Indian whom you think would perform this duty satisfactorily and obtain from him a price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. K. McIntyre, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S.\nOttawa, December 24, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the quarterly return from the Sydney School showing that Miss Margaret B. McLellan has been in charge since the first of October, apparently.\n\nThere is nothing in the records of the Department to show when or by whom she was appointed or the rate of salary at which she was to be paid. Appointments of this kind should not be made except by the Department and I have to ask you to be good enough to state by whose authority she took charge. You should also at the same time state when the previous teacher, Miss Gough, resigned and by whom her resignation was accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. J.

Dated April 29, 1913.\n\nTeacher, Margaret E. McLellan, hold B certificate and first rank M.P.Q. of Nova Scotia. Has no license. Has had no training. Age, 17 years October 22nd, 1912. Salary, $400 per annum.\n\nThe teacher seems to have tolerably accurate notions in regard to methods of teaching, but I am afraid her work is not very well done. Her manner as a teacher is not good. With training and experience she might in time develop into a fairly good teacher but I am strongly inclined to think she has little natural pedagogical ability. She seems to have poor control of the pupils and though the dirt of their faces was nauseating she paid no attention to this at all.\n\nI am very much averse to saying anything which might work an injustice to Miss McLellan but I think it proper to state that in my opinion a change of teacher is desirable. No teacher of any worth would permit the children to sit in their seats in the condition in which some of them were yesterday. I have in mind simply the horrible dirtiness of their faces. A capable teacher ought to be obtainable for the salary paid. I mean by this a teacher who has had normal school training and who has been successful in charge of a school.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Bailey,\n\nI beg to call your attention to an extract hereunder from the report of Mr. T. M. Phelan, Inspector of schools for the province of Nova Scotia, in regard to the present teacher of the Sydney Indian School, Miss Margaret E. McLellan. You will see that Mr. Phelan states that a capable teacher ought to be obtained for the salary paid.\n\nI think that, in view of the Inspector's remarks on this school, the Department would not be justified in retaining Miss McLellan's services after the end of the current quarter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Bannerman\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA.

He said there could not be a complaint that I work that school when it was in a run-down condition and that every time he came to the school he found a vast improvement; he said he would do anything for me if I wanted to keep the school. Let it go, said I will lose it anyway. I would like to teach the month of Sept. There is only all right my last quarter of the year.\n\nI taught three months there before I could draw my salary.

J. Sparrow, M. D. I am the Parish Priest of Sydney and the Indians here form a part of my flock; consequently, I have an interest in their welfare, both spiritual and temporal, and I feel that I have good reason to protest against the treatment that is being accorded them. Last year Miss MacLellan, a most competent teacher and a young lady of the highest moral character was dismissed without any reason being assigned to the young lady herself, and a Miss Hines put in her place. The character of this latter girl is evident from the fact that she was forced to get married on the 23rd of Feb. 1914, and that her baby was born on the 19th of April following. Even after her marriage, she persisted in keeping the school until I had to protest most vigourously with the agent for tolerating such a state of affairs. Miss Edna Gough, a most estimable young lady and an excellent teacher then took the school, and was led by Dr. Sparrow to believe that she would have the school for the coming year as well. You may judge of her surprise to-day when the Agent informed her that she would have to look for another school. This is the 17th and the great bulk of our schools open on the 24th. Only by the merest accident can she secure another school, so I leave you\nOttawa, August 21, 1914.\n\nC. J.

They are quite a number of teachers teaching at this reservation, but there wasn't one that rendered her or his services as good as Miss Douglas. She is making children a splendid headway also the time both in Reading and writing, English speaking and chiefly in catechism.\nI would be much pleased to see her continuing her services as we think it is most difficult to find a teacher that will equal Miss Douglas's work. People are very strong for her and children are creeping for her. We do not see why the government that she will see Miss Douglas continuing her services as we do not find any complaints about her.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Christians\n\nIndian Reserve\n\nSydney O.B.\n\nDated Aug 19th 1914\nOttawa, August 27, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th instant I beg to say that the services of Miss Gough as teacher of the Sydney Indian School will be retained for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLain\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Joseph Christmas,\nIndian Reserve,\nSydney, O.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd inst., and to say that I shall visit Sydney without delay to make careful enquiry into matters pertaining to the Indian school there, with a view to reporting the facts to the Department, as desired, at an early date.\n\nI am already aware that instead of making any progress during the past two years, this school has retrograded; and I was disposed to attribute the fact to frequent changes of teachers within that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAs requested by your letter of the 22nd ultimo, I visited Sydney this week, and having investigated matters affecting the Indian school there, found the situation substantially as described by Revd. D. A. MacAdam in his letter of Aug. 17th. to the Department.\n\nI would say that the Agent was unfortunate in having appointed last year such a teacher as Miss Hines proved to be, but I do not think he should be condemned for that, because she was duly qualified and well recommended. Nor can he be blamed for her failure as a teacher, or for her moral character, which was very bad; but he may not have been vigilant enough in his supervision of her work in school, as, otherwise, she would have been dismissed sooner than she was.\n\nI have not been able to discover any reason for the attempt, which seems to have been made, to dismiss the present teacher, Miss Edna Gough, and in which I cannot believe Mr. Sparrow took the initiative, because he speaks well\n\nof\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nof her capabilities as a teacher, although he thinks she is somewhat lacking in the matter of discipline, but I feel that he is disposed to be a little too exacting in that particular. At any rate, he intimated to me that the attempt had failed, and that he was satisfied to have Miss Gough retained as Indian teacher at Sydney.\n\nIn my judgment, her dismissal would be a mistake. She belongs to a good family, and is a young lady of the highest moral character. Her professional qualifications are official and unquestionable, and she has a teaching experience that should be valuable.\n\nMiss Gough opened school on the 1st. inst. as Indian teacher at Sydney, and I hope nothing further will occur tending to deprive her of the situation, or the Indians of her services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 14, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to official letter of the 22nd ultimo in regard to the Sydney School I beg to say that, as a result of the inquiry made into the matters pertaining to this school, the Department has decided to retain the services of Miss Gough as teacher there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacAdam, P.P.,\nChurch of the Sacred Heart,\nSydney, N.S.\nOttawa, September 14, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the matters pertaining to the Sydney School I beg to say that as a result of the investigation held by Mr. Superintendent Boyd the Department has decided to retain the services of Miss Gough as teacher of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. Sparrow, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S.\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThe great obstacle to progress in Indian Schools which I visit is the fact that the children know so little about English, and as they never attempt to speak it among themselves at school or at home, improvement is very slow. Teachers should endeavour to get them to talk more in class, particularly in discussing the meaning of the words and phrases in the reading lessons. Where their powers of observation and memory have room to play they are apt to do really well. For instance they spell as well as white children and usually their writing is good. The same may, I think, be said of drawing where it is taught. They do not appear to be much good at geography, but most of the people I meet are not sufficiently advanced to take up this subject.\n\nSgd. T. M. Phelan,\nInspector.\nSydney, N.

Commissioners E. T. McKeeen and E. C. Hazrahan reported at last night's meeting that, in order to make suitable recognition of the additional duties and skills required to be performed by the members of the grade staffs in order to form a basis for the increase which we intend to propose, we beg leave to suggest the following scale of payment to be considered as existing now in the common schools:\n\n| Grade | D | C | B | A |\n|-------|---|---|---|---|\n| Grade 1 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 2 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 3 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 4 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 5 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 6 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 7 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n| Grade 8 | 400 | 420 | 440 | 450 |\n\nThese are to be taken as initial salaries apart from the increase of $25 per annum now given according to Board regulation. Using the above schedule as a basis your Committee has found that such an increase of $225 should be added to the amount apportioned to each grade, in order to meet the situation as it stands. The schedule of initial salaries which we propose will therefore work out as follows:\n\n| Grade | D | C | B | A |\n|-------|---|---|---|---|\n| Grade 1 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 2 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 3 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 4 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 5 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 6 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 7 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n| Grade 8 | 625 | 645 | 665 | 675 |\n\nWe further urge (1) that the following increase of $25 per annum for teaching experience of five years or more shall be given: (2) that a Normal school diploma be given to all teachers who have taught five years continuously; (3) that $25 per year extra after the first two years and up to the end of the fifth year of satisfactory teaching in Sydney be granted to any teacher who has had five years successful teaching in Sydney be regarded as equivalent to a Normal school diploma; (4) that, in engaging new teachers, the Board shall give preference to those who have had five years' experience elsewhere be rated as equivalent to two years' in Sydney.\n\nAs an illustration of what is intended take the case of a teacher under this schedule whose salary at $625 until his successful receives $770 at the end of five years. This would be equivalent to a Normal school diploma. This added to the present salary of $400 will net him $370 per annum. The other grades receive in proportion:\n\n**Principals.**\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 5 or more departments should receive $1100.\n\nFemale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 5 or more departments should receive $1000.\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 3 to 5 departments should receive $950.\n\nFemale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 3 to 5 departments should receive $850.\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 2 to 3 departments should receive $800.\n\nFemale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 2 to 3 departments should receive $750.\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of less than 2 departments should receive $700.\n\nFemale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of less than 2 departments should receive $650.\n\nAll principals should receive a yearly bonus of $100 for the services rendered.\n\nWe would recommend that the salary of the Superintendent of Education and Expression be increased to $750 and that the salary of the Assistant Superintendent, who has to do much substitute work be advanced to $700. The Superintendent who has to shoulder the care and responsibility of all the schools in the municipality, the duties of which should be increased by $100.\n\n**Academy Increases.**\n\nIn regard to the Academy, we would recommend that Mr. Creelman, Vice-Principal Ellis and Mr. Archibald on account of their long service and because they have been promoted, be granted an increase of $150 each, and that Mr. Murray, who has been more recently employed and who holds positions as these may be present pressing needs which it would be well to review, we suggest that, if this recommendation is adopted, the teachers are receiving annually, including province wide allowance, $6000. Those who are receiving less than $6000 a year, while they are doing very well, are getting a little more than $600 find it extremely difficult to make ends meet. We believe that the situation is too much to expect either that they will remain in the same position or that they will be able to fill their places when they leave. We feel that it is only fair that they should be able to worry it out for a year or two, but would it not be in the best interest of the community to provide them with a little more money? Incidentally we may\nThese are to be taken as initial salaries apart from the increase of $25 per annum now given according to Board regulation. Using the above schedule as a basis your Committee now begs leave to suggest that a flat increase of $25 be added to the amount apportioned to each grade, in order to meet the situation as it stands. The schedule of initial salaries which we propose will therefore work out as follows:\n\n| Grade | Initial Salary | Increase |\n|-------|---------------|----------|\n| Grade 1 | $400 | $675 |\n| Grade 2 | $420 | $695 |\n| Grade 3 | $440 | $715 |\n| Grade 4 | $460 | $735 |\n| Grade 5 | $480 | $755 |\n| Grade 6 | $500 | $775 |\n| Grade 7 | $520 | $795 |\n| Grade 8 | $540 | $815 |\n\nWe further submit (1) that the existing increase of $25 per annum for teachers other than principals, giving satisfactory service for five years be maintained; (2) that the Normal diploma be rated as entitling the holder to $25 per year after the first two years and until the end of the fifth year of satisfactory service; (3) that three years satisfactory service in any school be rated as equivalent to a Normal School diploma; (4) that in engagements elsewhere in teaching experience be rated as equivalent to two years in Sydney.\n\nAn illustration of what is intended take the case of C teacher under the schedule. He would receive $645 at the end of five years or $845 in all. If successful he receives $770 at the end of five years or $970 in all. This is equivalent to a Normal School diploma. This added to the provincial grant of $50 will net him $925 per annum. The other grades behave in proportion.\n\n**Principals.**\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 10 or more departments should receive $1150.\n\nFemale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of 10 or more departments should receive $1000.\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of from 7 to 9 departments should receive $750.\n\nFemale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of from 7 to 9 departments should receive $700.\n\nMale principals, holding Grade B, in charge of less than 5 departments should receive $725.\n\nFemale principals should receive a yearly salary of $150 for successful service up to five years.\n\nWe respectfully recommend that the salary of the teacher of electives and expression be increased to $750 per annum. The salary of the supply assistant, who has to do much substituting work, be advanced to $700 per annum. In the absence of the principal, he has to shoulder the care and responsibility of all the eighty odd common school departments should be increased by $100.\n\n**Academy Increases.**\n\nIn regard to the Academy, we would recommend that Principal Creedman, Vice Principal Ellis and Mr. Archibald be granted an increase of $150 per annum. Because they hold Academic licenses, that they be paid $150 per annum each. These are as these may be present pressing needs which it would be unprofitable to delay. We further state that, if this report is adopted, the payments begin with the next cheque issued by the Board dating from January 1, 1919.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n**Committee Files Report.**\n\nAt the January meeting your Committee reported progress and was instructed to make further investigation. After full and careful investigation we have come to certain findings which we hereby submit to the approval of the Board. We desire to state that there is no more important duty devolving upon us than the proper moulding of the young for future usefulness as citizens we teach. We believe that the best way to do this is in this meritorious work and do it satisfactorily. We desire to give our earnest reward in material and moral support.\n\nTo qualify for the teacher's position requires hard and constant preparation. The work itself calls for the exercise of such a high degree of care, patience and skill that the success thereof is regarded as a public good and is regarded as a public asset of incalculable value.\n\nDuring the past fifty years industrial conditions have been such that a large number of young men and women have found employment in the province as a respectable means of earning a livelihood. The result was that the demand and school sections acquired the habit of paying their teachers wages which were not commensurate with the services rendered. Industrial conditions have changed. Other industrial avenues to higher rewards have been opened so attractive, that many communities bid farewell to the idea of maintaining a school. To compete face to face with the big cities is a difficult task. We must provide inducements in the form of an increased scale of wages.\n\n**Provincial Authoritative Law.**\n\nIt is a matter of fact regretted that the provincial government when asked to add to the provincial grants to the various grades did not see fit to do so. It is a fact that the provincial establishment has multiplied far faster than the resources of the province. To realize the full benefit of the teachers' ability we must do what we can to remove the financial worries to make it unnecessary for them to engage in outside occupations. We must also secure them from the reproach of constituting the poorest paid profession.\n\nAfter careful study and research, we find that the average individual teacher in the province, and particularly in the common schools, is forced to live and maintain a position of respectability. Most of them receive a provincial grant, sums varying from $420 to $670. There are those who receive $900 and running into cobs. Those who are getting a little more than $600 find it impossible to get ends meet. Laboring under these conditions it is too much to expect either that others will be available to fill their places when they leave or that the present teachers will be able to worry it out for a year or two, but would it not be better to provide the remedy. Incidentally we may say, that I am convinced that the janitors in eight of our public schools, who need no compensation for their labor, whose labor is entirely manual, receive larger pay than the highly trained experts in charge of the same classes.\n\n**Salaries Paid as Present.**\n\nAt the present time we are paying salaries in the common schools, including an advance of $25 per annum up to five years service as follows:\n\n- Grade D\u2014Female $300 to $455\n- Grade C\u2014Female $400 to $525\n- Grade B\u2014Female $450 to $550\n- Grade A\u2014Female $400\n- Grade A\u2014Female $425 to $550\n\nThe above report was adopted unanimously by the school Board.\nOttawa, March 27, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nA request has been received for an increase in salary to Miss Katherine Gallagher, teacher of the Sydney Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is allowing her an increase of $100.00 per annum on her present salary of $400.00 from April 1st, next, making her salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum from that date. She is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J.

Gallagher, teacher of the Sydney Indian Day School. This increase is made in view of her faithful and satisfactory service during the past 4\u00bd years.\n\nFrom the above date, Miss Gallagher will be paid at the rate of $550 per annum, plus a bonus of $150.00\u2014a total of $700.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nIndian Reservation,\nSydney, N.S.,\nFeb. 25, 1923\n\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you of the circumstances which is a problem to me at present. I am a janitor of the Indian day school here, and the conditions in the day school are rather unsanitary, due to public prayer meetings which are held three times a week Wednesday, Friday and Sunday for the Lenten season. It is considered unhealthy for the health of the children who are attending the school. The conditions in the school room is to speak of a truth is unsanitary, for the smoking, spitting, etc., makes a foul air unfit to breathe in the morning.\n\nIs this permitted? Please give me a satisfactory answer, I will be much obliged if you kindly send me Rules and Regulations which will instruct me to follow.\n\nI Remain,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJoe C. Marshall\n(Janitor)\nOTTAWA, March 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, informing the Department that prayer meetings are being held three times each week in the Sydney Indian Day School and that, after these meetings, the building is left in a very unsanitary condition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not understood why smoking, etc., should be allowed at meetings of this kind.\n\nEnquiry is being made regarding the conducting of these meetings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Joe C. Marshall,\nIndian Reservation,\nSydney, N.S.\nOTTAWA, March 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a communication from the janitor of the Sydney Indian Day School, referring to the conducting of religious services in the school building and the condition in which the classroom is left after these meetings.\n\nThe Department can hardly understand why it is necessary to hold these meetings in the school as, no doubt, there is a church of the faith to which these Indians belong near enough for them to attend. I shall be pleased if you will enquire into this matter and state what clergymen or other parties conduct these meetings, and also, if you are aware of the same, what authority the Indians have for conducting these services in the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss K.

Christmas, with the approval of Superintendent A. J. Boyd.\n\nI remain,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nCatherine Gallagher.\nOffice of Indian Chief\n\nSydney, N.S. July 3rd 1925\n\nJ.W. McLean Esq.,\nDistrict Deputy Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been led to understand that the department is prohibiting the use of our school house for holding council and prayer meetings on Sundays, to which I agree on the grounds that the school houses are not the proper places for such meetings. But I beg to inform the department that in the past our school house has been used for that purpose by authority of certain Indian officials, and the house is always kept in good condition in order to maintain a good government. Of the kind council meetings are absolutely necessary, and we have no proper or suitable place in the reserve for such meetings. It is the custom of Micmac\nIndians to have proper meetings on Sundays and other holy days of obligation for those who are unable to attend the Church services. Both meetings are not held now owing to the recent order of the department and it is very inconvenient indeed. I would like very much if possible if some special arrangement be made by the department giving us the privilege of using our school-house for such meetings as I cannot see my way clear to make a requisition for a much needed council-house owing to the present removal talk. Authority, if possible from the department direct would be more appreciated, because previous authorities are now considered null and void. Trusting this will be granted. I beg to remain\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nP.E. Christmas, Indian Chief\nOttawa, July 10th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Chief B. E. Christmas, Sydney, N.S., requesting permission to use the school house for the holding of council and prayer meetings. Last March a complaint was received from the janitor of the school regarding the condition in which the building was left after these meetings, which were held three evenings a week during the Lenten season. He stated that smoking, spitting, etc., were allowed and that the building was very unsanitary when the pupils assembled in the mornings after these meetings. The Chief states that there is no place available in which to hold the council meetings, and that the prayer meetings, which were held on Sundays and other holy days of obligation for those who were unable to attend the church services, have been discontinued, and he is anxious that the privilege of holding them be granted again.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as to your views regarding the granting of the school building for the purpose of holding church service and council meetings. The Department hardly understands why it is necessary to allow prayer meetings in the school, as, no doubt, there is a church of the faith to which these Indians belong near enough for them to attend. Kindly state if these prayer meetings are conducted by a clergyman, and if it is necessary that they be conducted in the school building. The Department would offer no objection to the conducting of meetings for the benefit of the Band, provided smoking and spitting are not allowed, and the school is cleaned and put in good condition after these meetings. We will await your reply before deciding as to whether authority can be granted for the holding of the council meetings and church service in the school building. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, July 10th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, requesting permission to hold council and prayer meetings in the school building at the Sydney Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that enquiry is being made regarding your request, and you will be further advised as to the Department's decision in the matter at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. B. L. Chisholm,\nSydney,\nN.S.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the contents of your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. - There being no councillor at Sydney Reserve besides Chief Christmas, I cannot understand what need there is of a place to hold council meetings, and consequently I do not think that his request in this case deserves consideration.\n\n2. - So far as I am aware, no church service in the serious sense of the term is ever held in the school house. Members of the Sydney band, including Mr. Christmas as leader, have been assembling occasionally in the building to say prayers, with the result described to you by the janitor of the school as to the condition he always found the place after these devotions, and in view of the pittance he gets for the performance of his duties, which he discharges faithfully, I am not surprised that he has complained to you about the matter. I have no knowledge of these assemblies having been conducted on any occasion by a clergyman. At present there is almost strife between Chief Christmas, who has three or four followers, and the other members of the band. In view of this fact itself, I think the Department should refuse permission to use the school house as desired by him. Furthermore, there is a church of the faith (Catholic) to which Sydney Indians belong within a short distance of their reserve, and they are at liberty to use it any time between sunrise and sundown for devotional exercises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, requesting permission to hold council and prayer meetings in the Sydney Indian Day School, I beg to say that upon enquiry being made the Department cannot see that there is any need for the granting of the school building for the purposes mentioned.\n\nRegarding the holding of prayer meetings, I may say that there is a church of the faith to which the Sydney Indians belong within a short distance of their reserve, and they are quite at liberty to attend the services. There is no need for holding either these services or council meetings in the school building, and the Department cannot, therefore, accede to your request for the use of the building, and our Agent at Sydney is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. B. E. Christmas,\nSydney, N.S.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nA request has been received from Chief Christmas, of the Sydney Band, for permission to hold council and prayer meetings in the Sydney Indian Day School. We referred this matter to Mr. Superintendent Boyd, and he states that there is no necessity for the school building being used for these purposes, and that the Indians can attend a church of the faith to which they belong which is located within a short distance of the Reserve. The Superintendent states that he does not think the request to hold council meetings in this building deserves any consideration. We have informed the Chief that we cannot allow the use of the building for any other than school purposes, and you will be good enough to see that these instructions are, in future, carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sugden, Sydney, N.S., in which he states that as a result of a storm two of the small outhouses at the Pemberton Reservation were blown from their foundations and smashed to pieces; and that one of the out buildings at the Day School was upset.\n\nIt will cost about $10.00 to replace the latter building on its foundation and secure it there. The other two buildings will have to be rebuilt.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that you grant authority to have this work done, and that figures be submitted by a local contractor for the rebuilding of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the lst instant, informing the Department that as a result of a storm two of the small outhouses on the Memberton Reserve were blown from their foundations and destroyed, also that one of the outbuildings at the Sydney Indian Day School was upset.\n\nYou may arrange to have the outbuilding at the day school replaced on its foundation and secured there. The expenditure should not exceed the estimate of approximately $10.00. When this work has been completed, a certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the two outbuildings on the Reserve, you should submit prices from a local contractor for the rebuilding of same. When information as to the cost of this work is received, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I think it will be difficult to have the sanitary work done by tender or contract, and as the reverend gentleman named is a practical man of affairs I think you had better allow him to have the oversight of the expenditure, which I can assure you will be a satisfactory matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: \"Poor copy\"]\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecty. Indian Dept.,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, 28th August, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, which only reached the Department today and bears the Sydney postmark of the 25th instant; and in reply I beg to inform you that the Department has acted on your suggestion to place the appropriations for the erection of the new schoolhouse and the carrying on of the sanitary work contemplated on the Sydney reserve, in the hands of Rev. D.M. MacAdam, Indian Agent at that place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary\n\nArthur Kendall, Esq., M.D., M.P.\nSydney,\nCape Breton,\nN.S.\nOTTAWA, 26th August, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the erection of a new schoolhouse on the Sydney reserve, I beg to enclose herewith plan and specifications for a building which, it is thought, will meet the requirements. The amount provided for this work is $700.00, which is considered to be quite sufficient to cover the cost of the building with the necessary furniture, equipment and outbuildings.\n\nI should like you to give this matter your immediate attention as it is desirable to have the building erected as soon as possible so that there may be no delay in opening the school.\n\nIf you think it advisable to call for tenders you may do so.\n\nThe matter of appointing a teacher will have to rest until arrangements are made for providing the building, which should be placed on a suitable site on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. D.M. MacAdam,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, C.B.\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary\nSydney, Sept. 15th 1902\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was sick in bed when I received your communication re Indian School being built at Sydney. I have endeavoured to obtain the lowest possible figures for the construction of the building, and a reputable builder will undertake to put up the building without any surcharge whatever for less than $7000. I have a good reliable man who will finish it according to specifications for $7000, and with your permission I shall give him the contract. Possibly the department may be induced to furnish it; besides, it must be remembered that the cost of putting up buildings in Sydney is at least $300 more than it was three years ago. At present every thing comes high in this town. Hoping soon to get permission to go on with the building.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nA.M. MacAdam,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. Hobson Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 19th September, 1902\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant relative to the erection of a new schoolhouse on the Sydney reserve, I beg to say that in view of your statement that you are unable to obtain tenders from reputable builders for this building for less than $700.00, you may close with a reliable man for this amount.\n\nYou will be expected to supervise the work and see that it is carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications already sent you. As the season is getting late the Department would like you to attend to this matter at once.\n\nWhen the building is nearing completion, the question of equipment will be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It will also be necessary to build a cold shed and water-closet. Kindly authorize me to make the necessary expenditure for that purpose. It might be as well also to attend to providing the building with the necessary equipment.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nD.M. Macdonald\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExd.\n\nOTTAWA, 11th December, 1902\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant asking for authority to purchase a stove to be used for drying the plaster in the new schoolhouse at Sydney, C.B., and also for the erection of out-houses; and in reply I beg to say that it will be necessary for you to forward a copy of the contract made with Mr. R.D. McMillan for the erection of this building, so that the Department may be in a position to ascertain who is responsible in this matter, as a stove which would be used for drying plaster would not be fit for heating the schoolroom afterwards.\n\nAn estimate of the probable cost of the out-buildings should also be furnished as well as a statement of the number of desks required for the equipment of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Millan has himself furnished the store for keeping the plaster.\n\nI have also received estimates for the outbuildings and desks. Mr. R. D. Millan will put up an outbuilding 8x16 feet, with three compartments\u2014a water closet at each end, one for boys and one for girls, with a coal house in the centre, shingled and painted for \u00a375.00. He will supply plain pine desks (painted) for each desk seating two persons for \u00a32.50 for each desk. It would be well to have four rows of desks, each row containing five\u2014twenty-five in all\u2014costing \u00a350.00.\n\nAs for the school\u2014teacher's desk and chair with blackboards, bell-frame, maps, globes, books etc., may be regulated to suit the generosity of the Department.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nD.M.

In reply I beg to say that an out-house, 8 x 16 feet, such as described by you may be built, singled and painted at a cost of $75.00 You may also have the requisite number of desks made to seat twenty-four pupils, the cost of which should not exceed $50.00.\n\nRegarding other class-room supplies, such as books, slates, blackboards, etc., the Department will require a requisition to be made out on the proper form, a supply of which is enclosed herewith, giving full information as to the number of pupils in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Chappells Limited an order for the materials required in making repairs to the Indian school buildings at Sydney Reserve, N. S., without first obtaining competitive prices. But this firm being the largest dealers in builders' supplies in Sydney, are in a position to provide such supplies at the shortest notice and the most reasonable prices. Consequently, they command the trade of Sydney in their lines; and I have no doubt that their prices in this case are right.\n\nI recommend payment of their account, less Sales Tax as deducted in Voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

You would be well advised in future, however, to request authority before incurring any expenditure unless in cases of emergency, and, in forwarding vouchers in such cases, they should be sent under a covering letter giving an explanation as to the reason for incurring the expenditure.

Limited\n\nMontreal December 29th, 1925\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nSuperintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nDominion Government,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen selecting a floor for buildings where long wear combined with silence is needed, Dominion Cork Carpet, a soft, quiet, carpet-like flooring that is meeting with favour in all sections of Canada, should be carefully considered. With this in mind, we feel that you will be interested in possessing information relative to this product; when deciding upon what type of floor you will adopt for the new Church & School - Indian Reservation, Sydney, N.S.\n\nDominion Cork Carpet is made of ground cork, oxidized linseed oil, kauri gum and other ingredients scientifically compounded to make a product that is especially quiet, effectively muffling the noise of foot-steps, thus giving the \"atmosphere\" so desirable.\n\nIt is made in pleasing, quiet shades of plain green and natural brown. As it is resilient, sanitary, noiseless, non-slippery, warm, odorless, durable and moderate in cost, you should not hesitate to specify Dominion Cork Carpet.\n\nSamples will be gladly mailed on request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFSMcG-RD\n\n[Signature]\n\nDominion Oilcloth & Linoleum Co. Limited\n\nFrank Smith\nAdvertising Manager\nBrook Village, Inverness Co., N.S.,\nJanuary 4th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI hereby submit report of work for the month of December 1925.\n\nSydney Reserve.\n\nSchool on this reserve visited in December. A number of the children attending school undernourished. Frank Donceth 9 yrs. of age, adopted son of Stephen Donceth, Louis Donceth 7 yrs of age, son of Peter Donceth, both these children appear to be undernourished.\n\nLast winter the children of this school were supplied with a liberal allowance of milk by the Sydney Chapter of the Daughters of the Empire, up to the time of the closing of the school for the Christmas holidays, nothing had been done this year.\n\nCatherine MacDonald.\nOttawa, September 13th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss MacDonald, travelling nurse for this Department for the Province of Nova Scotia, strongly recommends that a hot midday lunch be supplied the pupils of the Sydney Indian Day School each day, such meal to consist of hot soup or broth with biscuits, milk, cheese, sugar and cocoa. The preparation of this lunch in the school would serve a very useful educational lesson to the pupils. Besides, it will be of benefit to their health and encourage a more regular attendance.\n\nI have to request that you will take this matter up with the teacher and ascertain whether she would, with the help of the older girls, prepare and serve this lunch. If she will agree to do so, you may purchase a small quantity of utensils for the purpose, such as individual graniteware cups, a kettle for boiling water, large sauce pan, dish pan and a small quantity of dish towelling. You may also arrange for the purchase of a small quantity of the following articles to be used in the serving of the meal, viz: biscuits, cocoa, sugar, condensed milk and cheese. The serving of this meal is to be provided during the fall and winter months only. The Department will expect you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in the purchase of these supplies. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expense incurred.\n\nWe will expect to hear from you at an early date as to what arrangements you were able to make with the teacher for the preparing and serving of this lunch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver-Bourgeoise, N.S.\nReferring to your letter of the 13th, Sept., I beg to advise you that the teacher of the Indian Day School at Sydney agrees to prepare and serve a hot midday lunch for her pupils, as recommended by Miss MacDonald, travelling nurse for the Department, and approved by you.\n\nFor that purpose I found it necessary to provide a closet or pantry, in which to keep under lock and key the necessary utensils, biscuit, cheese, condensed milk, etc., as otherwise these things might disappear somewhat mysteriously over night. The closet is now ready, and the serving of a midday lunch will begin about the middle of this month.\n\nAs a matter of economy, I think it would be advisable to purchase a bbl. of biscuit, which usually contains about 70 lbs., instead of buying a few lbs. at a time. But until I get your opinion in this respect, I shall procure a much smaller quantity to begin with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 10, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, advising the Department that the teacher of the Sydney Indian Day School will prepare and serve a hot midday lunch to the pupils, and that you have provided her with the necessary utensils and other supplies.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased that the teacher will undertake this work and hopes that, as a result, it will lead to a more regular attendance of the Indian children. As informed in official letter of September 13th, last, the serving of this midday meal is to be provided during the fall and winter months only.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a barrel of biscuits.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the supplying of the cupboard, cooking utensils, biscuits, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A couple of small rooms would suffice.\n\nI may say also that the Indians are anxious to have a basement to the building, which (basement) could be used by them as a hall or council house. I do not urge this feature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt. D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJuly 11, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, two blue print copies of a plan of a combined day school and teachers' residence, which it is thought will be suitable for the new Sydney Reserve, and I would ask you to please arrange with Mr. Currie to have this building erected by day labour under the same arrangements as for the houses. The building should be erected to provide good drainage.\n\nIt is not thought necessary to place a basement under the building and the school can be heated by stoves. Before commencing operations I would ask you to have Mr. Currie examine the present old school building, with a view to using as much of the material out of this building as it is economically possible. No doubt the window frames, door frames, etc., can be worked in. The plan I am sending you is to be used as a guide but if you find that better use can be made out of the materials from the old building by making slight changes in the plans please do so. As the funds are limited I would ask you to please keep the cost of this building as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.

S., in the erection of a schoolhouse.\n\nWork on this building is proceeding as rapidly as circumstances permit. Mr. Curry, construction foreman, did not think it advisable to use any of the material out of the old schoolhouse in the new one. He states that in his experience of forty years, as a contractor and builder, he found that putting old windows and doors in a new building invariably proved unsatisfactory. At any rate, he assured me that the new schoolhouse could not be completed, according to the plans, before the end of September; and knowing that school should open this date - the beginning of the 1927-28 school year - I decided to leave the old building intact and to use it until the new one would be ready for occupancy.\n\nChas. Marshall, already reported absent from Sydney, has not yet returned. I am endeavouring to locate him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

S.,\nNov. 19th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Voucher No. 359A, amounting to $12.40 in favour of myself for services therein specified.\n\nSchool has been in operation since the last week of October, inclusive, in the beautiful building recently erected for that purpose on the new Indian reserve at Sydney, and I have taken the liberty to appoint Peter Doucette janitor of the school, pending the approval of my action by the Department, but whether the appointment be confirmed or not, I recommend an increase of salary for the service which, in my judgment, should be $100.00 per annum, at least, because the duties in connection with the new school, including teacher's residence, will require more time, and much more attention, than was the case with the old Day School.\n\nDoucette is not always able to do hard work on account of a chronic sore leg, which troubles him at times, but which is not of such a character as to interfere with the performance of his duties as janitor. He is in needy circumstances, and the income from this official position would be of very material assistance to him in providing for the support of his family. His home is one of the nearest to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nD. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

October 22nd, 1928\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Sydney School for Indians.\n\nA day or two ago the writer made a rather complete inspection of the Sydney Reserve in company with Mr. A. J. Boyd, Superintendent, and we went through the school house.\n\nMr. Boyd advised me to write you with a view to having some new seating and desks installed in this school. The present seats are considerably out of repair, and are the old fashioned two seat benches.\n\nIf it is decided to install new seating it is suggested that single seats and desks be supplied.\n\nPerhaps you have these at some other place and could ship them here, if not I shall be glad to get prices upon your instructions to do so.\n\nWe think about thirty seats will be sufficient.\n\nThe windows in the building are all on the cold\nor North side of the building, and the teacher complains that it is difficult to keep the place warm during high cold north west winds.\n\nStorm windows have been suggested, but the writer is of the opinion that weather stripping the windows would be more satisfactory in the long run.\n\nThese matters are submitted for consideration, and a reference to Mr Boyd may assist you in coming to a conclusion.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, reporting the need of new desks for the use of the Sydney Indian Day School. In this connection I have to request that you will obtain prices from each of the manufacturers or dealers in school desks and submit them for the consideration of the Department. Rhodes, Curry, Limited, of Amherst, are manufacturers of school desks, and you should obtain a price from them and from any other manufacturers or dealers that you wish. It is noted that you state 30 single desks will be sufficient. The last return shows an enrolment of 28 pupils, with an average attendance of 19. School desks are manufactured in the following sizes:-\n\n| No. | Size |\n|-----|------|\n| 1   | for adults |\n| 2   | pupils 15 to 18 years |\n| 3   | 11 \" 14 \" |\n| 4   | 10 \" 13 \" |\n| 5   | 7 \" 9 \" |\n| 6   | 5 \" 7 \" |\n\nIf the desks are arranged in the classroom in four rows of six desks each - each row to be of the same size desk with a front and rear seat - this would provide seating accommodation for 28 pupils. Before calling for prices you should ascertain definitely the sizes required and the number of each size. When the Department has received the quotations secured for supplying these desks, consideration will then be given to authorizing the purchase. You should ask the firms to quote f.o.b. nearest shipping point to the school.\n\nYou may arrange to have weather stripping placed on the windows on the north side of the building. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and, after this work is completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour. Please arrange to have this weather stripping installed at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secre\n\nS. E.

Awaiting your advice.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nSEM/B\nOttawa, November 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the installing of weather stripping on the windows at the Sydney Indian Day School building, and giving an estimate of the cost of placing this material on each of the eleven windows.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you consider weather stripping would be satisfactory, you may arrange to have the Chamberlin patent weather stripping placed on these windows, and the cost should not exceed your estimate, viz. $35.\n\nAfter this work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I asked another firm, but they refused to quote.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a folder which shows the kind of desk handled by the Sydney firm of Norris & McLeod and either of the cuts shown represent very good furniture, and you will remember that the single desk was the one which was thought of.\n\nSubject to your approval of course, I do not see why Single No. 2 would not suit.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSEM/B.

The desk we supply in all cases is the single school desk, which can be obtained at much less cost than the type of desk on which you furnished a quotation.\n\nThe Department is obtaining prices direct from two manufacturers of school desks, and, when we have their quotation, the order will be placed here for the supplying of sufficient desks to accommodate 30 pupils. You will be advised when the order has been placed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. E.

S., Jan. 14, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe thank you for your favor of the 12th, reference No. 61-1-5, instructing us to forward to Sydney, single, Silent Sanitary desks.\n\nThese will go forward as early as possible and invoice will be mailed to Mr. Muggah in triplicate just as soon as shipment is made.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n\nLTC/Y\nEXTRACT from report of Mr. Inspector Phelan, dated January 16th, 1929, on his inspection of the SYDNEY Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 61-1-6.\n\nIt would be advisable, I think, to supply good desks to this school. Those that are there were poor enough from the beginning and some of them are considerably battered. One indeed has only three legs and usually falls down when the pupils move from it.\n\nThe school building consists of a classroom, two entries, and a few rooms for the teacher. It is the property of the Dominion of Canada and nearly new. I am told the roof leaks. This should receive attention or the plaster will soon be spoiled. The classroom is on the north-western side of the building and never receives any direct sunlight during school hours. The building should have been placed so that the windows of this room would look to the south. This would make both for comfort and the health of the occupants. It is the correct way to light a school in these regions where there is hardly ever a warm day during the working term. Of course, this defect cannot readily be remedied now and the matter is mentioned mainly for the purpose of suggesting that plans for schools to be built in the future be referred to somebody experienced in details of this kind,\u2014an inspector of schools being in general well qualified.\n\nAll the foregoing is offered in the hope that it may be of service and not for the purpose of adversely criticising anybody.\nOttawa, January 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Sydney Indian Day School, makes the following remarks regarding the new school building: \"I am told the roof leaks. This should receive attention or the plaster will soon be spoiled.\"\n\nThis is a new building, having been erected in 1927, and it is not considered, if the shingles were properly laid, that there should be any leakage. However, I have to request that you will examine the condition of the roof and, if any repairs are required, you should arrange to have them carried out as soon as weather conditions permit in order to overcome the danger of any leakage and the consequent damage to the plaster. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of any repairs carried out. This matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. E. Haggah, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRoyal Bank Building,\nSydney, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour 61-1-5 of the 25th Indian School at Sydney N. S.\n\nI have just returned from an inspection of the school building in question, and cannot find any evidence of a leaky roof, or other part of this building.\n\nI asked the teacher to show me what Inspector Phalen had seen, and which were the leaks complained of.\n\nShe pointed to some small stains which look to me like stains in the plaster, which have been there since the place was plastered, and I doubt very much if these stains have been caused by water getting in.\n\nThere is just one other explanation that might be given with reference to this, and it is that some time ago, considerably over a month, we had a terrific gale of wind with very heavy rain from the south-west, and a good many dwellings in this city which have not leaked before, or since showed some signs of dampness after that storm, and there is a possibility that the wind was so high\nthat it raised the shingles which I notice are of the spark-proof variety of rubberoid, and not very stiff. This coupled with the fact that the roof at this point is very nearly level, would make it easy for the wind to get under these shingles and raise them in an exceptionally heavy gale such as we have had.\n\nI do not know whether I have made the situation clear to you or not, but in any case I do not think that there is any reason to believe that any damage will be done to the building as it seems to me to be in very good shape, both inside and out.\n\nI will have a carpenter up there within a day or two now installing the new seats, and I will get his opinion with reference to the roof.\n\nWhat is to be done with the old seats, they only seem to be fit for firewood?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the condition of the roof of the Sydney Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that you have examined the roof and consider it to be in a satisfactory condition. It is noted that you will have a further examination made by a carpenter.\n\nRelative to the old desks which have been replaced by new ones, I have to say that if they are not fit for further use they may be broken up and used for firewood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This roof is practically new, shingled with \"Ruthervold Shingles,\" which have a tendency to curl up in high winds.\n\nSydney, July 29\n\n[Signature]\n\nNote: This letter left at Sydney by Capt.

Has this been considered in view of the fact that T.B. may be lurking round in some cases.\n\nThere should also be a wooden bucket provided to catch the drip from the tap, or the floor will be in a mess all the time.\n\nKindly advise what you wish done.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of supplying a water cooler, cups and shelf for the use of the Sydney Indian Day School.

You may, also, arrange to have a shelf erected in a corner of the classroom at a cost not exceeding, approximately, $4.00.\n\nRelative to the drinking cups, it is considered that, if you purchased six aluminum cups and arranged to have hooks installed near the water cooler on which these cups could be hung, it would be more satisfactory than providing the sanitary paper cups. Please secure these aluminum cups and have the necessary hooks installed as soon as possible.\n\nYou may also purchase a galvanized water pail to catch the drip from the tap of the cooler.\n\nWhen all of the above purchases have been made, please forward accounts in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSydney E.

April 3rd, 1929\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago the matter of having some crushed slag placed around the Indian Day School building at Sydney, was under consideration, and the writer was asked to obtain a figure for placing a suitable quantity of this material on the ground.\n\nIn company with a friend of mine, who is our City Engineer, the writer walked over the site on a recent afternoon, and we have come to the conclusion that it will require from twenty to twenty-five tons of slag to make a satisfactory covering.\n\nI have obtained figures from a haulage firm in Sydney, and they have given me a figure of $3.50 per ton.\n\nThis includes loading at the Steel Plant, and transportation to the Reservation by motor truck, and the spreading around the grounds.\n\nIt is suggested that it might be well to try an amount of ten tons first and see what space is covered\nand if necessary more could be bought, as the price for ten tons would not be any higher than a greater amount, per ton.\n\nIf it is the Dept's wish I shall be glad to arrange the hauling and oversee the spreading of this material, as I am of the opinion that some covering is required, as the School House is a fine little building, but the grounds do not do it justice.\n\nPardon my writing so long on this question, but felt that I should make what explanation I can for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nSEM/B\nOttawa, April 8, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the placing of crushed slag around the Sydney Indian Day School building, and giving an estimate of the cost per ton of supplying, delivering and spreading it around the grounds. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the delivery of from 10 to 15 tons of crushed slag and having same spread around the school building. It is noted that the cost will be $3.50 per ton, which includes loading, transportation to the school and spreading on the ground. After this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. It is considered, when the above quantity is supplied, that it should place the grounds in a satisfactory condition.\n\nI have also your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the outbuilding in connection with the Sydney School. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $30 in having this building put back on its foundation and securely anchored at each end, as suggested in your letter. It is noted that the above amount will cover the expenses in replacing and securing the building. You should have this work carried out as soon as possible. After it has been finished, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.

S. Sept. 19th, 1929\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe Indian School, Sydney N. S. -\n\nWhen at the Indian School today I noticed two or three small spots in the ceiling where leaks were showing through.\n\nThese are small spots and have done no damage yet other than slightly stain the ceiling, but they are the outcome of a high wind and rain storm.\n\nThe high wind lifts the shingles and the rain gets in under them, and it looks as if we would have to do something to prevent the shingles blowing up.\n\nI have been speaking to a contractor today, and he tells me that outside of reshingling the roof the only thing that can be done is to go over the roof with a material known as \"Stop a Leak\" which is a mastic preparation, and stick down each row of shingles.\n\nTo do this would cost in the vicinity of $50.00\n\nThe shingles used were of a very light material\nand they were applied I understand at the wrong time of the year, that is to say after the hot weather had passed.\n\nYou will remember in former correspondence it was hoped that the hot weather of this year would complete the sticking process, but unfortunately this does not seem to be the case.\n\nThe shingles used on this roof have been replaced in the trade here altogether the last year or two by a much stiffer shingle known as \"Heavy Butts\".\n\nSubject to your judgement I am recommending that the sticking down of each row be undertaken at once, in order to protect this fine little building, and if you wish a more exact figure as to cost, and wire me, I will obtain one and telegraph you at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to the condition of the roof of the Sydney Indian Day School building. It is noted that the wind lifts the ends of the shingles and that the rain gets in under them, and that you recommend the roof be gone over with a material known as \"Stop a Leak\", which is a mastic preparation, to stick down each row of shingles. If you consider this would be satisfactory, you may arrange to have the roof gone over with the preparation mentioned. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $50. It is hoped that when this preparation has been applied it will prevent the ends of the shingles from sticking up.\n\nIf, however, after you have given this material a trial and it is found unsatisfactory, the question of reshingling the roof with a good grade of cedar shingles will have to receive consideration next spring. It is hoped, however, that the preparation above mentioned will prevent leakage during the present fall and winter months.\n\nYou should arrange to have the work mentioned above carried out at an early date, keeping all expense as low as possible. After the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. E. Muggah, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S\nOttawa, October 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss K.

I have asked the teacher to get in touch with me personally in future over such matters, and have given her a phone number where a message will always get me promptly if I am not in my office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAgent.\nSydney, N. S. Oct. 7th, 1929\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nYour favour of the 5th inst 61-1-5 on the subject of heat for the Sydney Indian Day School has been received.\n\nWhen at the school today I discussed the matter with the teacher, and she informed that on very cold days in the winter, it was once in a while hard to keep the room up to the required heat. My own opinion is that they let the fire get low. The stove man who was with me stated to me that the stove at present in the room should give ample heat for a room of the size in a building of as good construction as the school house is.\n\nDuring last Winter I frequently asked the teacher if the room was comfortable and her answer was invariably \"yes.\"\n\nIt seems that Miss McDonald the travelling has told her that the Public Health Dept. has approved of only one type of heating apparatus known as a \"Jacketed Heater\" at least that is what she called it.\n\nI am attaching here to a cut of the kind of furnace that is being installed in the modern schools, with attachment for a cold air supply. If this patent arrangement is installed, the pipe for the outside air could be put into the basement directly behind the furnace, and so led to the fresh air outlet in the side of the wall, that is to say, the furnace stands in the school room and the cold air pipe could be put through the floor to lead as above.\n\nThis furnace installed would cost $105.00 in Sydney. A larger and better heater than the present one but with no cold air attachment could be installed for $55.00. There should be some allowance for the old stove. If a change is made I would recommend the $105.00 job.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSEM/B Agent\nOttawa, October 11, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in connection with the heating of the Sydney Indian Day School. In view of your report, it is considered unnecessary to install a furnace at this school and you need not take any further action at the present time in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The schools at which this lunch was supplied to the pupils were as follows:\n\n- Eskasoni, Indian Cove (Pictou Landing)\n- Sydney, Afton,\n- Whycoomagh, Salmon River.\n\nThe supplies for the lunch should be of the same type and approximately in the same quantities as last year. You may inform the various agents, arrange with them to purchase the articles and have the teachers start the serving of the lunch from the middle of November, next. They may continue serving lunch to the pupils at these schools until the end of April, 1932. All expenses in connection with the purchase of the supplies required should be kept as low as possible. Itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred in this connection for each school, separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

This account is being paid, but I would point out that, in future, the Department cannot pay accounts covering the cost of classroom supplies purchased locally by the agents or teachers of Indian day schools. The regulations of the Government Stationery Office and of the Auditor General require that all classroom material be purchased through the Government Stationery Office. The teacher should anticipate her requirements, and prepare a requisition and forward same to the Department in due time to receive the classroom supplies she requires. You will be good enough to inform the local agents and teachers accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nC. J.

You should arrange for the purchase of the material, and, if possible, employ Indian labour in having the work carried out. We understand that the approximate cost of the material and labour will not exceed $25. This work should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays, and all expenses, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job, should be kept as low as possible. After the work is finished, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and for the labour.\n\nThe Department understands that the present location of the stove is unsatisfactory, as there is an unnecessary length of stove pipe and consequently a poor draft, causing smoke to escape at times. This could easily be remedied by changing the location of the stove, and I would request that you arrange to have the stove changed to another location in the classroom, and placed in a good, serviceable condition. Any expense for the purpose will be paid upon receipt of vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nSydney E. Muggah, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N.S.\nSydney N. S., July 29th, 1932.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt appears that there has been some correspondence between the Dept. and Mr McNeil with reference to cleaning the ceilings and walls of the Indian Day School at Sydney.\n\nIt further appears that he has made a recommendation to the Dept. to have the heating stove in this school moved over against the wall to shorten the length of stove pipe required, and do away to some extent with the sooting of the walls due to the escape from the long pipe required as the stove stands now.\n\nI looked at this school a day or two ago, and I am afraid that if the stove is placed over against the wall that the heat will not be so well distributed as it is from its present position in the centre of the room, and the stove pipe will stand in front of one of the blackboards.\n\nThe ceilings and walls are pretty badly darkened in the class room, but I believe that they would do for another season without cleaning, when perhaps the work could be undertaken of making a thorough cleaning of the room and furniture, as I am of opinion that another year the seats and desks would be the better of a coat of varnish, although they hardly require it now.\n\nIf the stove is to stand as at present, before school opens we will require to have 10 links of new stove pipe and three elbows 2 of 90 degrees and one of 45.\n\nNew knobs are required on one door, and the out buildings are in need of repairs to doors, some of which have been broken, and require new pieces set in, and some of the hasps are missing and should be renewed.\n\nIn front of one of the out-buildings they have shoveled the earth from in front down into the hole, and a platform of rough poles or plank should be put in here, as the door, due to the ground being shoveled away, is hardly accessible for the smaller children.\n\nWith attention given to these things the school should do another winter I should think without much expense.\n\nKindly advise what you wish done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.E. Mingah.\nOttawa, August 3, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to cleaning the ceiling and walls of the Indian day school at Sydney. Your letter crossed ours of the 28th ultimo, in which you were authorized to arrange to have this work done.\n\nRegarding the location of the stove, the Department will leave this in your hands to make the best arrangements you can in the matter. You may also arrange to have new knobs placed on one door and the repairs required carried out to the doors of the outhouses, also a platform of rough poles or plank placed in front of the outbuildings in order to have the door accessible to the younger children. The Department will rely on you to see that all expenses incurred for the above purposes are kept to the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. E.

E. [Signature]\nAgent.\n\nSEM/MR.\nEncl.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Friday night and Saturday the Island of Cape Breton was visited with a very severe gale of wind, but only slight damage was done to the property at the Indian Reservation.\n\nThe rubberoid roofing on the Day School out building was ripped off, and another small out building attached to one of the dwellings was overturned. It will be necessary for us to renew the roofing on the out building of the School, and to also replace on its proper position the other out building that was upset. The cost of doing these things will be very small, as it will only be a matter of buying sufficient roofing and nails for the School out building, and the work can be done by an Indian Joe C. Marshall. The work of replacing the other out house should cost very little, and we will see that this building is properly anchored to posts in the ground. The cost of this work should not exceed $20.00 at the outside, and we will do it as much under it as we can. We will proceed with it as soon as your authority to do it is received.\n\nAlthough the Department is not interested by way of information I may also say that the little bell tower erected by the Indians on their church was also blown away in the gale referred to.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the damage occasioned by a wind storm at the Sydney Indian Day School.\n\nYou may arrange to have the roofing that was torn off the outbuilding replaced and also replace on its proper position the other outbuilding. You may purchase the materials required and arrange with an Indian to do the work. These outbuildings should be properly fastened to posts in the ground in order to overcome the danger in future of them being damaged. You should have these repairs carried out at an early date.\n\nPlease keep all costs as low as possible and, after the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of any material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

It has been decided to make an exception in the case of the Sydney School and allow the same amount as previously, viz., $10.00, but it will be necessary to have Crowell's Limited account itemized.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Basement Windows in School\n\nThere are three windows, on the basement of the School, here. They have no protection, or any kind, and, very naturally, they are broken. The School needs them, for a minimum of light and ventilation. The School is heated by a Furnacett, placed not in the basement but on the first floor. Therefore, there is not any source of heating in the basement; and cold drafts, and weather coming underneath, up through the floor, is bad for the kids. It is also responsible for waste of fuel; and, a possible entry from outside for persons - or cats, rats, etc.\n\nRepairs to the window: six new glass, would cost about $6.00. Two wood movable shutters, and one heavy metal screen one, (at the coal window) could be purchased at $5.00, each, with steel hooks and eyes.; ready made. To fit the shutters into place would take about a day (it is slow work fitting anything on to a cement wall). Steve Gould a handy man on the reserve would do that for two dollars. Truckage etc., perhaps two dollars. Total between seventeen and eighteen dollars.\n\nI would not call it an emergency, but certainly a necessary matter. I leave it to the discretion of your Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding the windows in the basement of the Sydney Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost of the work which you recommend be carried out.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur an expenditure, not exceeding approximately $18.00, for the purpose of installing new panes of glass in the windows where required, two movable wood shutters and one heavy metal screen at the coal window, and for the necessary labour in carrying out this work. After the windows have been repaired and the shutters and heavy metal screen installed, please forward a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and that all expense is kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJoe.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe furnacett in Membertou Day School:\n\nThere are so many kinds of furnacett now, that it is very difficult, on short notice, to procure repair parts \u2014 especially in Cape Breton. With reference to this repair, I was obliged to pick up a part here, and another there, until we got the lot together, and I had to pay for them as we went along. Two of the grates had to come from St. John, N.B., also went good for the amount of his labour to the plumber, Mr. Christmas, at a local store, in advance. The telegraph Co.'s receipt is attached, for the night letter, which I also paid. Therefore, the ok. may come to me, I trust, within reasonable time; my own spare cash is too little.\n\nOn taking the furnacett apart, it was found that the fire-lining is worn out. It should have been cemented a year ago, and done over lightly, every year, \u2014 only a very small job, \u2014 in order to save the lining and keep it intact. Since that has not been done, the lining is now worn through. The final result will be that the casing of the heater will melt and warp, and a complete new one will behave to go in. Mr. Christmas while he had the furnace cold, patched up the lining, to save the casing as best possible, for the balance of this term. When warm weather comes in, there should be a new lining put in. It must come from St. John; and the job would cost approximately $25.00. Furnacetts are, so far, a chronic nuisance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6050, file 258-5, part 3)\nOttawa, February 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the furnasett at the Sydney Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you recommend the installation of a new lining later in the year.

Our Accounting Branch points out that the total of three gates, at $6.65, and cement, $1.40, is $8.05, and not $8.15, as shown on the account. You should have deducted 10% from the labour, making this amount $8.91. This will make the total of the account $18.96.\n\nAs you wish the cheque issued in your favour, it will be necessary for you to attach to the account a receipt from B. R.

You have not exactly instructed me how it should be made out; and, too much in the artistry of bookkeeping formalities is not to be reasonably found with a poor Indian, whose main line of work is along mechanical and labour efforts.\n\nI received a circular from the Department, when I became Agent, to the effect that labour performed at my request on the account of the Department, must be all subject to 10 per cent on regular rates, and billed in that much lower. I followed that advise, always, and, the same in this instance. The rate for Plumbing in the city of Sydney, is from a dollar to a dollar - ten, pr hour. The account in question was billed at 90 cents, which is ten per cent under the minimum.\n\nI trust this will explain, it all, satisfactorily, and whatever may be your final decision, on the amount correctly due, that it will soon reach me.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJoseph [Signature]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Mr. MacQuarrie,\nSydney, Cape Breton.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| April 28 | To Account for School Supplies Pemberton Reserve, as per detail attached. | $0.95 |\n\nAuthorized: Moh. 27, 1924, Letter, 61-1-5.\n\nVote: 176\nSchool Number: 258\nAllotment: 287\nE.R.

I am told that the school inspector commented on the matter, several times. The cost of shifting it over to the new place would be about $14.00., to include some new pipe, and a heavy cast iron elbow.\n\nAs smoke in a schoolroom is most disagreeable - the ceiling is nearly black from it - I would recommend trying the change.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 31, 1934.\nOttawa, November 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, regarding the furnacette in the Sydney Indian Day School. It is noted you recommend a change in the position of this furnace, shortening the smoke pipe. If you consider that it would be more satisfactory for the operation of the furnace to have it changed to a new position, you may incur an expenditure of approximately $14.00, which is to include some new pipe and a heavy cast iron elbow. You should arrange to have the change made in the position and have the furnacette placed in a good, workable condition, as soon as possible.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

School Toilets:\n\nI reported previously that these buildings would have to be roofed over, but that such work can be done much better and faster in hot weather, on account of using liquid tar in joining the edges of the roofing material.\n\nI find, lately, however, that the doors are half gone, and a side open on each building; and both vents are down, and the partition separating the schoolgirls' side from the compartment reserved for the teacher, in one building is all gone.\n\nI was out to the reserve with School Inspector Phelan, and while the roof, and window lights can wait till summer, the other repairs need to be done now.\n\nThere are two buildings, each double compartment, with two doors each, and they are much larger than ordinary school outhouses. The doors must be taken down, and repaired, new vents made, and set in place, new partition, and new sections placed on sides; estimated at $34.00. The boys' toilet will do with only the doors, and side walls made good. The other will need to be in a complete state of repair.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 12th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $34.00 in making the necessary repairs to the toilets at the Sydney Indian Day School.

The interior hasn't been painted; the walls, ceilings, and woodwork are very dirty and discoloured from coal smoke from the furnacette. If at all possible, the building, inside and out, should be painted during the summer holidays.\n\nThe furnacette is not satisfactory; parts are burned out and cannot be replaced; the top is cracked allowing the smoke to fill the classroom. It should be replaced with a suitable coal stove. New pipes are needed. It may do service for the balance of the winter but no longer.\n\nThe teacher has never occupied the residence. It was suggested that a reliable married Indian might be permitted to live in it in return for his services as janitor. The building would be better occupied if the right type of Indian is available and if such an arrangement wouldn't interfere with the teacher's classroom work. The grounds are used in the evenings by the younger set for ball games and windows, doors, and door knobs are constantly being damaged.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, March 12, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector McGookin's report regarding his recent visit to the Sydney Indian Day School.\n\nHe states that it was suggested that an Indian might be permitted to live in the teacher's residence in return for his services as janitor. The Department has carefully considered this suggestion but, from our experience in other places, it is felt that this arrangement might prove very unsatisfactory and we are, therefore, not prepared to grant the permission requested.\n\nMr. McGookin states that the interior of the school requires decorating, also that a new coal stove will be required for next winter. Please let me know the approximate cost of decorating the interior of the school, also the cost of a new coal stove. When this information is received, the Department will be in a position to decide if funds for the purpose are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJoseph MacKinnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N. S.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Repairs to School Toilets:\n\nThe enclosed account for this work is nearly ten dollars less than the estimate submitted, and authorized, in your latter of Feb. 12, inst., 31-1-5.\n\nThe reason is that four window lights, one to each toilet, broken away, and included in the estimate, were not put in now, because it is certain that when renewing the roofs of these toilets, next summer, the hammering would shatter the glasses, and could not be avoided; the buildings are not heavily framed. That part can wait until the roofs will be renewed, as I described in another letter, some time ago.\n\nIndian labour is always used on this reserve, when possible. But in this case, there is not any Indian who would do the work, without someone with experience to direct him; and two people around that little space would only be in each other's way, and make needless expense.\n\nThe account for stock, J. W. Stephens, may be sent in separate ok. to Peter MacKinnon, or the agent's office, or to Mr. Stephens, direct, taken off the total, and the balance, for labour sent to Peter MacKinnon, as you wish.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph McLean\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nSYDNEY RESERVE NO. 28.,\nApril 4, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian School, Here, Yours, Mch. 12, ult. 61-1-5.\n\nYour decision re a janitor to reside in the school, is based on the best of teachers, experience, and the advice shall be of good use to Agents. My hopes were prompted because of 1st, the saving of $60.00 2nd, to provide house for a family, much in need of it, and 3rd, to try and overcome petty mischief, about the building, a growing evil, the last year, with no constable, on the reserve.\n\nAbout the Stove: I asked for twenty-five dollars, some time ago to repair the furnace, now in the school; and, later, for fourteen dollars, to change its position, both estimates were kindly approved. But, when I went and examined the furnace, carefully, I thought that I surely would not like to spend forty dollars of mine on it, for what it could be improved. The Chief and a few others to help changed its position, during the Christmas vacation, making no charge, for same, except a couple of elbows for the smoke pipe, and we saw it would carry for this winter, and then should be scrapped. I sought prices on something to replace it; and, am watching the success of a stove newly bought for another school, in a country section, not far away. By next summer, some such heater will be recommended, to you, and, then, I shall ask permission to divert the estimates already approved, to the new stove, and that will nearly cover the cost, if allowed.\n\nAs to cleaning the inside of the school, and putting up cracks, and painting, - the best price I have is from a first class man, living out in that direction, who has ladders and such equipment, and offers to do the work, including blackboards, for fifty five dollars. The seats ought to be done, also, although that is a matter of taste, stained and revarnished, for which he offers to do for nineteen dollars. This could be done at Easter, if approved.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph Melvin\nOttawa, April 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that you may have the inside of the Sydney Indian Day School cleaned at a cost not exceeding $55.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that you will write later regarding the cost of a stove for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible. Please arrange for the purchase of the materials required.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

This year, or at last Christmas, we ordered the goods on enclosed account, on condition that the Grocer would duplicate the amount, as a gift, which he did. We got $5.00 worth of toys on the same terms, and collected an additional $5.00, used for more necessary articles, amongst the pupils. Special permission was not previously necessary in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJoseph Malinno\nOttawa, February 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, I enclose account which you forwarded in connection with the expenditure of $5 for a Christmas treat for the children at the Sydney Day School.

I trust the Department will approve, on that account.\n\nI am convinced, upon my observation, that the grates we put in, before did not last as long as they ought to; and that they \"burned out\" because the furnacett was not kept properly clear of clinkers, and ashes.\n\nThe Caretaker is one of a small group who hold a feeling against the Agency of bias over Indian election; and, if I say a word to him on the matter, his friends will get him worked up saying that the Agent is \"icking\" on him, and he should write to \"Ottawa\". I wish the Department would \"rake\" him a little, on the matter, or else, come direct at the Agent, who would pass the letter on to Mr. Marshall, the caretaker.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n61-1-5\nOttawa, February 12, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, submitting an account in favour of George Street Hardware, it is noted that this account is marked \"Paid\", but the voucher is issued in favour of the Hardware Company. If the account has not been paid, the firm should not have entered the word \"Paid\" on their account. The voucher which you submitted is, therefore, returned for correction.\n\nYou should issue special instructions to the caretaker regarding the manner in which he should look after the furnace. If he does not carry out your instructions, you should advise the Department, and, at the same time, submit the name of some other responsible Indian to act as caretaker of the Sydney School. You should inform Marshall of the contents of this letter, and advise him that, unless he performs his duties properly in future, the Department will dispense with his services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

MCGILL.\n\nSydney Indian Day School (Cape Breton Co.).\n\nTeacher: Miss C. Gallagher.\n\nThe average attendance at this school is 21. The teacher complained that most of the children leave school when they reach the age of twelve years or thereabouts. By then, they had only reached about the Fourth Grade.\n\nThe school inside looks very dingy - the walls are practically black - as no decorating has been done for years. It would be a step in the right direction if the school was either painted or kalsomined inside. There are many Indians there who could perform this labour.\n\nThe heater needs relining, as the present lining is pretty well burnt out, and the stove smokes badly.\n\nThere is a 22' x 30\" lean-to built on to this school as a teacher's residence, but this is not used as the teacher lives in town. There is also a room upstairs, which is not used either.\n\nA small coal bin was requested for the basement. At the present time, when the coal is put in, it is scattered all over the floor. I believe it would be more economical if a coal bin were built and there would certainly be less dust.\n\n- Miss Gallagher\nMiss Gallagher informed me that she had an appropriation of $8.00 with which she purchased sewing material. She said she appreciated this very much, as it enabled her to teach the children to make their own clothing, underwear, etc. She hoped that more material would be supplied later on.\n\nMiss Gallagher has, I believe, been teaching at this school for possibly twenty years.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to the Sydney Indian Day School, Mr. M. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, reported that a small coal bin is required in the basement and that the heater needs re-lining. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of these repairs.\n\nYou might, also, state what expenditure would be involved in painting or kalsomining the interior of the school. On receipt of your reply, it will be decided if this work can be authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJohn H. Langley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Peters, N. S.\nThe boy's entrance to this school, is nearest the road, and therefore the one in common use, for general purposes. The schoolhouse is on the top of a small steep hill, sloping, hard down to the road, and the boys' door is on the steep side of the grounds, in a hard exposed corner. The ground has washed away some, so that the steps up to the door are dropped into an outward angle. It is a most disagreeable entrance, looks poor, and, in winter, is very dangerous. Boys have been hurt on it; and the parents of one youngster, their only child, have complained that his death was indirectly due to having been pushed off that step, in winter. I think it the duty of the agency to mention this.\n\nI would have new steps replacing the old ones, and run alongside the wall of the building, instead of away from it, as at present, and the approach from the level side instead of up the decline. I would have some husky posts supporting the end of the steps, at the door, and a heavy guard rail of timber to prevent falling off.\n\nThe toilet building needs two doors. The estimate I have on the work, from a common sense carpenter, is $60.00. The work is fussy, and cannot be done by the Indians. Although not an emergency, I must say that it ought to be done; and I have put off referring to it since two years. Your valued instructions will be very welcome to me, in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nOn arrival here yesterday I found a postal and legislative letter from you in both of which you ask for my resignation from Indian School. I decline from at present to send in my resignation but will consider the matter later on. It is the usual thing to see a number of men anxious simply burning with a desire to teach the Indians, and they would do wonderful things too, but it would hurt them to what may be a little. I thank you for the very kind attention shown me.\n\nP. H. Macdonald\nAndrew Leeser - Wylcocoonal\nJune 23rd 1862\n\nRev. S. M. Pearson B.D.\nSilentula\n\nRespectfully,\n\nPlease pardon me for intruding on you this time. But I wish to call your attention to the unsatisfactory state of our school under our present teacher Mr. P. Murphy. Mr. Murphy has been employed as teacher for about eight years. And today we haven't a child in school who can read the No. 2 Reader. We are now anxious for a change of teacher, and hope you will see your way clear to do so. There are many smart young teachers in the County, who would gladly take our schools, and we know the school would benefit by the change. If you father Mr. Pearson could come over and examine the school, you would be convinced I am stating what is true.\n\n[Signature]\nFrancis Bonnor\nPlease return these copies to\nDr. MacPherson, P.P.,\nWindsor,\nNova Scotia\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd inst., enclosing a statement of the proceedings at the recent school meeting. From the tenor of your letter I take it that you were opposed to my having asked the teacher to resign. As I have shown it is beyond me to dismiss any teacher under the jurisdiction of the government. Having had a trial of what might be done by councils at Ottawa, now under the administration of the gentlemen we elected and voted, they are backed up against all opposition. Now, sir, that possibly you have been informed, as I have been myself, that I wished the teacher to resign, that I have been told so the enclosed letter from the teacher will show. That I have yet to be convinced that looked for his resignation remains the same from my unsanctioned letter of Aug. 26th last, copy of which I enclose, I am also sending you a letter received some time ago re condition of school at Wyeocough reserve. I shall lose nothing with giving notice against the present incumbent to find the reserve at the rottenness in the state of disrepair revealed it would little good. The first time I wrote Wyeocough about it another priest and myself had arranged to give the Indians a chance to make their Easter duties and we agreed Thursday. The day we got there there was no school; nor did the teacher turn up next day although we stayed the best part of it. Both these days were school days. This was before I became sick. Since then I have again visited the school after time, although things were going slowly but then showed no sign of being but an ordinary mortal.\n\nNow, dear Sir, if you want to retain this mission professor to the Ottomans go ahead and join the air. My feet is done.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Please return the letter enclosed.\n\"they are backed up against all opposition\".\n\nHe concludes by saying:\n\n\"Now my dear sir, if you want to re-\ntain this man as professor to the Micmacs go ahead\n\"and joy be wi ye'my part is done\".\n\nIn the Agent's letter above referred to\nhe accuses the teacher of neglect of duty. Mr\nMcPherson was appointed in April last and this is\nthe first intimation the Department has received\nfrom him that the teacher was neglecting the school.\n\nThe Public School Inspector in his last\nreport on this school dated 16th April '02 says\nthat Mr Murphy holds a Second Class License C and\nis fairly well qualified for his position and that\nhis success, conditions considered, is reasonable.\n\nThe average attendance for last year was\n15 out of an enrollment of 32 or 33, which compares\nfavorably with other Indian day schools. Mr Murphy\nhas had charge of this school since 1894 and no\ncomplaints have been made against him until now.\n\nThe Agent encloses correspondence between\nhimself and Mr Murphy from which it would appear\nthat he was anxious to get rid of him and to strength-\nen his case, he forwards a declaration purporting to\nbe made by one Rosie McIsaac accusing Murphy of gross\nimmorality. If the statements contained in the de-\nclaration are true, he should be dismissed at once, but\nas the offence took place early in the spring and\nwas not reported by the Agent until he had failed to\nget the teacher to resign or to dismiss him by other\nmeans, I think that in justice to Murphy, he should be\ngiven an opportunity to defend himself.\n\nRev. D. McPherson was appointed Agent in\nApril last by order of the Deputy Minister. See\nSee Memorandum of 22nd March 1902, turned out on file 8859 herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brossard\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 26th September, 1902\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nRe: Whycocomagh Indian School.\n\nIn August last, Mr Agent McPherson wrote asking whether he was permitted to hire anyone whom he might think competent to teach this school or whether the matter should be submitted to the Department, and he was informed that in case of a vacancy occurring, he should advise the Department before taking any steps to secure the services of a new teacher. He was also told that as Mr Murphy the present teacher had not sent in his resignation, it might be taken for granted that he had no intention of doing so.\n\nIn reply to the Department's letter the Agent writes under date of the 16th instant a letter which shows that he has little or no idea of how official correspondence should be carried in proof of which I may quote the opening paragraph of the letter in question:\n\n\"I am in receipt of yours of 22nd ult. re Indian school at Whycocomagh. From the tenor of your favour I take it that you were apprised of my having asked the teacher to resign. Little as I know, I know it is beyond me to dismiss any rascal under the protection of the Government's wing. I have had a trial of what purity of morals counts at Ottawa nowadays.

I do not know how the school leaves from year to year, and whether it is worth while, but they were doing so when I came here and have been doing so since. The big Indian Government is aware that it is paying the Indian School for it is shown in the statistics and returns.\n\nCharge No. 117. That P. A. Murphy got one [illegible] Mac Isaac of West Lake inside, his child out of school.\n\nMr. Murphy states and produces a marriage certificate to show that justice was done in this case by him upon April 15th last by his having married Miss Mac Isaac. Mr. Murphy further states that a child was born during the month of July last.\nIn the matter of certain charges preferred by the Rev. O. MacPherson against P.A. Murphy, school teacher upon the Aboriginal Indian Reserve No. 13.\n\nBoth the above mentioned persons having been duly notified by letter, the receipt of which they have heretofore acknowledged, inquiry into the said charges was commenced as appointed at 10 o'clock, May 14th, 1907, at 4 W. Macdonald House, Calgary, Canada.\n\nMr. P.A. Murphy was present, but the Rev. O. MacPherson about his letter in response to notification explains why.\n\nMr. Murphy asked for a private interview. The matter being cleared, he stated that he married Miss Maclean on April 15, 1894, and has since continued to do so before said date; that he begs to have any proceedings affecting his wife's good\nname consulted in private, and that her reputation should be spared. Promised that as far as possible this should be done.\n\nMr. Murphy asked for particulars of the charges. Being told of the Mr. MacPherson's attitude he said he could not answer general charges and must have particulars, and to have Mr. MacPherson subpoenaed.\n\nSubpoena granted requiring attendance of Mr. MacPherson for 10 A.M. tomorrow, and put in hands of Capt. W. H. McLean, for service.\n\nLetter sent to Mr. Murray, Indian Agent, concerning any other that may need his evidence. Signed and written yesterday about 12 o'clock, Wednesday, Oct. 18th.\n\nProceedings resumed at 9 A.M., Wednesday, Oct. 18th.\n\n1902.\n\nMr. D. MacPherson, being sworn, says: I am Indian Agent for the Whydahawk Indian Reserve. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 25th and 26th of last February I visited that reserve. I went to the Indian School accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Doyle. On the 25th it was not in session when we went there (between three and four o'clock), and I learned from the people that it had not been in session.\nDuring the day, I did not see Mr. Murphy that\nevening that occasion. On the 26th I visited the school\nagain, in company with Rev. Mr. Macdonald, but\nfound it as a chapel. We went there between 7 and\n8 o'clock in the morning, and remained there until\nabout noon. I did not see Mr. Murphy, the school\nteacher. The children did not come because\nthey knew that we were stopping there. The\nschool house was free during the afternoon but\nI believe the school was held; indeed I know\nit was not.\n\nOn a later occasion, on a visit to the school,\nI looked upon the school register, and in appeal\nto me that the register did not show that\nthe school was closed on those days. I believe\nthe register does not show that the school\nwas closed on those days.\n\nI visited the Reserve on Oct. the 6th and\nfound that the school had been closed\nfor two weeks or thereabouts. It was closed\nwithout my permission. I am not aware\nFor what cause I understand that Mr. Murphy was away at times from the school acting as surveyor on these occasions; however, Mr. Murphy, I understand often left a female substitute (whether always or not I do not know) to teach the school. I have never given him permission to absent himself or to employ a substitute during the three quarters I have had charge of the agency.\n\nCross Examination by Mr. Murphy.\n\nQ. Are you positive that he was not there on Feb. 25th?\n\nA. As far as I remember I was told that he was in school.\n\nQ. Did you know that any person came to teach school on the 26th?\n\nA. I had no such knowledge.\n\nQ. Did you know that a young lady came to teach the school on the 26th?\n\nA. I have no recollection.\n\nPeter Burgess, Jr., sworn says: I am a Mi'kmaq Indian of Whigwam Reserve. I live on the\nReserve all the time. I remember the visit of Mr. MacKenzie to hold Easter service on the Reserve last spring. Remember the day when Mr. MacKenzie and Doyle came to the Reserve. I believe the school was open in the morning of that day, but cannot state positively. I do not know whether it was closed or open in the afternoon. I believe there was no school on the following day. Mass was held in the schoolhouse in the morning, and I believe there was no school in the afternoon, but cannot state positively. During the month of September I believe the school was closed on the 11th and 12th, and on the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th of the following week, all these days being school days. I do not know what occasioned this closing. I believe there was no school on the 1st and 2nd. On Monday, the 6th, we were cleaning the school in preparation for using it as a chapel, though we did not prevent the schoolmaster coming in, and on the 7th it was in use as a chapel.\n\nFrom Mr. Peter Cooper, Jr., by Rev. Murphy.\nQ. Are you sure that there was no school all day on the 25th?\nA. No, I am not sure.\n\nQ. Did you hear that a young lady went to take charge of the school on the 26th, when it was in use as a church?\nA. No, I did not.\n\nQ. Was school taught on the 27th by Miss Austin?\nA. Yes.\n\nBy Mr. MacPherson.\n\nQ. Did Mr. Murphy always teach the school himself?\nA. No, not always.\n\nQ. During the past summer who taught or how he was away?\nA. Miss Butler, during last summer and last fall.\n\nQ. Who is Miss Butler?\nA. She is a daughter of Mrs. Austin, a girl of about 16.\n1. Is she a trained teacher?\n   a. I do not know anything about her qualifications, but the Indians like her.\n\n2. What is the religion of Miss Baxter?\n   a. Puritan, I believe.\n\nBy Mr. Murphy\n\n3. Was the school open on Friday, the 19th of April?\n   a. Not to my knowledge.\n\n4. Might the school not have been open on Thursday, April 18th, without your knowledge?\n   a. Yes, it might have been.\n\nBy Mr. MacPherson\n\n5. Do you know if any other days beside these would be when the school was closed?\n   a. No, I do not.\n\nMichael Bernard, sworn, says: I am an Indian of the Micmac breed, by a certain Reserve. I have no children that go to school. I remember Mr. Lloyd and Mr. MacPherson being in the Reserve last spring for the Easter duties. The school was closed upon that day. They came about 3 o'clock the next morning to MacPherson's and were in the school house until the priest from Birch Village (Mr. Mac Donald) the Mass finished.\nAbout 8 o'clock in the morning I do not know whether there was any school that day. I do not know anything about the school being closed at other times.\n\nBy Mr. Murphy.\n\nQ. Was there school the day that Mrs. MacPherson and Mr. Eagle were on the Reserve together?\n\nA. I do not know.\n\nQ. The following day, did you know that Miss Austin went to the school to teach?\n\nA. I did not.\n\nStephen Thomas, sworn, says: I am an Indian of the Micmac band, belonging to the Weymouth Reserve. I remember the Rev. Mr. MacPherson and Mr. Eagle coming to the Reserve last spring for Easter services. I was not on the Reserve the day they arrived, but got home late in the evening. I do not know whether the school was open or closed that day. I went to the schoolhouse the next morning. It was about 9:30 when I left home and I went straight to the school, a quarter of a mile away, and began school. Mr. MacPherson and Mr. MacDonald (from Brook Village) were present. I remained until after the Mass, and it was about 12 o'clock when I left the schoolhouse. I then went home. I did not see Miss Austin again that day. I have a key which admits pupils. He did not go to school after Mass for there was no school. My key is irregular in attendance almost the time of the Halifax shipwreck.\nMr. Murphy had school on Wednesday and Thursday it was closed and he went away. I heard of the Hopedale exhibition. He was away on Saturday and the whole of next week until the Thursday there. He then taught school on Friday and the following Monday; then he went off again. Before he was away for a couple of days and the school was closed. Mr. MacBroom and Mac Donald were saying Mass on the occasion. Named I am their master came to the close of the school and then he away. The community voted a substitute for Mr. Murphy, the school teacher.\n\nMr. R. A. Murphy, section, says: I am the school teacher for the Otyantumah Indian Reserve. The Register for the last March and June quarter was left by me in the school desk and is not there now. It has not been destroyed by me. The Register I am using is the common school Register used in Nova Scotia. I do not use any Indian Department Register because I have never been supplied with one. I make a return to the Indian Department from the common school Register. I am paid by the Department of Indian Affairs two hundred and five dollars a year. I am also paid by the Provincial Education Office. The sum I receive from this source varies, but is about eighty-five (85) dollars a year. I have been drawing a grant from the Provincial Authorities for six or seven years. In addition to the Indian grant I make returns to the Provincial Educational Office.\nOffice every six months. There is nothing in the returns to show that the school is an Indian School. I do not know whether the Education Department owns the School as an Indian School or not.\n\nI believe I am entitled to draw a grant from both the Dominion and the Provincial Authorities for the same school. I am a Provincial Land Surveyor, but for the last year I have done considerable surveying for the surveyed lands for the Crown Lands Department of Nova Scotia and Mining Roads for the Department of Mines. This work as a surveyor has caused me to be absent occasionally from school, but when so absent I have sometimes furnished a substitute, but not upon all occasions. When I do not furnish a substitute I close the school. During the past year I have only furnished a substitute (so far as I remember) once, for two days. I have twice as far as I remember closed the school without a substitute during last year, once from the 1st to the 15th of September, and once subsequent to the latter date, for three days. On the first occasion I went to Halifax on private business, and on the second occasion to survey some Mining Roads.\n\nCross Examination by Mr. MacPherson.\n\nQ. Did you close the school at all between the 1st and 25th of May?\n\nA. I cannot state.\nPeter George Sr., sworn says: I am an Indian of the Mic-Mac band, in Hyacinth Reserve. I have children of the ages of eight and ten who go to school. They have been going there about a year.\n\nCharge No. II. That P. A. Murphy fails to properly conduct the school under his charge.\n\nPeter George Sr., recalled says: My children do not go to school regularly. I have a baby and when my wife is out helping me the children have to look after it. I do not know whether the school is punctually opened or not. I like the teacher very well. Once I kept my children at home because some big boys had ill-treated them. My children told me that they got \"plugged\" in the school house.\n\nBy Mr. Murphy:\nI did not complain to me about the children being ill-treated.\nQ. Yes, I did not let my wife drill, she went to the school house and told me.\nI did the children say at noon on the school house.\nQ. Yes.\nI fear the boy treated. Q. Not that I know of. He was not badly hurt.\nI was I myself in going to school. Q. Yes, so far as I know.\n\nBy Mr. MacPherson.\nI ask Mr. Murphy back the catechism? &c., &c.\n\nMr. Maclean, school boy, I have never examined\nthe children of the Hyacinth Indian School. I have\nvisited the school three or four times since I became\nIndian agent. Upon two of these visits, some three or\nfour weeks apart, I observed that the same sentence had\nbeen upon the blackboard. The sentence was grammatical-\nly incorrect on the second occasion. I brought this to the\nteacher's notice, and he said the pupils had not yet learned\nabout plurals. (The mistake was in connection with the use\nof a plural.) I inferred from the fact of the sentence being\non the board so long that the board was not used much.\nSince Baskin told me last Thursday that all the people\nin the Reserve were against Mr. Murphy accepting himself,\nand that he was changing now.\n\nCross-examination by Mr. Murphy.\n\nQ. Were the children present at the time you drew atten-\ntion to the sentence on the blackboard saying a old\nC. They were playing. Despite to them about throwing their\nclothes on the floor and they picked them up. I consider\nit a mark of carelessness upon the part of the teacher\nthat the clothes should have been thrown upon the\nfloor in that way.\n\nQ. Was there plenty of room on the blackboard for other\nmatter to be written besides the sentence in question?\nA. Yes, but that room was utilized by inscriptions\napparently as old as the sentence.\n\n(12)\nQ. Did you hear the children at recess and think them backward?\nA. I thought they did fairly well.\n\nMiss Louise Boyce, would say: I have two children going to school on the Reserve. I know nothing of the purpose they make. I do not know whether the school opens punctually. I think the school might be better, but my children are small and have only been there two summers and one winter.\n\nHave examination by Mr. Murphy.\nQ. Do you children like to go to school? A. Yes.\nQ. Have you ever examined them? A. No.\n\nMr. John MacKinnon being sworn, says: I am Inspector of Public Schools, and at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs inspect their schools on the Wabigoon Central Indian Reserve. I have done so for eight years. During that time I have inspected it twice a year, and occasionally oftener. Mr. Murphy has always been in charge since I commenced inspection. The progress during eight years has not been what might have been expected, but this was due first to unfavorable location of the school house, it being situated at the extreme end of the settlement, and second to irregular attendance. I have only a general knowledge of the school routine. I have never seen a time table, but infer from the text books used the subjects taught between one inspection and another the progress has not been such as it should have been.\nIf the school had been regularly attended, the order of the school is not what I would like to have it, but as good as I think it possible to have it with Indians. I have inspected the Register and have not seen anything in them that would lead me to believe that they have not been faithfully kept. I do not know how the school draws funds from both Provincial and Dominion governments, but they were doing so when I came here and have been doing so since. The Provincial Government is aware that it is paying the Indian school for it is shown in the statistics and returns.\n\nCharge No. III. That P. A. Murphy got one child, Mac Isaac, of West Lake Annie, in child act of Wellwood.\n\nMr. Murphy states and produces a marriage certificate to show that justice was done in this case by him upon Sept. 15th last by his having married Miss Mac Isaac. Mr. Murphy further states that a child was born during the month of July last.\nI return herewith File No.103,167-IA, to which has been attached the evidence taken in connection with charges against Mr. P.A. Murphy, teacher of the Whycocomagh Indian School and some correspondence in connection with the inquiry.\n\nFather McPherson, the Agent, charges the teacher with not having the school open on certain school days; with failing to properly instruct the children and with having got one Rosie McIsaac of West Lake Ainsley in child out of wedlock.\n\nThe evidence goes to show that there was some reason for closing the school on two days particularly indicated by the Indian Agent but establishes the fact that on other days the school has been closed without permission and apparently without sufficient reason. It was formerly not uncommon also for the teacher to place a substitute in charge of the school whilst he was absent performing his functions as a land surveyor.\n\nIt is in my opinion sufficiently clear that the school has been closed frequently without proper authority from the Indian Agent without good excuse.\n\nAs to the second charge, the School Inspector says \"the progress during eight years has not been what\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\"might have been expected, but this was due, first to unfavourable location of the school house, it being situated at the extreme end of the settlement and second, the irregular attendance.\n\n\"I have only a general knowledge of the school routine. I have never seen the time table, but infer from the text books used, the subjects taught. Between one inspection and another the progress has not been such as it should have been if the school had been regularly attended. The order in the school is not what I would like to have it, but as good as I think it is possible to have with Indians.\"\n\nThe width of the reserve is only about a mile and a half so that the extreme distance to be traversed to the school, when it was badly located, would not exceed that distance for any of the children of the reserve. The irregularity of the attendance at school may have been due, to some extent at least, to uninteresting teaching; and experience proves that the order in the Indian schools need be no less perfect than in those of whites.\n\nThe Agent and I examined the school, therefore, on October 16th and I have no hesitation in saying that the teacher's work has not been well directed or at all effective.\n\nAs to the third charge. The main fact is admitted. In July, a child was born and on September 15th some two months later Mr. Murphy married Miss McIsaac. It was stated by the Indians that a result of the teacher's conduct was that they were afraid to send their girls to school. It was also urged that marriage was practically compelled but I did not consider this of any importance. The question at issue was whether the teacher was one who was guided by the dictates of morality and his admission seems\nseems to show that he was not.\n\nIt is my opinion that the interests of the Service and the Indians would be best served by dispensing with the services of Mr. Murphy and that the Indian Agent who evidently wishes to make the school successful should be asked to nominate his successor.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies and Reserves.\nInverness Co. Indian Agency.\n\nMy copy of the letter Oct. 15th 1872\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior\n\nTo Mr. J. W. Smith, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs\n\n234551\n\nI have just received your letter of Sept. 16th last\n\nI am obliged to say under circumstances which led me to believe it justified, but I cannot help to admit that there occurrences were not connected with the Indian Dept. Mr. Evans an S.R. employee has been and is acting in a manner that caused great scandal and no representations have succeeded in having matters put right though once had been made.\n\nIn this case too, I feared that justice was unattainable and I thought that good cause to fear it. The morale of the people under my charge were undermined and effect utterly destroyed.\n\nMy animadversions springing from this\nCause. Regret that the heads of the Indian Dept felt that my language was directed against them. I did not mean to hurt anybody's feelings; hope the Ministry will overlook these letters bearing in mind what those stated caused them. We have very hearty thanks for the promptness shown in investigating the charges I have laid at the school and its teachers. In future my correspondence will be strictly official in tone and shall ever strive for the Indians' good and shall endeavor to carry out your instructions to the best of my ability.\n\nRemain,\nYour obedient servant,\nDonald MacPherson P.P.,\nIndian Agent.\nOct. 14/02\n\nLr.

He has been engaged by Mr. David Macdonald of Langley, Miss Doyle I feel confident will do the best work. Everything considered, you may be assured.\n\nJ.M.

When my friend who is not here at present returns, I shall send him your note. I have heard of your name in 1879. You have attended college three times since and passed my first exam. You have a certificate to that effect. I applied for the Wayseemag Indian School when I was in charge. It promised that whenever a vacancy should occur my application would be considered. I want not to be an inconvenience.\nI have been at present away three days and trying to help my brother in running his canvass.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ. R. Beaton\n\nP.S.

Father,\n\nSharing that Mr. Murphy is resigning his position of teacher in the Indian School, Whycoomagh, I hereby apply for the situation for the ensuing term.\n\nI hold a B. Licence and have had several years' experience as to my moral character. I refer you to the Rev. J.J. Chisholm, S.W. Margaret, to whose parish I belong.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nAngelo U.

Hearing that the school in question is now located, I renew my application. I hold the Grade D. Licence and have had six years experience in teaching. If any references are required,\nRefer you to the trustees of any of the sections in which I have been previously engaged, of which sections are, Chippewa, Halifax Co., and Cape la Ronde, Richmond Co.\n\nIn case you need these testimonials and think that I should furnish them, I shall procure them for you at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEllen J. Duff.\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nNovember 12th, 1902\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI heartily congratulate you on the decision to which you have come regarding the Teacher of the Otsycook Indian School. You have at the same time my hearty thanks for the speed developed in choosing him out. Would that your energy could be directed along some of your other Departments.\n\nThere carried out some instructions. The teacher is notified. There concerned with my prospect MacKinnon with regard to new appointments. Enclose his letter which shows all the applicants the duty specified. If you give me any way I declare that Mr. MacKinnon's choice is also mine.\n\nLadies are filling the position of teacher etc., Indians very acceptable in some places. Miss MacKinnon, Miss Doyle, would I think, give good satisfaction and should feel that in her absence there would be discontent in getting rid of the young but the older Misses would, to express many other blessings of civilization. Morally she would do much by her example. Socially she would help, may materially, to give these people better ideas for future perhaps as seen in the light of good manners. Must make a marked improvement both in attendance and in the advancement made under a new teacher. It gives me pleasure to know that his assistants cooperate with him... Trusting that Miss Doyle's appointment will follow forthwith. Remain\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6051, File 259-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 17th November, 1902\n\nRev.

McLean\n\n(The Indian Dept.)\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the appointment of a teacher for the Indian School at Whyacrough, I have thrown some light on the subject.\n\nI have your letter asking me to appoint Miss Doyle in the recommendation of Inspector, Mr. Kinross and myself, and previous to that you asked me to concern with the Inspector in hiring a teacher. Why is all this tomfoolery going through? I have more to do than chase up and down to whyacrough and write here and there when such things are useless. I have made trips to whyacrough through fourteen miles of slush when I could scarcely consider myself paid with a master's salary. You have asked me to act as your agent hereafter, but I have tried to do the best of my ability and when your department becomes suffused through my fault than I wish to be dismissed. I am doing my part conscientiously, guarding my words and trying to be faithful to my master. I shall not change though and I detest being made a tool of. Let business be business.\n\nWho is this strange new personage? Have never heard of the gentleman. Where does he come from? When shall I address his appointment? Making this appointment over the appointment of the applicants already named is a very arbitrary way of doing business. Am I such a figure head? I think the Inspector was not well worth for my honest purpose. I wish to do well by your department and by\nthe Indians. I feel that I am entitled to an explanation of your extraordinary mode of procedure in this case and I ask for it. Please reconsider your latter step and reinstate Miss Doyle, who, I am sure, will give satisfaction.\n\nHowever, if no further steps must carry the weight of things in dealing with your department let me know something about Miss Leman. This business is a mean scheme and shows another depthpoliticians will stop to secure their end.\n\nNow, my dear sir, I feel that you should reconsider this matter and rise above this petty worshipping of party men. In the face of all that was done under your express orders I cannot see how you can turn around and cancel an appointment in your division. Satisfactory, have you received any complaints about Miss Doyle as a woman or as a teacher? If not why look so trusted. I feel confident that, when you consider that this affair is public property and may be discussed according to the wishes of the public, and an explanation asked in public, when you consider how very mean your action was; when you consider that a Department should not be swayed by a single man; when you consider many other circumstances connected with the affair, I feel confident, long that in the face of these things you will be pleased to reinstate Miss Doyle.\n\nAssuming myself that you will not go back on your former appointments on such small matters as I imagine there are between the lines.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald MacPherson, R.P.\nIndian Agent\n84.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to the enquiry contained in your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to inform you that the address of Mr. Angus MacLennan, who has been selected to fill the vacancy at the Whycoomagh Indian school, is Margaree, Inverness County, Nova Scotia, and I have to request that you will be good enough to notify Mr. MacLennan of his appointment at a salary of $250 per annum, and instruct him to proceed to Whycoomagh in time to open the school on Monday, the 8th of January next.\n\nBe good enough to give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nRev. D. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B.,\nNova Scotia,\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBe good enough to attend to the matter of my letter of 25th Ult re appointment of teacher for Indian School at Whyecough. In compliance with your orders I notified the teacher to quit at once as your instructions called for. Consequently the school has been idle since 14th ult. I asked the teacher to send me his report for transmission to you, but have not received it.\n\nI think it would be most unfair for you to make an appointment over that of Miss Boyle. There is a deal of business principle involved and I am certain if anyone else endeavored to act with your appointment in such a way that you would soon let him know who's role and what's what. I feel that I cannot take the interest Dwight in things if any work is not to be considered done under your supervision. A gentleman who might know told me that the appointment of teacher was part of the agent's privilege. I know nothing about that; but I know that in this case between inspectors, Mr. Murray and myself, the services of a promising teacher were secured. Possibly my letter of 25th Nov got a cold reception for nothing else can explain the long delay. I believe likely on the school reopened immediately after the holidays I knew your second nominee's name but I do not know his address. I feel pretty sure however that you will select Miss Boyle.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am informing you that I have been informed by Mr. Smith that he has received a letter from Mr. Johnson requesting an explanation regarding the delay in payment of his wages. Mr. Smith has asked me to forward this letter to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 3rd January, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the two letters hereunder from Mr Agent MacPherson respecting the appointment of a teacher for the school on the Whycoocomagh reserve, I beg to say that the first was written before he had received definite instructions to notify Mr McLennan of his appointment. In his second letter of the 30th ultimo, he states that he is advising him of his appointment but threatens to appeal to the House of Commons for an explanation as to why the Department made an appointment contrary to his recommendation.\n\nIt was only on the 5th November last that the Department accepted an apology from Father MacPherson for the intemperate language he used in official correspondence and it is a question how often he should be called upon to apologize for forgetting himself in this manner. He has apparently lost sight of the fact that as Agent, he is bound to obey orders.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 15th, 1903.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 30th ultimo, advising the Department you were informing Mr. McLennan of his appointment as teacher for the Indian School at the Whyocomagh Reserve. I may say, with reference to the correspondence which you have conducted with the Department regarding this matter, that it is not customary for the Department to make explanations at the request of its agents and it is entirely optional whether it does so or not. You are an Agent of this Department and should obey its instructions without question, and I wish to impress upon you that what you say about appealing to Parliament because the action of the Department does not meet with your views is something which can not be tolerated. Any further correspondence from you couched in such language will have to be dealt with as it deserves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFrank Pedley\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nReverend D. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C. B.,\nN. S.\nDear Sir,\n\nPermit me to say a few words in reply to your letter of 13th inst. From what you say I notice that my request for an explanation by your Department's way of dealing with the appointment of a teacher for the Wyandotte Indian School has at least been acknowledged. That done is something and perhaps sufficient as those who knew why a former appointment was cancelled. It is all cleared up now for the present teacher is a nephew of one who must be reckoned with. Now, my dear sir, I trust you will not consider me too horrible for anything. I respect you as a man but for politics as we know them I prefer leaving good enough alone. Of course you are not familiar with this little fight of mine over the School Question so I think that in justice to myself I should give its history.\n\nWhen I was given the agency three quarters ago, I thought that the School was out of hand. I made such a complaint to your Department. I also asked for information as to how to proceed in case of a vacancy. The teacher was made to stand a beating and his school was examined by the Inspector Maclean. He was dismissed. I was notified that effect by letter from Department having date Nov. 5th. I was instructed to notify the Indians that his services were no longer required. Further instructions to connect with the Public School Depart...\nWith a view to obtaining the services of a duly qualified teacher to take charge of the school, I did as recommended. I presented the application I had received, to Mr. Inspector Macdonald who made a first and second choice. His first happened to mine also. The agency lady belongs to my parish and knows what she is. I felt that her excellent character coupled with her experience would make her an excellent teacher to the Indian children. These children need the influence of good manners and good lives more than the bare idea of me and to make them good, independent, useful citizens of our land. A common nominee was appointed; but the same mail brought me a telegram cancelling the appointment. I thought I had a right to an explanation and I demanded one. The girl's character, the standing of the Inspector Macdonald and myself thought justified me in such a step. Again there was here an appointment without any concurrence of mine with the Inspector, a thing I had come to think essential; but when one understands better one can easily get over such small trifles. It affords me considerable satisfaction to learn that my request for an explanation is met, though I am denied such.\n\nAs to the present incumbent of the Indian school, may say that he promises to be a good, faithful servant and looks forward to seeing a vast improvement among those poor little children through the influence of a good life and an honest application to duty\u2014\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nDonald MacPherson, P.P.,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 26th January, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith returns received from the Whyccoomagh Indian school, sent in by Mr Murphy late teacher there, for September and December quarters last, and to request that you will be good enough to certify to the same if they are correct and return them to the Department at once so that payment will not be delayed.\n\nIt is noted that Mr Murphy claims that he has taught 58 days in the December quarter, being up to 17th Dec., although you were instructed by letter of the 5th Nov. last to notify him that his services were no longer required. If you acted on these instructions, the Department does not see how he could have remained in charge of the school for the time for which he claims payment. Be good enough to state when you he was notified of his dismissal, as he can only be paid for the actual time he taught.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. D. McPherson,\nIndian Agent, Glendale, C.B., N.S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you regarding your position as teacher at the Indian School in [location]. I understand that you have been employed there since [date], and I am writing to inform you that your services are no longer required effective immediately.\n\nAs per instructions received from the Department of Indian Affairs, you are hereby dismissed from your position as teacher at the Indian School. You are to report to the nearest post office by [date] to receive your final pay. Any personal effects left in your possession will be returned to you upon your departure.\n\nI trust this information is clear and complete. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.\n\nPlease make sure to return all personal effects to the school office before leaving.\nOrlycocumagh C.B.\nNov. 13th 1902\n\nResd. Agent Passover\nIndian Agency\n\nI am in receipt of your favor of the 10th inst. and note contents. I shall enter copy connection with the Indian School on the 14th Dec. The beginning of Christmas vacation will find me in absence of school on or about that time. I have closed order from Peter Cooper for stores and wish you would join to deduct from his store of account for building driving shed.\n\nYours Truly,\nP.M. Murphy\nDear Mr. Donald MacPherson,\n\nThe Board of Directors has received your letter dated 15th inst. The investigation has been completed and the charges laid against the teacher have been found to be unfounded. The Board has decided to notify him immediately that his services are no longer required. Should there be nothing else to be done, please send in your return for the next term taught and mention whether there will be your change address.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n[Name]\n\n[Signature]\nDonald MacPherson\n\n[Signature]\n[Name]\nDear Sir,\n\nPermit me to say that with regard to the enclosed returns I can do little more than sign my name thereto simply for form's sake. I enclose copies of letters I sent Mr. Murphy so to his dismissal, also a copy of one received from him. I think mine are sufficiently clear as to the manner in which they express your instructions to me. As to statistics of returns I can say nothing. You will note the date on which I first allowed the teacher to quit and the next date to which I permitted him to teach. Of course in justice he is entitled to pay only to Nov. 12th or so when he would receive my letter of Nov. 18th. It would be a revelation to us all, white men and Indians, how Mr. Murphy could get by his 5-8 days in D.C. quota. It would also be in the interests of truth should him prove that he taught 5-8 days. I mean that other was true. I presume both are the same.\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely Yours,\nDonald MacPherson, P.C.,\nIndian Agent.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata":
