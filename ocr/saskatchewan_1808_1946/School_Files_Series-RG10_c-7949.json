Brachet, Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School, for a small boat.\n\nI quite understand that your Department has spent a large amount of money for the construction of the road from the school to the station of McIntosh and that it is also yearly spending a fairly large sum for its maintenance.\n\nBut there is a problem of recruitment which must not be forgotten at McIntosh. All the reserves that send students to this school are north of it and there are no roads of any kind which can be used. For recruiting purposes a boat is therefore essential.\n\nSo that the Department would not be put to too much expense, I forwarded to Father Brachet the letter that I received from the Peterborough Canoe Co., and told him to select the cheapest boat capable of doing his recruitment. Personally, I would have advised him a much more expensive one, but he chose a 15 ft. boat without a canopy and powered with an out-board motor. That is possibly, the cheapest boat that you ever purchased for a residential school. I therefore hope that you may want to reconsider your decision.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

We have inspected for a good location and come now to propose to You and to the Department a site for said Indian Boarding School.\n\nThis land is situated in the Province of Ontario, 3 miles more or less North of the station of Mc Intosh, on the C.N.R. (G.T.P.) line, and may be described as Concession L.K.175, a regular quarter Section, 160 acres, and concession L.K.174 of similar size and immediately adjoining the former.\n\nThis land was surveyed by Mr A. Mc Meekin, residing at 216 Main Street, Kenora Ont., an Ont. land surveyor, for a certain Mr Wilson of Winnipeg. This land however has been abandoned several years and can now be considered as Crown Land. I however advised Mrs Wilson of our intention to take same for the Indian School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nHoping the Department shall not experience any difficulty in getting this site, which is a good farming land and very suitable to our purpose,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir:\n\nYour humble servant:\n\nJ.B. REYS O.M.I.\nProvincial\nJanuary 4th, 1924.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am advised by Rev. Father Reys of the Oblate Fathers that he has chosen as a suitable site for an Indian School certain lands near McIntosh, Ontario, comprising 320 acres more or less, and being known as Locations L.K. 174 and 175 Canyon Lake.\n\nI am acting for Mrs. Margaret Wilson of this city who is interested in the property. The property was surveyed for her late husband James A. Wilson the intention being that one-quarter section would be occupied by Mr. Wilson and the other quarter by his son William Wilson. Some improvements were made on the property but the son went away to the war, and was killed at the front. Mr. Wilson Sr. was killed accidentally on the C.N.R. in the early part of 1918. Owing to these happenings Mrs. Wilson was unable to go into occupation of the property.\n\nMrs. Wilson is prepared to release all claim to the property upon payment of $775.00. Out of this amount she would pay the price of the land asked by the Ontario Government, namely $1.00 per acre. There are also expenses of surveying which are still unpaid. These would also be paid from the said amount. As Mrs. Wilson's solicitor I would undertake to obtain from her a Quit Claim Deed or such other documents as may be necessary to release her claim, and would also undertake to see that the said accounts are paid before handing any balance over to Mrs. Wilson.\n\nI may say that in 1916 I had certain correspondence with the Department of Lands, Forests & Mines at Toronto with a view to obtaining title to the properties for Mrs. Wilson without the necessity of performing the usual homestead duties. The Department did not agree to this but they stated that they would consent to Mrs. Wilson disposing of her interest in the land to any other party who would undertake to do the settlement duties. I presume therefore that there would be no difficulty in arranging the matter satisfactorily.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nOttawa, 28th January 1924\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department has been considering establishing an Indian school near McIntosh, Ontario, and one of the sites which would appear favourable for this purpose is the 320 acres comprising locations 174 and 175, Canyon Lake.\n\nWould you be good enough to inform me if these locations are now recorded as Provincial Crown Lands or if the fee has passed to private individuals? In event of the fee having passed from the Crown, kindly advise me as to the name and address of the party or parties from whom it would be necessary to obtain title to this property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J.D.

The locations lie within the English River Pulp Limit and Mr. Wilson, the squatter on the lands, died and his widow has not been able to procure the lands.\n\nIn any event, the Department would not consider granting so large an area for a school site and if your Department desire to procure 5 acres in that vicinity for school site purposes it may be taken up under the regulations regarding the disposal of summer resorts, trading posts and other lots required in small areas.\n\nI enclose you a copy of these regulations for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Minister Lands and Forests\n\nJ.D.

Sir,\n\nThe Department is arranging to have the firm of Phillips and Benner, Ontario Land Surveyors of Port Arthur, undertake the survey of the parcel required for the purposes of the boarding school at McIntosh.\n\nThis survey is necessary as plans of the property must be filed with the Province of Ontario before the Province will definitely state that it will be made available, but I have every reason to hope that the application will be favourably considered.\n\nIn order that the surveyor be not delayed on his arrival, it is desired that the site which is satisfactory to you be definitely settled before he proceeds to do the work and I would request that you arrange to have your agricultural representative proceed there in advance of the surveyor and make this selection, on completion of which he could wire the surveyor that he was ready for him to commence work.\n\nIf your representative could on his first arrival at McIntosh advise Messrs. Phillips and Benner as to what labour would be available there for his survey party, it would assist him greatly and if labour can be obtained would greatly reduce the expense of survey.\n\nI am asking Messrs. Phillips and Benner to communicate with you so that you may arrange the details of the above points to your mutual satisfaction.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 14th instant, I have to request that you arrange to survey as soon as possible a parcel of approximately 250 acres in the vicinity of McIntosh Station for the purposes of the Indian boarding school. The site according to information to hand is approximately two miles south-west of McIntosh, fronting on the stream between Forest Lake and Canyon Lake. The survey is to be made in conformity with the regulations governing surveys in the Province of Ontario.\n\nThe selection of the parcel is to be made under the instructions of the Very Rev. G.B. Beys, O.M.I., 222 Provencher Ave., St. Boniface, Man. For your information I am enclosing a copy of his letter and shall be glad to hear from him. Please communicate with him. It is desirable that as much of the necessary labour in connection with this survey be obtained at McIntosh, or as near to the point of survey as possible.\n\nIt is reported that there is a small water power on the stream which it is hoped to utilize in connection with the boarding school, but that it is well under the 150 H.P. minimum, in fact about 40 H.P., and I have to request that your returns include such information as to volume and height of fall etc., as may be required in order to establish to the satisfaction of the Province that this power is sufficiently under the 150 H.P. to warrant them examining it outside the regulations regarding Water Powers and enabling us to grant the Department the use of this power. Your returns should also show the height of dam needed to develop this power and the extent of the lands would be flooded as a result of its construction. Payment will be at the rate of $20.00 per day.\n\nThe following are enclosed:- Field book sheets, Pay lists, Blueprint of the Township of 3rd, Blueprint of resort locations on Canyon Lake, Field of the West boundary of Smellie and a copy of Letter from Very Rev. G.B. Beys, O.M.I., Ontario Section sheet.\n\nYour returns should consist of full report, accounts and vouchers in duplicate and should be prepared in this Department.\n\nHerewith please find Departmental cheque for $100.00 on account of this survey.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J.D.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe enclose field notes and accounts for survey at McIntosh, Ont.\n\nIn regard to water power between Forest and Canon Lakes, we may say that we do not regard the result given in the field book as indicating the actual theoretical available horsepower, being probably considerably too high as the water is no doubt above the average at this season. There is a dam in poor repair at the outlet of Forest Lake, this has a six foot opening in it, the sill at the opening being 2.65 feet below the level of Forest Lake. The water in the pool below the dam and away from the influence of the current in the timber slide is 0.63 feet below the level of Forest Lake. The results given were obtained by measuring the current in the timber slide 300 feet long and five feet wide and taking the depth of water in the slide, as the dam and entrance to the slide are leaking badly it was estimated that 70% of the water was going through the slide. The information in regard to the watershed drained by this stream appears to be very vague and there is probably no reliable information in regard to rainfall at this point so that this method of calculating the power does not appear to be available without considerable investigation.\n\nIt would probably not be necessary or desirable to hold the water of Forest Lake above its present level which appears to be about normal high water and to do this a dam of the height of the present one would be sufficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhillips & Benner\n\nper C.A.

It may be that the Province cannot reduce the rate below a minimum of $5.00 per acre, but on account of it being for educational purposes I endeavoured to obtain a rate of $3.00 per acre. A final rate was not decided upon but the Department will be informed as to that when reply is received to our letter to the Deputy Minister, Department of Lands and Forests, dated the 26th instant.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that this property as surveyed included so much water front, it was decided that the Province would reserve a road allowance one chain in width along the water front. The above assurance was given with the understanding that no squatters or improvements of any kind were on the property with the exception of the old dam at Forest Lake and the slide between Forest Lake and Canyon Lake. As the Department has the assurance of Father Boys and also of the surveyor who made the survey that there no squatters or other improvements, it may be taken that the transaction will be completed and that preparations for construction of the buildings may be immediately undertaken. The Department may expect official confirmation of this from the Province early in the coming week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are sending you under separate cover plans of Surveys at Mobert and at McIntosh duly signed as requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhillips & Benner,\nper E.P.A. Phillips.\n597 McDermot Avenue, WINNIPEG, Man.\nAugust 2nd, 1924.\n\nMr J.D. McLean, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of July 21st, addressed to Very Rev. Fr Beys O.M.I., St Boniface, in the matter of preliminary work at McIntosh, Ont, in view of the erection of an indian residential school, I am directed to submit to the Department a list of different works to be undertaken without delay:\n\n- Clearing of land (if possible to the extent of 40 acres)\n- Building of docks at the station and at the school site;\n- \" a slide for unloading of cars;\n- \" 2 temporary shelters for men;\n- \" 1 \" horses;\n- \" 1 \" kitchen;\n- Blazing of trail from station to the school (over 1 mile).\n\nAs already mentioned in my letter of July 3rd, the approximate cost will be about $5,000.00 (including material, freight, salaries, use of gasoline boat, etc).\n\nHowever, Very Rev. Fr Beys is prepared to have all this work done by day labor and to supply in due time the salary sheets and vouchers for material and freight. Regarding the gasoline launch referred to in your letter this matter will not be taken up presently.\n\nIn my opinion the above would be the most practical course to follow as it would be rather difficult to give a definite estimate for the total work. I beg to state again that this work is most urgent as the tenders will be opened on the 18th inst and the erection of the building should be proceeded with immediately on account of the late season.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nOttawa, August 5th, 1924.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd inst. with reference to the preliminary work required at the McIntosh school.\n\nWith reference to the building of docks at the station and construction of a slide to unload all materials, I would say that the contractor, to whom the contract will be awarded for the erection of the building, will be expected to make all arrangements necessary for the delivery of the materials at the site of the school.\n\nRegarding the clearing of land, approximately forty acres, and the blazing of a trail from the station to the school, I am pleased to authorize you to proceed with this work. The work to be performed by day labour under the direct supervision of one of the members of your order. Time sheets should be kept for the labour performed and forwarded to the Department in duplicate at the end of each week. A fortnightly report should also be submitted outlining the work that has been performed.\n\nWith reference to the building of two temporary shelters for the men and one shelter for horses and one for a kitchen, will you please advise me if these accommodations are required for the men employed in clearing\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nthe land, also the size of the buildings you propose to erect and the approximate estimate of the cost. Of course you understand that the contractor for the school building will be expected to make all arrangements for the providing of accommodations for his men.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| Name          | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | No. days worked | Price per day | Amount of wages | Received Payment |\n|---------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Eugene Gauthier | 10   | 8     | 8    | 10     | 10   | 5    |                  |               |                 |                  |\n| John Pichette | 10   | 10    | 10   | 10     | 10   | 6    |                  |               |                 |                  |\n| John Drouin    | 12   | 8     | 10   | 10     | 10   | 5    |                  |               |                 |                  |\n| Mr. Boudreault | 10   | 10    | 10   | 10     | 10   | 5    |                  |               |                 |                  |\n| J.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th inst., in the matter of preliminary work at McIntosh Indian Boarding School, I wish to thank you for the authority given for the clearing of approximately forty acres and the blazing of a trail from the station to the school. In connection with the same matter I wish to state the following.\n\nYour remarks about the docks and slide have been noted and we will govern ourselves accordingly.\n\nThe clearing of the land in our estimation and according to work already done will cost approximately $110.00 an acre, making a total of about $4,400 for the forty acres required. As already stated, the site of the intended school and surroundings are thickly wooded and the work of clearing is extremely difficult, but this work has to be done for the protection of the school from fire and also for the purpose of having land for cultivation.\n\nThe temporary shelters referred to are exclusively for the use of the men presently working on the site and cost from $500 to $600.\n\nAs you are aware, the Oblate Fathers have already spent a considerable amount of money at McIntosh for preliminary work and I take the liberty, in the name of Very Rev. Fr Beys O.M.I., of asking for an advance of $4,000. I herewith enclose salary sheets and vouchers for material already received and used. The total amount is $2,554.25 which partly accounts for the request of an advance.\n\nHoping that this request will receive favorable consideration, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Guy in reply to your letter of the 5th inst., with further reference to the preliminary work required in connection with the proposed new McIntosh school.\n\nFather Guy states that the cost of clearing the land is approximately $110.00 an acre, making a total of $4,400.00 for the forty acres required.\n\nThe temporary shelters which he asked for, in a previous letter, are required exclusively for the use of the men employed in clearing the land and will cost approximately $600.00.\n\nHe has made a request for an advance of $4000.00 and has also forwarded vouchers amounting to $2354.25. I beg to recommend, for your consideration, that a cheque for the $4000.00 asked for be drawn in the name of the Rev. Father Guy.

Phillips, O.L.S., of a parcel containing 191 acres lying to the west of and adjoining the Township of Smellie. I am also enclosing a description of this property made by W.R. White, O.L.S., and a declaration setting forth that there are no squatters or improvements on the land and that the property is required for educational purposes.\n\nIt is presumed that it is your intention that the road allowance which is provided along the shore of Canyon Lake in this parcel will be continued through Lot 12, in Con. 5 and 6.\n\nOn receipt of advice that this plan is approved and accepted and a statement of the total number of acres for which payment should be made, including the area of the S.1/2, Lot 12, Con. 6, Tp. of Smellie, a cheque will be forwarded to you at the rate of $5.00 per acre, as arranged.\n\nAs previously understood it is of course expected that permission will be granted to the Department to use the small water power on the stream connecting Forest and Canyon Lakes.

Attwood, Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, Department of the Interior. For your information I submit the following extract from his report:\n\nPossible Power\n\nUnder the maximum regulated head of 17 feet and the estimated low-water flow of 14 c.f.s., the power available at the site is 22 h.p. By the use of the storage, however, it is estimated that the minimum flow may be increased to 25 c.f.s., although the head will be decreased as the storage is used until it is 14 feet. Under these conditions the estimated minimum power available is 32 h.p.\n\nUse of Power\n\nThe amount of power available is sufficient only for small local uses such as lighting, pumping for water supply, sawing wood, etc. There is at present no market at the site, but it is proposed to establish there a small Indian mission-school, for the purpose of which the power could be very advantageously employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J.D.

We are having this corrected on our plan and would suggest that you make the correction on your copies. The total distance as shown along the east side of this line, namely 25 chains, is correct and the distance given in our description, 25 chains, which was copied in your Order in Council, should be 25 chains.\n\nIt is further noted that an apparent clerical error has been made in the Order in Council in stating the area in Parcel I as one hundred and sixty acres and thirty-five hundredths of an acre, which should be one hundred and sixty-six acres and thirty-five hundredths of an acre.\n\nIt is also noted that in your description you have left out the portion excepting the connecting waters between Canyon Lake and Forest Lake. Is it to be presumed that this was done with the intention of conveying to this Department the water power which it is necessary to use for our school purposes?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Lands and Forests,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hunter, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Public Works,\nDept. of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nOttawa November 17, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nWith reference to the letter of the 11th ultimo, from the Department of Indian Affairs in attached file IO,971-1, regarding navigation on Canyon Lake, Ont., I beg to transmit herewith a report thereon dated the 14th inst. from Mr. District Engineer V.Y. Mercourt.\n\nThe District Engineer reports that the Dept. of Indian Affairs have constructed a school for Indians at the lower end of a small arm of Canyon Lake, near McIntosh on the Can.Nat.Ry., about 165 miles east of Winnipeg. It is understood that it is proposed to build in connection with this school, stables, a saw mill and power plant, etc. The material for these works, as well as the furnishings and supplies for the school, will have to be brought from rail head at McIntosh to the school by water, as overland traffic in the summer months is impossible. Previous to the construction of the Can.Nat.Ry., the natural depth of water in Canyon Lake was sufficiently adequate for these purposes. When the railway was constructed the right of way across this small arm of Canyon Lake was filled in and a culvert and artificial channel built to take care of the flow of water. While the culvert and the channel provide ample clearance and width, the channel itself is not sufficiently deep for the present needs of navigation.\n\nIt is stated further that the supplies mentioned above will be taken in barges towed by a motor launch, and to provide sufficient draft for these vessels a minimum depth of 4 feet at low water level will be required. As far as can be ascertained this work was constructed without permission being granted under the Navigable Waters Protection Act.\n\nI would suggest that the Department write to the Company and point out that the work seems to have been constructed without permission being granted under the Navigable Waters Protection Act, and request that they provide the necessary channel.\n\n(sgd) E.M. Cameron,\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa Nov.22,1924.\n\nFROM-The Secretary,\nDept.of Public Works.\n\nTO-The Secretary,\nDept.of Railways & Canals,\nOTTAWA.\n\nA complaint has been made to this Department by the Department of Indian Affairs regarding the blocking of navigation facilities formerly existing at Canyon Lake, Ont., by the construction of works by the Canadian National Railways (C.N.R.)\n\nI send you herewith a copy of letter from the Department of Indian Affairs, and copy of a report from our District Engineer, which fully explain the situation.\n\nAs the records of the Department do not show that the work complained of was approved either under the Navigable Waters Protection Act or the Railway Act, I am directed to request that you will please provide the necessary channel for use at the beginning of next season.\n\n(sgd) N.E.O'Brien,\nSecretary.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER\nOTTAWA\n23rd January 1925\n\nTO\u2014The Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nReplying to your favour of the 20th instant, in reference to filling in by the Canadian National Railways of the right of way across Canyon Lake at McIntosh Station, I enclose herewith copy of a report presented by the Chief Engineer together with copy of a communication addressed to the Secretary, Department of Railways & Canals, under date of December 22nd last, which will fully inform you of the action taken on your request of October 11th, 1924.\n\nJ.B. Hunter,\nDeputy Minister.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nOttawa, Feb. 5, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nOn his return from making inspection of the McIntosh School Mr Orr reported on the desirability and necessity of deepening the water passage in the present culvert under the tracks of the Grand Trunk Pacific at Canyon Lake. This matter was brought to the attention of the Department of Public Works, and I have today received a reply from them in which they state that as the railway did not obtain any permit to block navigation on Canyon Lake they have been directed to provide the necessary channel for use at the beginning of the next season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I believe that the water in this channel is not more than 12 inches deep at the present time. As the channel will be needed immediately the ice leaves the lake, the work of deepening it should be proceeded with without delay.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

Fogley, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Railways & Canals,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the alleged blocking of navigation on Canyon Lake near McIntosh on the Quibell Subdivision. I was informed some time ago that the trouble being experienced was partly caused by the low water; however, we have taken no steps to deepen the channel and no such action is contemplated by us, as our Legal Department advise us that this is not our obligation.\n\nMy understanding is that, in previous seasons, supplies for the Indian School have been taken through the opening on a scow towed by a gasoline launch. I am not informed as to whether there is now sufficient depth of water to enable this to be done. The report I have on the subject indicates that to deepen the opening now would be a hazardous undertaking, with the possibility of causing interruption to traffic.\n\nIt is presumed that the Department of Indian Affairs will be informed of the views of our Legal Department to the effect that no statute was infringed when this fill and diversion were made by the Government.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) S. J. Hungerford,\nVice-President.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th December, instant, regarding the blocking of navigation facilities on Canyon Lake, near McIntosh, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter dated the 17th instant from Mr. S. J. Hungerford, Vice-President, Canadian National Railways, in the matter.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. V. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nOctober 28, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the blocking of navigation facilities on Cayuga Lake near Rollinsford Station, and in reply to my request for a copy of the letter from the Vice-President of the Canadian National Railways, as enclosed with your letter, state that the Legal Department advises that they are under no obligation to provide a proper channel through their waterway.\n\nIn a letter received from the Deputy Minister of the Dept. of Public Works, under date of the 26th of June, of this year, a copy of the memorandum from the Chief Engineer of that Department was enclosed, which stated that this blocking of navigation was done without obstruction being caused under the applicable laws or regulations, and I am enclosing herewith a copy of said memorandum for your information.\n\nI may say that the only way during the summer months of getting supplies into this school is by water, and that freighting material from Rollinsford Station to the school is necessary to pass through these large channels. I do not agree with the Canadian National Railways' statement that the deepening of the opening would be a hazardous undertaking with the possibility of causing obstruction to traffic. I may say that the Assistant of the Department is well acquainted with local conditions, and that the deepening of the channel can be very easily carried out without in any way affecting the military traffic. Will you be kind enough to see if something cannot be done during this winter to deepen this channel in order to provide proper navigation for boats to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

January 27, 1925.\n\nCulvert - Canyon Lake, Near McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Warren.\n\nAnswering yours of the 21st instant, the National Transcontinental Railway Act is silent on the matter of obstructing or diverting navigable waters.\n\nThe Government Railways Act does not, in my opinion, apply, firstly because its provisions are not incorporated in the N.T.R. Act, and secondly because it only applies to Railways vested in the Crown and under the control of the Minister of Railways. This Act provides that the \"Minister\" shall not obstruct any navigable waters. The work on the N.T.R. was done not by the Minister but by the Commissioners of the N.T.R.\n\nThe Dominion Railway Act is only made applicable in a limited way, that is certain powers are given, but no obligations, duties or restrictions are imposed. Accordingly, I do not think the navigable waters provisions of the Dominion Railway Act apply to this work.\n\nThe only other Act that has any bearing on the subject is the Navigable Waters Protection Act in force in 1909 when the work was done. This Act did not forbid a fill such as that at Canyon Lake. In any event as the Crown is not specifically named in the Act it is not bound by its provisions.\n\nAccordingly it seems to me that when this fill and diversion were made by the Government no statute was infringed.\n\nEven if this work had been done in contravention of a statute, it seems to me the deepening of the stream to permit of navigation would be a matter of construction and not one of \"operation and management\" which latter are the only powers entrusted to us in relation to the N.T.R.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that reply be made to the Dominion Government that no sanction were required for the work done without under the Navigable Waters Act, or any other Railway Act, and that the matter being one of construction is one for consideration by the Dominion Government alone.\n\n\"G.

For your information I enclose copy of Mr. G. M. Hair's opinion of January 27th, 1925, which is concurred in by our Vice-President and General Counsel.\n\nThe whole trouble seems to have been caused by the failure of the Indian Department to inform the Commissioners of the navigation requirements when the line was being constructed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) S.

The principal asks that the work on this should\nbe started as soon as possible and that the engineer\nshould see him before commencing.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to yours of April 23, 1926, file 130-7-9 I beg to say that though the clearing of land is very important and I would not hesitate to say even necessary, I must let it go if the funds are so limited because there is more pressing need, namely the flooring of the basement covering of the flat roof and root cellar.\n\nTrust that you will be able to help us in this matter of the land clearing in the near future.\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont May 12th 1926\nOttawa, June 28, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to improvements at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I regret that the only vote in this connection was one of $500 for clearing. Please let me know without delay if this sum is more urgently required for outbuildings than for clearing.

In reply I enclose herewith an accountable cheque No. 1610, for $500, to be used in the payment of the labour in the clearing of the land.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to keep returns, in duplicates, of the labour employed. The names of the men employed and all the other columns on the return should be filled in properly. Each man should sign the return, in duplicate, in the presence of a witness. You should certify the return and hand them to Mr. Agent Edwards, who is being informed of the authority granted you to incur the above expenditure. He will forward these returns to the Department. These labour returns are to account for the expenditure in the employment of the labour to the amount of the grant. Should there be any balance on hand after the work is completed, you should hand same to Mr. Edwards for transmission to the Department.

Ry. The Principal informs me that he gave the Father Provincial, in October or November, 1927, a copy of a contract which had been given him by Mr. Fred McIntosh, who was the Divisional Engineer on that section of the railroad, and in which it was stated that the Railway authorities would see to it that the water in the culvert would be at least 4 feet deep. I would suggest, therefore, that you ascertain if this work should not be done by the Railway, without any charge to our Department. It would be cheaper and better to have the work done in March before the ice goes out instead of in June. There is only 12 inches of water, in the culvert at the present time.\nOttawa, January 24, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Edwards writes that Father Perreault, Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School, gave you, in the fall of 1927, copy of a contract entered into by the Divisional Engineer of the C.

It is expected that, under favorable conditions, the work can be done for about two thousand dollars, but to undertake it at the present time would cost very much more.\n\nWill you please advise if this is satisfactory to you?

McKenzie's telegram of the 28th instant, authorizing me to have work completed to insure three feet of water in the McIntosh culvert on the C.N.Railway near McIntosh School. On the 26th instant I received a telegram from Mr. E.W. Robinson, District Engineer of the C.N.R Port Arthur, saying:\n\n\"Have gang now working on concrete culvert McIntosh.

Principal and the Brother, we met Foreman Welsh and looked over the situation. The foreman explained it would be a very expensive job to put in coffer dams and take out much of the solid rock, and also that the amount of the appropriation, $2,000, was just about exceeded. He informed me that with the expenditure of a little more money and providing the water kept warm, he could guarantee a depth of three feet of water for very little more expense, and as the Principal informed me they could manage with this amount, I sent the following telegram to Mr. Robinson:\n\n\"Foreman Welsh guarantees at least three feet of water in culvert at present water level when all loose rock and a few points of solid rock are cut.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nKenora, Ont.\nSept. 9th, 1929\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter #130-7-9 of the 4th instant re improvements on culvert Canadian National Railways near McIntosh School. I visited this School on Saturday and Sunday, the 7th and 8th, and found that the Railway Company had moved their men from the work and the depth in the culvert at one point was only 2 ft. 6 inches and not 3 feet as promised. It is impossible for the School to take their launch through with any supplies and in going through with a row boat and outboard motor, they even hit bottom. The Principal is letting the water through the dam from the lakes higher up so as to enable the water power branch to do the necessary work in repairing the hole in the culvert. This will bring up the water a little and perhaps they will then be able to go through. They have to bring gravel from the lake North of the track through the culvert to the School for the repair work to the dam, which is being started in a few days, and as they are unable to bring the launch through, they request authority to purchase a large Johnson Outboard engine. The Father Provincial from St. Boniface was at the School and we discussed the matter. I suggested he should ask the Principal of the Kenora Residential School if he would be willing to give them his large Johnson, and he was agreeable to do so, and the same is being shipped today. The Principal of the Kenora School would like, if possible, to have authority to purchase a smaller one, namely a Johnson Sea Horse to replace it. This would be the cheapest way of surmounting the difficulties. I shall be glad if you can see your way clear to purchase a Sea Horse Johnson Outboard Motor for the Kenora School and charge the big one to McIntosh School.\n\nThis Summer has been exceptionally dry and I personally do not think the water will be as low as this again for some time so perhaps the school could manage without deepening the culvert any more.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

To my understanding, the said Culvert was to be deepened four feet, but since the supposed work is over, we have noticed no difference as we cannot pass with our large boat and are obliged to lift the engine of our canoe. I am most sure that it is not more than a foot deeper, which is not sufficient.\n\nI regret of not being capable to O.K. the work and trust all in your care.\n\nI remain, Sincerely Yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOctober 14th, 1929\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find voucher for $2,744.20 in favor of the Canadian National Railways for work on culvert at McIntosh. The Principal refuses to O.K. the account as he says what was done was absolutely of no use. The arrangement was that the culvert was to be deepened four feet but the Principal states it has not been deepened more than a foot, and cannot pass through with a large boat. He says they are even obliged to lift the outboard engine on the canoe.\n\nThis work was authorized from Ottawa and the Railway Company promised at first to deepen the culvert four feet as the Principal states, but this was not done. As I presume the account will be paid, I have, therefore, O.K'd it, although the work is not satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edward\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 18, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Edwards, of Kenora, has forwarded accounts Nos. W.9068-9 from your office, which have reference to deepening of culvert near McIntosh, Ont., so that it will be passable by boats of the Indian Residential School there. At the request of your District Engineer, Mr. E. W. Robinson, Mr. Edwards went to McIntosh on August 26th and learned from your foreman, Mr. Welsh, that, with an expenditure of a little more money (evidently over and above the $8,500 authorized) and provided the water kept warm, he could guarantee a depth of three feet of water at the then present level. On the 28th, after Mr. Edwards had returned to Kenora, he received a telegram from Mr. Robinson that he could not guarantee three feet of water and he suggested shallower draft barges and boats rather than face expensive excavation of solid rock.\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the School at McIntosh wrote on the 7th instant that it is necessary to lift the outboard engine of the canoe and that their launch boat cannot go through at all. This Department is satisfied that your District Engineer has done what he could for the amount authorized; but, before paying the account, I should be glad to have on our file a report from your District Engineer, showing just what has been done and indicating what, if anything, is possible, what additional work would be necessary to prepare a really satisfactory channel for the purposes of our school. If this report could be sent to me in duplicate, I should be very grateful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. G.

I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. A. C. Egan, Comptroller, Canadian National Railways, Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont., December 2, 1929\n\nMr. H.P. North,\nSuperintendent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nYour letter of October 30th, with copy of letter attached from Mr. J.D. McLean, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe work performed this year embraced the removal of loose rocks in the channel approaches to culvert and the blasting of small projecting pieces of rock. A quantity of clay was also secured and deposited in a pile at the South end of South approach, in anticipation of coffer-damming the channel, which scheme was later considered too expensive and abandoned.\n\nThe additional depth secured from this work in places exceeded 5 ft., but on the average was slightly less. I made an inspection of this Culvert three weeks ago, and in testing the depth of water, found it about 2.5 ft.\n\nCanyon Lake at present, on account of the low precipitation this past Summer and Fall, is about 1 ft., 6 inches, or 2 ft., lower than normal. This condition, alone, in my opinion, accounts for the difficulty experienced by the Indian School Authorities in navigating the channel. Under normal water levels they should experience no difficulty whatever.\n\nI have estimated it will cost about $8000.00 to lower the approaches an additional 2 ft., through solid rock, which estimate includes the de-watering of the existing channel in order to enable blasting to be done. The most expensive part of this operation is the coffer-damming of the open ends and the blocking of seams in the rock side walls of the approach, in order to keep water from seeping through the walls.\n\nI am still of the opinion that the expense involved is not warranted, and that the Indian Dept. would do well to consider the use of shallower boats and barges.\n\nSigned (R.W.

Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed the report for labour made last Spring at the McIntosh Indian School.\nI did not send it sooner as I did not have enough sheets of those return of labour. I asked some to Mr. Edwards, Indian Agent who himself always forgot to forward some.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nJanuary 15th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my trip of inspection to McIntosh School last week, the Principal asked me if the Department could not do something re raising the water in Canyon Lake, so that his boat could get through the culvert. The work done by the C.N.Railway has not deepened the channel enough. He informs me that if a dam was put at the outlet of Canyon Lake, it would raise the water sufficiently for his purpose. He says that Mr. E.Wallace a small lumber man operating there, has authority from Toronto to put in a dam, but he is not going to do so.\n\nIf the Department made a grant of $1000.00 for this purpose, the school would put in the dam under the superintendence of Brother Eugene Gothier, so as to keep the water up to normal height, and the water would not be raised in the lake enough to do any damage to the settlers, campers or anyone else.\n\nHe asks that the Department purchase the material, about $600.00 for a Chicken House and the School would supply the labour and if the Department agrees, the Principal would go ahead with the work, and render the account after the 31st March.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-9, part 1)\nWe shall be glad to receive instructions re these matters,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-20 of the 15th instant, with reference to a grant of $1,000 for the erection of a dam near the McIntosh Indian Residential School, so that the level of Canyon Lake will be raised and the passage under the C. N. R. culvert made deep enough for the school boats. There are no funds available for this purpose at the present time, nor will there be any during 1931. Further, there has been so much difficulty in connection with the raising of waters in this section, that the Department wishes the school to see if the present situation is not satisfactory before we even consider making application to the provincial authorities for the right to change the level of the lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI visited the McIntosh Indian Residential School on Sunday, the 3rd instant. I found conditions here to be satisfactory, the school well managed, and in a most cleanly condition. The pupils had all returned from their holidays.\n\nOwing to the low water in Canyon Lake, the school launch, which brings in all supplies, has difficulty in getting under the culvert of the C.N.R. track. The Principal suggested that the Department provide a grant to build a dam at the outlet of the lake. I told him it would be impossible at the present time to consider making any grant for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It was brought to my attention that about twelve children from Grassy Narrows I.R. had not returned to the School since last fall. Approximately half this number were new pupils who should have been enrolled in September. We gave notice in writing to the parents or guardians in November, informing them that the children must be sent to school immediately. Only two children have been returned to date as a result of this warning.\n\nI would suggest that a member of the R.C.M.P. from Kenora be sent to Grassy Narrows with instructions to bring all delinquents out to McIntosh. Some of the children are out with their parents on the trap lines, consequently it would be impossible to contact all of them at once.\n\nIt is proposed that the parents and guardians be prosecuted under Section 10 for failing to have their children attend school after having been notified. This action would not be practical until Treaty time but even then it would serve as a good example.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 25, 1943.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to certain Grassy Narrows children who failed to return to the McIntosh Indian Residential School at the commencement of the current academic year.\n\nIf you consider that the R.C.M.P. would be able to reach any appreciable number of these children, you may arrange to have one of the officers visit Grassy Narrows. However, the Department does not see any necessity for this action if he would only secure one or two pupils.\n\nI agree with you that the compulsory clause in the Act should be enforced regarding these Indians and this phase of the question should receive your attention at Treaty time.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Patricia\nAge: 5\nName of Band: Park Hope\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 340\nFather's full name and No.: Joseph\nMother's full name and No.: Joseph\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: R.C.\nDoes applicant speak English?

I believe this represents practically all the children of school age, with the possible exception of one or two sickly ones, who are permanent residents of Grassy Narrows. Consequently we do not propose taking any further action at this time. The Reverend Principal has expressed himself as being well satisfied with the results.\n\n\"It is noted that the reasons given by the parents or guardians for not having their children sent to school were partly due to insufficient clothing & footwear at the school, also that they were severely punished by being locked up in rooms, etc. These statements given you by the Indians are nothing more or less than lies. Our Inspector, Mr. Hamilton, who recently visited the school, stated that he was of the opinion that the children at Nettleton were better clothed than those in any other school in his Inspectorate. He has had occasion to know that some punishment at this school is severe but nothing that would justify a complaint of this nature. I mention this for purposes of record only.\n\n\"We wish to thank you for your co-operation in this matter.\"\n\nIn view of the above no further action will be taken in this connection.\n\nH.O.E.B.D.C.,\nThe G.O., 8th Division,\nS.G.M.

This girl is almost blind having undergone an operation for cataracts about eighteen months ago. She has no place to go and is not employable. The Nenaokijic girls are orphans and also have no place to go, although we will endeavour to have them employed if suitable work can be found for them. Suzanna Ferguson is an illegitimate orphan, consequently there is nowhere for her to go when she leaves the school unless we are able to find employment for her as well as the others.\n\nIt is recommended that these girls be allowed to continue at the school for another year or until such time as arrangements can be made for their employment.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\nOttawa,\nMay 19, 1943.\n\nMr. G.

We won't by no means let her out of school to work for any one and we do hope she gets married during the coming year. It would be the only way to assure her a safe future.\n\nPoor illegitimate child of an abused young girl she would surely follow her mother's path judging by her attitude and disposition.\n\nWe believe that the only means to save her is to let her choose here the man she likes and we prefer to keep the girl at school even at our own expense than to let her go out and work for any one.\n\nThe child given to the school by her dying mother must and will find here happiness and protection.\n\nTrusting you fully understand this request\nI am Yours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSioux Lookout, August 4th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter received from the Reverend Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School with respect to retaining pupil 086 in the School for another year.

They request that the Department give assistance toward providing them with portable sawmill. They were given to understand that this might be possible after the war but not at present. The matter of American Tourists, hunters and fishermen, supplying the Indians employed as guides, with liquor was brought to my attention. I would suggest if possible that arrangements be made with the Ontario Department of Game and Fisheries to have printed on each license issued to non-residents a warning in this regard. They also wanted to know if it was the intention of the Indian Affairs or the Department of Game and Fisheries to deprive them of the right to hunt and fish for their own use off their reserves. The subject of children being sent to the Residential School at McIntosh was fully discussed. The reasons given for not cooperating fully were not very impressive. I agreed to meet the Chief and Councillors at McIntosh some time in September and investigate each complaint with the School authorities. The Band passed a resolution to have all outside Band members living in the vicinity of, or on, the Reserve transferred to the Grassy Narrows Band. This did not include the Wabuskang Band members.\n\nGifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Most of the children listed, I believe, are of primary age and should be at school. If you proceed to survey further, it is requested that you insist that the parents of these children send or take them to the school immediately. We have notified all the parents by letter in accordance with the Indian Act, that the children must attend school, otherwise prosecution would result.\n\n3. The child, while on leave during the No. 103 Indian Residential School, has returned that a number of children had returned, but there was still about 10 more who were located and three were unable to return to school immediately, and mostly because they lived near the school, were escorted to the school. It is also reported that four of those were located at various places and will be sent back to their respective schools, so other measures will be made and it will be determined if these children have been returned.\n\n4. While on patrol at Garry River, I.A., four more children were located and two were instructed to return immediately. These were children who could not go to the school. Other Indians have followed up, and the opportunity was given and they were able to return very successfully. This has been done several times recently, and the Indians report. It is stated the policy of the Indian Agent is being adhered to, and the children are being returned to the school under police escort. He performed these duties without any difficulty.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This was authorized by Department letter 451-1 February 1st, 1943. She was discharged from the Sanatorium in September 1944 and had to take pneumo-thorax treatments. It appears that she went to Winnipeg intending to secure light work and continue her pneumo treatments at the same time. Inspector Hamilton decided that the best plan would be for her to return to the McIntosh Indian Residential School from which she could come to Sioux Lookout for treatments as required.\n\nI do not know why Application for Admission was not forwarded before this date, but it is recommended that her application for re-admission under these special circumstances be approved.\n\nG.

Would there be any possibility of you finding a place for her at Sioux Lookout where she could get her pneumothorax treatments and perhaps some light employment. We would be willing to contribute toward her maintenance. If this is impossible the Medical Division will have to pay her board in the Residential School and you should find out from them the sum for which they will agree to keep her and then you will have to arrange for her to come to Sioux Lookout for treatment as required.\n\nEither of these or any other practical solution that you can work out will be appreciated by the department.\n\nP.

When the evidence re residence was taken, the mother volunteered the information that the children were Treaty Indians, although she had lost her treaty status through her marriage to Danielson. The case was remanded until January 31st, 1945, to have the Indian Department represented.\n\nAt the second hearing the Indian Department was represented by Mr. Ward Leroy, who states that by a ruling of the Indian Department these children are to remain wards until they are twenty-one years of age. The Magistrate stated that he found the children neglected, and if it were not for the fact that they were already wards of the Indian Department, he would have made them wards of the Children's Aid Society.\n\nIndiscussing this matter afterwards with Mr. Leroy, he told us that he was thinking of sending the children down to the MacIntosh School. The little girl is crippled and he thought it might be arranged for her to attend the Shiner's Hospital in Winnipeg from the school.\n\nWe will be interested to know your decision on this case and shall be glad to give you any further information you may require.\n\n(Sgd.)

DANIELSON, Karl.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in connection with the above. While the mother has lost her status as an Indian, the father of the children was an Indian and, consequently, they remain Indians. When they reach 21 years of age, they can decide if they wish to become enfranchised.\n\nI note from the copy of the letter from the Children's Aid Society that our officer at Port Arthur is considering the placing of these children in one of our residential schools. I intend to write to our Indian Agent, Mr. J. G.

Burk, Indian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Dependents' Allowance Board, enclosing copy of a communication dated February 2 from the Children's Aid Society, Fort Arthur, with reference to three Danielson children. In this connection I might refer you to departmental letter of May 25, 1945.\n\nIn the letter from the Children's Aid Society it appears that they consider the children are not receiving proper care and consequently they endeavoured to have them made wards of their Society. However, it is stated that your clerk, Mr. Leroy, was present at the hearing and he intimated that it was your intention to have two of the children sent to the McIntosh School and the little girl placed in a hospital in Winnipeg. We do not appear to have received any correspondence from you regarding the placing of two of the children in McIntosh. Provided they are physically fit and are eligible for admission to that school, we are quite prepared to approve their admission.

One of the children, however, (Merle) is at present a patient in our Squaw Bay Indian Hospital on the Fort William Indian reserve. Applications for their admission to the McIntosh school have not been forwarded to Ottawa, due to the fact that their Mother refused to sign the application forms, but it is expected these will be forwarded you in a few days time.\n\nWith reference to Elizabeth, one of the children sent to McIntosh school, Dr. Gillie, our Indian doctor, considers that she should be given treatment for her hip at the Shriner's Hospital, at Winnipeg, Man., just as soon as she reaches a certain age. This matter is under his consideration at the present time and you will be advised later.\n\nI trust that my action in this matter meets with the Department's approval.\n\nJ.G.

I discussed this matter with Rev. Father Perrault who informed me that these boys were sent in from Red Lake with the understanding that they were members of his church. Their parents, or guardians, in the case of the King boy, were away on their trap lines and it was impossible to get in touch with them. From your letter of January 31st I understood that I was authorized to make the most practical arrangements possible under the circumstances, and after reviewing all the information available, I decided that the logical solution would be to have the boys remain at McIntosh until June. I will interview the parents and guardians in June or July and discuss the matter fully with them at that time. It is nearly five years now since I have seen the Paishk family. Consequently I am not very familiar with their latest religious belief. In the meantime it is recommended that the boys be allowed to remain at McIntosh as grant-earning pupils until the end of the present term. It is also recommended that all Missionaries, when recruiting pupils for the various schools, be requested to take every precaution in order not to have children of one faith being admitted to a school of different faith.

Was it impossible to make arrangements for the transportation of these children in a less costly method? As you know, air transportation is expensive and principals, missionaries and our own officials interested in placing children in residential schools should make every possible endeavour to have them brought in the least expensive manner. In many cases parents would be prepared to bring the children themselves without any expense to either the School or the Department.\n\nThe extra money involved in providing air transportation could be used to much better advantage at practically any Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThe enclosed letter has recently been received from Reverend Father Comeau of McIntosh Indian Residential School applying for a grant of $300.00 to cover airplane fares for children coming in to school from the Northern points. These are for the most part orphans and neglected children and it is recommended that a grant of $300.00 be provided.\n\nSwartzen,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Phalan's letter of September 20th, 1946, File 130-7-10 (W.T. 1) with respect to our recommendation for a grant to cover air transportation charges for pupils coming in to McIntosh Indian Residential School from the remote northern points.\n\nDuring the summer months in the north I endeavoured to recruit certain children for both our Residential Schools, as instructed. Parents and guardians would promise on the spot to send or bring the children out early in September, but it often seemed they change their minds. Some children have arrived at the Schools concerned, but no previous arrangements had been made. In tracing back we find they decided among themselves to send others instead of the ones we had previously arranged for. This might partly explain why we are not in a very good position to be certain in advance, just how many children will come out to School.\n\nWe have had a few come out from Port Hope and Lansdowne to the line by canoe. This is a very hard trip of nearly 100 miles with many portages. At this season of the year the parents feel that they are neglecting their own livelihood during the period required to bring the children out. It should be remembered too that in most places none of the parents are not anxious to send their children to Residential Schools and refuse to spend any time or energy in getting them out. Children from Ogoki are obliged to come out by plane due to the fact that the water route south is not navigable by canoe at this season.\n\nIn most cases, however, the children are brought out to school without any cost to the Department, either by white people interested in their well-being, or the parents paying the air fares themselves. It is just for children who should be at school and for whom no other means except air transportation is available or practical that the grant was applied for by Father Comeau and recommended by the undersigned.\n\nA glance at the geographical situation of the Sioux Lookout Agency will show that most of the pupils for the Residential Schools must come from the North. There are not sufficient children living off the Reserves along the main line of the C.N.R. to provide the necessary pupilage.\n\nI realize that the extra money required for air transportation would go far and be used to good advantage at any Residential School, but there is no object in having these Schools unless they are kept reasonably well filled.\n\n---------- over.\nIndian Affairs Branch - Cont'd.\n\nTherefore in view of the foregoing, it is recommended that the grant of $300.00 for the McIntosh School be provided and we will do our utmost to see that it is spent only on those pupils who have no other means of transportation and who otherwise would be denied the opportunity of attending School, which has always been our endeavour.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 26 September 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the transportation of children to the McIntosh School.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, we will allow an amount of $300.00 for transportation of children to the McIntosh School during the past summer.\n\nIt should be very distinctly understood by the Principal that the amount allowed this year is not to form a precedent. In future years we will not allow transportation expenses of this nature unless we are consulted before the expenditure is incurred and our approval is given.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| No. | Name                  | State of Education | Periods in the School | Remarks |\n|-----|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------|\n|     |                       |                    |                       |         |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n| No. | Name                  | State of Education | Periods in the School | Remarks |\n|-----|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------|\n|     |                       |                    |                       |         |\n\n**NOTES:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

With Garson Dam at elevation 930, a minimum head of 14 feet would be available, which, with the estimated storage of 14,000,000 cubic feet, would deliver 20,000 c.f.p.s. It has been estimated that three feet of storage on Rupert Lake would be sufficient to provide a regulated outflow of 25 c.f.p.s. during the winter, an average of 75 c.f.p.s., and continuous head of 14 feet would develop.\n\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA.\n\nMay 29th 1926.\n\nBy G. H. ASTWOOD,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nFurther storage is utilized or not to increase storage to raise the level of the lake five feet to elevation 1185 to secure a sufficient depth of water over the fall.\nSources of data:\n\nIn accordance with your letter of instructions, dated May 1st, Messrs. B. B. Hogarth and J. R. Mooney made a reconnaissance survey of this site on May 9th and 10th and obtained a metering of the stream on May 9th. Following this survey a plan of the site has been prepared, showing the immediate contours, together with a profile of the stretch of river considered and a cross-section on the line of the present dam.\n\nA brief description of the site and an estimate of the power available are given below. No other data concerning the watershed are available.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe natural fall in the river, at the site, is 18 feet in a distance of 350 feet, being caused by a flat, shallow rapid over a bed of granite. There is at present an old lumbering dam at the head of the fall which might be repaired and enlarged to provide additional head and storage capacity by raising the level of Forest Lake to elevation 112.0. With Canyon Lake at elevation 95.5 a maximum head of 16.5 feet would be available, which, with the estimated minimum flow of 14 c.f.s., would develop 20 h.p. It has been estimated that three feet of storage on Forest Lake would be sufficient to provide a regulated outflow of 25 c.f.s. during the winter. An outflow of 25 c.f.s. and a minimum head of 14 feet would develop about 32 h.p. continuously throughout the winter.\n\nWhether storage is utilized or not it appears advisable to raise the level of the lake five feet to elevation 112.0 to insure a sufficient depth of water over the intake.\notherwise rock excavation may be necessary to insure a seal at\nthe intake structure. Raising Forest lake to elevation 112.0\nwill cause very little flooding around the shores of the lake.\n\nGeneral Introductory.\n\nThe Canyon river is a southerly tributary of the\nWabigoon river and joins the latter a short distance below Clay\nLake, about seven miles west of the north-west corner of Edgars\nTownship, District of Kenora, Ontario. The main river connects\nCanyon lake with the Wabigoon river, but the part under con-\nsideration is the short stretch connecting Forest lake with\nCanyon lake. This stretch is about two miles west of the\nwestern boundary of Snellie Township and about two miles by\nwater on Canyon lake south-west of McIntosh Station on the C. N.\nRailway.\n\nRAFEL SURVEY.\n\nGeneral Description of Drainage Area.\n\nThe basin of the Canyon river above the site has\nan area of 108 square miles, and consists of rocky Laurentian\ncountry covered by a thick growth of spruce, poplar, balsam\npine and birch. There are numerous lakes scattered through\nthe basin and occupying about one-sixth of its total area.\n\nRun-off Records.\n\nPrevious to the date of the survey, no measure-\nments of the flow of the stream had been secured, but on May 9th\na metering was taken at a section above the fall and gave a\nflow of 51 c.f.s. The minimum flow of the river and the mean\nannual flow have been based on estimated run-offs of 0.185 and\n0.40 c.f.s. per square mile of drainage-area. The maximum flow\nhas been estimated from the high-water marks considered in\nrelation to the water levels at the time of the metering on\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6331, file 472-16, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 9th. These flows are tabulated below:\n\nEstimated minimum flow ........... 14 c.f.s.\nEstimated maximum flow .......... 500 c.f.s.\nEstimated mean annual flow ...... 43 c.f.s.\n\nFlow on May 9th, 1924 .......... 51 c.f.s.\n\nStorage\u2014Lake to Lique. From the notes of the survey, the accompanying Forest Lake, immediately above the site, has an area of 1.1 square miles and it has been estimated that raising the lake level three feet will be sufficient for complete regulation of the inflow. This would provide a reservoir with a capacity of 2112 acre-feet, which it is estimated will regulate the minimum outflow to 25 c.f.s.\n\nIn addition to raising the lake level three feet for storage purposes it also appears advisable to raise it an additional two feet higher to provide a higher head and a sufficient depth of water at the intake to the penstock, particularly during the winter months. If this additional depth of water is not secured by raising the lake level, excavation would be necessary to insure a seal at the intake structure.\n\nFrom the information obtained it appears that the shores of the lake are sufficiently high to prevent flooding at elevation 118.0, (present elevation 107.2), excepting possibly at a few points where small areas extending back about 200 feet from the present shore line might be submerged. Highwater marks were noted at elevation 109.5.\n\nIce Conditions.\n\nAn ice-sheet forms on all the lakes in this region during the winter, but gradually melts in place during the warm weather of spring. At the time of the survey Forest Lake was practically clear of ice, but Canyon Lake was nearly wholly covered, except along the immediate shores. The ice was, however, very much honeycombed and melting rapidly.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nDetailed Work at the Site.\n\nThe work at the site consisted of a reconnaissance survey of the stretch of river between Forest and Canyon lakes, an examination of the banks of Forest lake with a view to determining the effect of raising its water-level, a cross-section of the river and banks on the line of the dam, and a profile of the river from lake to lake. From the notes of the survey, the accompanying plan has been prepared, showing the contours of the bed and banks at five-foot intervals, the nature of the surface materials, and the water-levels and highwater marks. The cross-section on the dam-line, the profile of the river, and a key-plan showing the location of the site are included. Photographs of the site are appended hereto.\n\nThe site is accessible from McIntosh station on the C. N. Railway by a water-route of two miles in the summer, or by travel over the ice by team in the winter. There are no summer roads, and the small amount of power available would not warrant any expenditure for their construction in a country of such a character.\n\nAs shown on the plan and profile, the natural fall of the river at the time of the inspection was 12 feet in a distance of about 350 feet. This fall takes place in a fairly uniform rapid over a bed of smooth granite. At the head of the fall is an old lumbering-dam, with a six-foot sluice in the centre, used to direct the main body of the stream into the log-chute, which extends down the right channel. The proposed scheme of development would include the lengthening and raising of the dam to a sufficient height to raise the water-level of Forest lake to elevation 112.0, (i.e., three feet above highwater mark), provision for a sluice gate to control the flow, the installation of a pipe line from the dam along the right bank to the foot of the fall, and the construction of a powerhouse.\nin Canyon Lake some 40 or 50 feet from the foot of the right bank. This would provide a maximum head of 17 feet, and a minimum head, as the storage is depleted, of 14 feet.\n\nPossible Power:\n\nUnder the maximum regulated head of 17 feet and the estimated low-water flow of 14 c.f.s., the power available at the site is 32 h.p. By the use of the storage, however, it is estimated that the minimum flow may be increased to 25 c.f.s., although the head will be decreased as the storage is used until it is 14 feet. Under these conditions the estimated minimum power available is 32 h.p.\n\nUse of Power:\n\nThe amount of power available is sufficient only for small local uses such as lighting, pumping for water supply, sawing wood, etc. There is at present no market at the site, but it is proposed to establish there a small Indian mission-school, for the purpose of which the power could be very advantageously employed.\n\n[Signature]\nH.

B. GOW.\nThe Gannon River Power Site is located on the north shore of the river, surrounded by forest and canyon lands. The main Gannon river flows into the outlet channel of Gannon Lake into the Red River. The power site is about two miles in a direct line from McIntosh, a station on the Canadian National Railway, 150 miles south of Winnipeg. Owing to logging timber and making the site Robert and Gannon Lakes is practically inaccessible by overland routes during the open water season. DISTRICT OF KEIBA, readily accessible by a two and one-half mile water route.\n\nRURAL RESERVATION\n\nThe stretch of river carrying the overflow of Robert Lake into Gannon Lake is about 320 feet in length and divides part of inland at the lower end. The channel is from 70 to 100 feet in width, shallow and boulder strewn and there is a descent of about 25 feet between WINNIPEG, MANITOBA. BY D. B. GOV. October 3rd, 1934.\n\nDuring earlier years lumbering operations were carried on above Gannon Lake and a timber and rock dam was built across the outlet of Robert Lake to raise the lake level. From an opening in the dam a log chute extended to Gannon Lake. However, no lumbering operations have been carried on for years on these lakes and the dam and log chute are now unnecessary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nDuring the past summer the land on either side of the stream has been cleared and an Indian school is now in course of erection upon the left bank. The general topographical features of the site are shown on\n\n**LOCATION AND ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nThe Canyon River Power Site is located on the short stretch of the river separating Forest and Canyon lakes. The main Canyon river forms the outflow channel of Canyon Lake into the Wabigoon river. The power site is about one mile in a direct line from McIntosh, a station on the Canadian National Railway, 169 miles east of Winnipeg. Owing to fallen timber and muskeg the site is practically inaccessible by overland route during the open water period, but it is readily accessible by a two and one-half mile water route.\n\n**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**\n\nThe stretch of river carrying the overflow of Forest Lake into Canyon Lake is about 350 feet in length and divides past an island at the lower end. The channel is from 70 to 100 feet in width, shallow and boulder stream and there is a descent of about 18 feet between the two lakes.\n\nDuring earlier years lumbering operations were carried on above Canyon Lake and a timber and rock dam was built across the outlet of Forest Lake to raise the lake level. From an opening in the dam a log chute extended to Canyon Lake. However, no lumbering operations have been carried on for years on these lakes and the dam and log chute are now unserviceable.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nDuring the past summer the land on either side of the stream has been cleared and an Indian School is now in course of erection upon the left bank. The general topographical features of the site are shown on an accompanying plan.\n\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nGeneral Description of Drainage Area.\n\nAs the greater part of the area draining into Canyon Lake lies in unsurveyed area it is impossible to accurately estimate the extent of the drainage basin above this power site. From existing maps the area has been calculated to be about 108 square miles and is of a rocky Laurentian formation, covered by a thick growth of spruce, poplar, birch and balsam pine. There are numerous lakes throughout the basin which ultimately drain into Canyon Lake.\n\nRun-off Records.\n\nPrevious to 1934 no measurements of the flow of this stream have been obtained. On May 9th the flow was found to be 51 c.f.s., while on September 9th it was 26 c.f.s. The summer and fall of the present year has been a period of very low water conditions throughout the district. The run-off data so far obtained are too meagre to permit of accurate flow estimates being determined from them, but estimates have been prepared, based upon flow conditions in adjacent drainage areas for which data are available, and these are tabulated as follows:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nThere are several lakes above the power site, to which several different names have been applied, but the larger ones comprise Forest, Boulder, Corner and Sandy Lakes. These are all joined by narrow or short sluggish streams so that the group have practically the same water level as Forest Lake, and appear to cover an area in excess of 10 square miles, although this area is indefinite, no surveys having been made. A reservoir of 10 square miles immediately above the power site affords unusual opportunity for storage regulation.\n\nIn the proposed development of this power site it is intended to raise the water level above the dam from a present assumed elevation of about 106.5 to an elevation of 112.0. One foot of storage on these lakes would be equivalent to a continuous flow of about 9 c.f.s. for one year, or 18 c.f.s. over a period of six months. Since the proposed scheme of development only necessitates a flow of 25 c.f.s., it is quite probable that one foot of storage will ensure a continuous flow of 25 c.f.s. at all times.\n\nMETHOD OF DEVELOPMENT:\n\nThe proposed scheme for the development of this power site is shown on accompanying plans. Briefly stated, it provides for a concrete dam at the outlet of Forest Lake.\nwith a penstock 385 feet long leading to the powerhouse situated on the small island at the lower end of the channel. The forebay level will be elevation 112.0 and the normal tailwater elevation about 95.6, giving a maximum head of 17 feet. If storage is drawn upon heavily the forebay elevation may drop to 111.0, and taking into account loss of head in the pipe line of one foot, the minimum head expected will be 16 feet. Hence the power available with a flow of 25 c.f.s., under 16 foot head at 80% efficiency will be 35 h.p.\n\n**Dam**\n\nThe dam, as proposed, will rest on rock, be of concrete construction, and will contain, spillway section, and non-overflow section, the latter containing an opening for a log chute and also a sluiceway for discharging flood waters. The dam will have a maximum height of seven and one half feet and a length of 330 feet, and is designed to withstand flood conditions. A 30-foot spillway section connects the right bank and has a crest elevation of 112.0. The non-overflow section will be constructed to elevation 115.0; the sluiceway will be eight feet wide with sill elevation of 108.0; and the log chute opening will be five feet wide, with sill elevation of 109.0. Stop logs will be provided for these two openings.\n\n**Intake Works**\n\nThe intake works will consist of a suitable intake structure located downstream from the dam. The intake will be constructed of reinforced concrete and will extend through to the upstream face of the dam, and the base will be at elevation 105.0. As the inside diameter of the penstock is to be...\n56 inch the intake works are designed accordingly. Two six inch steel channels set upright and four feet apart and extending three inches out from the face of the dam, serve as a guideway for the gate, which will be raised and lowered by means of a suitable hand worked hoist. Rails are provided to cover the intake end are supported by concrete piers extending out from the face of the dam. The details are shown on accompanying plans.\n\nPenstock.\n\nA penstock line, 325 feet in length extends from the upstream face of the dam to the powerhouse and passes down the shallow river channel to the island upon which the powerhouse will be located. The penstock will be supported on timbers and at the lower end on trestles, and will be 36 inches inside diameter and constructed of continuous wood stave pipe of standard construction.\n\nPower House.\n\nThe site chosen for the powerhouse is on the lower end of the island in the lower end of the channel. The building as planned will be 18 feet by 30 feet, provision being made for a workshop above the generator room. The turbine will be set in an open wheel pit, this pit having inside dimensions four feet by six feet and raised to elevation 112.0, being covered and a manhole provided for inspection purposes. The walls of the wheel pit are to be 18 inches thick, constructed of reinforced concrete and the wheel pit will be wholly within the powerhouse. The floor will be of reinforced concrete, but the building will be of frame construction.\nTailrace.\n\nThe tailrace will be discharged into Canyon lake, the bottom of the tailrace being at elevation 90.4. Considerable rock excavation will be necessary to provide a satisfactory tailrace.\n\nIt is also desired to place a few lights around the installation.\n\nIt is proposed to install one complete unit consisting of a 30 h.p. horizontal turbine of improved type and set in an open wheel pit, and one 17\u00bd k.w. D.C. generator which will be belt driven from a pulley on the turbine shaft. For speed regulation a suitable sized compensating governor will be installed.\n\nIt is proposed to generate at 115 volts and a single panel direct current switch board will be installed.\n\nPOWER AVAILABLE.\n\nThe power available has been estimated at 25 h.p., under minimum head conditions and as the installation is for 17\u00bd k.w. only, a power shortage is very improbable.\n\nMARKET FOR POWER.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs of the Interior Department are erecting a school along the left bank of this stream and as the site is rather isolated it is planned to use hydro power from this power site to supply lighting for the school, also power for the operation of a water system and laundry and a work shop. The water system is not only for domestic purposes but also for fire protection. It is considered that 15 k.w. will meet the power demands of this school, and the power site will provide a dependable source of power.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nThe school building is being wired for electric lighting and power, and is about 300 feet from the power house site, so a short pole line only will be required. It is also desired to place a few lights around the grounds and the power house building will be heated by electric heaters.\n\nESTIMATES.\n\nThe estimates given herein are based on what is considered a fair contract price and include freight charges and contractors' profit. No engineering charges are included as it is presumed that the engineering and supervision will be in charge of Departmental engineers.\n\nIt will be noticed that the cost of this development is high in view of the power required. It might be pointed out that in the advent of the Catholic Mission making an agreement to provide free labor (rough) the construction costs could possibly be reduced to the Department of Indian Affairs by approximately 25%. This saving would occur principally in concrete construction and free hauling of materials and equipment from McIntosh to the site.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nREMARKS\n\nIf it is decided not to develop the Garryon river power site as a source of electrical energy for the McIntosh Indian School, it will be necessary to install a 25 h.p. oil fuel engine to provide for domestic water supply and fire protection requirements. In this advent it would be found advisable to install separately, a small generating set for supplying electric lighting throughout the building.\n\nSeveral manufacturing firms are now turning out quite simple, compact and fairly efficient small generating sets and it is considered that one of these will meet the present requirements of the Indian School for lighting purposes.\n\nA typical outfit consists of the following:\n\nOne 3 h.p. Engine - Kerosene or Gasoline fuel with high tension oscillating Magneto.\n\nOne Ball bearing Dynamo, 900 Watt - 30 to 42 volts, Multi-polar & Shunt wound.\n\nSealed glass jar storage battery (120 amperes hours) - 16 cells with hydrometre syringe.\n\nOne type F. S. Switchboard.\n\nThis outfit will, with the battery fully charged and engine running, keep 45 25-watt lights running for five hours; the battery alone, if fully charged, will keep 35 25-watt lights going for five hours, and with the engine running and battery floating 35 25-watt lights can be kept going as long as you like.\n\nThe price of the outfit is approximately $640.00\n\nP.O.B.

B. Gow.\nREPORT ON WATER SUPPLY INSTALLATION FOR MACINTOSH INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nI - INTRODUCTION.\n\nAt the present time the Department of Indian Affairs is engaged in building about 15 miles of road from Macintosh to the Canadian National Railway line east of Winnipeg. The purpose of this report is to provide information regarding the installation of water supply equipment at Macintosh Indian School.\n\nII - GENERAL.\n\nThe present structure is designed to accommodate about sixty individuals, but a survey of the needs of the district in which the school is located shows that in the near future extensions may be necessary to accommodate a total of about 100 pupils. Accordingly, a water supply system to accommodate 100 pupils is now provided.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nNovember 5th, 1924.\n\nBY D. B. GOW.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nREPORT ON WATER SUPPLY INSTALLATION FOR MCINTOSH INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nI - INTRODUCTORY.\n\nAt the present time the Department of Indian Affairs is constructing a school building about 14 miles from McIntosh, a station on the Canadian National Railway 169 miles east of Winnipeg. The contract for the construction work includes all plumbing fixtures and a complete cold water supply to all plumbing fixtures, to heating boilers and stand pipes, and the installation of a complete system of stand pipe and hose for fire protection, but the contract does not include the pumping equipment or intake pipe and fixtures necessary to ensure a satisfactory water supply. This report is intended to outline in considerable detail a water supply system with estimate of the cost of same, for domestic use and for adequate fire protection for the school.\n\nII - GENERAL.\n\nThe present structure is designed to accommodate about sixty individuals, but a survey of the needs of the district in which the school is located shows that in the near future extensions may be necessary to accommodate a total of about 100 pupils. Accordingly, a water supply system to accommodate 100 pupils is now proposed. It is desired that the water supply system should serve the two purposes, domestic water supply and fire protection, to provide sufficient water for a fairly satisfactory domestic...\nwater service will be comparatively simple and inexpensive, but to provide sufficient water for adequate fire protection for the building will require a high pressure system and the expense will be considerable.\n\nTo provide for domestic water supply it is considered that a supply of 30 gallons per minute should meet requirements. The pneumatic pressure tank will provide storage capacity of 850 gallons.\n\nThe specifications for the construction of the school call for ten hose connections to standpipes, two on each floor. In the case of any ordinary outbreak of fire not more than four of these would be in use, accordingly for fire protection it is considered necessary to provide sufficient water to feed four lines of hose under pressure of 60 pounds per square inch. It is considered that a water supply of 250 Imperial gallons per minute under pressure of 60 pounds per square inch pressure will give adequate fire protection for ordinary fire outbreaks. In case of forest fire the building would in all probability be doomed.\n\nFor convenient operation it has been decided to place the pumping apparatus either within the school building or in an addition immediately adjoining that portion of the basement containing the laundry. It has also been decided to pump the water from Forest lake, a pipe line approximately 450 feet long being necessary. To provide for fire protection and to overcome pipe resistance, a 5\" wrought iron pipe is necessary and the pipe must be laid sufficiently deep to be sufficiently protected to prevent frost penetration.\n\nThe source of power for the operation of the pumping system has, as yet, been undecided. If the Canyon\nriver power site, located some 400 feet from the school, is developed to provide electrical energy for the school requirements. The installation of the water system and especially the operation of the system is a simple and comparatively inexpensive proposition. If this power site is not developed it will be necessary to install fuel engines for a source of power for operating the pumps and the installation becomes more elaborate, more expensive, and operation costs will be much greater. Accordingly, in this report it has been necessary to consider the question of the water supply for the school on the basis of\n\n(a) - Hydro power available,\n(b) - Hydro power not available.\n\nPlans for the development and estimates of the cost of the development of the power site have been dealt with in a separate report. It was pointed out in the report that it was considered quite possible to develop sufficient power to meet all present requirements of the school, but that the cost of the development was expensive considering the amount of power required.\n\nA - HYDRO POWER AVAILABLE.\n\n1 - INTAKE.\nAn accompanying plan shows the proposed location of the intake, also the location of the pipe line and the location of the school. The intake would be immediately above the dam at the outlet of Forest Lake. The 5\" pipe should pass through the dam at about elevation 107 and extend upstream only sufficiently far to permit of the attachment of a strainer and gate valve.\n\n2 - PIPE LINE.\nApproximately 375 feet of 5\" wrought iron pipe would be required for the pipe line to connect with the pump.\nThe pipe should be embedded at least three feet underground and be further protected above ground to prevent frost penetration.\n\n3 - PUMP HOUSE.\n\nProvision can be made to accommodate all equipment necessary in the laundry room and boiler room of the school building, thus doing away with any expense for any addition to the present structures.\n\n4 - DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE PROTECTION.\n\nIt is proposed to install a 15 H.P. motor which will drive a single stage double acting centrifugal pump mounted on the same cast iron base with the D.C. motor. The pump will have an air compressor attachment and will be direct connected to the standpipe piping and fitted with the necessary check valves. Pipe reducing down to 2\" will lead from the main pipe to a 4' x 16' pneumatic pressure tank from which the water supply of the building for domestic purposes is forced under pressure of a minimum of 25 pounds per square inch. This pressure tank will be fitted with the necessary gauges, etc., and will have a working capacity of 833 Imperial gallons with a working pressure of 50 pounds per square inch. The domestic water supply system will be equipped with a suitable Cutler Hammer diaphragm pressure regulator for automatic control. In case of fire the pump feeds the hose direct at pressure required.\n\n5 - Hydro Power Not Available.\n\n1 - INTAKE.\n\nThe accompanying plan shows the location of the intake, the pipe line and the addition to the school building.\nrequired as a pump house, in case no hydro-electric energy is available. The intake is at the outlet of Forest lake, but must extend out to ensure a seal over the intake. The outlet of the lake does not freeze over under existing conditions and little trouble need be anticipated with the intake.\n\n2 - PIPE LINE.\n\nApproximately 465 feet of 3\" wrought iron pipe will be required. The pipe must be laid at least three feet underground, where possible, and protected otherwise to prevent frost penetration; particular care being taken in the vicinity of the lake shore, where rock prevents excavation.\n\n3 - PUMP HOUSE.\n\nThe equipment necessary for the water supply may be housed in the school building, owing to lack of space and the excessive noise of the exhausts. It is proposed to house this equipment in an addition 16' x 31', as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\n4 - DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY.\n\nTo pump 30 gallons per minute it is proposed to install a 3 H.P. gasoline, distillate or kerosene burning engine, which would be bolt connected to a double acting power pump with a capacity of 30 gallons per minute and with an air compressor attachment. The pump will be connected by piping with a 4' x 16' pneumatic pressure tank, fitted with gauge, etc., and with a working capacity of 833 gallons with working pressure of 80 pounds per square inch. The domestic water service will be fed from the pressure tank.\n\n5 - FIRE PROTECTION.\n\nFor fire protection it is proposed to install a 25 H.P. oil engine, which will be bolted to a single stage.\ndouble acting centrifugal pump having a capacity of 250 Imperial gallons per minute against a total head of 120 feet. The pump will be connected to the feed pipe and also to the piping leading to the standpipes. This pump could be connected up with feed pipe from the standpipe piping to the pressure tank and thus utilized for domestic service in the event of a breakdown of the domestic service pumping equipment.\n\n6 - LAUNDRY ROOM SERVICE\n\nPower will be required for the operation of the machinery of the laundry room. A central shaft connecting the different laundry mechanisms could be operated by a belt connected to the 3 H.P. engine running the domestic water supply pump. However, if a small 3 H.P. engine is installed to operate a generator to supply electric lighting it should be located so as to also operate the laundry machinery.\n\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nNovember 5th, 1924.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was also desired that the system should give continuous service with a minimum of attention. Though\nthe type of soil is not naturally favorable for the sub-\nirrigation method of treatment, being mainly a non-porous\nclay, thus method is practically the only one that will\ngive the desired conditions.\n\nThough the school is designed for only sixty\npupils it was considered advisable, in view of possible\nfurther extensions, to provide a system capable of taking\ncare of 100 inmates.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION.\n\nAs shown on the general layout Plan No. 1 it is\nproposed to discharge the laundry waste directly into the\nlake through a six-inch tile drain. In addition to re-\nducing the amount of sewage to be treated it ensures that\nno chemicals, etc., used in washing enters the treatment\nworks, and is neutralized. To secure protection from frost\na tank is provided. The sewage from the toilets, baths, etc., is\ncarried by a six-inch tile (designated Sanitary on the plan)\nto the septic tank with the dosing or syphon chamber\nattached. From the syphon chamber the liquid is automatic-\nally discharged by two three-inch \"Anther\" syphons to\nthe disposal bed. The effluent enters the lake\nthrough a six-inch cast-iron soil pipe laid by means of a\n\nLAUNDRY WASTE.\n\nAs already stated the waste from the laundry is\nnot treated but is discharged directly into the lake. A\nsix-inch cast-iron soil pipe carries the waste from the\nbuilding to the double manhole \"A\". See details of\nManholes Plan No. 3, and from this manhole a six-inch\ntile is laid for about fifty feet in the same trench as\nthe sanitary drain and then carried direct to the double manhole \"A\" which, as shown on Plan No. 3, has two separate chambers at different elevations, the lower receiving the laundry waste, and the upper the affluent from the septic tank. From this manhole the laundry waste is carried through a six-inch tile pipe laid through the centre of the disposal bed to manhole \"C\" and thence through a six-inch tile to Canyon Lake.\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND SYPHON CHAMBER.\n\nThe sewage, other than the laundry waste, leaves the building through a six-inch cast-iron soil-pipe to the double manhole \"A\", thence through a six-inch tile to the septic tank. As shown on Plan No. 2 the septic tank and syphon chamber are combined and are to be constructed of a 1, 2 and 3 concrete mix. To secure protection from frost a double plank roof with a six-inch air space is provided. The septic tank itself is seven feet wide, seventeen feet long and six feet deep at the centre. To facilitate the removal of sludge the bottom of the tank slopes towards the inlet end, and a manhole is placed in the roof at this point. The affluent enters the tank through a six-inch cast-iron soil-pipe and by means of a tee and a short length of pipe is carried one foot below the sewage line, thus avoiding any disturbance to the surface scum.\n\nFrom the septic tank the sewage flows over the dividing wall to the syphon chamber; two baffle boards carried one foot below the standing level of the liquid preventing any undue disturbance.\nFrom the siphon chamber the sewage is discharged through two three-inch \"Artho\" automatic siphons designed to discharge under an eighteen-inch head. As the siphon chamber is seven feet square it will carry about 450 imperial gallons before discharging to the disposal beds. With one hundred inmates this will be from one-third to one-half the daily amount of sewage to be taken care of and will therefore allow ample resting periods for the disposal beds.\n\nDISPOSAL BED.\n\nAs already stated this method was decided upon as it would give (1), Continuous service with minimum attention, and (2), Absence of any works above ground and freedom from objectionable odors.\n\nThough the nature of the soil, which is mainly a non-porous clay, is not favorable for this method of treatment, this can be overcome by excavating to the desired depth and laying the four-inch field tile on a fifteen-inch bed of gravel.\n\nAs shown on Plans Nos. 1, 4 and 5 the bed is 120 feet wide by 100 feet long. The affluent from the siphon chamber is discharged through a six-inch tile to the double manhole \"B\" and from there flows through the two six-inch tile headers. From the headers it is distributed over the bed through thirty branches, each 100 feet long, of four-inch field tile, laid with open joints on the fifteen-inch bed of gravel.\n\nIt is necessary for the proper working of the disposal bed that the oxygen of the air be brought in contact with the sewage and any covering over the bed should be\nThe following gives the estimated cost of labor and materials necessary for the construction of the system. The three manholes called for provide sufficient access to the system so that in case of any blocking of the drains the trouble can be removed, or at least located, by means of rods.\n\nAs shown on Plan No. 1 the manholes are constructed of concrete, with the exception of the roof, which is made of two thicknesses of two inch planks. Each manhole is provided with a two-foot square cast-iron cover to allow of easy entrance.\n\nManholes \"A\" and \"B\" are double manholes having two chambers separated by a concrete dividing wall, the one chamber taking the laundry waste and the other the sanitary sewage.\n\nAn iron screen is provided for the sanitary sewage chamber at Manhole \"A\" to prevent any articles such as rags, boots, etc., reaching the septic tank.\n\nThe sanitary sewage chamber of Manhole \"B\" receives the affluent from the septic tank and from there it passes to the six-inch tile headers of the disposal bed. The laundry waste chamber is at a lower elevation, the six-inch tile drain entering it, passing under the sanitary chamber.\n\nThe sewage from the septic tank may, if desired, be allowed to flow into the lower chamber and thence into the six-inch laundry drain direct to the lake. By this arrangement any trouble in the disposal bed may be made sufficiently porous to allow the entrance of air. The design therefore calls for a covering of sand and clay twelve inches in depth with a six-inch top dressing of loam.\narrangement may repairs to the disposal bed may be made without interrupting the disposal of the sanitary sewage.\n\nESTIMATED COST\n\nThe following gives the estimated cost of labor and materials necessary for the construction of the system without the disposal bed, the estimate for the bed being given separately.\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND SYPHON CHAMBER.\n\n- 22 cu. yds. concrete @ $4.00.............. $88.00\n- 71 cu. yds. earth excavation @ $1.00........... 71.00\n- 1400 F.B.M.

The first estimate includes all labor and material required, while the second estimate assumes, as suggested by Mr. Orr, the supplying of the gravel and all necessary labor by the Oblate Order, and covers only the cost of the six-inch tile headers and underdrain and the four-inch field tile.\nEstimate I - Including all Labor and Materials.\n\n880 cu. yds. earth excavation @ 0.50........... 440.00\n270 \" gravel @ 3.00.................. 1710.00\n660 \" top covering @ 0.40............. 264.00 2414.00\n\nSupplying and Laying.\n\n3000 lineal feet 4\" field tile @ 0.15...... 450.00\n120 \" 6\" tile headers\nincluding 30 Tees @ 1.30............ 156.00\n120 lineal feet 6\" tile underdrain @ 0.70............. 84.00 690.00\n\n$3104.00\n\nEstimate II - Excluding all Labor and the supply of Gravel.\n\n3000 lineal feet 4\" field tile.............. 240.00\n120 \" 6\" tile headers\nincluding 30 Tees...... 84.00\n120 \" 6\" tile underdrain...... 60.00 384.00\n\n$384.00\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS RE OPERATION.\n\nThough the proposed sewage disposal plant requires less attention than any other standard method of treatment there are certain duties that are necessary to ensure successful and continuous operation. These duties are increased when the system has to operate under extreme winter conditions such as prevail in the vicinity of McIntosh, Ontario. To ensure satisfactory service the following suggestions are made:\n\n(1) - If the system is started up during cold weather it is advisable to have as much hot water as possible enter the septic tank, thus aiding the bacterial action.\n\n(2) - As eighteen inches of earth over the disposal bed is about the maximum depth allowable in order that sufficient air will reach the sewage, it is advisable, especially during the first winter's operation, to cover the entire bed with manure or straw. No doubt more\nsuccessful operation would be secured if this were done every winter.\n\n(3) - As shown on Plan No. 2, an overflow pipe is provided from the siphon chamber. The purpose of this pipe is twofold, as in addition to taking care of the sewage in case the siphone stopped working, it provides an outlet for the air from the disposal bed, as it is receiving its charge of sewage from the siphon chamber. To ensure a free outlet for this air it is essential that no trap be placed in the sanitary drain between the ventilating stack in the building and the septic tank.\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOctober 25th, 1924.\n\nJohn Craig\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nA report and plans of the proposed Hydro Electric power for the MacIntosh Indian Residential School, in the District of Kenora, Ont., have just been received from the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nThe project as submitted comprises, first - the clearing of the site and the building of a concrete dam at an estimated cost of $2,552. Second - the intake works, penstock, which consists of 36\" wood stove pipe, and powerhouse estimated cost of which is $3,617.00. Third - the turbine generator and other accessories to be installed in the powerhouse which are estimated at $3,505.00 making a total cost of $9,674.00.\n\nAfter going over this report, I would recommend that only the dam be proceeded with this fall, and that I be given an opportunity to examine the question of the powerhouse, which appears to be too elaborate for the requirements of this institution.\n\nIn order to reduce the cost of the dam, which has been specified to be built of concrete, I would suggest that only the centre part of it be built of concrete, on a width of about 40 feet, and that the balance be constructed of stone masonry, as stone is available in large quantities on the site of the work.\n\nThe work should be proceeded with at once if a reliable water supply, fire protection and lighting system are to be available for this building next year. The contractors for the building are willing to undertake the\nOttawa, Nov. 14, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Canyon River power site between Forest and Canyon Lakes, in the District of Kenora, which construction will be used in connection with the furnishing of electric current to the proposed MacIntosh School.\n\nAs already mentioned to you by the Departmental Engineer it is the intention of the Department to have only the dam proceeded with this year, in accordance with the plans already submitted. In view of the fact that there is a large quantity of stone available on the site of the work it is desired that this dam be constructed of either masonry or timber with the exception of that portion containing the spill-way sluice and intake, which should be built of concrete as specified. It is also suggested that the non-overflow portion be raised one foot. A steel thimble should be installed through the dam in the penstock opening.\n\nThe work may be performed by day labour under the supervision of one of your engineers in the district, on the same terms and arrangements as were made for the building of the septic tank. I may add that the construction of the intake works, penstock, power house, etc., are now under consideration and you will be further advised later on as to the Department's intentions regarding this part of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. De McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nIn your letters of November 11th and 12th you state that the Indian Department now propose to install a large water tank on high ground above the school to provide a gravity system of water supply.\n\nThe proposal to install a large water tank on the hill is, I think, Mr. Orr's suggestion, based upon observations made by him during his inspection of the site. During my visit to the site last week I obtained the elevation of the top of this hill in relation to the school building. The top of the hill is at elevation 135.00 and the ground on the back of the school about 118.00. A level sight from the top of the hill to the school building shows that the elevation of the top of the hill would correspond to a point on the building about 5.7 feet below the eaves.\n\nI quite appreciate that the decision to install a large tank on the cliff rests entirely with the Department of Indian Affairs, but it seems to me that there are two factors which will have an important bearing on this decision. These are: 1. Whether or not the proposed tank is to provide for fire protection as well as for a domestic water supply. 2. The cost of the tank as compared with the cost of a pressure tank, particularly as 30 h.p. can be obtained from the water power development.\n\nFrom rough level notes on hand and scaling the height of the building from the plans the following are the approximate elevations of:\n\n1 - Basement floor of school - elevation 109.00\n2 - Ground elevation outside of building 112.00\n3 - Top of Roof - elevation 161.00\n4 - Top of Hill - elevation 135.00\n\nA tank for domestic water supply alone, with a four-inch stand pipe feeding into the water system in the basement, would, in order to give 30 pounds pressure on the taps on the second floor, have to be 40 feet high above the top of the hill. A tank, with a six-inch stand pipe and high enough to give a pressure of say 65 pounds, for fire protection, at the ground hydrants, would have to be 124 feet high above the top of the hill, or 95 feet above the roof.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWhen it is considered that temperatures ranging down to 40 below zero will be experienced at McIntosh you will appreciate that the cost of constructing these tanks and protecting them from freezing will amount to quite a large sum of money. In fact, Mr. Simmons has stated that to construct a tank as outlined above for domestic water supply only would cost in the neighborhood of $40,000 or $50,000. While that same classification would have to consist of a steel supporting structure and would likely cost between $10,000 and $15,000.\n\nIn view of the above and in view of the fact that 30 h.p. will be available from the power development at McIntosh it seems to me that this power should be utilized in some manner which can be economically connected to a 20 kilowatt motor, pumping direct to the hydrants in case of fire, or through a pressure storage tank for domestic water supply, will provide by far the most economical system of water supply and fire protection, even though a small auxiliary pump of sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of the domestic water supply were installed in addition to the automatic pump connected for both purposes. The pump suggested for this purpose would throw 250 gallons in either three or four streams clear over the buildings. Both systems, that is, the large storage tank suggested by Mr. Orr, and the pressure system suggested by me, have their advantages and disadvantages. I quite realize that the pressure system is more mechanical than the other but at the same time these systems are reliable and I know from experience that they do give practically automatic operation with very little trouble.\n\nIt would appear that the Department of Indian Affairs desire to have a larger quantity of storage water on hand than the arrangement suggested in Mr. Orr's report. If such is the case I would suggest that as an alternative layout to that suggested by Mr. Orr, that a pressure storage tank, with a capacity of 1,500 imperial gallons, be supplied. If this size of tank is required, and if it is thought advisable to have an auxiliary pump, I would advise that a separate pump house be built to contain the pumping apparatus and also the 1,500 gallon pressure tank. If there is no objection to pumping the water from the draft tube chamber of the power house, the power house floor could be enlarged or an addition to the power house built to contain the pumping apparatus and pressure tank, but in any case, this system, especially if fire protection is insisted upon, would I think cost about one-half that of the large storage tank.\n\nThe above is submitted for your consideration because 30 h.p. is available, and if you think it would be acceptable to the Indian Department I will have prepared an alternative layout for the water system, together with estimates providing for a separate pump house and a 1,500 gallon pressure tank, either with or without a small auxiliary pump for domestic water supply.\nIf the building is to be heated this winter some source of auxiliary water supply is necessary, either gasoline engine or hand pump, to supply feed water to the boilers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nSir,\n\nThe Department considers it advisable to immediately install a temporary water supply and electric lighting system at the new Indian Residential School at Moosonee, Ont. This temporary plant will consist of a gasoline engine to be used to operate jointly an electric generator and a small water pump, all of which will be installed in the boiler room. The supply pipe will be of 2\" wrought iron connected to Canyon Lake and to the 800 gallon hot water storage tank already installed in the boiler room. This system will also provide means of testing the electric lighting and plumbing system now in course of completion. It is therefore desired that you obtain competitive prices and purchase the following machinery:\n\n1 - 5HP. Verticell gas engine, with pulley of the dimensions required to operate a typhon pump or equal, having a capacity of 8000 imperial gallons per hour, equipped with air compressor, etc.\n\n1 - 3Kw., 115 volts, D.C., generator, complete with the accessories required to satisfactorily operate the electric lighting system just installed in this building.\n\n480 feet of 2 inch in diameter wrought iron pipe with reasonable quantity of fittings for the installation of this pipe on the ground, including a brass strainer and three two inch valves.\n\nThese articles should be shipped to the school as early as possible, and it is understood that Brother Gauthier will undertake the installation of this machinery, which it is considered will be of use to the institution after the permanent water supply and lighting system are installed in the course of next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn R. Dunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nRe McIntosh Indian Mission School.\n\nIn order to confirm our verbal instructions of November 9th to Mr. J.H. Simmons, contractor for the McIntosh Indian School, a letter was sent to Mr. Simmons stating that the Department of Indian Affairs authorized the construction of the McIntosh dam by him on the same terms as he was constructing the septic tank, that is, on a basis of proven cost plus 10%.\n\nThe contractor was at that time rushing the work on the school in order to get his contract completed as quickly as possible. In this work, however, the contractor was handicapped by lack of transportation of building materials from the station to the site and from the source of gravel supply, which was a pit well located on Canyon Lake about half a mile east of McIntosh Station and about a half miles from the school. The gravel was hauled from the pit to the school in a barge towed by a small motor boat. Even working day and night it was impossible for this mode of transportation to haul all the materials to the school before freeze-up, with the result that when freeze-up did occur there was not a supply of sand or gravel available to start construction on the dam or septic tank. Under these circumstances, therefore, the contractor was not in a position to start concrete work on the dam and septic tank when authorized to do so.\n\nSubsequently, a new supply of sand and gravel was secured adjacent to the site of the school and last Wednesday I received notice that the contractor was ready to proceed with the construction of the dam. On Thursday Mr. Gow left for McIntosh to supervise the continuation of the dam, but found upon examination of a portion of the river bed which had been unwatered that there were seams and shallow layers of rock through and under which water was flowing. The contractor removed the fissured rock on one side of the channel by blasting them out and solid rock and arrangements were made to remove all shattered rock in the stream bed along the dam line. On Saturday last weather conditions were so severe that work on the dam was stopped, and because of the severe weather and blizzards prevailing since, and also because the contractor was closing down on all work for the Christmas holidays, work on the dam has been stopped until January 2nd or 3rd.\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nThe construction problem is quite simple and under summer conditions would be quickly and easily handled. Under winter conditions, particularly with small masses of concrete, extra precautions have to be taken to prevent freezing of the concrete to secure proper set and bond. Likewise extra care will have to be taken in grading, compacting, and sealing the foundations prior to placing concrete or masonry. I am quite confident, however, that the dam when constructed will be entirely satisfactory, and in order to ensure a proper set and to safeguard against freezing I have shipped to Moiintosh two old Red River tents which can be kept over the work and the concrete kept warm by a couple of old camp stoves.\n\nThe seams and layers of rock revealed in the river bed were not anticipated, as the shore rock is all solid. An additional expense is therefore necessarily involved to secure a water tight seal for the dam. On the other hand, sand and gravel have been obtained closer to the site, which should to some extent reduce the cost of construction, but the saving here will hardly offset the additional expense necessary to secure proper foundations and the slower progress due to winter conditions. Under the circumstances, it is quite possible that the estimate for the dam and unwatering may be exceeded.\n\nIn reply to my wire of November 19th stating that inspection had not been provided for, you wired that Brother Gauthier had been asked to act as inspector on the construction of the septic tank and dam. Brother Gauthier received a wire from the Department of Indian Affairs asking him to give whatever assistance he could in supervising the work and checking the time. In reply Brother Gauthier wrote Mr. Orr stating that he would assist us providing he was paid full time and asked under whose authority he was to act. This matter was apparently unsettled on Dec. 9th, as you will note from the copy of letter attached, and so far as I know, is still unsettled. From the above you will realize that no check has been kept on either labor or materials in the excavation and construction of the septic tank and dam.\n\nIn order to keep a close check on all time and materials entering the dam and septic tank from this date I have instructed the contractor to cease work on the dam, with the exception of hauling the necessary sand, gravel and rock, until after the New Year, when an engineer from this office will reside on the job until it is finished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. C.H. ATTWOOD,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEnc.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nA detailed report with plans and estimates has been submitted by the Dominion Water Power Branch of Winnipeg, on the proposed hydro electric and water work system for the McIntosh Indian Residential School. This report contains a number of schemes all of which I have carefully examined, and discussed with Reverend Father Boyer, when he visited this office.\n\nThe first proposal provides for a water supply system and electric lighting plant operated with gas engine, without hydro electric power, and the second proposal provides for the operation of both systems with hydro electric power available on the school site.\n\nAs you are aware the Department has already decided to adopt the second proposal and the construction of the dam for the hydro electric power is now being carried out by the contractors for the building, under the supervision of an officer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, but only this part of the scheme is authorized at present and will be attended to this fiscal year. This part of the work was considered necessary in order to enable the rest to be proceeded with next spring. The project as submitted should be accepted but with modifications which will not reduce the cost of erection materially but will keep down the maintenance cost. The scheme in summary which I would recommend would consist of the following items:\n\nA power house 30' x 18' located 325' below the dam, a distance of 300' feet south of the school building, where the hydro electric machinery is to be installed in the basement together with pressure tank, motors and pumping outfit.\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Scott.\n\nA turbine of horizontal type, having a capacity of 30 H.P., to operate a 17 K.W. direct current generator. This generator will supply ample power to provide for an adequate fire protection, also the operating of the pumping units, lighting system, laundry, work shops, etc.\n\nThe water supply system will consist of 46\" x 16' pneumatic pressure tank, which will be supplied by a centrifugal pump with a capacity of 250 gallons per minute, operated by a 15 H.P. motor. The water intake is to be located in the turbine chamber in the power house. The pump to be equipped with a device so the hose or stand pipe can be fed directly from the pump at the pressure required in case of fire.\n\nTo save the cost of maintenance it is proposed to incorporate in the above mentioned scheme the small pumping unit lately authorized as a temporary water supply. I would not suggest the installation of several hydrants outside the building on account of the high cost of such work, and the great care required to keep them in good working order. As a practical means of protecting the building from bush fires, I would recommend the purchasing of a portable engine and pump of the type used by the fire rangers. This apparatus would require the installation of one hydrant only, on the north west side of the school building, which is the only place where a reliable source of water is not available for the feeding of the pump. The cost of the hydro electric power and the pumping plant with the exception of the dam would amount to approximately $7500. The cost of the water supply including connection to the building and hydrant would be $2,500.\n\nAs a means of reducing the cost of the above mentioned work, I would recommend that all the materials required be purchased direct by the Department by obtaining competitive prices, giving the various firms ample time to submit quotations. The work could be carried out advantageously by Brother Eugene Gauthier, who is experienced in this kind of work, and willing to take charge of it without remuneration other than his wages. An inspection of the work could be made from time to time if required by an officer from the Winnipeg office of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\nBy proceeding in the above mentioned manner it is quite probable that a number of changes could be made during the progress of the work which would help to keep the cost of erection as low as possible.\n\nI may add that the question of erecting an elevated wooden water tank on the cliff North of the school, has been duly considered. This tank is not necessary with the proposed auxiliary electric centrifugal pump, as before described, which can be directly connected to the stand pipes or hydrants by a few simple manipulations of switches and valves. The installation of the tank as a safer fire protection would require a frost proof construction erected on an enclosed tower, which would have to be kept heated continuously during the cold season. Furthermore, this proposal is not advisable for the reason that ample electric power will be available from the turbine which may as well be taken advantage of in this case, on account of the extremely low cost of operation.\n\nI would recommend that a few chemical fire extinguishers be placed on each floor of the building for emergency cases. Mine would be sufficient for the purpose, and these would cost in the neighborhood of $15.00 each.\n\nBrother Gauthier, as you know, has had charge of the supervision of the building, and is well acquainted with the requirements of this institution, and well qualified to look after the interests of the Department in the execution of the above mentioned project.\n\nThere is an item of $5,000 in the budget Estimate 1925-6. It is probable that more could be found of it is decided to proceed with his work.\n\nD\u00c9PARTEMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nA report accompanied by plans and estimates has been submitted by the Dominion Water Power Branch of Winnipeg for the development of a hydro electric power plant located on the site of the McIntosh School now in course of completion.

Previous to January a certain amount of work was done during November and December, 1924, comprising the following:\n\n1. All earth excavation.\n2. Cofferdams for unwatering the south side of the river from Station 2 + 90 to Station 3 + 25.\n3. Some rock excavation from Station 2 + 90 to 3 + 25.\n4. About 50 cu. yds. gravel hauled to the site.\n5. About five cords of wood hauled to the site.\n\nThe cost of labor for this work was $735.00\n\nOn January 7th the section from Station 2 + 84 to Station 3 + 24 was housed in by tents over a frame work of poles and four stoves and a small steam boiler set up for heating. Owing to the extreme cold, the work was carried on under difficulties and it was not until January 16th that the section from Station 2 + 88 to 3 + 22 was completed. As the greatest care was taken to protect the concrete from freezing no trouble is anticipated from this source. It is the intention to keep this section covered and heated until the 19th to ensure the proper setting of the concrete. Though the work from the standpoint of quality will no doubt be satisfactory the cost is considered excessive. The labor cost alone, which runs about $40.00 a day, will for this section of the dam 34 feet long,\namount to about $450.00.\n\nThe construction of small works of this nature during extreme winter conditions adds a high percentage to the cost. In this case the increased cost will probably be between 33 and 50 percent. Though some conditions might justify this additional cost, the necessity of completing the dam during this winter does not, in my opinion, warrant this increase. In addition to the increased labor costs, the construction of the non-overflow section will be further increased, if carried on during the winter, owing to the difficulty of securing boulders. A large number are available at the site, but with over a foot of snow on the ground it is almost impossible to locate them. Building the non-overflow section of ordinary concrete instead of masonry construction will mean a large increase in the amount of cement and gravel required.\n\nThe suggestion therefore is made that that section of the dam from Station 2 + 60 to Station 3 + 66 be completed now and the balance of the non-overflow be finished in the coming spring. By finishing the section stated above, all work requiring cofferdams will be completed and by constructing the non-overflow section to Station 2 + 60 no difficulty should be encountered in the spring from the increased run-off. This work might be either included in the power house contract or could be done by day labor.\n\nThe moving of the bunk-house off the line of the dam will be an awkward and rather expensive piece of work and if it is the intention to construct the balance of the non-overflow section by day labor it would be advisable to have it moved this winter by Mr. Simmons while he has his men and equipment at the site.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\"SCHRAMM\" Double-Cylinder Engine-Driven Triplex Pump\n\nROAD Contractors have for some time past demanded a high pressure, heavy duty pump that would deliver water through long pipe lines with an even flow. With this thought in mind we have developed the \"SCHRAMM\" Double-Cylinder Engine-Driven Triplex Pump. The Engine was designed to specially meet the requirements of this particular unit. It is a horizontal, two-cylinder, four-cycle, throttle-governed gasoline motor.\n\nThe two cylinder feature makes the unit a steady running power plant with a minimum of vibration due to the alternately exploding cylinders. It also helps insure a steady flow of water. Connection to the pump is made by means of broad-faced, machine-cut gears, well guarded, to prevent accident to the operator. The direct connected feature makes a most compact and neat equipment.\n\nThe engine base, cylinders and water hopper are cast integral, and are made of close-grained gray iron of the highest quality. The cylinders are machined and ground accurately to size.\nThe pistons are of close-grained gray iron accurately machined and ground to a perfect fit with the cylinder.\n\nThe connecting rods are of steel. They are nicely proportioned and well balanced. The piston end of the rods are fitted with a solid bronze bushing, which is securely forced into the rod and fitted to the piston pin. This bearing is lubricated from the top of the piston by means of an oil tube running down through the bearing.\n\nAnother big feature of the engine on this unit is the bearings. They are made of a high grade babbitt metal, accurately turned and scraped, and fitted into the base. On the \"SCHRAMM\" Engine, we do not follow the old method of pouring the babbitt metal into the rough casting of the frame. All of the babbitt bearing shells are interchangeable and in case of excessive wear can be replaced by an inexperienced man.\n\nAll bearings have proper grooves distributing the lubricant to all points. The bearings are exceptionally broad and the shaft is large in diameter. These parts are practically indestructible.\n\nThe enclosed crank-case is also an important feature of \"SCHRAMM\" units. It prevents dust and dirt from getting into the cylinder and bearings, and therefore, prevents excessive wear to these very important parts of the unit.\n\nThe pump is of the same type as used in our line of single-cylinder engine-driven tripex pumps, with the exception that the cylinders are brass lined. The pistons are also of brass. This prevents both cylinders and pistons from becoming corroded, due to water laying in the cylinders when the pump is not in use. This is a feature very seldom practiced by other manufacturers of road pumps. It is specially designed with extra large valves and water passages so as to obtain low water velocity.\n\nThe valves are easily accessible. The pistons are guided by separate cross heads and are outside-packed. All bearings on the connecting rod and crank are adjustable.\nStandard equipment of these outfits consist of the engine and pump mounted on steel channels, in order that it may be set alongside a stream or lake, for forcing water long distances, under high pressure, to any place where the road is being constructed.\n\nIt is also especially adaptable for irrigation work.\n\nWhere it is necessary to move the outfit about, we are equipped to furnish the machine with wheels having standard 30\"x33\u00bd\" automobile tires and demountable rims. In this case we can furnish the equipment with a handle for pulling about by hand, or with a draw-bar for attaching to a wagon, automobile or motor truck. This equipment is shown on the front page of this bulletin.\n\nThis particular unit is also especially well adapted for fire fighting service in rural communities. It is impossible for the smaller towns to equip themselves with a fire-fighting apparatus costing several thousand dollars, but with the \"SCHRAMM\" double-cylinder, engine-driven triplex pumping unit, an equipment can be had that will furnish adequate protection for only a few hundred dollars. This will make all smaller communities totally independent of the larger towns adjacent to them. For this purpose we recommend that the outfit be mounted on the rubber-tired wheels. In this case the draw-bar and handle is always furnished.\n\nWe also recommend that the outfit be equipped with the wire basket and supports as shown in the cut on page 2 for holding the suction hose and discharge hose. The outfit can then be attached to the back of any automobile, wagon or even to a motorcycle, should such a machine be available, and hauled to the fire.\n\nAny one of these equipments will have sufficient power to haul the \"SCHRAMM\" outfit at high speed over even the roughest country roads. If none of these are available then the outfit can be hauled by two men. The light weight, compact construction and even balance, coupled with the fact that the wheels are equipped with roller bearings, make it easy for two men to handle the outfit.\n\nThis outfit will give sufficient water for handling a one-half inch fire nozzle, when the fire is a considerable distance from the water supply. Should the water supply be close to the fire it will be found that the outfit will give sufficient water to play two streams on the fire under high pressure and quickly extinguish same. There is always a lake, creek or even a well into which the suction hose for the pump can be thrown without any trouble.\nComplete Specifications are given on this outfit in the following table:\n\n| Specification                          | Value       |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Engine H.P.                            | 5           |\n| Bore of Cylinder                       | Inches      |\n| Stroke of Piston                       | Inches      |\n| Number of Engine Cylinders             | 2           |\n| Engine Speed                           | R.P.M. 690  |\n| Bore of Pump-Cylinders                 | Inches      |\n| Stroke of Pump-Pistons                 | Inches      |\n| Number of Pump-Cylinders               | 3           |\n| Pump Speed                             | R.P.M. 195  |\n| Pump Suction                           | Inches      |\n| Pump Discharge                         | Inches      |\n| Pump Capacity                          | G.P.M. 80   |\n| Working Head                           | Feet        |\n| Weight, mounted on channels            | Pounds 100  |\n| Shipping weight, mounted on channels   | Pounds 935  |\n| Export weight, mounted on channels     | Pounds 1085 |\n| Size of Export Box                     | Pounds 1250 |\n| Code Word                              | Pedast      |\n| Weight, equipped with rubber-tired wheels and draw-bar or handle | Pounds 1275 |\n| Shipping weight, equipped with rubber-tired wheels and draw-bar or handle | Pounds 1425 |\n| Export weight, equipped with rubber-tired wheels and draw-bar or handle | Pounds 1675 |\n| Size of Export Box                     | 79\" x 52\" x 37\" |\n| Code Word                              | Pedastew    |\n| Weight, equipped with rubber-tired wheels, draw-bar or handle and wire basket and supports | Pounds 1360 |\n| Shipping weight, equipped with rubber-tired wheels, draw-bar or handle and wire basket and supports | Pounds 1560 |\n| Export weight, equipped with rubber-tired wheels, draw-bar or handle and wire basket and supports | Pounds 1825 |\n| Size of Export Box                     | 79\" x 52\" x 48\" |\n| Code Word                              | Pedastwh    |\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean,\n\nRe: Centrifugal Pump for McIntosh, Ont.\n\nWith further reference to your inquiry for a Centrifugal Pump and Electric Motor for McIntosh Indian Residential School, we are afraid that we shall be unable to submit a tender as the data contained in your inquiry and your letters of February 10th and 12th, is not quite clear to us. We have the impression that you require a pumping unit capable of delivering 250 Imperial GPM, against a pressure in the two pneumatic pressure tanks of 65 pounds per square inch, plus the friction in 500 feet of piping. No mention is made, however, of the size of the pipe. The inquiry also calls for an air pressure adjustment, from which, we take it that the pump is to be started by means of a pressure governor, that is to say when the pressure in the tanks has dropped to a certain predetermined point, the pump will be put into operation automatically, and will continue in operation until the level of the water in the tanks has reached a point which causes the pressure to rise to 65 pounds per square inch. Your inquiry specifies a 15 H.P., direct current motor, but if our interpretation of the data is correct, we would have to offer a pump which would require motor of at least 25 H.P.\nSec'y Dept. Of Indian Affairs.\n\nWe shall be only too pleased to tender on this equipment providing that we are sure of the conditions, and if it is not too late, we would request that you advise us just what pumping conditions for this unit will be. Hoping that you will kindly let us have this information at your earliest convenience, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN ALLIS-CHALMERS, Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nMANAGER: PUMP DEPARTMENT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 1)\nDouble Suction, Horizontally Split Shell Centrifugal Pump, direct connected by flexible coupling to electric motor.\n\nWe briefly enumerate below a few of the leading features of these pumps:\n\n**GENERAL DESCRIPTION:** The pump shell is horizontally split, the lower half containing the suction and discharge connections (flanged) and the lower half of the journals, all cast in one piece. The upper half is merely a cover, and provided with water pipes to stuffing boxes and air cock.\n\n**IMPELLER:** The impeller is of the double suction, enclosed type, made of cast bronze, finished smooth all over, inside and out, and each one is designed for the conditions under which it is to operate. The impeller is keyed to the shaft, and further held in place by brass sleeves, screwed on to the shaft with right and left hand threads, and completely covering the shaft to the outside of the stuffing boxes.\n\n**LABYRINTH RINGS:** So as to facilitate repairs, the impellers are provided with wearing rings of the labyrinth type.\n\n**BEARINGS:** Bearings are ring oiled, with large oil wells and glass oil gauge. They are lined with best babbit metal, and are carefully fitted.\n\n**BALANCING:** To eliminate the slight end thrust which is developed in double suction pumps, a balancing port is provided in the lower half of the pump shell.\n\n**THRUST BEARING:** To take up any slight tendency to end thrust which may develop, and to hold the impeller in the desired position as regards the labyrinth rings, the outboard bearing is provided with a double thrust collar, made in the shape of a spool, the pump shaft being turned down so that it passes through the centre of the spool, which is held firmly in place by a nut and lock nut on the end of the shaft.\n\n**STUFFING BOXES:** The stuffing boxes are provided with lantern glands, and water sealed, so that they need not be screwed up tight. Gland studs are of the hinged pattern, and glands are not split. The casting below the stuffing boxes is of the U shape, and acts as a catch basin for any water which may leak through the glands. It is drilled and tapped for a pipe connection in the bottom, to carry the drip to the drain.\n\n**FLEXIBLE COUPLING:** The flexible coupling is made with pins engaging with rubber rings, so that it has flexibility and allows for end play of the motor.\n\n**EXTENDED BASE:** The extended base is of substantial design, and is made up specially to suit the particular motor required.\n\n**BELT DRIVEN PUMPS:** Any of these pumps can be made with two pedestal bearings and pulley, in place of the motor.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nPurchasing Branch,\nBooth Bldg.,\nCity.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn reply to your valued inquiry of recent date, requesting a quotation covering the supply of a single stage Centrifugal Pump for McIntosh, Manitoba, on behalf of the Canadian Blower & Forge Co., Ltd., I beg to submit for your consideration as follows:-\n\nOne(1)-3\" SA, double suction, single stage horizontal split case Centrifugal Pump, capacity 300 U.S. gallons per minute against 150 ft. head, complete with cast iron base and flexible coupling suitable for direct connection to motor.\n\nPrice of pump not including motor . . . . . .$190.00\nF.O.B. cars McIntosh, Manitoba, Sales Tax included.\n\nPlease note the above pump will require a 20 H.P., 1750 R.P.M. motor to operate same satisfactorily continuously.\n\nIn regard to the providing of a small air compressor, our engineers advise that the best way to arrange this, would be to have an extended shaft on motor at opposite end to coupling, so that a small pulley may be mounted on same to operate the small air compressor.

Horizontal Single Runner Turbine for the Indian Mission near McIntosh.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your consideration in sending us this specification and sincerely regret that the time allowed for submitting a tender and also for completing the unit makes it impossible for us to submit a tender. As our Turbines are all built by Vickers in Barrow at England, delivery of sixty days is quite impossible for us, as that allows less than one month for the actual construction of the Turbine at the Works.\n\nIf you could see your way clear to extending this time, we would greatly appreciate it and would be glad to submit a telegraphed tender, to be followed later by the actual formal quotation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nVICKERS & COMBUSTION ENGINEERING LTD.\n\nM.V.

SK Motor\n\nFrame and Field Coils\nThe yoke is a ring made of open-hearth steel, hot rolled and butt welded. Rolled steel is an ideal material for motor frames because of its high magnetic permeability, uniform structure and great strength.\n\nFront Bracket\nThe brushholders are clamped to insulated rods mounted on the front bracket. The proper position of the brushes is determined at the factory and should not be changed.\n\nArmature\nThe armature is wound so as to permit excellent ventilation. The coils are form wound and are thoroughly insulated. The shaft can be removed from the armature in all except the smallest motors without disturbing the windings.\n\nBearing\nThe bearings are bronze bushings in the small motors and babbit-lined iron sleeves in the larger sizes. They are fully protected from dust by end caps and felt washers. The two bearings of each motor are interchangeable. Automatic oil-ring lubrication is used.\nWESTINGHOUSE direct-current commutating-pole motors represent the most advanced design in direct-current machines for general, constant and adjustable-speed power purposes; they are especially suitable for driving machine tools and for other service where the load is frequently started, stopped and reversed. Among their special features are the following:\n\n**Great Mechanical Strength**\u2014The frames and feet are made of forged open-hearth steel, which provides great strength and reduces the weight and dimensions. The bearings have large area, and the shafts, which are of axle steel, are unusually heavy.\n\n**Excellent Commutation**\u2014The commutation is practically sparkless on all loads, overloads, and speeds, and in either direction of rotation without change in the brush position. The life of the commutator is very long and brush renewals are rarely required.\n\n**Dustproof Bearings**\u2014The bearings are protected from the entrance of dust and are automatically lubricated so that their life is very long. They are designed to permit the motor to be used in the severest gear service.\n\n**High Efficiency**\u2014The efficiency is high at all loads. The overload capacity is ample for all services in which these motors are used, and extremely high momentary peak loads can be handled without injury to the motor.\n\n**Reliability**\u2014Beyond an occasional inspection and oiling and infrequent renewals of the brushes, these motors require practically no attention and will insure continuity of service.\n\n**Direct-Current Commutating-Pole Motors\u2014Type SK**\nConstant and Adjustable Speeds 115, 230, and 550 Volts 1\u00bd to 250 Hp.\nMotor with Idler Pulley\n\nThe idler pulley attachment is supplied for use with short belts in order to avoid excessive belt tension.\n\nSemi-Enclosed Motor\n\nFront covers are held by latches and are easily removed, but cannot become loose or fall off under vibration.\n\nLarge Type SK Motor\n\nType SK motors of approximately 125 horsepower and larger have cast-steel frames. The frame, brackets, and bearings are split horizontally.\n\nWestinghouse Type SK Motors\nWestinghouse Type SK Motors\n\nBack-Geared Motor\n\nBack-geared parts can be supplied for motors of small and moderate capacities. The construction of the gear, countershaft, and bracket is especially strong and rigid. Gear cases can be supplied on order.\n\nEnclosed Motor\n\nEnclosed motors are supplied in capacities from 1 to 25 horsepower. They are dust-proof, and can be made weatherproof when so ordered. Ribs on the brackets and covers aid in dissipating the heat.\n\nVertical Motor\n\nVertical SK motors can be supplied in all standard ratings. The weight of the armature is carried by a large ball bearing which operates immersed in oil. The lubrication is automatic.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1925.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOffice of the Purchasing Agent,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour recent enquiry sent direct to our Head Office has been referred to us for our attention.

D.C. electric generator for the McIntosh Indian Residential School be not proceeded with, I beg to add that owing to some important changes in the plans for this proposed hydroelectric power plant, the capacity of this generator will be changed.\n\nI shall again communicate with you as soon as the plans, which are now under preparation, have been submitted here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. H. Paget,\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nLincoln Electric Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nPlans for the McIntosh March 30th 1925.\nelectric power plant have been placed with general plans\nfor the building.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed is a revised report on the water\nsupply and power installation, McIntosh Indian school.\nYou will note that this report provides for a change from\nelectric driven machinery to belt driven machinery.\n\nThis change in design was made at the\nrequest of Ruther Bovey of the McIntosh Indian school\nwho requested that the plant be designed to provide for\nthe simplest form of operation and also to provide them\nwith accommodation for a carpenter shop and a blacksmith\nshop.\n\nIn addition to the changes of the power\ninstallation a considerable improvement has been made\nin the general layout of the water system, and even though\nthe automatic features are not provided for in the present\nlayout the layout does, I think, provide for a simple and\neasily operated system. The inexperienced attendant\nshould have no difficulty in watching the air gauge and\nwater gauges and keeping a continuous water service. The\nother main feature is that all the water equipment is\nhoused in the powerhouse and protected from freezing con-\nditions, and the intake being under a head from the turbine\nchamber will always insure water service in the school\nbuilding, even though the pump be temporarily out of order.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs are not\ncomitted to the first layout submitted by Mr. Gow I would,\nin view of the simplicity of operation by inexperienced\nattendants, recommend that either alternative \"A\" or \"B\"\nof the present layout be accepted. I would like to be\nadvised which installation the Department of Indian\nAffairs decides to accept.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nREVISED REPORT ON THE\nWATER SUPPLY AND POWER INSTALLATION,\nMcINTOSH INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nWith the completion of the McIntosh Indian school and the installation of the heating plant and various machinery it was seen that it would not be feasible to install the pumping plant and pressure tank in the school building as stated in Mr. Gow's report, and that a separate building to house this equipment would be required. In further discussions with Father Bovey relating to the general layout and operation of the plant he asked to have the installation as simple as possible and to eliminate the use of electric motors by substituting belt driven machinery. His reason for this latter request was that the motors would require skilled attention and in case of trouble would necessitate sending an electrician from Winnipeg to make the necessary repairs, whereas with the belt driven plant he felt that the school officials could handle most of the troubles themselves. Furthermore Father Bovey stated that the original layout did not provide sufficient accommodation for machine and carpenter shops.\n\nAccordingly I have had prepared plans showing a revised layout of the power plant and water system. From the attached blue prints of the above plans you will note that the entire installation is located in the power house and that all machinery is belt driven. With this layout it is possible to have the water supply taken direct from the wheel pit, thus...\novercoming the difficulties of freezing at the intake.\n\nAnother advantage of this change is that in case the pump was out of order water supply would still be available because the intake to the water system is under a pressure head. The increased size of the powerhouse building provides the accommodation for carpenter and machine shops desired by the school officials.\n\nTwo alternatives of revised layouts are shown on the accompanying plans. In one case a blacksmith and machine shop together with an enlarged carpenter shop is provided. The other alternative provides for carpenter shop only. Estimates with estimates of cost are submitted for approval of the Department of Indian Affairs as to which layout should be adopted.\n\nThe original layout by Mr. Gow provided for a 17\u00bd horse-power, belt-driven from the turbine. This arrangement supplied all the lighting and the power required for motor-driven pumps and motor-driven lime kiln and carpenter shops. This design proved unsatisfactory in operation of the water system. In the present revised layout now submitted it is proposed to install the following:\n\nHydraulic.\n\nNo change has been made in the turbine installation, this consisting of a 24-inch horizontal runner with Woodward Compensating Governor.\n\nElectric.\n\nThe size of the generator has been reduced from a 17\u00bd K.W. to a 10 K.W., D.C. As the pumping plant will be belt driven from the turbine the generator only supplies power for lighting and the motor for the laundry and kitchen.\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nThe pumping plant comprises a centrifugal high lift pump with 250 gallons per minute capacity against 60 lbs. pressure; a 3\" x 3\" Curtis air compressor, and a 4' 0\" x 16' 0\" steel pressure tank. As both the pump and air compressor are belt driven it will not be possible to have automatic control. With the large capacity of the pump, however, it will only take a few minutes to pump the day's supply into the pressure tank.\n\nThe water supply will be taken directly from the wheel pit, the pump thus receiving the water under a head. The force main from the pressure tank to the school will be a 4 inch W. I. pipe protected from frost.\n\nThe main general changes are:\n\n1 - A general improvement in the layout of the water system in that it eliminates a long suction intake and will provide a continuous water service even though the pump is not in service.\n\n2 - The reduction in size of the electric motor and the elimination of all meters; all machines being belt driven from the turbine.\n\n3 - In the revised scheme \"Alternative A\" calls for a two storey building 40' x 20'. This provides a blacksmith shop and power house on the first floor and carpenter shop on the second floor. \"Alternative B\" provides for a carpenter shop only on the second floor. In both these alternatives the cost of hoisting and pulleys in carpenter and blacksmith shops have been included in the estimates.\nESTIMATED COST.\n\nFrom the estimates given below for this layout it will be noted that the total cost of the combined hydroelectric development and water supply system exceeds Mr. Gow's estimate by $3,500.00. A large part of this increase is due to the increased cost of the dam, which when completed will cost about $8,100.00. The increased cost of the dam is due chiefly to,\n\nA - The large extra cost of winter construction on small work of this nature.\n\nB - When unwatered numerous seams were discovered in the bed of the river channel. This involved considerable rock excavation to obtain proper foundations and was an unexpected contingency not provided for in the original estimate.\n\nC - The extra height of dam and increased width of and sluice deck.\n\nD - Increased cost of enlarging powerhouse to for installation of pumping plant, black carpenter shop.\n\nThe estimates for the two alternatives follows:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brown,\nSales Manager.\nA revised report has been submitted by the Dominion Water Power Branch on the Hydro electric power plant now in course of erection at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is only one item in this report which will increase the cost of the work. It is suggested that the power house, which it was intended to have built be enlarged from 20 x 25 to 40 x 20, in order to provide accommodation for a blacksmith's and carpenter's shop on the first floor. This change will increase the cost of the work $600.00.\n\nAs it is intended to proceed with this work very soon, the District engineer at Winnipeg would like to be advised whether this change will be allowed.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nApril 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find three copies, together with vouchers, of Mr. J.H. Simmons' statement of cost, plus ten per cent, as per agreement, for work on the concrete dam and sewage disposal plant at the Indian Residential School, McIntosh, Ontario. These accounts have been checked as closely as possible and are recommended for payment.\n\nThe cost for constructing that portion of the dam from Sta. 3+66 to Sta. 2+10, namely $4,063.28, appears high, but the work was carried on under severe winter conditions and the utmost care had to be exercised to ensure a good job. The increase in cost over that estimated may be summarised as follows:\n\nA - The large extra cost of winter construction on small works of this nature.\n\nB - When unwatered numerous seams were discovered in the bed of the river channel. This involved considerable rock excavation to obtain proper foundations and was an unexpected contingency not provided for in the original estimate.\n\nC - The extra height of dam and increased width of piers and sluice gates.\n\nWith reference to the cost of the septic tank and drains the actual cost will also exceed the estimate for this work. The cost to date, it will be noted, is $1,274.99 and as it will cost $150.00 to complete the work in the spring the estimate will be exceeded by about $200.00. The increase is mainly due to part of the work being carried on under winter conditions and to the encountering of large excavation of large boulders. A small amount of work still remains to be done on the septic tank and adding about one foot to the concrete walls and placing the wooden flooring on the top. It was considered advisable not to complete this at the time as, owing to the extreme cold weather, the cost would have been excessive. All the necessary manholes and drains have been laid and connections constructed so that the work is complete and provided for the school and no inconvenience will be caused owing to the septic tank not being entirely completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

Simmons' statement of cost, plus ten per cent, for the work done by him on the concrete dam and sewage disposal plant at the Indian residential school near McIntosh, Ontario, together with vouchers for same. These accounts have been checked by Mr. Attwood, the District Chief Engineer of this Branch at Winnipeg, and are now recommended for payment.\n\nA copy of Mr. Attwood's letter which accompanied these accounts is also enclosed herewith. This letter explains the reason for the cost of the dam and septic tank being greater than was originally estimated. Mr. Attwood does not consider it advisable to resume work on the dam until the middle of May, when it is hoped that good progress will be made on this and on the remaining work connected with the power development.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector,\nWater Power and Reclamation.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 2)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nWith further reference to the matter of the 17\u00bd K.W. Generator ordered for McIntosh School, we find that this machine is completed and was on the point of being shipped when we received your wire instructing us to hold the order up.\n\nWe are sorry that you have changed your plans because we cannot see any way to change this for a 10 K.W. machine without incurring a heavy cancellation charge.\n\nThis machine was specially made for your order and it is not of a type which we keep in stock now on account of the almost universal use of alternating current in Canada.\n\nIf we were left with this machine on our hands it is very doubtful indeed if we would have an opportunity to sell it for a number of years. Ordinarily, and in the case of standard alternating current machines such as we are selling every month, we would be quite pleased to arrange for a customer to change an order like this without asking him to accept a cancellation charge, but in view of the special nature of this machine we feel that we cannot do so in this case.\n\nAs a matter of fact we would suggest that by far the best solution of the matter is for you to take this machine as it is and instal it. The fact that it is larger than you need will not have any practical disadvantage from the engineering point of view. It will not take any more power to run it than is required to handle the load which is actually on it.\n\nWith reference to the bearings, it is not practicable to convert this machine for ball bearings. There may be some condition with which we are not familiar which renders the use of\nball bearings advisable in this case, but we cannot think of what this might be.\n\nWe do use ball bearings in certain cases, more particularly for direct connected motor generator sets and similar machines; but for any motor or generator arranged for belt drive with an overhung pulley it has been our experience that ball bearings have certain disadvantages and we cannot think of any condition under which the sleeve bearing would not be satisfactory.\n\nWe would again urge upon you the advisability of using this machine, but if for any reason you positively cannot do so we will make you a proposition involving the substitution of a 10 K.W. generator with ball bearings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE LINCOLN ELECTRIC CO. OF CANADA, LTD.\n\nRES/Mc.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nCANADA\n\nDOMINION WATER POWER BRANCH\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nApril 1st, 1925,\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of March 24th stating that tenders have been accepted for the generator, motor, pump and pressure tank. In reply to my wire of Saturday you replied that the order for pump and motors had been cancelled but that it may not be possible to cancel the order for the generator.\n\nIn the revised report on the McIntosh power development and water system forwarded Monday, you will have noted that the plans provide for belt driven machinery instead of motor driven. This revised layout by eliminating the motors and water and air pumps reduces the size of the generator required. If this revised scheme is approved, the Lincoln Electric Company might be asked to supply a 10 k.w. D.C. generator in place of the 17\u00bd k.w. now ordered. The Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company have quoted a price of $461.00 plus freight for a ball bearing 10 k.w., 1400 r.p.m. D.C. generator. The prices for same generator without ball bearing and at higher speeds are considerably lower. I would, however, recommend that the speed of the generator be not higher than 1400 r.p.m.\n\nWith respect to the pump, I have, in the revised report, provided for a high duty ball-bearing centrifugal pump with a capacity of 250 imperial gallons per minute against a pressure of 50 lbs. If fire protection is not required a centrifugal pump of 250 gallons capacity can be purchased at prices ranging from $118.00 upwards.\n\nThe accepted tender for the pressure tank appears quite reasonable and there is no necessity of changing this order provided the tank has the necessary connections for pipes and water gauge glasses arranged to suit the vertical setting shown on the plan. It is our intention to place three one-foot water glasses as shown on accompanying plan.\n\nOf the tenders received for the turbine and governor I would recommend the acceptance of the tender of the Boving Hydraulic and Engineering Company, Lindsay, Ontario, for $2176.00 F.O.B. McIntosh, including supervision of the erection; the Department of Indian Affairs to pay for board and lodging of the erection superintendent while at McIntosh. I would, however, like to have received\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 2)\na tender from Chas. Barber & Sons, Meaford, Ontario. This firm have specialized in small size hydraulic installations for many years and I think it advisable to ask them to tender for this job, particularly as I have had some correspondence with them in reference to this work.\n\nI do not consider it advisable to resume work on the dam or start work on the powerhouse before the middle of May. The completion of the dam should be included as part of the contract for the powerhouse building, construction of penstock and transmission line. This work should be done by contract if possible as we have no equipment to handle the job by day labour. Turbines and other machinery should be delivered between June 1st and 10th. I would also point out the necessity of securing tenders for the wood stave penstock immediately so that this material will be delivered at an early date. As there are many details in connection with this work I would suggest that if the Department of Indian Affairs approve of the layout shown on the plans accompanying the revised report that the work could be expedited and carried on much more satisfactorily if authority is given me to proceed with the work and order the balance of the material not already ordered by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd... C. H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nRe: Indian Residential School at McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the tenders for the turbine in connection with the power development at the Indian residential school at McIntosh, Ontario, submitted by the Boving Hydraulic and Engineering Company, Hennie Engineering Company, and William Kennedy and Sons, these have been examined by Mr. Attwood, returned and handed to Mr. Cheng.\n\nMr. Attwood, as will be seen from his letter returning these tenders, copy of which is attached, recommends the acceptance of the tender of the Boving Hydraulic and Engineering Company of Lindsay - $2178, F.O.B. McIntosh. He suggests however that an opportunity to tender on this work should be given to Charles Barber and Sons of Meaford, Ontario, who have specialized in small hydraulic installations of this nature. There may be some objection to asking this firm to submit a price in view of the fact that the other tenders have already been examined; but if not, I would recommend that Charles Barber and Sons be asked to tender on this work, failing which, the tender of the Boving Hydraulic and Engineering Company should be accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We are enclosing you with the quotation a cut giving particulars of the compressor which we think is about what you require. The only difference is that you are asking for 6\" tight and loose pulley and you will see that this equipment is supplied with pulley 14\" in diameter for 2\" belt, but do not suppose that this makes a great deal of difference and we believe the compressors are made by the manufacturers with the size pulley that in their opinion they believe is best suited for the compressor.\n\nShould our quotation be satisfactory we would like to state that it would take perhaps a week or ten days to make delivery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADA VULCANIZER & EQUIPMENT CO.

I wish also to state that a copy of specification and form of tender have been sent to Charles Barber and Sons of Eastford for a quotation on the turbine for the above mentioned work. As soon as this received and provided their price is lower than those already submitted I shall send you their plan for your consideration. As suggested in your letter you may obtain prices for the wood stove panstock and other fittings. These quotations should be forwarded to me with your recommendations when the order for them will be placed directly from this office.\n\nWith reference to the power house I regret that owing to the limited amount available for this work that a smaller building should be erected. The outside wall at one end of the building should be built of wood instead of reinforced concrete, so that an extension might be added to it when funds are available. As already mentioned to Mr. Cochran of your Department it is not the intention to have the remaining work performed by contract; as arrangements have already been made with the school authorities to undertake this work by day labour, in order that it might be carried out as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Acting Director,\nDom.

You will note that the form of specification is slightly changed to suit our standard design.\n\nPlease note that we are using a one piece cast iron runner which we have found superior to the cast-in buckets for this class of work, also that our gate operating mechanism is not of the slipring type. We use alternate stationary and moving gates which has the same effect as the speed ring which has lately been adopted by other makers. This gives us an absolute face to adjust against, making a practically leak-proof gate, and one which is very easy to adjust.\n\nOur standard 24\" turbine is rated at 28 H.P. under 15 feet of head and this is all we have guaranteed. We shall, however, overgate it to give the full 30 H.P. Our next size of turbine is considerably large for the power required.\n\nWe carry our thrust on the turbine dome with an adjusting nut. It is of lignum vitae and iron and we have found that it is just as trouble proof and more durable than an outer bearing would be. The bearings in the turbine itself are of bronze of ample area and we have found that they give the very best of satisfaction.\n\nWe trust our proposal will meet with your approval and that we may be favored with your valued order.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nCHAS.

This is a matter however that cannot be definitely decided until the speed of the pump, generator and air compressor as ordered is known. When the speed of these machines is furnished to me I can then determine the size of the pulleys required on the line shaft, the speed of which will be governed largely by the speed of the above machines and the speed of the turbine. I had also made provision for operating the generator, pump, air compressor and carpenters shop separately by operating each pulley individually by a friction clutch.\n\nParagraph eight of your letter states that definite arrangements have been made with the school authorities to have the work done by day labour by the lay brothers under the supervision of Brother Gauthier. Does this mean that\n\n(1) The lay brothers will decide upon and purchase or rent all tools and equipment and hire all labour necessary to carry out the work.\n(2) The supervising engineer will not be called upon to certify to vouchers and cost of the work.\n\nThe estimate submitted with Alternative A and B were based on competitive bids and I feel sure that tenders could be received from reliable contractors within these figures. In deciding to do this work by day labour I quite appreciate that the work may be done within, or for less than the estimates cost. On the other hand however, I wish to point out that work done by day labour has in many cases exceeded that done by contract, and under the circumstances I can give no guarantee that the estimate will not be exceeded.\n\nI presume from your letter that in addition to the power house the completion of the dam and septic tank will also be done by day labour by the lay brothers.\n\nBefore we can complete the details of the power house and order the necessary shafting, piping, etc. it will be necessary for the Department of Indian Affairs to supply this office with a copy of the specifications and blue prints of the machines ordered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Steel.\n- Non-copper Bearing O. H. Steel.\n- Bass Steel.\n- Non-copper Bearing Bass Steel.\n- Puddled Iron.\n- Non-copper Bearing Puddled Iron.\n- Pure Iron.\n\nThe results and conclusions are most convincing, and are recorded in full in the report of Committee A-5, American Society for Testing Materials, at the meeting of the Society at Asbury Park, N. J., June 21-24, 1921. These findings are of particular value and interest to all users of sheet metal.\n\nThe Society states that its results and observations \"have now reached a point where we may definitely conclude that copper-bearing metal shows marked superiority in rust-resisting properties as compared to non-copper-bearing metals of substantially the same general composition. From which superiority we may truly anticipate a marked increase in the service life for copper-bearing metals under atmospheric exposure of uncoated sheets.\"\n\nTo analyze and summarize the Report of Test of uncoated sheets made by American Society for Testing Materials, at the end of four years and four months, the losses by corrosion are as follows:\n\n| Type Designation | Gage | Total Failures at Each Inspection. Expressed as Percentages of Total Sheets of Each Type Exposed |\n|------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  |      | 1 Tr.-10 Mos. | 3 Trs.-3 Mos. | 4 Trs.-4 Mos. |\n| Copper-Bearing...| 16   | none          | none          | none          |\n| Non-Copper-Bearing.| 16  | none          | none          | none          |\n| Copper-Bearing...| 22   | 79.4          | 37.4          | 97.4          |\n| Non-Copper-Bearing.| 22  | 79.4          | 37.4          | 97.4          |\n\nKEystone Copper Steel\n\nThe Original Copper Steel\n\nLasting in Service\nResistant to Rust\nReasonable in Cost\nWhat is Keystone Copper Steel?\n\nKEYSTONE COPPER STEEL is an alloy made by the addition of a certain percentage of Copper to well made Steel, thereby greatly increasing its wearing qualities under actual service conditions. It has been scientifically developed and tested\u2014and its use is strictest economy.\n\nThe Material of Quality \u2014 KEYS TONE \u2014 Unexcelled for rust-resistance\n\nCopper added to Steel is not an impurity, any more than Copper is an impurity in brass or bronze. It loses its identity as a metal by becoming thoroughly diffused with the steel\u2014thus forming a new metal or alloy.\n\nCopper in Steel increases its resistance to rust. Actual time and weather have proved this fact. This explains why this material is unequaled for culverts, flumes, tanks, roofing, siding, and all sheet metal work where resistance to corrosion is a factor. It further explains why the demand for Keystone products from satisfied buyers and users has increased from 5,311 tons in 1911, to upwards of 300,000 tons annually. This remarkable production record speaks for itself.\n\nKeystone Copper Steel products were awarded the Grand Prize (highest award) for general excellence and greatest merit, by the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco. This high recognition followed very careful and thorough investigations by able juries, and testifies to the high standard achieved in Keystone quality.\n\nSupplied in Black Sheets, Galvanized Sheets, Roofing Products, Culvert and Flume Stock, Etc.\n\nUSED BY\n\nThe Steel Trough & Machine Co., Ltd.\n\nENGINEERS - TANK SPECIALISTS - MACHINISTS\n\nTWEED, ONTARIO CANADA\n\n(Printed in U.S.A.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Attwood, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power Service,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAttention Mr. Craig - File B.4996-M.\n\nWe have your favour of the 29th ult. with reference to Wood Pipe for McIntosh Ont., and note that the quantity has now been reduced from 450' to 330'.\n\nWe take pleasure in quoting as follows:\n\n330', 36\" Continuous Wood Stave Pipe, with staves made from 2\" dry Fir, finished 1\u00bd\", together with \u00bd\" round mild steel bands and shoes,\n\n@ $2.10 per ft., f.o.b. McIntosh, Ont., OR\n@ $2.15 per ft., f.o.b. Vancouver, B.C.\n\n(Sales Tax not included; we understand this would not apply in your case)\n\nPrice for Creosoting would be ... 70\u00a2 pr.ft.extra.\n\nYou will note this price is higher than the previous estimate but this is entirely due to adjusting the smaller quantity to the nearest freight. The actual weight of the pipe material is 17200\u00a3 and in figuring a delivered price the cheapest freight rate we can take is the 10th Class, 30,000\u00a3 minimum, @ $1.04, - or $312.00 - which accounts for the higher delivered price.\n\nWe do not know whether there is any possibility of other lumber being ordered for the same point; if so, this price would be materially reduced; possibly you can advise us further on this point.\n\nWith reference to Creosoting. We most strongly recommend it for a pipe of this nature working under a low pressure. With creosoted staves we will supply any larger service from the pipe. The price for creosoting is based on being able to include this small quantity in another Retort charge, and should you decide to favour us with your order, we would like to be advised as soon as possible, so that the material could be manufactured and set aside to await a favourable opportunity for creosoting, and in this way there would be no delay when shipment was required.\n\nIn our previous letter we gave an estimated cost of 79\u00a2 pr.ft. for creasing, and at the same time pointed out we could supply one of our superintendents at a rate of $10. per day and expenses. We frequently have one or more of our men at different points in Eastern Canada, or might have one on his way East, and could arrange a stop-over for a few days to assemble this pipe; in this way you would be put to a minimum of expense.\nWe hope you will find this quotation attractive and that we may be favoured with your order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPACIFIC COAST PIPE CO., Ltd.,\nPer... H. C. James,\nMgr.\n\nP.S. This Pipe if laid on the surface should be supported on sills about 6' apart.

W. R. Hancock.\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of April 25th prices have been obtained for 320 feet of 36-inch continuous wood stave penstock for the McIntosh Indian School hydro-electric plant. These are as follows:\n\nCanadian Pipe Company, Limited, Vancouver.\n\n$8.88 per foot F.O.B. McIntosh.\n$75.00 extra for a 20-minute bath of creosote, and\n$10.00 extra for pressure creosoting.\n\nPacific Coast Pipe Company, Limited, Vancouver.\n\n$3.10 per foot F.O.B. McIntosh.\n.70 per foot extra for creosoting.\n\nOntario Wind Engine & Pump Co., Winnipeg.\n\n$3.45 per foot F.O.B. McIntosh.\n\nThe tenders from the Canadian Pipe Company and the Pacific Coast Pipe Company are enclosed. The price from the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Company were obtained verbally from their Winnipeg representative.\n\nThe Canadian Pipe Company's quotation is the lowest and as they are a responsible and reliable firm I would suggest that their tender be accepted. With respect to creosoting the pipe no allowance was made for this in the estimate and if the Indian Department decides on one of the two methods the estimate will be increased by this additional cost. In their letter the Canadian Pipe Company state that as the pipe will only weigh 20,000 pounds and the minimum car rate is 40,000 pounds, some 6,000 feet of lumber could be shipped at the same time with no extra cost for freight. If the Indian Department consider it advisable to take advantage of this, 6000 feet of 1 x 6\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dom. Water Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nshiplap could be ordered as it will be required for the powerhouse and forms. This might be made up as follows. If the Indian Department desires B.C. fir sheeting both inside and out 4,000 feet of B.C. fir 1 x 6 shiplap, could be ordered; the balance or 2,000 feet of spruce shiplap which will be required for the roof and for form work. The complete quantities of lumber required for McIntosh are now being prepared and will be forwarded within the week.\n\nWill you please have this order placed for immediate delivery and also advise the Canadian Pipe Company that we desire to have one of their men superintend the erection of the panstock if, as they state in their letter, a man is in the vicinity of McIntosh, and that the cost for these services will not exceed $200.00. This erection can be proceeded with any time within the next 30 days, but it is necessary that we be advised by the Indian Department and also by the Canadian Pipe Company as to the approximate date of the arrival of the panstock so that we may only desire to take advantage of the Pipe Company's offer to have one of their men erect the pipe if that man is in the vicinity of McIntosh, otherwise we can secure a man in Winnipeg to do this work.\n\nI suggest that the Department of Indian Affairs when awarding the contract to the Canadian Pipe Company also notify the Pacific Coast Pipe Company that the contract for the pipe has been let.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd....

A reply dated April 30 has been received from that Department, a copy of which is attached.\n\nThese two questions have also been discussed with the Departmental Engineer, and we are informed that as regards labour, the lay brothers will be used as far as they are available, and any additional labour required will be a matter for arrangement between the engineer in charge and the School Principal. The engineer in charge will also be expected to certify all expenditures on incoming pay-lists. As the attached letter states, you will be required to provide building materials and all necessary tools and equipment.\n\nThe three blue prints mentioned in that letter of the machinery which has been ordered by the Indian Department are enclosed.\n\nWe have also been furnished with three letters addressed to the Indian Department from the Boving Hydraulic and Engineering Company. Two of these letters are dated May 2 and suggest certain changes in the turbine; the third dated May 5 suggests a change in the foundation of the power house, penstock and intake. Copies of these three letters and of the drawings accompanying them are enclosed herewith.\n\nThe Indian Department wishes you to take up the matters involved direct with the Boving Company and make the necessary decisions yourself.\n\nFor your guidance, I would suggest that the matter of providing an extension to the turbine shaft through the wall, to allow for connecting the turbine with a saw, as suggested in the first letter of May 2, might be discussed with the School Principal. No money is available this year for building the wood-shed, but if you consider it desirable, it might be well to provide the shaft extension.\n\nThe question of a larger pulley for the turbine suggested in the other letter of May 2, should be taken up with the Lincoln Electric Company.\n\nC.

On Saturday Mr. Craig met Mr. Orr at McIntosh. While at McIntosh Mr. Craig freely discussed this work with Mr. Orr and also with the Reverend Father Bayes, Superior of the Oblate Order, and Father Boyer.\n\nWith respect to carrying on this work by day labour conditions at McIntosh have changed entirely since last fall and Father Bayes and Father Boyer both stated to Mr. Craig that they preferred to have the work carried by contract of hire rather than our own labour, as at present there are no Lay Brothers available at McIntosh to carry on the works, Brother Gauthier having been transferred to other work. Upon being asked by Mr. Craig what instructions they had received with regard to carrying on this work by day labour both Father Bayes and Father Boyer stated that the only instructions received were a copy of Mr. Macdonald's letter of April 30th as forwarded to us with your letter of May 12th.\n\nBoth Mr. Craig and myself have discussed the whole matter with Mr. Orr, who, while he has not been in touch with this work for some time, appreciated the unsatisfactory position which we were being placed in by the letter of instructions on April 30th, and upon his return to Ottawa would forward these instructions to the Deputy Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs and arrange for definite instructions for the performance of the work.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Lay Brothers at McIntosh are not anxious to carry out this work there are two methods of handling the work. The first is by contract, which will involve no purchase of plant and small tools or the hiring and payment of labour and have the advantage of the contractor's organization. The second is by day labour, carried our directly by this office. To do the work by day labour would involve renting a concrete mixer and the purchase of\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Water Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nsmall tools and equipment such as shovels, picks, sledges, drills, pails, rope, block and tackle, etc., etc. It is hardly feasible to rent the small tools mentioned above as certain portions of them would be used up in the work. Further, the tally laborers would necessarily have the money available for prompt payment of wages when demanded. I am quite willing to undertake the work on either of the above methods, but prefer the contract method, but in the final adjustment of this with the Indian Department I would like to have a clear-cut understanding as to my responsibility in the matter. This I have asked Mr. Orr to take up with you personally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) C.H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n**The CANADIAN BLOWER & FORGE CO.

I am advised today that the Lay Brothers on whom the Principal was depending have been transferred to another institution. It is, therefore, suggested by the District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg that the balance of the work be carried out by contract. The remaining work consists in the completion of the dam, the erection of a small power house, and the installation of the machinery already purchased.\n\nIf you approve of this suggestion I would recommend that competitive prices be obtained from contractors in Winnipeg.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 29th ult. and in this connection we beg to advise you that we have now received the information referred to from the District Engineer's Office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBOVING HYDRAULIC & ENGINEERING CO., LTD.\n\nBAJ/ALC.\n\nGeneral Manager.\nF.

The inner end of the tail race would be 9' West of the West end of the dock.\n\nAs shown on our Blue Print W.T. 461 we propose to make the tail race 4' wide in the part that is excavated on land, beyond the shore line it could be broadened out so that you do not need to excavate deeper than to elevation 95.00 as indicated on the enclosed Blue Print.\n\nYou will find from this Blue Print that you will require about 370' of 36\" wood stave penstock and there will also be required 2 steel\n\nIndian Affairs.

Copies of your letters of May 2nd and May 5th have been forwarded to me with instructions to take up with your Company direct the suggestions made in these letters.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion of extending the turbine shaft through the wall of the power house to operate a saw as shown on the blue print WT 491, you will note from our blue print enclosed that a carpenter's shop is being provided above the power house and at present the extension for the saw is not considered necessary.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 2nd suggesting that the drive pulley on the turbine shaft be changed from a 30\" to pulley 36\" in diameter, this is quite agreeable, if in your opinion after examining the new layout proposed, the larger pulley is still necessary to provide proper regulation. In our design of the power house layout the line shaft is designed to operate at turbine speed (450 r.p.m.)\n\nWith respect to your suggestion of May 5th regarding the position of the power house and the length of the penstock, I may say that this location had been considered but the present location on the island provided for a little cheaper construction and we were quite limited for funds.\n\nI am enclosing a plan showing the general layout of the McIntosh development, and also a plan of the power house showing the installation of turbine, governor, generator, water pump, line shaft, etc. This plan supersedes the one you formerly received and provides for belt driven machinery.\n\nBefore proceeding with the construction of the power house building I would like to receive from you a complete installation drawing showing the details and position of the openings to be left in the floor and the wheel pit together with any bolt holes for the turbine and draft tube, the wheel pin type, and the turbine shaft. I would also like to be advised whether you would prefer to set the wall frame and draft tube foundation rings, if not, these will be set prior to the arrival of your men to install the turbines.\n\nIn the specifications it is stated that the unit shall be constructed for installation on steel foundation beams which must be provided by the Contractor. Are these foundation beams necessary with the open wheel pin type of installation? If so, please show the position of these beams together with size and dimension.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd)... C. H.

It should be shipped with the wood stove penstock without extra cost for freight. You may therefore advise your Winnipeg office accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFe H.

Chance, to discuss certain of the details arising out of the work to be completed at McIntosh.\n\nDuring this discussion Mr. Attwood pointed out that there were certain items included in the estimate which would not be satisfactorily handled on a cash basis, and Mr. Chance agreed that it would probably be more satisfactory that these items be provided for by a cash advance. I would suggest, therefore, that an advance of five hundred dollars ($500.) be made available, its expenditure to be fully accounted for and vouchers in duplicate supplied for all expenditures in excess of one dollar.\n\nIf this suggestion meets with your approval, I shall be glad if you would forward a cheque for five hundred dollars drawn in favour of G.H.

Two copies of the plans are being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nEven the lowest of the tenders received is somewhat higher than had been anticipated, particularly in view of the fact that our estimate, as submitted on March 30th, 1925, was based on prices received from both local manufacturers and contractors.\n\nThe tender of J.H. Simmons being the lowest, and as he was the contractor for the school at McIntosh, I would recommend that his tender for the sum of $5,789.00 be accepted, and if approved by the Department of Indian Affairs, that I be notified immediately and supplied with the necessary forms of contract so that the contract can be closed and work started at the earliest possible date. I would also suggest that the cheques be returned in the usual manner to the unsuccessful tenders.\n\nAssuming that the tender of J.H.

Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power Service,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. Hydro plant and water supply system, McIntosh, Ont.\n\nIn reference to the above work for which we submitted you a tender on the 21st instant, we have subsequently had an opportunity to place this proposal before our foreman, who built the part of the said work which has already been erected, and is therefore, familiar with the local conditions. This man has just returned to the City today, and he advises us that he can considerably improve on the estimated cost of several features of the work.\n\nWe, therefore, are prepared to give you a guaranteed cost on the work of Five Thousand Three Hundred Dollars $5300.00 at the present time, and are willing to proceed with this work at once if you wish us to do so, and to carry it out as per plans and specifications on a basis of cost plus 10%, with the guarantee that this will not exceed Five Thousand Three Hundred Dollars $5300.00.\n\nAs we explained to you we are willing to take this chance on cutting the price in order to provide employment for this foreman and his gang, as we have no other work to offer them at the present moment, and are anxious to keep this part of our organization together.\n\nWe will, therefore, appreciate an early decision by your department on this proposal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMACAW & MACDONALD.\n\nSgd. A. Macaw.\nSir:\n\nRe Hydro Plant at McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter this morning, from Macaw and Macdonald, General Contractors, Winnipeg, who tendered on the completion of the hydro plant at McIntosh, stating that on the advice of their foreman they are prepared to do the work on a cost plus ten per cent basis and give a guarantee that the total cost will not exceed $5,300. This letter is enclosed.\n\nMr. Macaw called at this office and brought with him his estimates for the work at McIntosh explaining that his foreman, who worked on the construction of the dam last winter, had shown them through his knowledge of conditions that their estimate was quite high. The estimate of Macaw and Macdonald was revised by their foreman and shown to me amounting to a total of $6,100, and Mr. Macaw's explanation for submitting his alternative fixture was that he feared his tender as submitted would probably be considered high. He further stated that his foreman and construction gang had just returned to the city having completed a contract for the C.I.R., and as his firm had no other work to offer they thought it would be to their advantage to bid at McIntosh on a cost plus basis, giving the Department the advantage of any saving which might accrue and at the same time guarantee that the total cost of the work would not exceed $5,300. Mr. Macaw explained that this offer was made in order to provide employment and keep his organization intact.\n\nI informed Mr. Macaw that the tenders had been forwarded to Ottawa, but gave him no information as to the number of firms who had tendered nor the amount of the tenders, and agreed to submit this letter to the Department of Indian Affairs for their consideration. I felt, however, that in submitting the letter of Macaw and Macdonald to the Department it was only fair to inform Mr. Simmons that a letter had been received offering to do the work at McIntosh on a cost plus basis with an upset price at a figure considerably lower than those received in any of the tenders, and asked him if he would be prepared to do the work on a cost plus basis, naming an upset price for the contract. In reply to this Mr. Simmons has submitted a letter indicating that he would agree to do this work on a percentage basis, namely, cost plus ten per cent, with his previous tender price as an upset price.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAlthough the receipt of the revised offers from the contractors after tenders have been received may be considered irregular, the saving to the Department is, I think, of sufficient amount to warrant consideration of these revised tenders.\n\nAlthough the upset price stated by Mr. Simmons is higher than that of Macaw and Macdonald I personally feel that all the tenders submitted were high and feel confident that the work can be done for less than $5,300., and in view of the fact that Mr. Simmons was the lowest tenderer I am of the opinion that he can execute the work on a cost plus basis and therefore of the utmost importance to save and if these new offers are considered by the Department of Indian Affairs I would recommend that Mr. Simmons' offer of this date be given favorable consideration, or that he at least be given an opportunity to reduce his upset price to that of Macaw and Macdonald.\n\nUpon receipt of a decision regarding these tenders from the Department of Indian Affairs I would be glad to receive a telegram advising me of that decision so that the contract may be let and work started immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nAttention The Departmental Engineer.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn further reference to my letter of July 27th last forwarding Tenders, etc., in relation to completion of the power development at the McIntosh Residential School, I now enclose copy of a letter from Mr. Attwood of July 27th, with copies of the letters from Messrs. Macaw and Macdonald and J.H.Simmons, therein referred to.\n\nThe substance of the further proposals of these contractors was contained in a telegram from Mr. Attwood, copy of which was handed to you on the same date as it was received, viz. July 27th last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

In his last letter Mr. Craig mentioned that probably they would be ready to start the erection the first week of this month but we now understand that the erection cannot be started for another five weeks.\n\nOur Erection Superintendent, Mr. Olson, communicated with Mr. Craig from Pointe du Bois, Man. last week and he was advised to this effect.\n\nThe funds which we required for constructing this machinery were advanced by our Bankers under a special agreement and they are now claiming repayment because the Contract with you should have been completed some time ago and payment received.\nKindly let us know when we may expect your remittance for the usual instalment, and oblige,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBOVING HYDRAULIC & ENGINEERING CO. LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Manager\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 130-7-16.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of August 24 I now enclose herewith agreement in duplicate between J.H. Simmons and the Department of Indian Affairs for the completion of the hydroelectric plant for the McIntosh Indian residential school at McIntosh, Ontario.

This decision was arrived at owing to the fact that a two-inch steam pipe was being laid alongside the four-inch water pipe from the school to the powerhouse to prevent the water pipe from freezing; and further that Father Dyer stated that there were enough radiators left from the school to heat the power house. On taking this matter up with the school authorities on the ground, however, it has been found that only a small part of one radiator is left and that practically all the necessary radiators and pipe would have to be purchased.\n\nFrom inquiries made of the different heating firms in the city I estimate that the cost of supplying steam radiators and fittings for the building would run something over $200.00. This seems rather high for the heating equipment and as the cost for two suitable box stoves with the necessary pipe will not exceed $50.00, I suggest that the necessary authority be obtained from the Indian Department for their purchase. I have taken this matter up with the school authorities and they are agreeable to have stoves in place of steam heating.\n\nWith the near approach of winter an early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

With this credit slip deducted, the amount due the company is, as shown on the invoice, $132.30.\n\nThese pipes and fittings have been purchased to avoid the necessity of changing the connections on the water pressure tank to make it suitable to place in a vertical position. The matter has been taken up with the Lay Brothers and they suggested that the pressure tank be placed in a root house which they are building adjacent to the school. By doing this, the connections on the tank can be left as they are as it is intended to place the tank in a horizontal position. As the cost of changing the connections would run somewhat over $100.00 and as the Lay Brothers prefer to have the tank in the root house, it was decided to follow their suggestion as the additional expense incurred only amounts to a little over $30.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Simmons for the construction of the hydro-electric plant at McIntosh, and which is now nearing completion, the school officials are very anxious that the balance of the work be left until next spring. The work still remaining to be done by the contractor comprises a small amount of back-filling at the dam, powerhouse and water mains, painting of the powerhouse, connecting up the penstock to the steel thimbles in the dam and wheel pit and removing the tail-race cofferdam.\n\nIn taking up the question with the school officials they state that they are strongly opposed to the remaining work being finished during the winter for the following reasons:\n\n(1) They will not, in any case, operate the plant until next spring.\n\n(2) With the plant not operating they fear that considerable damage would result from ice during the winter months if the plant were completed.\n\n(3) That the powerhouse cannot properly be painted during cold weather.\n\n(4) That with the ground frozen the remaining back-filling cannot be done as well in the winter as in the spring.\n\nIn view of the school officials' decision not to operate the plant until spring there would, I think, be some danger of the plant being damaged by ice, if completed at the present time. With reference to the painting of the building and the back-filling, there is no question that this work cannot be done properly during the cold weather.\n\nMr. Simmons was authorized to start this work on August 24th, 1925, and according to the contract, was to have it completed on or before October 31st. Owing to one thing and another, but principally to the lack of proper supervision by the contractor, the work has been dragging along in a very disappointing manner, in spite of repeated instructions, both verbal and written, by Mr. Craig and myself urging the contractor to speed up the work, both for his own sake as well as the sake of the school officials. There being no penalty clause in the contract, however, little notice was taken of these requests, as practically no improvement took place in the methods of handling the work.\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs stated above, the school officials are very anxious that all of the remaining work should be left over until spring, and to this end a meeting was arranged in this office with Brother Eugene, representing Red River College, and the contractor Mr. J.H. Simmons. It was pointed out that the Department of Indian Affairs might prefer to have the work finished up before the end of the fiscal year, that the money was now voted and that otherwise it would be necessary to place an amount in the estimates and ask for a revote next year. At this meeting Brother Eugene and Mr. Simmons estimated that the cost of completing the contract would be approximately $300.00, and Brother Eugene agreed, if the work was left over until spring, to complete it for that amount.\n\nTo overcome the necessity of asking for a revote of any portion of this contract, and in order to meet the wishes of the school authorities that the work be left over until spring, it is suggested that the sum of $300.00 be deducted from the contract price of $5500.00 and be paid to the school authorities before the end of the fiscal year, they on their part agreeing to complete the unfinished work for this sum. As the work already completed, such as the penstock, wheel-pit, etc., would not be tested until spring, Mr. Simmons is willing to have this deposit cheque of $300.00 held as a bond until the work is completed and tested by me. A written agreement would, of course, be secured from both the school officials and the contractor. It might also be stated that Mr. Simmons is quite agreeable to the proposal and would like to see it adopted, if possible.\n\nThe work yet to be done is of such a nature that it can be done by the Lay Brothers equally well as by the contractor and entirely to the satisfaction of the school authorities. If the Department of Indian Affairs can arrange for the payment of $300.00 to the school officials for the completion of the contract before it is actually finished and the final payments to the contractor as per the suggestion outlined above I feel certain that the work can be completed to entire satisfaction of the school authorities and the Department. Holding the contractor's cheque for $300.00 will, I think, be ample security for the Department, as a bond, that the work already performed by the contractor has been satisfactory.\n\nIt might be pointed out that the school officials have been put to extra work and expense due to the delay on the part of the contractor and are very anxious to see him off the job and finish what work there is to do themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd... G. H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 130-7-16.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 13th instant I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Attwood, our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, with reference to the completion of the hydro-electric plant at the McIntosh Indian school. He recommends that no more work should be done at the present time owing to winter conditions and that the small amount of work which still remains to be done should be carried out by the Lay Brothers, instead of by the contractor, for which purpose the sum of $300 estimated as sufficient to complete the work, be deducted from the contractor's price of $500.00 and paid to the school officials before the end of the present fiscal year, them on their part agreeing to complete the unfinished work for this sum.\n\nMr. Simmons, the contractor, is willing to have his deposit cheque of $500 held as a bond until such time as the work is tested and accepted by our District Chief Engineer, a written agreement to be secured from both the school officials and the contractor to cover this arrangement.\n\nI beg to recommend that this arrangement be adopted and will be glad to have your approval and instructions with regard to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

Previous to this, part of the dam had been built and all other equipment purchased, with the exception of the shafting and pulleys, electric switch-board and wiring, pipes and fittings, etc. The contract awarded to Mr. Simmons comprised the:\n\n- Completion of the dam.\n- Building the power house.\n- Laying the penstock.\n- Laying the water supply system from the power house to the school.\n- Poles for power line to school building.\n\nThough the contractor started the work during the last week of August progress was exceedingly slow, with the result that after five months the following items still remain to be done:\n\n- Connecting up of the penstock to the dam and power house.\n- Removal of the tailrace cofferdam.\n- A certain amount of back-filling.\n- Painting of the building.\n\nThe main cause of this delay was the lack of proper supervision by the contractor, together with the fact that the contract contained no penalty clause for non-completion on the specified date, October 1st. Though the contractor was instructed a number of times, both verbally and by letter, to make better progress, very little improvement in the handling of the work took place.\n\nWith reference to the completion of the remaining work to be done under Mr. Simmons' contract, a suggestion put forth by the Lay Brothers, to leave this work until spring has been taken up by me in my letter of January 16th.\n\nThe installing of the machinery, shafting, etc., is not included in the general contract, as by an arrangement with the Lay Brothers this work is to be done by and under their supervision. The contractor, however, was to\nsupply as an extra any unskilled labor required for the installation of the machinery. To date all the heavy machinery has been installed. There only remains the setting of the shafting, switch board, electric wiring, etc., and in view of the fact that the school officials have decided not to operate the plant until spring, the work of installing this equipment will naturally be carried on at their convenience.\n\nThe cost to date and the estimated amount necessary to finish the work are shown on the attached sheets. The items shown under the heading \"Paid by Department of Indian Affairs\" are those of which we have record in this office. Possibly other payments have been made of which we have no record, but in that case those amounts are shown under the heading \"Amount Needed to Complete Work\".\n\nIn addition to the statement of cost there is also enclosed a copy of \"Estimate of Cost\" submitted with my letter of July 22nd.\n\nJohn Craig\n\nIndian Affairs.

Attwood, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\n303 Chambers of Commerce,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Friday last you informed me that the Department of Indian Affairs, in a letter dated February 6th, had no objection to me subletting to the Oblate Fathers the balance of the work yet to be done on the Hydro-Electric and Water supply installation at McIntosh upon the understanding that the subletting of the balance of the work does not release me from full responsibility for the satisfactory completion of the work, and further that my security deposit cheque of $500.00 shall be retained as a guarantee until the work is tested and accepted. I agree to the above conditions.\n\nOn February 26th an agreement was entered into between the Oblate Fathers and myself whereby they agreed to complete the remaining portion of my contract to your satisfaction. It was mutually agreed that the sum of $300.00 was sufficient to complete the work and I understand that this amount is to be deducted from the contract price and a certificate prepared covering the balance due under the contract.\n\nAs only one payment has been made on this contract I would appreciate having the certificate prepared and submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. H. Simmons\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 3)\nFebruary 26th 1926.\n\nIt is hereby agreed between J. H. Simmons, Contractor for the construction of the hydro-electric development at McIntosh, Ontario, and the Oblate Fathers, that the contractor sublets to the Oblate Fathers the balance of the work to be done under its contract with the Department of Indian Affairs dated August, 1925, to complete the said development, and the Oblate Fathers agree to complete the work to the satisfaction of the District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, resident at Winnipeg, Manitoba, on a basis of actual cost plus a commission of $50.00.\n\nIt is further agreed by the said parties that as a basis of cost for the completion of the said power development that the time of Brother Eugene shall be paid for at a rate of 85 cents per hour; That of Brother Adolph at a rate of 75 cents per hour. That the use of team and driver shall be charged for at a rate of 65 cents per hour and that any other labor required, or expenses incurred to complete the contract by the Oblate Fathers shall be charged for at actual cost.\n\nPayment for the completion of this work shall be made upon the presentation of the final account accompanied by a certificate of completion from the said District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service.\n\nContractor: [Signature]\n\nOblate Fathers: [Signature]\nSir,\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of Feb. 10th, enclosing a copy of a letter dated Feb. 6th from the Department of Indian Affairs, in which Mr. Simmons offers Mr. Simmons to sublet the remaining portion of his contract for the hydro-electric development and water supply installation for the McIntosh Indian School, to the Oblate Fathers.\n\nFollowing this authorization, a meeting was arranged between Mr. Simmons, the contractor, and Brother Eugene, representing the Oblate Fathers, when an agreement was made for the subletting of this work. A copy of this agreement, signed by Father Beysa, Superior for the Oblate Order for this district, and Mr. Simmons, the contractor, is enclosed, together with a copy of a letter from Mr. Simmons to me, whereby he agrees to sublet the work under the prescribed conditions.\n\nThe agreement between Mr. Simmons and the Oblate Fathers is designed to protect the Oblate Fathers from any loss, and though the tentative estimate for this work was $300.00, the Oblate Fathers actually do the work at cost plus a fixed commission of $50.00, this amount being 10% of the estimated cost.\n\nWith the above arrangement completed an estimate has been prepared, two copies of which are enclosed. As will be noted, the $300.00 is deducted from the contract price of $500.00 and the amount due is the balance less the amount paid on Estimate No. 1 together with $47.33 for extra work done by the contractor.\n\nThe only item in the extras which was not connected with the contract was the item of $47.00 for repairing a small leak at the steel thimble in that section of the dam which was built in January, 1925. The leak was probably caused by a certain amount of freezing of the concrete before it was properly set.\n\nYou will note Mr. Simmons requests payment of the balance due on the contract at an early date, and in view of the work done and also that Mr. Simmons's security cheque for $500.00 is to be retained by the Department until final approval of the work, it is recommended that this payment be made to Mr. Simmons at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n'SGD' C.H.

In addition to these documents I also enclose certificate from Mr. Attwood covering the sum now due to Mr. Simmons on account of his contract, amounting to $2787.33, with a detailed account of the extras amounting to $441.33, certified by Mr. Attwood; also Mr. Simmons' account for the completion of the septic tank, amounting to $339.44, certified by Mr. Attwood. The septic tank was completed as a force account plus 10% of the cost as authorized in your letter of July 21 last.\n\nI beg to recommend that Mr. Simmons should now be paid these two items, namely, $2787.33 on account of his contract for the hydro-electric development and water supply, and $339.44 for the completion of the septic tank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. J.D.

R. Bunn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, a short time ago that there had been a fire in the McIntosh Indian School, Mr. Mooney who was at Sioux Lookout at the time, was instructed to visit McIntosh and make a personal inspection of the power plant with special reference as to how satisfactory the water supply had been during the fire.\n\nThe fire, it appears, had occurred in the laundry of the school and before any extensive damage was done was got under control. The chemical fire extinguishers were used until the centrifugal pump could be started when more than a satisfactory supply of water was obtained which quickly put out the fire. Rev. Father Perrault, Principal of the school, stated that he was more than satisfied and that with the equipment a stream of water was easily thrown over the school buildings.\n\nThe sewerage system appears to be working quite satisfactorily, the grounds in front of the school having now been graded and planted with potatoes, with practically nothing showing that a sewerage system had been installed.\n\nThe hydro-electric plant is giving entire satisfaction and even with the high water experienced no damage has been done or inconvenience occasioned in the operating of the plant. The 36\" wood stove penstock was found in good condition, though it will be advisable to have this painted with a suitable tar paint, as otherwise its life will be considerably shortened. The painting should be done during this season as soon as the stage of high water has passed.\n\nWhile at the school Father Perrault informed Mr. Mooney that they were quite concerned over the fact that due to the high water on Forest lake the water had started to flow through an old high water channel into Canyon lake. As shown on the attached sketch this channel is about half a mile west of the school. Mr. Mooney made an inspection and reports that this channel had been completely silted up and overrun with brush previous to the high water on Forest lake. This spring the lake was evidently high enough to cause the water to flow over the silt-filled channel with the result that the earth and silt eventually was washed away. At the time of Mr. Mooney's visit the channel was about 2'9\" wide at the entrance, eventually widening to about 50' at a rock ledge approximately 800' from the entrance. The depth of water flowing through the channel was about 3' at the opening and about 1' at the rock ledge, where the velocity was quite high.\nFrom information obtained it appears that the flow through this high water channel could be stopped by the building of a small dam on the rock ledge at the narrow section of the channel. Mr. Mooney states that at this location the ground on the south side is quite high and that though on the north side there occurs much loose ground gradually rises and there would be a small area only that might be flooded by the construction of a dam at this point. With the dam 60' wide a timber crib earth filled dam about 60' long and 3' high should be sufficient to meet the requirements. It might be advisable to have the upstream side sheeted with rough lumber in order to stop any possible washing away of the earth fill.\n\nAs already stated, this channel had been previously filled with silt and completely overgrown with bush and even with the high water of last year when water was wasting over the spillway some 3\" or 4\" deep no leakage occurred through this channel.\n\nThe accompanying photographs show the entrance to the high water channel, the narrow section at which it is suggested that the dam might be erected and certain views of the hydro-electric development at the school.\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 1307-16.\nRe: McIntosh Indian School.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a memorandum received from Mr. Attwood, our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, with reference to the hydro-electric development at the McIntosh Indian school. From this you will see that the power plant, together with the water and sewage systems, appears to be giving entire satisfaction and the only trouble that seems to have arisen is the opening up of an old high-water channel due to the exceptional high water this year. Mr. Attwood reports that the cost of putting in a small timber, earth-filled, crib dam at the narrow section of this channel should not be high and it would probably be advisable to have this work done so as to make the flow of water from the upper and lower lake available for the power development.\n\nMr. Attwood also recommends the painting of the wood stave penstock from the dam to the powerhouse, with a suitable tar paint, and states that this painting should be done this year as soon as the high water has passed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would appreciate it if you would furnish the Department with an estimate of the cost of the repairs referred to in the above mentioned report, also an estimate of the cost of constructing a fish way in the dam to allow the fish to go up to their spawning grounds, which has been reported by the Provincial Game and Fisheries Department to be absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of July 29th in which you request estimates of certain work at the McIntosh Indian school power development, enclosed you will please find two copies of Mr. Craig's memorandum in which is given estimates of cost of the different items.\n\nWith reference to the painting of the wood stave penstock, as Mr. Craig states, the applying of one coat of hot creosote oil followed by a coat of tar creosote paint follows the best practice for the preservation of wood pipe. As this pipe had no preserving material applied at the time of installation it would be advisable to have this work done at a fairly early date.\n\nThe damming of the high water channel does not appear to be, with the present power needs of the school, a very urgent affair. Even with a head of less than 13\u00bd feet the power available would be in my opinion sufficient to supply the school needs, and unless an exceptionally dry season occurs there should not be any serious shortage of power. If the Department of Indian Affairs, however, decide to have this work done at an early date the estimate given in Mr. Craig's memorandum for the building of this dam should cover the cost of construction.\n\nNatural conditions at the McIntosh Indian school are such that a fish ladder to be satisfactory, will have to extend from the dam at the outlet of Forest lake down to Canyon lake, this being some 400 feet long. It might therefore be advisable for the Department of Indian Affairs to again take up with the Ontario Department of Fisheries the matter of installing a fish ladder between the two lakes. As Mr. Craig points out no previous attempt was made in the old lumber dam which had been in place before the present installation and it is doubtful whether many fish were ever able, for a great number of years, to pass from Canyon to Forest lake. In view of the above the Ontario Department of Fisheries might reconsider their decision as to the necessity of installing a fish ladder at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nPer J.C.\n\nJohnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power &\nReclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRE\n\nMCINTOSH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nSeptember 16th, 1927.\n\nJohn Craig,\nAsst. Dist. Chief Engineer.\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nSeptember 16th, 1927.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- Mr. Attwood -\n\nRe: McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nA memorandum dated July 5th was forwarded to Ottawa re McIntosh Indian School power and water installation in which was recommended the painting of the 36-inch wood-stave penstock. The dam is an old high water channel between Forest and Canyon lakes. This channel was overgrown with trees and bush and filled with silt. The exceptionally high stage this summer of Forest lake was sufficiently high to start water flowing over the top of this natural dam of silt and eventually swept it away with the result that a considerable amount of water is flowing through the channel into Canyon lake. As the control of the channel is about one and a half feet below the spillway level of the dam the storage on Forest lake will be lowered by this amount.\n\nIn reply to this memorandum the Department of Indian Affairs requested that estimates of cost be furnished covering the work recommended and also an estimate of the cost of constructing a fishway in the dam to allow the fish to go up to their spawning grounds. This fish-ladder the Department stated has been reported by the Provincial Game and Fisheries Department to be absolutely necessary.\n\nBelow is given an estimate of cost of the above items:\n\nPainting 36-inch Wood-Stave Penstock.\n\nThis work comprises the painting for preservative purposes of the 36-inch wood-stave penstock running from the dam to the powerhouse. It is proposed to apply one coat of hot creosote oil and after sufficient time has elapsed to allow the more volatile oils to evaporate to apply two coats of hot creosote paint prepared by the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company and sold under the trade name of \"Rhonal\". This treatment of hot oil and then painting with a tar-creosote paint follows the best practice for this class of work and it should be good for the next five to eight years, when the penstock should again be similarly treated.\nThe estimated cost is as follows:\n\n16 gals. creosote oil @ 80\u00a2 ... $12.80\n18 gals. Ebonal Point @ $1.60 ... 28.80\nLabor & Brushes ................. 50.00\n\n$91.60\n\nIt is recommended that this work be done at an early date.\n\nDamming High Water Channel.\n\nIn the former memorandum it is suggested that the high water channel could be stopped by the building of a small dam some 30 feet long across the foot ladder in the narrow section of the channel. This was based on the short inspection made by Mr. Mooney at the time of his first visit. Following the request for an estimate of this work a survey was made which shows that in order to avoid excessive flooding the most suitable location for the dam is a short distance below the entrance from Forest lake, as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nThe dam proposed is a clay filled timber dam, two and a half feet maximum height and some 200 feet long. As there is an abundance of timber at the site and suitable clay available the type of dam proposed is, under the circumstances, the cheapest in cost.\n\nAs shown on the accompanying plan the dam consists of two rows of upright timbers driven firmly in the ground, against which are fastened horizontal timbers. The space between these is then filled with clay. In the following estimate of cost it is assumed that the work is carried on under the supervision of Brother Adolph, now resident at the school. It is also considered that the work should be completed in two weeks.\n\nForeman - Bro. Adolph - 12 days @ $7.00 = $84.00\n1 lumber man - 12 days @ 5.00 = 60.00\n5 Indians - 12 days @ 20.00 = 240.00\nTools, spikes, etc. - 100.00\n\n$484.00\n\nIn view of the present power requirements of the school the need of stopping the flow through this high water channel is not considered immediately pressing. As stated above, the control of the high water channel is 110.5 which reduces the head of the dam to 110.5 and reduces the head from fifteen to thirteen and a half feet and the storage capacity one and one half feet. Even with this reduction in head and storage the power available is in excess of the present power demands and unless there is an exceptionally dry season it is not probable that the school will suffer from any shortage of power.\nFish Ladder.\n\nTo install a fish ladder at the McIntosh dam that will enable the fish to pass from Canyon to Forest Lake will be quite expensive. The distance between the two lakes is some 400 feet; the channel connecting them being a flat rock from 70 to 100 feet in width. In a channel of this nature practically no pools occur throughout its length and it will not be necessary therefore to connect the lakes by means of a fish ladder some 400 feet long. This ladder would run from the spillway of the dam at the outlet of Forest lake down the right side of the protrud to Canyon lake. It is estimated that such a ladder, three feet wide and some 400 feet long, with the necessary chambers and baffle boards, will cost between $1,500 and $2,000.\n\nIn view of the high cost of installation at this development it might be advisable for the Department of Indian Affairs to again take up with the Ontario Department of Fisheries the necessity of a fish ladder between these lakes. It might be pointed out that before the present dam was built there was an old rock filled timber dam at the outlet of Forest lake with a log chute running from the dam to Canyon lake. This chute was some 300 feet long with a high gradient, the water flowing through the chute at a high velocity. No channel other than the chute was provided and with the high velocity of the water and with a smooth stretch of 300 feet it is doubtful if many fish were able to pass from Canyon to Forest lake by means of it.\n\nPossibly the Ontario Department of Fisheries could suggest a cheaper installation than the one outlined above. In any case it will be advisable that plans of the type of fish ladder approved by the Ontario officials be obtained.\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to Mr. MacKenzie's letter of July 27th as to repairs required at the McIntosh Indian residential school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Attwood, together with copy of a memorandum giving an estimate of the cost of the suggested repairs and improvements.

If so, I shall communicate with the Principal of the School to find out whether they would be prepared to undertake the work themselves without outside Engineer supervision.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our conversation yesterday in regard to depth of water in Calumet Connecting Canyon Lake with South Bay of same lake about one half mile west of Redstone Station on Hall Road, Ky., mileage 83.5. I beg to state briefly the agreement made between the Nat. Trans. Co. and the Ontario Government at the time of Construction.\n\nThe writer was Division Engineer (51) District \"F\" at time of construction and planned to cross this two bay of Canyon Lake with a rock fill to be taken from the adjoining mts. Calumet, with a 10 ft. arch.\nCalvert at the East End.\n\nThe Iron Works of Goddardian over the river limits the logs which had to come out that way and he registered a block with the Ontario Government about our feeling the Bay with rock.\n\nThe Ontario Government thereupon demanded that we bridge the gap, which would have meant a span of between two and three hundred feet. (I do not recollect the exact length) The depth from water level to rock bottom being about 85 ft.\n\nAfter considerable correspondence between the Ontario Government Dept. of Mines Lands & Forest (I think) and with the office of Chief Engineer Nat Trans by Ottawa, or with Major Hodgins District Engineer Kenora, it was shown by the Railway that a very material saving could be made by being allowed to cut the rock for the\nfill, which would otherwise have been wasted\u2014and an agreement was finally come to whereby the railway was allowed to make the rock fill, putting in a 10 feet arch culvert and excavate rock on the east side of the bay so as to gain a minimum depth of three feet below low water level.\n\nThis arrangement was made as nearly as I can recollect in 1907 or 1908, and the correspondence and plans relating thereto should be on file with the Dept of Roads, Mines & Streets. The Home's Line (Tunke) was W.R. 9, and the fill was approximately Mile 16.9. J.B. McArthur Contract and probably referred to as such in correspondence.\n\nThe railway made the rock fill build the concrete culvert and excavated from the rock bank on the east side of the bell.\nwhat was supposed to be a channel to approach the Canal. Said channel was supposed to be 3 feet below low water mark and the bottoms of the Canal was to be the same elevation.\n\nThere is tunnel south of the track which still has to come through the Canal, and it is clearly up to the Railway to maintain three feet of water at low water both in the Canal and in the Channel approaching same so that was the understanding under which they were allowed to make the fill.\n\nYours,\n\nJ.M. Paton\nDec. 28, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is advised that a considerable amount of water is leaking through the earth embankment near the dam of the Ryrie Electric Power plant at the McIntosh Schools near McIntosh, Ont.

By the use of the storage, however, it is estimated that the minimum flow may be increased to 25 c.f.s., although the head will be decreased as the storage is used until it is 14 feet. Under these conditions the estimated minimum power available is 32 h.p.\n\nUse of Power.\n\nThe amount of power available is sufficient only for small local uses such as lighting, pumping for water supply, sawing wood, etc. There is at present no market at the site, but it is proposed to establish there a small Indian mission-school, for the purpose of which the power could be very advantageously employed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(J.D.

Rorke, Surveyor-General, Ontario Department of Lands & Forests, in which Mr. Rorke speaks of a complaint received by his department concerning flooding on the shores of Forest, Whitney, Indian, Alexander and Boulder Lakes, alleged to have been caused by the construction of the dam at the outlet of Forest Lake.\n\nI am requesting Mr. G. H. Attwood, our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, to make an investigation of this matter and submit a report. On receipt of Mr. Attwood's report you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- Mr. Attwood -\n\nRe Alleged Flooding on Forest, Whitney, Indian, Alexander and Boulder Lakes.\n\nThe writer made an inspection on August 3rd and 4th of the conditions pertaining to the above mentioned lakes as a result of the construction of the dam by the Department of Indian Affairs at the outlet of Forest Lake. Inquiries were also made of those individuals whom it was suspected were responsible for complaints made to the Ontario Government as to their views on the situation. The inspection covered an examination of the shore line of Forest, Whitney, and Indian Lakes, Alexander and Boulder Lakes not being examined as conditions surrounding all these lakes are similar.\n\nPrior to the construction of the dam at the outlet of Forest lake the water level of these several lakes was about elevation 107.0 (assumed elevation) with a maximum flood elevation of 109.5. With the construction of the dam it was intended to raise the level of these lakes to elevation 112.0 and present 112.6. During the flood conditions of 1927 the water level rose to 113.0, but on August 4th of this year the water level was 111.3. In consequence of the raising of the natural level of these lakes some five feet there has resulted more or less flooding along the shores of all these lakes, although generally speaking the shores are rocky, fairly steep and the flooded strip consequently narrow. The standing timber along the flood line has been killed and in places is uprooted and detracts from the appearance of the shore line. Certain sand beaches have been flooded but new ones are being formed.\n\nThere is no land bordering these lakes in private ownership and there is only one camp on the lakes, this being the property of Mr. Charles Byrnes of Winnipeg, but Mr. Byrnes has no title to the land where his camp was. Mr. Byrnes was questioned by the writer and was quite emphatic on the following points relating to the increased lake level.\n\n1 - No individual, other than himself, had any interest from the campers' viewpoint in these lakes, he was not complaining and had made no complaints, although he had been forced to move his camp to higher ground, clear the killed timber from the shore and was put to considerable expense with docks.\n2 - Fishing was not adversely affected by the increased level of the lakes, the fishing has been getting poorer and poorer for the past ten years due to the permitting of commercial fishing at times in these lakes.\n\n3 - These lakes have very little scenic value and are not favorable for campers so that flooding of the old shore line adversely affects no one.\n\nThe writer believes that any complaints made to the Ontario Government come from a few campers on Canyon Lake, which lake lies a mile below the dam at the outlet of Forest Lake. These campers did not take kindly to the establishment of an Indian School in the vicinity. For years these campers have seen the fishing getting poorer and poorer until today fishing on Canyon Lake is practically finished. These campers, principally from Winnipeg, have blamed all their ill will on the establishment of the Indian School and also to the construction of the dam. This Department is not concerned whether the school attracts the parents of the Indian children to the district, whether the Indians are fishing with nets and killing all the game in the district. The school was established with the permission of the Ontario Government and that Government has its own laws governing the protection of game and fish.\n\nThe dam at the outlet of Forest Lake was built without a fish ladder. However, during the open water seasons of 1927 and 1928 there has been a natural outflow channel from Forest Lake which gives fish free access from Canyon Lake to the lakes above. This channel will probably be closed in the future but even so, it would not appear necessary to go to the great expense involved in placing a fish ladder in the dam in order to permit suckers to reach the lakes above since there are practically no other fish left in Canyon Lake.\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 12th, requesting that an investigation be made of the alleged flooding on the shores of Forest, Whitney, Indian, Alexander and Boulder lakes due to the construction of the dam by the Department of Indian Affairs at the outlet of Forest Lake, Mr. Gow made the necessary inspection on August 3rd and 4th and I am enclosing a memorandum prepared by Mr. Gow dealing with the matter.\n\nIn Mr. Rorke's letter to the Department of Indian Affairs it is noted that he says that permission was granted to use the natural water power at the outlet of Forest lake but it was not anticipated that this dam would have any effect on the levels of the lakes above.\n\nThat was not our understanding of the situation at the time surveys were being made as all reports and plans prepared here called for several feet of storage behind the four lakes. Would it not be possible to obtain a copy of the correspondence covering the granting of these power privileges to the Department of Indian Affairs by the Ontario Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Before doing this, however, I sent a copy of the correspondence to Mr. Atwood for his comments and am awaiting a reply from him before writing to Mr. Horke.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will remember that on July 4 last you wrote to the Department of Indian Affairs regarding complaints received in your department as to injury alleged to have been caused by the raising of Forest, Whitney, Indian, Redden and Boulder lakes, due to the construction of a dam by the Department of Indian Affairs at the outlet of Forest Lake. This letter was referred to this department for attention and on July 12 I wrote you stating that Mr. Attwood, our District Chief Engineer, at Winnipeg, had been asked to make an investigation of the matter and submit a report. The report of Mr. Attwood and his chief engineer has been received and a copy is enclosed herewith. This report states that there is no land bordering the lakes in question which is in private ownership and there is only one camp on the lakes affected by the raising of the water level, the owner of which makes no complaint of material injury.\n\nSince receiving this report I have also seen the correspondence between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Department of Lands and Forests at Toronto regarding the purchase of land for the school site and the references made to the development of water-power in connection therewith. Amongst this correspondence there is a letter from Mr. McLean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, dated August 31, 1924, which quotes certain extracts from the report prepared by Mr. Attwood at the request of the Indian Department on the proposed scheme for the development of water-power at the outlet of Forest Lake. The extracts show that it was intended to raise the level to some extent and so obtain a certain amount of storage to provide dependable power. Mr. McLean replied to this letter on September 5 of the same year in which he is quoted as saying there seems to be no reason why a sale of the land referred to should not be carried out to the Indian Department for the purposes of the Indian school, which seems to imply that the scheme proposed in Mr. McLean's letter of August 31 had been sanctioned by your department.\n\nMr. Attwood in further correspondence which we have had with him states that it was his understanding at the time surveys were made that a certain amount of flooding would necessarily be caused by the construction of the dam and his plans were prepared for several feet of storage on all these upper lakes, these being the plans referred to in Mr. McLean's letter of August 31, 1924.\n\nMr. L.V. Rokke,\nSurveyor-General,\nDepartment of Lands and Forests,\nToronto, Ontario.\nMr. Attwood further writes in regard to this matter\u2014\n\n\"Many years before the school and power plant was built at McIntosh there had existed a dam and log chute at the outlet of Forest lake. This dam raised the level of Forest lake and the adjoining lakes some two or three feet or more above its natural level for the purpose of creating storage and having water available for the log drive and passing the logs from Forest to Canyon lake. In other words this old log dam raised the water level of Forest and adjoining lakes above normal conditions. In building the new dam raised the water very little above the previous levels.\n\nThe power site would be of little or no use without some measure of storage. The storage and lake levels now maintained does not damage private property on any of the lakes above and only damages a small fringe of timber at places around the lakes. The school authorities could not afford to clear timber off the flooded area.\n\nThe Indian Department have invested a considerable sum of money at this point for the education and betterment of conditions among the Indians in the region. The Oblate Fathers are running the school and under their charge are dorming between 100 and 125 pupils which were being trained and instructed with the ideals of a better livelihood by the Oblate Fathers. This is a cause that is worthy of support, but I happen to know that there are some few individuals in the district who are trying to raise as many difficulties as they possibly can for the school authorities.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing explanation I think you will agree that the Indian Department in carrying out the power development has acted in good faith and has not gone beyond a reasonable interpretation of the permission given by your department. The power development is necessary for purposes of the school and is not being used in such a way as to materially affect any private interests.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

No plans of said construction were ever submitted, and it was not until the complaint was made by some of the tourists and summer cottagers in that vicinity, that damage to the shore was resulting due to the raising of the waters in Forest Lake and other Lakes, this became known.\n\nThere was an understanding at the time that the Department of Indian Affairs received a grant of the lands for school purposes, and that they might develop a\n\nIndian Affairs.

T. Johnston, Director of Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, Ottawa, was forwarded to you for your information.\n\nThis is a matter which should receive further attention and the Inspector will be authorized to look into this condition when he is in that vicinity.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.

I may say that Mr. Ferrier discussed this with the Very Rev. Father Magan at St. Boniface a few days ago. More information is required before the Department can give intelligent consideration. It is reported that there is a 5 kilowatt dynamo which is overloaded and that a 10 horse power machine is required. Is it possible that a motor is meant and not an electric generator? You might indicate who supplied the 5 kilowatt machine and for what purpose it is used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. Ferremit, O. M.

No estimates of the cost were included because the probable cost of the work depends so largely upon the success met with in lowering the forebay sufficiently to render unwatering a simple and inexpensive feature of the work. When unwatered a thorough examination will definitely reveal the extent of the works necessary. Mr. Atwood was asked to give some estimate as to the probable cost of the work and his reply is as follows:\n\n\"The unwatering of that section of the dam between station 1 + 20 and station 1 + 75 is comparatively simple even at present water elevations and will be inexpensive with forebay elevation at 109. The cost of repairs to this section of the dam should not exceed $250.00.\n\nWith forebay elevation of 109 the unwatering of the log chute is accomplished and the unwatering of the sluiceway is greatly simplified. There is leakage through concrete joints along the spillway and sluiceway sections and this seepage should be stopped. Repairs to this section of the dam should not exceed $300.00, making a total of $600.00 for the job.\n\nThe above mentioned sum of $600.00 estimated to make the repairs outlined may be too low or excessive depending upon circumstances as can only be ascertained upon unwatering. It is assumed that the school authorities will fully cooperate in the work by furnishing transport, securing Indian labor, etc., for which they will be recompensed.\"\n\nIt is noted from your letter of May 7th that the local Indian Agent has been given the necessary authority to carry out the repairs required to this dam on a day labour basis under the supervision of the Reserve principal of the school. If, however, it is found desirable to have some engineering assistance in connection with this work, Mr. Atwood and his staff will be very glad to give any assistance which the Indian Department wish to secure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 3)\nNo person has any right to occupy Crown lands or construct a dam without obtaining (according to Statutes) the necessary permission from the Crown, as represented by this Department. I am assuming that the school authorities acted without the permission of your Department, but as the lands were vested for school purposes only, it is necessary that you be advised that action be taken to clean up the damage which has been done by flooding the shores of the lakes, and also that if it is necessary to maintain and operate a water power to this extent, a lease must be obtained from this Department for such purposes, under the usual terms.\n\nOur Inspector also reports that the method of clearing land in the vicinity of the school has not been carried out very satisfactorily, that instead of culling the timber and making a park near the school, they have cut down all tree-growth, making an unsightly waste, probably in excess of fire protection requirements.\n\nThe land which is now being applied for contains one of the best stands of timber in that vicinity, about 50% Jackpine, and 10% Spruce, and the Inspector was informed that\n\n(J.

The result is that some sixty miles of shore line is being damaged, by reason of the killing of the tree-growth all around the shores, and the drowning of the beaches, rendering the adjacent lands unsuitable for tourist purposes, and destroying the beauty of the lakes.\n\nI may further add that the authorities of the school have constructed a dam at the outlet of Canon Lake, without ever requesting permission or authority from this Department so to do.\n\n(J.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 3)\nJuly 26th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Repairs McIntosh Dam.\n\nI made a personal inspection of the dam at McIntosh about a week ago and as a result have made the necessary arrangements for the repairs to the structure.\n\nBefore repairs can be undertaken it is necessary to draw down the water from the lake above a couple of feet and at the present time Mr. R. E. Wallace, the contractor, is taking out thousands of railway ties from the lakes above the dam and is sluicing them through the dam into Canyon Lake and thence to the railway. Mr. Wallace has requested that we lower the water in the lake before the end of August in order that he may have ample water to float his ties and sluice them through the dam. Rev. Father Perrault, Principal of the McIntosh School, also informs me that he will not be able to secure Indian laborers until about the middle of August, and under the circumstances a start cannot be made on the repairs much before September 1st.\n\nWhile making an inspection of the dam I also made an inspection of the overflow channel to the west. The matter of blocking this channel was referred to you and to the Indian Department a year or so ago when Mr. Craig furnished a plan with suggested means for blocking the overflow on this channel.\n\nWith the water lowered next week the Department will never have a better opportunity to block this channel as cheaply as it can be done when the repairs to the dam are underway. In making an examination of this channel I have devised a much modified scheme to that suggested by Mr. Craig which in my opinion will be quite effective and considerably less. One of the objections to Mr. Craig's scheme was the securing of clay fill for the timber crib at reasonable cost. In my opinion clay fill is not necessary and a cut off can be made by a double row of wood sheeting supported on the ground by a log frame cut from the spruce lying right at the site. I estimate that the cost of the work will be $50.00 for the general laborer for labor or approximately $300.00 altogether, and would like to have the authority of the Department of Indian Affairs to proceed with this work when repairs to the dam are underway.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This delay will also give the Department of Indian Affairs an opportunity to arrive at some agreement with the Ontario government regarding the lake levels and the regulation thereof.\n\nDelaying the repairs to the dam until next spring will not in my opinion cause much inconvenience to the school authorities at Man. The lake levels could for protection purposes be very readily lowered to elevation 110 or 110.5 and still provide plenty of head and water for the operation of the power plant throughout the winter and under the circumstances I would suggest that the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs be obtained to postpone this work until next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

I approve of Mr. Attwood's suggestion and shall be glad of your instructions in this connection.\n\nI am having prepared a statement in regard to this water power development for the information of the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests, as it appears desirable that application should be made to that Department for authorization covering the development and this information with plans of the development will be required for that purpose.

We are further advised that no fish ladder has been installed in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries Act and that the absence of such fish ladder is the cause of conditions which are responsible for the present complaint.\n\nWill you please advise us to the correctness of our information, in so far as it concerns those who were responsible for the construction of the dam and those who are responsible for its present maintenance. We would also like to know whether or not this dam is maintained for the purpose above set forth and if it is absolutely necessary that the same should be maintained.

With particular reference to a fish ladder, I wish to quote from the report of the Assistant District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service:\u2014\n\n\"The dam at the outlet of Forest Lake was built without a fish ladder. However, during the open water seasons of 1927 and 1928, there has been a natural outflow channel from Forest Lake which gives fish free access from Canyon Lake to the lakes above. This channel will probably be closed in the next year or so, but even so, it would not appear necessary to go to the great expense involved in placing a fish ladder in the dam in order to permit suckers to reach the lakes above since there are practically no other fish left in Canyon Lake.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 3)\nOctober 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will remember that on July 4 last you wrote to the Department of Indian Affairs regarding complaints received in your department as to injury alleged to have been caused along the shores of Forest, Whiteley, Indian, Alexander and Boulder lakes due to the construction of a dam by the Department of Indian Affairs at the outlet of Forest lake. This letter was referred to this department for attention and on July 12 I wrote you stating that Mr. Attwood, our District Chief Engineer, at Winnipeg, had been asked to make an investigation of the matter and submit a report. This report, prepared by Mr. Gow and his chief assistant, has been enclosed herewith. This report states that there is no land bordering the lakes in question which is in private ownership and there is only one camp on the lakes affected by the raising of the water level, the owner of which makes no complaint of material injury.\n\nSince receiving this report I have also seen the correspondence between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Department of Lands and Forests at Toronto regarding the purchase of land for the school site and the references made to the development of water-power in connection therewith. Amongst this correspondence there is a letter from Mr. McLean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, dated August 21, 1924, which quotes some extracts from the report prepared by Mr. Attwood at the request of the Indian Department on the proposed scheme for the development of water-power at the outlet of Forest lake. The extracts show that it was intended to raise the level to some extent and so obtain a certain amount of storage to provide a suitable power site. Mr. McLean replied to this letter on September 5th of the same year in which he stated that there seems now to be no reason why a sale of the land referred to should not be carried out to the Indian Department for the purposes of the Indian school, which seems to imply that the scheme proposed in Mr. McLean's letter of August 21 had been sanctioned by your department.\n\nMr. Attwood in further correspondence which we have had with him states that it was his understanding at the time surveys were made that a certain amount of flooding would necessarily be caused by the construction of the dam and his plans were prepared for several feet of storage on all these upper lakes, these being the points referred to in Mr. McLean's letter of August 21, 1924.\n\nMr. L.V. Borko,\nSurveyor-General,\nDepartment of Lands and Forests,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Attwood further writes in regard to this matter -\n\n\"Many years before the school and power plant was built at McIntosh there had existed a dam and log chute at the outlet of Forest lake. This dam raised the level of Forest lake and the adjoining lakes some two or three feet or more above its natural level for the purpose of creating storage and having water available for the log drive and passing the logs from Forest to Canyon lake. In other words this old log dam raised the water level of Forest and adjoining lakes above natural conditions. In building the dam we raised the water very little above the previous levels.\n\nThe power site would be of little or no use without some measure of storage. The storage and lake level now maintained does not damage private property on any of the lakes above and only damages a small fringe of timber at places around the lakes. The school authorities could not afford to clear timber off the flooded area.\n\nThe Indian Department have invested a considerable sum of money at this point for the education and betterment of conditions among the Indians of this region. The Oblate Fathers are running the school and last winter there were about attending between 100 and 125 pupils which were being trained and instructed with the ideals of a better livelihood by the Oblate Fathers. This is a cause that is worthy of support, but I happen to know that there are some few individuals in the district who are trying to raise as many difficulties as they possibly can for the school authorities.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing explanation I think you will agree that the Indian Department in carrying out the power development has acted in good faith and has not gone beyond a reasonable interpretation of the permission given by your department. The power development is necessary for purposes of the school and is not being used in such a way as to materially affect any private interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nSummary of the Negotiations between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests for purchase of McIntosh School Site, from material supplied by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe first communication from the Ontario Government in the correspondence relative to the application by the Indian Department to purchase lands for the McIntosh Indian residential school which mentions the water-power appears to be that of May 10th, 1924 from Mr. W.C. Cain, Deputy Minister of Lands and Forests, in which he states,-\n\n\"If there is a water power located on these lands the question of the development and disposal of this power will require to be considered and such conditions would be made to apply to the same as would seem reasonable.\"\n\nIn a letter of May 19th from Mr. Rorke, Director of Surveys, to Major Robertson, Mr. Rorke says,-\n\n\"Water Powers on Crown lands which will develop 150 horse-power and over are subject to the regulations respecting the disposal of water powers and unless 150 horse-power are dealt with on such terms and conditions as the Minister of Lands and Forests may deem advisable and in any case full information regarding the power is required before an application is considered.\"\n\nFollowing this notification that full information would be required, the Department of Indian Affairs wrote under date August 1st of the same year as follows:-\n\n\"As previously understood it is of course expected that permission will be granted to the Department to use the small water power on the stream connecting Forest and Canyon lakes. The Department of course does not propose any particular development at this point as power is required merely for local use in connection with the school, such as lighting, water supply, pump etc. A report on this power has been made by C.E.

Is it to be presumed that you are in accord with the intention of conveying to this Department the water power which it is necessary to use for our school purposes?\"\n\nIt appears that no reply was made to this letter.

The site selected bordered on Forest and Canyon lakes on provincial Crown lands. Application was made to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests for the lands selected, and after some exchange of correspondence, an area of about 350 acres was sold to the Department of Indian Affairs under authority of an order of the Executive Council dated October 2nd, 1924.\n\nOne of the chief reasons for the selection of the site chosen was the existence of a natural water-power due to the difference in level between Forest and Canyon lakes. The Mission authorities were most anxious to have this water-power used to supply the electric energy needed at the school for lighting, pumping water and general purposes and the Indian Department agreed to pay for the cost of developing the power so as to provide a dependable supply which could be readily maintained and operated by the school authorities.\n\nIn order to carry out the development, the Indian Department requested the Director of Water Power and Reclamation of the Department of the Interior to have surveys made and plans and specifications prepared to determine the extent of the power and the best method of development. This was accordingly done, the plans submitted were approved and work was begun in November 1924, but owing to the difficulty of constructing the concrete dam in winter and to other unavoidable delays, the development was not completed until June 1926.\n\nThe intention of the Indian Department to develop this power site was communicated to the Department of Lands and Forests and the method of development by which it was proposed to raise the natural level of Forest lake about three feet in order to maintain a dependable flow of 25 c.f.s. was described by Mr. J.D. McLean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary of the Indian Department, in his letter of August 21st, 1924 to the Deputy Minister of Lands and Forests.\n\nNo objection was taken by the Department of Lands and Forests to this proposal and the development was carried out in good faith by the Indian Department solely for the benefit of the Indian schools. As was pointed out by the District Chief Engineer of the...\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service in submitting his report on the proposed development, a fuel generating plant giving an equal amount of power could have been installed at much less cost, and the water-power development was decided upon only on account of the urgent requests of the Mission authorities.\n\nDescription of Development.\n\nThe water-power development at the McIntosh Indian school is situated on the short stretch of river separating Forest and Canyon lakes, the natural head available being about 11 or 12 feet. During earlier years a timber and rock dam was built across the outlet of Forest lake to assist in lumbering operations by raising the lake level, and the dam is in Forest lake and the connecting lakes above it has thus been raised above the natural level at intervals for a number of years past.\n\nIn the plan of development as carried out, the assumed natural high water level of Forest lake was raised a maximum of 2.5 feet, partly to obtain storage to give a continuous supply of water to the reservoir, also to obtain a sufficient depth of water at the intake to the penstock and so avoid expensive rock excavation which would otherwise be necessary to ensure a seal at the intake structure. The maximum head available is about 17 feet, the minimum 14 and the power available is 33 horse-power.\n\nThe works as constructed consist of a concrete dam about 10 feet high at the highest part and 330 feet long on rock foundation with spillway and non-overflow section, the latter containing an opening for a log chute and a sluiceway for discharging flood waters; intake works, wood slave penstock 3 feet diameter, and 312 feet long, power house 20 X 25 feet with workshop above, and tailrace, details as shown on the accompanying plans.\n\nThe machinery in the power house consists of a single horizontal turbine, 30 B.H.P. under 15 feet head at 450 R.P.M. with Woodward governor supplied by Boving Hydraulic and Engineering Company of Lindsay, Ontario; D.C. generator, 17\u00bd K.W. belt driven from turbine supplied by Lincoln Electric Company of Toronto, Ontario; switchboard and accessories.\nWater Power Development at the\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ontario\n\nHistory of Development.\n\nIn 1924 the Department of Indian Affairs decided to erect a residential school for Indian boys near McIntosh, Ontario, the school was completed to be conducted by the Roman Catholic Mission for Eastern Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario.

Regarding the letter of July 4, 1928 a reply was sent from this Department to Mr. Rorke dated October 6th, 1928, copy attached marked C hereunder, which was intended to meet the questions raised at that time, and the summary marked B deals more particularly with the correspondence, copies of which have been received from the Indian Department.\n\nIt is assumed, however, that the Indian Department, having made its position clear, will be quite ready now to supply any available information which may be requested by the Department of Lands and Forests and to\n\nMr. J.D.

M.\n\nWith reference to letter dated 24th July last from the Surveyor General and Deputy Minister, provincial Department of Surveys, please see letter of Sept. 9th from the Director of Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service.\n\nI would suggest that the next step to be taken is for this Department to make application to the Province for official authorization covering the water power development of the McIntosh school. It would be well, in making this application, to endeavour to placate the provincial officials somewhat by pointing out that the Department acted in good faith in proceeding with this development, as it considered that the correspondence between the provincial Department of Lands and Forests and this Department was tantamount to permission for the development of the power, inasmuch as the power which could be developed at this point was very much below 150 horse power.\n\nThe Province no doubt on receipt of this official application will at once reply stating upon what conditions the authorization will be granted. These conditions will, in all probability, involve flooding damage claims. On receipt of these conditions the Department will then be in a position to enter into final negotiations with the Province as to the fulfilment and the payment for any damages which may be proved to have been caused, as it will undoubtedly be necessary for the two Departments to come to an agreement on this subject.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Upon compliance with the foregoing regulations and upon approval of the application by the Minister in writing he may order a lease of the water privilege to be issued to the applicant upon such terms and conditions and at such rental as may be fixed by the Minister. The rental reserved by any such lease or any renewal thereof shall be payable yearly in advance.\n\n9. No such lease shall be granted for a longer term than twenty years, but the lessee shall have the right of renewal of such lease for two further and successive terms of ten years each upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon or may be fixed by the Minister.\n\n10. The right of timber owners and others to drive their logs or timber down any river, stream or other body of water, as now by law established, shall not be interfered with, lessened or restricted by the granting of any such lease; and if any dam, weir or other structure is erected or built in connection with the development of any such privilege, within the object, intention or effect of damaging the water or impeding the flow thereof, full and proper provision, as now by law required, shall be made by the lessee for the safe and convenient passage of logs and timber over and through the same.\n\n11. The lessee under any such lease shall not destroy or obstruct the navigation of any river, stream or body of water.\npreviously navigable; but shall provide such locks, canals, passages and other means as may be necessary for the proper and safe surmounting or passing of any dam, weir or other work made or erected by the lessee, and as may be required for purposes of navigation by the Government of Canada.\n\n12. In addition to any other conditions or provisions required by the Minister, the lease shall contain conditions and provisions to the following effect:\n\n(a) Requiring the development and use within a period or periods to be named in the lease of a specified quantity or quantities of power or energy, estimated in horse power.\n\n(b) If the quantity of power required by the lessee to be developed within a period or periods therein named is less than the full capacity of the said privilege, upon report being made by the said Hydro-Electric Power Commission to that effect, and also that there is a bona fide demand for power which can be supplied therefrom, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may, by Order-in-Council, require the lessee to develop the said privilege to its full capacity or to such other extent as he may deem proper or requisite within a period or periods of time to be named in the said Order.\n\n(c) For the use by other parties than the lessee of surplus or unused water or power not required by him for the purposes of his business, plant or manufactory, on such terms as may be agreed upon.\n\n(d) Failing an agreement between the parties concerned as to the rates or conditions for supplying power by the lessee to any person, company or corporation, or by any person, company or corporation receiving power from the lessee, and any other person, company or corporation, either party may submit the matter to the said Power Commission, and any Order made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council upon report thereon by the said Power Commission fixing and determining the said rates and conditions shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties concerned.\n\n(e) In case of submission to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission as in Paragraph \"(d)\" herein mentioned, the said lessee on being so required by the said Commission shall produce all books, accounts, records and statements verified by affidavit, showing the cost of constructing, equipping and maintaining the works for the development of the said privilege and delivering the power therefrom.\n\n(f) Upon complaint in writing being made that any municipal corporation is granting bonuses by supplying power, light or heat below cost to manufacturers or others, whether the said corporation is in possession of a water privilege or is receiving power therefrom from or through such lessee, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may refer the matter to the said Hydro-Electric Power Commission, who may dispose of the same in manner provided by Chapter 15 of the Ontario Statutes of 1906, or any amendment thereto.\n\n(g) For the purpose of ascertaining the quantity of power actually developed or capable of development from any water privilege, or the amount of rental payable under a lease thereof, the said Power Commission, or any engineer appointed by it for that purpose, shall have free access to all parts of the works and all books, plans or records bearing on the quantity of power, and may make measurements, take observations etc., and any calculation as to the quantity of power so developed or capable of development made by the said Commission or by such engineer shall be binding upon the lessee.\n\n(h) The power and authority to acquire water powers and works by purchase, lease or otherwise, or without the consent of the owner thereof conferred upon the said Power Commission by Chapter 15 of the Statutes of Ontario of 1906, shall be exercisable by the said Power Commission in respect of any water power leased under these regulations or any works connected therewith.\n\n(i) During the construction of the works for the development of any water power, the said Power Commission or any engineer appointed by it for that purpose shall have free access to all parts of the works for the purpose of inspecting the same and of ascertaining that the construction thereof is in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the said Power Commission.\n\n(j) For the erection and maintenance by the lessee of a durable and efficient fishway when so required by the proper officer or authority in that behalf.\n\n(k) During the continuance of the lease, the lessee shall keep and maintain all dams, weirs, tunnels, races, flumes, sluices, pits and other structures and works necessary for the development and use of such privilege in good repair and condition, and shall not wilfully or otherwise injure or destroy the same or any part thereof, but at the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, shall leave all such structures and works in good repair and condition, reasonable use and wear thereof and damage by fire and tempest only excepted, and so that their subsequent usefulness shall not be lessened by any act of the said lessee.\n\n(l) At the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, the water privilege shall revert to and become the property of the Crown as fully as if no such lease had been granted together with all dams, weirs, tunnels, races, flumes, sluices, pits and other structures and works made or erected by the lessee in connection therewith, and all buildings erected on land covered by the lease, but the lessee shall be allowed a reasonable time to be fixed by the Minister in which to remove all machinery employed by him in the development and use of the privilege, failing which removal, such machinery shall become the property of the Crown. Provided that where any such buildings or structures are of a permanent\ncharacter and necessary or useful for the proper development or utilization of the water privilege, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may upon report in that behalf by the said Hydro-Electric Power Commission pay the lessee by way of compensation therefor and purchase thereof such sum or sums as he may deem proper upon the same being appropriated for the purpose by the Legislative Assembly of the Province.\n\n(m) The lease shall at all times be subject to any general regulations thereafter made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council affecting the construction and operation of works for the development of water privileges or the supply of water therefrom.\n\n13. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may cancel any water power lease issued under these regulations for non-payment of rental within 90 days after the same is due and payable, whether the same shall have been demanded or not, or for failure by the said Power Commission to perform the conditions as to construction of the works for the development or supply of power have not been complied with, or that at any time after the water privilege has been developed, either in whole or to the extent to which the lessee is bound or required to develop the same, the lessee has continuously failed or neglected for the space of one year effectually to develop and maintain the said privilege, either for his own use or that of other persons, unless hindered by unavoidable accident, or that the lessee has failed or neglected to comply with any of the conditions of the lease or any Order-in-Council respecting any matter or thing arising under the lease concerning which an Order is made; and publication of any Order-in-Council cancelling such lease shall be deemed proof that the same has been duly and lawfully cancelled. Provided due notice shall be given a lessee before such cancellation in order that he may have an opportunity of being heard, should he so desire.\n\n14. Where a water privilege is applied for by a municipal corporation for the purpose of supplying water, power, light or heat for the use of the inhabitants of the said municipality, the Minister may issue a lease of said privilege to such corporation if otherwise entitled to receive and hold the same under special terms and conditions as may be recommended by the said Power Commission, and at such rental as he may deem proper.\n\n15. The word \"Minister\" in these regulations shall mean the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines or any Minister of the Crown personating the offices of the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines in his absence or during a vacancy in that office; and the Minister may refer to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario any application for the leasing of any water privilege or any matter arising out of such application or any lease made in pursuance thereof, whether hereafter or heretofore issued, for consideration, investigation and report.\n\n16. No water power lease shall be valid or effective unless the same is issued under the Great Seal of the Province, and is signed by the said Minister.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Water Power McIntosh Indian School.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd inst., in further reference to the water power which has been developed at McIntosh, at the Indian School.\n\nI am enclosing you the Regulations regarding the leasing of water power, which gives you the information required to fully consider the matter.\n\nIn addition to the lease which will issue covering the power plant, it will be necessary to file plans of survey, shewing the extent to which the shores of the lakes have been flooded, and an annual rental will require to be paid on this flooded area, as well as paying for all commercial timber which has been damaged, and the clearing of the same, so that the shores of the lake will not be destroyed, from a tourist point of view.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSurveyor-General\nDeputy Minister\n\nJ.

Rorke, Surveyor General and Deputy Minister, Department of Surveys, regarding unlicensed development of the water power for the McIntosh Indian school between Canyon and Forest lakes, it was tentatively agreed, subject to confirmation by the heads of the Departments interested.\n\n(1) This Department would be willing to pay the annual rental demanded of $1.00 per horse power for the power development, which at the present development of power available of 25 horse power is equivalent to $23.00 per year.\n\n(2) This Department admits its liability to compensation for the flooded lands, the provincial rate for which is an annual rental of 10\u00a2 per acre.\n\n(3) This Department is also liable for timber dues on timber damaged by the flooding.\n\n(4) It is the responsibility of this Department to provide by survey or other means data which will enable a calculation to be made of the extent of the lands flooded.\n\n(5) The Province to permit the Department to have a reasonable number of years to arrange for the removal of the timber and undue stress is not to be made on the removal of the very small stuff and this will particularly apply towards the upper ends of the lakes affected and the Province will not demand that the timber be cut to a ground stump but will be satisfied for it to be removed during the winter by cutting it as closely as practicable to the ice level. Underbrush and stuff which is not suitable for putting into use is to be disposed of in such a manner as will not permit it to be turned into floatage in the lakes and streams, but such of it as is in proper condition for so disposing is...\nto be piled on the ice and burned before break up; the remainder to be piled on the land and as soon as it is sufficiently dry to be burned in such a manner and under such supervision as will not endanger forest growth.\n\nIn discussion as to the nature of the survey which would be required to supply the information in article numbered 4 above, I first succeeded in getting Mr. Rorke to agree that his Department would not insist on an actual survey of the present water line but that a traverse of the exterior line of flooded vegetation, with occasional offsets to the line of the present water level would be considered sufficiently accurate to estimate the acreage of flooded lands. After further discussion, Mr. Rorke agreed that as his Department would not require a very strict accuracy in the calculation of the area flooded but that a reasonable approximation would be satisfactory, he conceded that if sufficient information could be obtained from aerial photographs, no other survey would be required. Finally it was agreed that should sufficient information not be obtained from the aerial photographs, it would be considered satisfactory for a surveyor appointed by the Province to be accompanied by a representative appointed by this Department, to cruise the shore line of the flooded area, and by means of hand level information obtained on this cruise to prepare sketches which would enable an estimate to be made of the flooded area, the expense of this to be borne by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt will be seen that Mr. Rorke was very reasonable in making these concessions, and it is considered that his Department could have insisted on a traverse along the line of the present water level which I am quite sure would cost the Department over $2000.00. His concession in agreeing to a winter traverse on the ice, with offsets, would reduce this cost to approximately $1000.00. The cost of the cruise finally agreed upon will probably not be in excess of $500.00 and should the aerial photographs, copies of which I am now obtaining from the Civil Government Air Operations Branch, contain sufficient information to convince Mr. Rorke that further survey is unnecessary, we will of course escape any expenditure in this connection, other than the cost of the prints which will be about $2.00.\nof the district which were taken in June 1928 support the contention of this Department that the banks of the lakes and streams in the area affected are for the most part of a steep or rocky nature and as a result, except in a few localities, the construction of this dam has affected only a few feet in width of the shore line, that a sufficiently accurate estimate could be obtained by having the district carefully cruised by an Ontario Land Surveyor. It was considered that this surveyor could make a sufficiently accurate estimate by means of sketches estimating the average width, amplified in any places where the areas flooded are of considerable extent by measured offsets and such hand level information as might be considered necessary, it being considered that a continuous chained or transit survey was unnecessary under the circumstances.\n\nIt is further understood that you suggest that this cruise will be performed by an Ontario Land Surveyor appointed by you, accompanied by a surveyor or engineer appointed by this Department and that this Department will defray the expense in connection with this cruise. On further consideration, this Department is not only willing to accept these conditions but is willing to accept the results of such cruise made by the Ontario Land Surveyor appointed by you and acting under your instructions without appointing a departmental representative to accompany him.\n\nIn connection with the discussion of the subject matter of Condition 5, it is understood that this Department expects to have a number of years in which to remove the timber from the flooded area and that your Department will assist its removal during the winter season and will impose convenient conditions as possible in connection with the raising of the stumps and brush removal.\n\nAs it is understood that a considerable portion of the area is in a district which your Department has not as yet surveyed, I am forwarding for your information and use in connection with the proposed cruise six blueprints of the outline of the lakes affected, on a scale of 40 chains to the mile, as obtained by an aerial survey in June 1928. Should it be necessary, I could also arrange to supply you with copies of the aerial photographs of that district which Mr. Watson has already shown you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAct. Assistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThe heaviest items of expense in connection with the settlement of this matter are the clearing of timber from the flooded lands and the cost of survey. The survey cost has been reduced as above mentioned and the arrangement in Article No.5 could be utilized to reduce the cost of clearing to a minimum as a result of obtaining the concession that the Province would not insist on immediate clearance but would allow a considerable number of years for its completion. As the school will require firewood, I thought that a policy could be adopted to instruct the school authorities each winter to obtain their firewood requirements from the flooded area until it has been cleared to the satisfaction of the Province, and I would recommend that instructions be immediately given to the school authorities to follow this programme, commencing their cutting at a point nearest the dam and working up both shore lines.\n\nChief Surveyor\n\nIndian Affairs.

Payment is to be made by this Department of an annual rental of $1.00 per horse power, based on maximum horse power available under present development.\n\n2. This Department admits its liability to compensate the Province for the lands flooded as a result of the raising of the water level above the high water mark.\n\n3. This Department is also liable to the Province for timber dues on such timber as lies within the flooded area.\n\n4.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nRe McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nAs I discussed with you personally, both here and in Ottawa last year, repairs are required to the edge of the sluiceway section of the dam at McIntosh. It was our intention to have this repaired last year but owing to the difficulties which might have been encountered with one Mr. Wallace, a lumberman operating on the lakes above, and having in mind that your Department had the matter of obtaining a license or authorization for this development up with the Ontario government, the matter of repairs was left over until next spring.\n\nMr. Wallace is cutting about 100,000 railway ties along the lakes above the dam and will doubtless close the dam at the time of the spring break-up in order to raise the level of the lakes to facilitate the running of his ties into West Lake. It is almost a certainty that there has been increased deterioration of the concrete in the vicinity of the sluiceway and log chute during the present winter. Any increased head against the structure might endanger the whole dam so it is very essential that Mr. Wallace be prevented from accomplishing his purpose.\n\nTo carry out the repair work to the dam it is probably essential to obtain the license for this development between now and spring. If this is not obtainable between now and spring it is necessary to secure authority to make such repairs as are necessary to ensure stability of the structure and such authority should include such measures as are necessary to prevent any interference from Mr. Wallace in the successful carrying out of the work.\n\nI would point out that if authorized I would have the repair work commenced and completed soon after the spring break-up so that a considerable portion of the early summer run-off could be conserved. This policy would ensure to Mr. Wallace ample water for his operations as I understand he does not wish to pass ties through the dam before July 1st. He has however shown no inclination to cooperate with the authorities at the school, but to the contrary he has at times sent a gang of employees to the dam and closed the sluiceway over the protest of the Principal of the school, and doubtless will do so again unless prevented.\n\nR. B. Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWhile in Ottawa in December I discussed this matter of the development at McIntosh with Major Robertson, of your department, and Mr. L. V. Rorke. Major Robertson I believe has the matter well in hand, but in the event that a license for this development is not obtained before the spring break-up, it would be suggested if Major Robertson could take some correspondence with Mr. Rorke, the Ontario officer in charge of logging operations, that would ensure this work being carried out without any undue annoyance from Mr. Wallace.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

It is likely at the same time a timber estimator will go along and report on the commercial timber of the flooded area. This inspection will be made at an early convenience.\n\nIt seems to me that next month will probably be a good time to do the work on the ice, and I will advise you when the surveyor is instructed to make this inspection and report.\n\n(A.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nChairman, Tourist Fish & Game Committee,\nKenora Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA short petition has just been drafted and will be mailed to you in due course, in connection with the blocking of the waterway between Little Forest Lake and the South Bay of Canyon Lake near McIntosh, Ontario, at a point where the Indian School is erected. When this dam was constructed a few years ago, no provision was made to take care of the game fish in these lakes, during spawning seasons, with the result that many of them travel to this dam in the spawning season and being unable to get through from one body of water to the other, are either caught by Indians or natives or die in the attempt to get through. At the present time, it is understood that an application is before the Department, presumably from the Indian Department at Ottawa, requesting that repairs be made to the present dam. Would it not be an opportune time to have a fish ladder erected over or through this dam or a satisfactory runway made through, so that fish could navigate the stream at all times, but more especially during the spawning season.\n\nThen there is the question of a right-of-way across this Portage. I would like to point out that this is the only portage connecting Canyon Lake with Forest, Whitney, Edwards Bladder, Boulder and Little Boulder lakes to the sougah and as matters are at present, we are looked on as trespassers by the Indian School authorities, when we travel over this Portage, therefore, I would suggest that you take the matter up with the proper authorities and arrange if possible, for the Government to reserve a strip of land along the creek on the South side, to be used by Lumbermen, Tourists, etc., in travelling between the lakes herein referred to.\n\nSeveral Inspectors have been shown this situation when at McIntosh but to date nothing has been done that would help to conserve the fish in these lakes. If there is any further information required by you do not hesitate to communicate with the writer. Trusting this matter will have your earnest attention and that we will hear favorably from you in the near future, I am.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) A. W. Lewis.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I understand this matter was taken up some time ago with the Dominion Water Power Branch, Winnipeg, by the Department of Game and Fisheries of Ontario and that something had to be done. Mr. Lewis also writes re a right-of-way crossing the portage over school property. I do not think the Principal of the school should have any objection or even could stop people using this portage. However, I am writing him and do not think there will be any trouble in this connection.\n\nI presume the Department has taken up the matter of the hole in the dam with the Dominion Water Power Branch. This should be done before the high water of the Spring, otherwise the whole might get larger.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc. 1.\nOttawa, 18th February 1950\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is arranging for an Ontario Land Surveyor, Mr. C.R. Kenny, Sault Ste. Marie, to proceed to McIntosh at an early date for the purpose of estimating the extent of the lands flooded as a result of the construction of the Departmental dam at the outlet of Forest Lake.\n\nI have to request you to be good enough to provide quarters for him while he is on this work and to give him assistance in obtaining such labour as he may require and any other assistance which you may be able to give him in connection with the performance of his work. You will be advised later when Mr. Kenny expects to arrive at McIntosh and commence the work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C.

Kenny, which accompanied your letter of the 11th instant and I may say it is not considered that Mr. Kenny will require to have anything added to these in order for him to properly carry out the work.\n\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter sent this day to the Rev. C. Perreault, Principal of the Indian Residential School at McIntosh.\n\nIt is noted in your letter of the 3rd instant that it is your intention that the lease to the Department for the water power development at this point will issue dated from the 1st May 1929 and I have to advise you that this is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI may state that it has been found that certain repairs are required to the edge of the sluiceway section of the dam and in order to prevent any further deterioration to the concrete in the vicinity of the sluiceway and log chute thereby endangering the whole dam, it is imperative that these repairs be made this Spring. To do this it should be commenced and completed as soon as possible after the Spring break up so that a considerable portion of the summer run-off would be conserved. As it is possible that Mr. Kenny's report may not be received soon enough to ensure licence having been issued prior to the time when it is necessary to make arrangements for these repairs, insomuch as licence is to date from the 1st May 1929, and in order that the Department may not be taking any further unauthorized steps in connection with this development, may I request you to be good enough to give the Department authority to make such repairs as are necessary to ensure stability of the structure. This authority of course granting the Department permission to keep the water level lowered during the period of repair.\n\nL.V.

Barke Esq., O.L.S.,\nSurveyor General,\nDeputy Minister,\nPARLIAMENT BUILDINGS,\nTORONTO, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nFollowing your instructions dated February 10th 1930 to make an inspection and report in reference to the lake shores affected by water power development at the Indian School near McIntosh, Ontario, I beg to state that I left Sault Ste. Marie on March 1st, and arrived at McIntosh the following day.\n\nTo save time and long walks I had with me a light camp equipment for 3 men to travel the lakes, and acquired the services of an Indian at McIntosh to assist me in packing this outfit on a toboggan. On the evening of March 3rd the Crown Timber cruiser overtook me on Boulder Lake.\n\nNear the Indian School I found a dam of concrete construction, having a length of about 300 feet, which included a spillway at the South end, 45 feet long. The crest of the dam above present water level is 4.5 feet, and the top of the spillway measures 2.5 feet above present water level. Almost adjacent to the North end of the spillway is a gate 8 feet in width, and a few feet North of gate is a log sluice 5 feet in width. Following Northerly along dam from log sluice is a penstock opening, 3 feet in diameter. The end of penstock at head of dam is bedded one foot below surface rock, leaving the top of penstock one foot below the present water level. The depth of water about the gate, sluiceway and penstock is 3 feet.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo arrive at a height of mean flood level that this dam has made from the date of operation, I believe that it was necessary to observe the present water level conditions of lakes in this vicinity, other than those affected by damming. While travelling on the railway to McIntosh I saw many lakes, and it appeared to me that the present water level was from 3 to 4 feet below high water mark. This condition is similar or Canon Lake which takes its waters at the dam from Forest Lake. The high water mark on Canon Lake, which could be seen distinctly in many places, measures 3.5 feet above present water level.\n\nThe lakes affected by the dam are, Forest, Whitney, Edward, Alexandra, Bladder and Boulder; also a creek which drains Moose Lake and flows in an Easterly direction for a distance of about 2 miles to Bladder Lake.\n\nAt a point on Forest Lake, about half a mile Westerly from the dam, is a rapid, and I am told on good authority that this rapid had a fall of one foot before dam construction. The dam at present is holding back water to barely flood this rapid out, although there still remains a noticeable current here.\n\nAlong the Northerly shore of Forest Lake, a distance of about half a mile, from the dam, a by-pass was noted, having a width of about 8 chains. If water was raised another foot above its present level it would make its way to Canon Lake.\n\nTaking into consideration the length and height of the spillway, and the slow gradual rise of cleared land at the end of the spillway, together with the by-pass to Canon Lake, I doubt very much if the dam could hold back water to its total height of 4.5 feet above the present water level.\nWhile travelling the lakes in question, I worked on a 5 foot contour, but was unable to find any traces of tree destruction caused from floods at this elevation. Any tree destruction was found at an elevation of 3.5 feet above present water level, which elevation corresponds with the high water mark of these lakes.\n\nNoted on my plan which accompanies this report are flooded areas due to the effect of high water periods. These areas are swamps and of no agricultural value.\n\nThe blue line indicated on plan is a contour 3.5 feet above present water level, and along this contour very little destroyed timber from flooding was found. In a distance of about 60 miles of shore line there would not be more than 500 cords of pulpwood, and some red pine, and cord-wood.\n\nMy opinion is, that without the dam the timber along the beaches and around the inner edges of the swamps, would be affected by spring floods, and that this natural condition would not as a rule, kill tree growth, but if water is held by damming, and becomes warmed, it has a tendency to affect the bark by scalding and therefore kills the tree. Flooding of timber in the late fall of the year and water freezing about the tree will also prove disastrous to tree growth.\n\nThe present water level conditions of the lakes and at the dam appear to be of sufficient volume to operate the power system for the Indian School, but for logging purposes more water may be required.\n\nAbout 50 per cent of the shore line of these waters is high bare rock the balance consists of clay and sand shores, and along this in many places, there would be an area equal to about 24 acres affected, together with an area of 399 acres of low lying...\nland, making a total area of approximately 423 (four hundred and twenty-three) acres of land affected by the holding of water at the dam above a height of natural water conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nO.L. Surveyor.\nToronto, March 25, 1930\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: McIntosh Power Development.\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of Ontario Land Surveyor Kenny's report on his examination of ground areas around the lakes at McIntosh. I also forward you a copy of his account amounting to $273.79, which is being paid by this Department, pending reimbursement from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI also enclose a statement of dues on the timber damaged around the shores of the Lake, from the Woods and Forests Branch of this Department.\n\nYou will note that lands flooded by reason of the dam at McIntosh School, above the natural high water mark, is some - 425 acres.

Intosh Ontario. I beg to state that I left Sault Ste Marie on March 1st, and arrived at Mo.

Until we have completed our repairs at the dam under protection of our lease and license of occupation, I think it would be most undesirable to further go against the wishes of the provincial authorities, inasmuch as our irregular action in establishing this dam without official permit has caused the provincial authorities considerable annoyance resulting from complaints of summer residents in the district.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, April 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with enclosure, with reference to the flooding caused by the dam at the Malteek Indian Residential School, and the necessity for clearing the flooded area at the rate of approximately 20 acres per winter. The Department is glad to have your communication and it will be timely to use the information therein at a later date. At the present time, it is desired that the instructions of April third to the Rev. Principal be complied with faithfully. You might state that we have now abandoned the former idea and the license of occupation of the flooded land, and it will not be advisable to now ask the Provincial authorities for reconsideration.\n\nYou might inform the Principal that the Department is not holding the school authorities alone responsible for the work that is to be done in the flooded area. We believe that the school is benefiting largely by the development of power and can use the wood for domestic fuel. However, I indicated in the penultimate paragraph of my letter that when the flooded area distant from the school is being cleaned, the Department might favourably consider a small grant to assist in the work.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this letter, for you to forward to the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I may say that, three years ago, the Provincial Game and Fisheries Department asked that we consider the erection of a fish-way, or ladder. The Department asked the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, which had built the dam, for a report. The expense would be between $1,500 and $2,000; and, as very few use the upper lakes which were affected and as there was a seasonal natural spillway, I did not think favourable consideration should be given. It was further reported that there had been very poor fishing in the upper lakes for some years, previous to the construction at the Indian School.\n\nI gave this information to the Provincial Department of Game and Fisheries and, in September, last, the Deputy Minister promised to communicate with me if the expense of constructing a fish ladder was necessary, but I have heard nothing further from him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

E. Wallace in the construction of a coffer dam at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will forward to this Department a copy of the agreement with Mr. E. E. Wallace for the carrying out of this work. When this is received, consideration will be given to payment of the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 5th of September, 1929, your file 130-7-16, with reference to the dam at Canyon Lake, McIntosh, and the suggested inclusion of a fish-way therein, I would advise that we have now received the following report from our Seasonal Biologists in this connection:\n\n\"We understand that in 1925 and in the succeeding years many pike, pickerel and muskellunge tried to ascend the river but were unable to do so because of the presence of the dam. As a consequence many of these fish got stranded on the rocks and died. Since 1925 the number of fish coming up to the dam each year is said to have diminished greatly. Moreover, fishing is said to have become much poorer during the same period and hence we are of the opinion that this dam is having a very detrimental effect on fish migration and consequently on all the other phases of fish life which that involves.\n\nWe recommend that a fishway be constructed at the earliest possible date and in our opinion a fishway could best be constructed in this location by blasting a channel through the rock, over which the water now spreads, to a point a short distance below the dam. From there a short fishway might be constructed. There would appear to be sufficient water for such purposes even in a dry season such as the present one.\n\nIt is the opinion of this Department that these recommendations are reasonable and that the suggestions made in regard to the fishway are logical, and we trust that some steps will be taken by your Department as soon as possible with a view to giving effect to these recommendations.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nJE/LT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\nOttawa, August 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 40103 W R of September 22nd, 1927, enclosing Mr. Craig's report - forwarded by Mr. Atwood - with reference to a fish ladder at the McIntosh Indian Reserve. Some time ago I made a recommendation if a fish ladder was necessary involved over $1,600 but I stated that it was possible the Ontario Department of Fisheries could suggest a cheaper installation and that, in any case, it would be advisable that the type of fish ladder be approved by the Ontario officials.\n\nIn view of the expense and the last paragraph of Mr. Sew's report of August 8, 1928, forwarded under cover of your 40103 of August 14th of that year, the Department took no action. The question has been raised on two or three occasions since and I am now in receipt of a letter from the Deputy Minister of the Game and Fisheries Department, Toronto. He quotes from a report of their Seasonal Sidelines. It is claimed that the dam is having a very detrimental effect on fish migration, and it is recommended that a fish-way be constructed at the earliest possible date. The report goes on to state: \"In our opinion, a fish-way could best be constructed in this location by blasting a channel through the rock, over which the water now spreads to a point a short distance below the dam. For there a short fish-way might be constructed. There would appear to be sufficient water for such purposes, even in a dry season such as the present one.\"\n\nMr. MacDonald, the Deputy Minister, is of the opinion that this recommendation is reasonable and he asks our Department to take the necessary steps.\n\nWould you please let the Department have a report on the cost of this proposal and indicate if you could arrange to have a fish ladder, as suggested, constructed. I concur in the earlier recommendation of your officer, that the Ontario authorities should approve of the type of ladder before construction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The Fisheries Act, chapter seventy-three of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is amended by adding to section two thereof the following paragraphs:\u2014\n\n\"(d) \"fishing vessel\" includes any ship or boat, or any other description of vessel used in fishing.\n\n(e) \"Canadian\" means a British subject resident in Canada.\n\n2. Section seven of the said Act is amended by inserting after the word \"may\" in the first line thereof the following words:\u2014\"in his absolute discretion,\"\n\n3. The said Act is further amended by inserting the following section immediately after section eight thereof:\u2014\n\n\"S.A. The Minister may cancel any license issued under the authority of this Act, if it has been ascertained by the report of a commissioner appointed under the provisions of the Inquiries Act, chapter ninety-nine of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, that the operations under such license are not conducted in conformity with law.\"\n\n4. Section twenty-eight of the said Act is repealed and the following is substituted therefor:\u2014\n\n\"28. (1) No one shall maintain a pound or enclosure in which lobsters, legally caught during the open season, shall be retained for sale during the close season at a place where the pound or enclosure is located, or for export therefrom, except under a license from the Minister, and no lobsters shall be taken from any such pound or enclosure, and disposed of outside the close season at the place where it is located, except under a certificate from a fishery officer, setting forth the pound from which the lobsters were taken and that they had been legally caught during the open season.\"\n(2) Each such pound or enclosure shall be marked with the name of the licensee and the number of his license. Such marking shall be in black on a white ground, and the letters and figures shall be at least six inches in height.\n\n(3) The annual fee for such license shall be seventy-five dollars.\"\n\n5. Section forty-six of the said Act is amended by adding to subsection one thereof the following paragraphs:\u2014\n\n\"(h) to prescribe the size or sizes of containers in which oysters may be sold, and how such containers shall be marked;\n\n(i) to provide for the grading and inspection of oysters;\n\n(j) to prescribe how incorrectly marked containers of oysters shall be re-marked and dealt with.\"\n\n6. Section forty-six of the said Act is further amended by repealing subsection two thereof and substituting the following subsection therefor:\u2014\n\n\"(2) Such regulations shall take effect from the date of the publication thereof in the Canada Gazette or from the date specified for such purpose in such regulations, and such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if enacted herein, notwithstanding that such regulations extend, vary or alter any of the provisions of this Act respecting the planting and modes of fishing: Provided that any regulation made under the provisions of paragraph (g) shall take effect at the expiration of six months from the date of its publication in the Canada Gazette.\"\n\n7. The said Act is further amended by inserting the following section immediately after section sixty-nine thereof:\u2014\n\n\"69A. (1) Every person shall be guilty of an offence, and shall incur therefor a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars and not more than two thousand dollars, recoverable with costs upon summary conviction, who at any time holds a license from the Minister,\u2014\n\n(a) with intent to fish or to cause any other person to fish with a vessel that uses an 'otter' or other trawl of a similar nature for catching fish in the sea, leaves or departs from any port or place in Canada for the purpose of such fishing; or\n\n(b) knowingly brings into Canada any fish taken or caught in the sea beyond the territorial waters of Canada with any vessel that uses an 'otter' or other trawl of a similar nature, or any vessel that uses an 'otter' or other trawl of a similar nature for catching fish in the sea beyond the territorial waters of Canada, if the leaving or departure from Canada of such vessel...\"\nconstituted an offence under this section, and moreover the fish or vessel so brought in shall be confiscated to His Majesty for violation of this Act, in the manner provided by section eighty-two of this Act.\n\n\"(2) No such vessel shall carry on fishing operations from or to any Canadian port or ports, unless such vessel is registered as a British ship in Canada and is owned by a Canadian or by a body corporate incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada or of one of the Provinces thereof, and having its principal place of business in Canada.\n\n\"(3) No such vessel shall carry on fishing operations from or to any Canadian port or ports, unless it restricts its fishing operations to waters that are at least twelve miles distant from the nearest point on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The proof that such fishing operations are so restricted shall at all times lie on the Captain of the vessel: Provided that this subsection shall not apply to small dragger operated by inshore fishermen if exempted from the provisions of this subsection by special permit which the Minister is hereby authorized to issue for that purpose.\n\n\"(4) The Minister may determine the number of such vessels that shall be eligible to be licensed.\n\n\"(5) Regulations may be made under the provisions of section forty-eight of this Act,\n\n(a) describing the form of license;\n\n(b) specifying the evidence to be submitted with an application for a license;\n\n(c) fixing the conditions under which a license shall be issued;\n\n(d) making any other provisions respecting licenses.\n\n\"(6) The burden of proving absence of intent or knowledge, when intent or knowledge is necessary to constitute an offence under this section, shall lie upon the person accused, and intent or knowledge shall be presumed unless negatived by proof.\"\n\n8. Subsection one of section eighty-seven of the said Act is repealed and the following is substituted therefor:\u2014\n\n\"\u00a77. (1) Every penalty or forfeiture imposed by this Act or by any regulation made hereunder, may be recovered or enforced on parole complaint, before any fishery officer who is authorized by the Governor in Council to exercise the powers of a justice of the peace, stipendiary magistrate or justice of the peace, in a summary manner.\"\nCHAPTER 73.\n\nAn Act respecting Fisheries and Fishing.\n\nSHORT TITLE.\n\n1.

The fees payable for each such license shall be eight hundred dollars for the first year, one thousand dollars for the second year, and twelve hundred dollars for the third and each ensuing year, and the annual fee on all subsequent licenses for the same factory shall be twelve hundred dollars and such fee shall be payable to the Minister annually in advance: Provided that the Governor in Council, after the first two years may exact each year, in lieu of such fee, a sum equal to two per centum of the gross annual earnings of the factory.\n\n6. Every licensee upon cause shown, after one month's notice in writing to the licensee, shall be liable to forfeiture of license for any infraction of this Act, or for failure to fulfill and carry out the assurances required by this section to be given to the Minister previously to the issuing of the license; and in the case of forfeiture, the Minister may, without any suit or other proceedings at law, and without compensation, cancel the license.\n\n7. Boats known as tow boats shall not be used by any one in the prosecution of the whaling industry, and no net to be vessel other than the vessel from which the whales have been used.\n\nR.S., 1927.\nbeen captured or killed, shall, by any method or contrivance, bring or tow into port any whale for manufacture or other purpose; but nothing in this section shall prevent any one, other than the holder of a license, or his employees, from towing any dead whale to land, and having it manufactured or otherwise disposing of it in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n8. No one shall take, capture, shoot or kill any whale within the distance of one-half nautical mile of any vessel or boat not at anchor or within one nautical mile of any vessel or boat at anchor or engaged in any kind of fishing.\n\n9. No one shall have in his possession for the purpose of catching or killing whales, or use in the catching or killing of whales any contrivance which does not include a harpoon, with a whaling line attached thereto, fixed or fastened to the boat or vessel from which the whale is captured or killed.\n\n10. Notwithstanding anything in this section, the license fee payable for any vessel or boat engaged in the whale industry or hunting whales within the waters of Hudson Bay, or the territorial waters of Canada north of the fifty-fifth parallel of north latitude, if not so engaged or hunting in connection with a factory established in Canada, shall be fifty dollars for each year; and, inasmuch as Hudson Bay is wholly territorial water of Canada, the regulations of this section as to licensing, and also the fee payable therefor, shall apply to every vessel or boat engaged in the whale fishery or hunting whales in any part of the waters of Hudson Bay, whether such vessel or boat belongs to Canada, or is registered and outfitted in, or commences her voyage from any other British country or from any foreign country. 1914, c. 8, s. 8.\n\n10. Except as in this Act otherwise provided, no one shall engage in the manufacture of fish meal, fertilizer, oil, glue or products of a similar character from fish, fish offal or marine animals, except under license from the Minister. 1924, c. 44, s. 1.\n\nCOD FISHING.\n\n11.

No one shall with boat or vessel or in any other way during the time of fishing for seals, knowingly or wilfully disturb, impede or injure any sedentary seal fishery, or prevent, or impede the shoals of seals from coming into such fishery or knowingly or wilfully frighten such shoals. R.S., 1927.\n\nDisputes between occupiers of seal fisheries concerning lines and the mode of fishing or setting nets, shall be decided summarily by any fishery officer or justice of the peace, by whom arbitrators may be appointed to assess damages; and any damage assessed or which arises out of a repetition or continuance of the difficulty ordered to be remedied, may be levied under the warrant of any fishery officer or justice of the peace. 1914, c. 8, s. 11.\n\nSALMON FISHING.\n\n13. Salmon fry, parr and smolt shall not at any time be fished for, caught or killed, and no salmon or grilse of less weight than three pounds shall be caught or killed otherwise than by angling with hook and line; but no penalty shall attach if such fish are caught by accident in nets lawfully used for other fish, and if they are liberated alive, at the cost and risk of the owner of the fishery, on whom, in every case, the proof of such actual liberation shall devolve. 1914, c. 8, s. 12.\n\n14. The use of nets, weirs or other apparatus of a like nature for the capture of salmon shall be confined to tidal waters, and any fishery officer may determine the length and place of each net or other apparatus used in any of the waters of Canada.\n\n2. No one shall fish for or catch salmon with swing nets in any of the waters of Canada. 1914, c. 8, s. 13.\n\n15.

The said twenty dollars shall be paid before the license is issued, and the remainder of the license fee shall be paid as the Minister may from time to time by regulation prescribe.\n\n3. The annual license fee for a salmon curing establishment shall be\u2014\n\nFive cents on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season does not exceed ten tons;\n\nSeventy-five cents on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season exceeds ten tons but is not more than twenty tons;\n\nOne dollar on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season exceeds twenty tons but is not more than fifty tons;\n\nOne dollar and twenty-five cents on each ton or fraction thereof of dry-salted salmon put up in the establishment during the season, when the total quantity of dry-salted salmon put up in one season exceeds fifty tons. 1914, c. 8, s. 18; 1922, c. 24, s. 1; 1924, c. 43, s. 1.\n\n20. In British Columbia no unlicensed boat shall be used in buying fresh salmon, and no person engaged in cold storage fish packing shall buy fresh salmon from any fisherman unless such person holds a license authorizing such purchases.\n\n2. The fee for each license shall be one dollar, and the Minister may make regulations prescribing how such licenses may be granted and the respective forms thereof.\n\n3. In addition to any other penalties that may have been incurred, such license shall be liable to cancellation if the holder thereof buys any salmon that has been caught illegally, and if any licensed boat is used for purchasing or carrying salmon that has been illegally caught the license of such boat shall be liable to cancellation. 1918, c. 22, s. 3.\n\n21.

As the fisheries in Ontario are being administered by the provincial authorities, the enforcement of the provisions of this section comes within the purview of the Provincial Department of Game and Fisheries at Toronto.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm.A.Found\nDeputy Minister.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n706 Commercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nJuly 31, 1920.\n\nE. E. Wallace, Esq.,\nTimber Contractor,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving received notification that you have completed the removal of the coffer dam at the McIntosh Indian School Dam, I have forwarded the amount to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, with the request that you be paid.\n\nThe items for transportation of men for seven days at $2.00 per day, and for service on labor and transportation at 20%, a total amount of $19.70, have been deleted.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 12th, I may say that our Engineer, Mr. H. L. Johnston, who supervised the repair work, informs me that you did not carry out the terms of our agreement with respect to the compensation inasmuch as the men had to work in water and it was impossible to make complete repairs due to the excessive leakage through the badly built coffer dam. Nevertheless, I am authorized to pay in full for the work. No arrangements were made with you for transportation of men, but merely that you would supply labor at cost. I understand you transported your own men to the site and it was considered fair for the labor supplied us to travel on the same route, and incidentally, these men traveled on government time, which is unusual. The charge for service on labor and transportation at 20% demand be approved, and I am fairly certain that if any analysis is made, it would probably be found that your profits on labor supply were very substantial.\n\nWith respect to the final paragraph of your letter in which you say you did not apply for the job, but was asked by the Department to undertake the work, which you did to the delay of your own requirements, I may say that I was making arrangements to carry on this work independently of you, and it was only when you had visited this office and requested us to hurry up the work in order to facilitate your operations in the vicinity, that we agreed to cooperate with you in rushing the work to completion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power Service,\n706 Commercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAm enclosing herewith account in quadruplicate on work done at Indian School here. I have cleaned up the job to the satisfaction of the Indian Dept.\n\nRe your objection to claim for transportation of men, this is a perfectly legitimate charge, and a small one at that, being but a dollar per trip, less than half what it cost me. Had I put up accommodation for the men at the school site, it would have cost considerably more. No service charge, this also is quite in order and modest to say the least. It was understood between Mr. Atwood and myself that I was to charge cost plus 20% on the whole job, but we altered that to a set price for the coffer dam and agreement to supply the other labour required; there being nothing to the contrary that the 20% should not stand on this extra labour, which if you care to analyse you will find that the work was done considerably cheaper than if you had had to bring men from Winnipeg to do the work.\n\nMoreover I wish to remind you that I did not apply for the job, but was asked by the dept. to undertake the work, which I did to the delay of my own requirements. The obligation is yours.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed \"E. Wallace\")\nWinnipeg, Man., June 16, 1930.\n\nE. E. Wallace, Esq.,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am returning you herewith bill of costs in duplicate, covering the work in accordance with our agreement dated April 28th, 1930.\n\nThis agreement made no provision for payment to you for transportation of men or for service on labor and transportation and accordingly I would request you to make out your account in quadruplicate addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, leaving out the two items of $14.00 and $15.75, as these two items will not be passed.\n\nPlease send your account to this office to receive approval for payment, and when approved we will forward it to Ottawa for payment by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAccording to our agreement you were to remove the coffer-dam. My information is that you have not completed this portion of the work, there being two layers of bags remaining on the coffer-dam, and that you opened the sluice and allowed many bags to pass through the sluice into the stream below where they are now lying. Please note that payment of your account will be withheld until such time as all material used in connection with the construction of the coffer-dam is removed from the site, and I am requesting Father Perreault to advise me when this is done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

I am starting work at McIntosh and would like to hear from you at once. Re concrete work, I can find all labour required except the concrete man.\n\nRe gravel, think you had better ship this, as my timbers will be blocking the creek, so making it impossible to tow heavy snow through.\n\nThe ice is about out now, so you can ship everything necessary and I will freight it over to the school.\n\nDrop me a line at McIntosh and greatly oblige,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"E. Wallace\"\nMr. C. H. Attwood,\nDominion Water Power\n706 Commercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to mine of the 20th inst., I submit herewith a price for the work suggested to be undertaken by myself, including hauling material from McIntosh Station to dam site, building two coffer dams, supply sandbags and tools incidental to the work, rough logs if necessary, find and supply all labour, board and wages for men and team, taking out structure after requirements have been fulfilled:\n\n$590.00...........................................\n\nI would suggest that I build the coffer dams of sandbags using a clay filling for centre and further bags as a stiffener on the inside. I am under the impression, owing to the fact that the bed of the lake at this point is solid rock with no, or rather very little overlay of sand, that built as suggested, it would offer a more water-tight structure, more-over do away with the need of any timber or planking, drift bolts etc., therefore cheaper and quicker to build.\n\nAwaiting the favour of your reply,\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

By the first of May the two coffer dams should be finished, and your concrete man able to start in, and the job complete and ready to take the water by the first of June, allowing two weeks for hardening.\n\nIf the building of the coffer dams is left until the water opens up, I doubt very much whether I should be able to undertake the work other than perhaps the freighting over the material, as I expect to be engaged on other work.\n\nAs charges for work, I will submit a price to cover the cost within a few days, as I think that an overall price would be more satisfactory than a cost plus.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"E. Wallace\"\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of August 1st, I am enclosing in duplicate a copy of the agreement made with Mr. M. E. Wallace for the carrying out of certain work in connection with the repair job done on the McIntosh Indian School dam. I am also enclosing, in duplicate, the correspondence between Mr. Wallace and this office, covering the arrangements made for the carrying out of the work and also correspondence relating to the settlement in payment of the work.\n\nMr. Wallace during the present season and also last season has been carrying on logging operations on the lakes above this dam, and passing his logs through the dam into the lakes below. He has given a great deal of trouble to the authorities at the Indian School and deserves consideration for anyone else. The work he carried out in accordance with the agreement made with him by Mr. Atwood was not performed in a very satisfactory manner, insomuch as the sand bag, Coffin Dam did not reduce the leakage to sufficient extent. The work was only carried out after a great deal of trouble and extra expense to this office. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that no consideration whatsoever should be given to any protest made by Mr. Wallace over the settlement of his account.\n\nI understand he has taken the matter up with Captain Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora and possibly with other people also.

(RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTo Mr. C. H. Attwood,\n\nRe: Canyon River Power Dam at McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nOn April 24th a letter was received from Rev. Father Perrault, Principal of the Indian Residential School near McIntosh, Ontario, stating that clefts had formed through the concrete dam and he feared that if repairs were not made immediately serious damage would result. This letter was forwarded to Ottawa for attention. A few days later a second communication was received from the School stating there was considerable flowage through the dam. In view of these communications and acting upon your instructions I proceeded to McIntosh and on May 9th made an examination of the dam.\n\nThe attached plan shows a profile of the concrete dam, a plan of the log chute and sluiceway section, also typical section through the non-overflow section, spillway, log chute and sluiceway.\n\nThe examination showed that there is some flowage presumably between the concrete and the rock surface between station 1 + 30 and station 1 + 75, the leakage being greatest at station 1 + 57. There was about 2 to 3 feet of backfill both above and below the dam along this section but this has mostly disappeared along the upstream face. During construction in 1925 it was found that in this section the bed rock was very smooth so instructions were given the contractor to thoroughly chip the rock surfaces, drill holes and place anchorages bolts. There has been no apparent leakage through any portion of the overflow section of the dam until this spring and it is impossible to state definitely the cause of the present trouble, although it is apparent the bond between rock and dam has been broken, presumably by frost or ice action. Repairs are necessary as another winter would aggravate the present condition.\n\nThe examination also showed considerable erosion of concrete along the log chute, sluiceway and spillway sections, being serious only in the sluiceway. These sections were constructed during very severe winter weather, under adverse conditions and although great pains were taken to secure good work and although a very rich mixture of concrete was poured it is admittedly poor concrete along the outer surfaces. The accompanying photographs show to some extent the wearing away of concrete around and under the right pier of the sluiceway and also around the stop log chocks. Here the penetration is quite deep, but elsewhere it is merely superficial erosion of concrete. However, the present condition of the sluiceway demands repairs being made inasmuch as with the sluiceway open, erosion might quickly cause failure of this pier.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRepairs to the dam should be made this summer preferably early in July when Indian labor is procurable and the work could best be done by day labor under suitable direction. It would expedite the work and cut the cost of requiring to draw down the present forebay elevation of 110.9 to 109 and to do this would take nearly 60 days with low inflow conditions now prevailing. With the forebay elevation at 109 it would be a very simple matter to lower the dam between stations 420 and station 175 and excavate to the rock surface on either side of the dam and examine closely conditions existing. It would then be necessary to thoroughly roughen the rock surface for 12\" upstream from the present face of the dam and also roughen the concrete face and construct a section 12\" wide along the upstream face to prevent seepage. If possible, the basement openings should be cleaned out with high pressure hose and a rich grout mixture forced into all openings to secure a seal under the existing dam. Ice pressure is considerable against this section of the dam.\n\nIt will also be necessary to unwater the log chute and sluiceway sections. No difficulty would be encountered in unwatering the log chute, but the sluiceway would require more work, although lowering the forebay to 109 would render the task fairly simple. When unwatered the soft concrete should be dug out and the walls, floors and piers again built up with a strong mixture of concrete.\n\nAnother matter that should receive the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs is the present fire hazard in the vicinity of the powerhouse. As shown in the photograph the powerhouse is adjacent to the wood yard and this wood pile with the chips, etc., is a constant fire hazard as everything is dry as possible. Campers pass to and fro daily and this summer many men will be working there passing 125,000 railroad ties past the dam and a carelessly thrown match may endanger the powerhouse with its valuable equipment.\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...Department of Lands & Forests,\nProvince of Ontario,\nToronto.\n\nDATE 1931\n\nSERVICE\n\nAMOUNT\n\n30 To rental of Water Power Lease No. 41 from January 1, 1931, to December 31, 1931, covering site of dam for power purposes in connection with the McIntosh Indian Residential School .... $25.00\n\nThis Water Power Lease covers land used for site of dam and land covered by the water at the outlet of Forest Lake in the District of Kenora.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 62.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour Department has a Water Power Lease on the outlet of Forest Lake near McIntosh in the District of Kenora and also a license of occupation for land which has been flooded out in certain Townships.\n\nThe purpose of the Water Power was for an Indian School. Recently a letter was received from Rev. J. O. Flourde, written on behalf of The Reverend Oblate Fathers, asking for an area of land comprising of approximately four hundred acres in the District of Kenora in the Township of Smallie, North of the area granted by Order-in-Council some years ago to your Department. Whether this area referred to is that covered by the License of Occupation which I mentioned above, or not I cannot say.\n\nThe Reverend J. O. Flourde states that the reason for obtaining the land North of the School is for two outstanding purposes, - First, to give ample room to develop into an industrial farm an area to be held in connection with the school and to provide protection for the Indian adults who find it necessary to regularly visit their children while at school, their homes being far distant from the school site. He further states the acquisition of the area by the Order of Oblate Fathers will give them an outlet to Canoe Lake and provide reasonable opportunity of developing the agricultural potentialities of the area and of assisting in giving to the Indians an opportunity likewise of becoming interested in farming, at least to the extent of encouraging them to produce sufficient to sustain themselves.\nToronto, Ont. July 25th, 1935.\n\nBefore dealing with the matter it is desirable to know what the attitude of your Department is with respect to it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. H. Fullerton,\nSurveyor General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 31st July 1935\n\nMemorandum\n\nSchools Branch,\n\nWith reference to your inquiry regarding letter hereunder I have to advise that the Department purchased not only the 191 acre parcel adjoining Forest and Canyon Lakes, but also the S. \u00a7 Lot 12, Con. 6, Township of Smellie. These are indicated on the plan showing flooded lands accompanying Licence of Occupation No. 2237 (on file hereunder).\n\nThe application of the Oblate Fathers should not be, as suggested by the Surveyor General in his letter, for lands lying North of the area covered by Licence of Occupation, as this is comprised of a number of small areas adjoining the lakes throughout the Township of Smellie (as indicated in green on the plan above mentioned) and inasmuch as the Oblate Fathers request the land North of the area granted by Order in Council, it is thought that the parcel they desire lies to the West of the Township of Smellie and North of the 191 acre parcel, which was purchased by the Department and was transferred by Provincial Order in Council 2nd Oct. 1904. This appears evident as the applicants state that it would give them an outlet to Canyon Lake, and land in the N. \u00a7 Lot 12 would not give any access to the lake. This application should not interfere with the lands sold to the Department, nor should it have any effect on the lands covered by our Licence of Occupation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rose of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau at Winnipeg on the dam of the hydro-electric plant at McIntosh Indian School. You will note from the report, which has been forwarded me by Mr. Mills, that the deterioration of the concrete work has been rapid owing to poor aggregate and to the fact that much of the cement was poured during the winter months in 1925.\n\nMr. Rose estimates the repair work will cost $900 and, in the opinion of Mr. Mills, $1,000 should be made available for the work. As you are aware, no funds have been transferred to this Branch for undertaking this particular project and as the repair work seems very necessary, I would suggest you make the required amount available to us or authorize the Treasury Department to honour expenditure for wages and material that will be incurred by our engineer on the repair work, up to $1,000.\n\nWill you kindly advise me as soon as possible so that we can make early arrangements to have the work done.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum: Mr. D. B. Gow.\n\nRe: Dam of Hydro-Electric Plant at McIntosh Indian School.\n\nIn accordance with your verbal instructions, the writer visited the Indian Residential School near McIntosh, Ontario on May 29th and inspected the hydro-electric plant at the outlet of Forest Lake that supplied the school with electric light and power. The dam, penstock and powerhouse installation were all examined as closely as conditions permitted and photographs were taken to show existing conditions at sections of the dam where repair work appears necessary.\n\nThis hydro-electric plant was constructed in 1925. The main section of the dam, including the log chute and sluiceway sections, was constructed in January and February under severe winter conditions and admittedly the concrete work was poor, although a very rigid structure was poured. During 1930 it was necessary to make repairs to the dam along the non-overflow section to stop seepage under the structure and also to reconstruct eroded sections on the side walls of the sluiceway and log chute openings.\n\nThe accompanying plan of the dam and sections has shown on it those areas of the structure where deterioration is such as to necessitate immediate repair work. The accompanying photographs show in part the wearing away of concrete. Damage is most marked at the sluiceway and log chute; due principally to frost action, also to erosion, etc. Although the downstream face was damp near the base, over a considerable area there was no distinct flow through cracks except at a construction joint. Some seepage was evident at the rock near the middle of the non-overflow section of the dam at 2'00. However, there seems to be enough percolation to cause continued destruction of the downstream face of the dam by repeated action of water during each winter season. A few minor cracks have occurred, most likely due to expansion, over the length of the dam, but they do not cause leaks and appear to be of little consequence. Repair work done in 1930 to seal off leakage originating along the upstream base of the dam, has evidently permanently stopped most of the seepage on the shore ends.\n\nThe water worn areas of the sluiceway and log chute abutments and dividing pier show the most important deterioration. Water worn areas, however, repaired in 1930, seem to have reinforced sections mostly sound but as the sluiceway were wide open during the inspection, this could not be fully observed. The concrete has so broken away around the slots that stop logs roll and cannot be placed in effective\nposition. Deterioration in view was mainly of the original concrete which was placed in severe winter weather.\n\nThe intake gate has not been operable for three years on account of being jammed. This is believed to be due to concrete being broken unevenly off the upstream face of the dam, on which the gate slides, causing a rough surface over which stops movement of the gate. The worm drive mechanism was broken in an attempt to close the gate and a strong lever was rigged up by the power house operator, but all efforts to move the gate were fruitless. The operator is unable to close off the flow at the turbine as the gates there will not now close sufficiently to stop flow enough for reduction of pressure at intake gate.\n\nThe pipe line, while not a part of the dam, should be reported on as it was brought to the writer's attention that rotted places had developed in the wood. These were one half inch deep, three to four inches wide and six to ten inches long in at least sixteen places, all observed in the upper part of the pipe and in the creosoted area. At only two places was water spouting out and this was around a butt joint in the creosoted area on the side of the pipe. It should be observed that the pipe outside is about 300 feet long and last feet of the upper end was painted with special creosote paint and this action only contains the rotted areas. The lower 120 feet is also cut in the open and shows some seepage, at butt joints mainly, while the pipe within the powerhouse seems to be in perfect condition.\n\nThe turbine was reported to have lost its best regulative characteristics and some of its power but it is still sufficient to supply the ordinary requirements of the school. It has been found that the wicket gates on the turbine could not be closed.\n\nREPAIRS RECOMMENDED:\n\n1. SLUICES: In view of the repeated breaking down of the water-worn areas, it is considered advisable to install 12\" steel channels for the sections upstream from the stop-log slots up to the face and 6\" angles on the downstream corners of the slots. These would be drilled and anchored with concrete filled behind in the broken away and adjoining faulty areas. This protection should stop destructive action where, where breaking down most probably begins. The lower wells of the sluices showed deterioration above patched places so that it will be advisable to break away well above water line and place a facing of reinforced anchored slabs from the downstream side of slots and around the ends of the pier and abutments.\n2. INTAKE GATE:\nThis may be best provided with smaller channel guides fixed by countersunk bolts to the present slides or side channel guides. Concrete in the area about the gate should be cut away and refaced, leaving operating clearance for the gate. Operating gears for gate movement require replacement.\n\n3. SPILLWAY:\nUpstream face should be repaired with 4 inch slab for distance of at least 10 feet as deterioration has occurred to depth of four inches. The whole downstream face should be cut away to within eighteen inches of top and reinforced concrete slabs anchored in place, sealed at upper edges by expansion joint filler.\n\n4. NON-OVERFLOW SECTION OF DAM:\nUpstream face should be repaired with 4\" slab to 20 feet from log chutes. Reinforced concrete slab on downstream side is not considered necessary at present as probably backfilling from the north end to near the pipe line thimble with underdrainage provided by tile, would stop most of the deterioration. Pressure grouting by holes spaced at 6-foot intervals should be tried next in order to determine if in this way the dam can be made less permeable.\n\n5. PIPE LINE:\nThis will require galvanized plates and caulking at each rotated angle. It is claimed the life of the pipe would be considerably lengthened by providing a roof over it; however, this work could be done at any time the dam is closed. At the same time some of the saddle timbers could be replaced. The extent of the rotting of these could not be determined on account of depth of water around pipe at time of inspection.\n\n6. THE TURBINE:\nThis has run almost continuously for eleven years and it is found the water cannot be stopped running through. The cast iron spindle and bearings are probably in need of repair but cannot be inspected until the intake is closed.\n\nCOSTS:\nEstimates for this type of work are not readily accurately determined as the actual overlay for material is relatively small and a great deal depends on the indefinite cost of coffin-damming transportation of equipment and material. Repair work in 1930 was done on a similar area of the same dam and cost ran up to $700.00 exclusive of engineering supervision. The present plan is to\nCOSTS (Continued) use more steel and concrete and it is expected that total costs will be higher than they are now $800.00 should be provided for the work outlined. Details of material needed are appended.\n\nJ. T. ROSE,\nWater & Power Engineer, Grade II.\nJuly 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 15th regarding the condition of the dam at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, the matter was referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch and they estimate that an amount of approximately $1,000.00 will be required to place this dam in good condition.\n\nAs it is important that these repairs be made at once, this Branch is authorizing the Surveys and Engineering Branch to proceed with the necessary work at the earliest possible date. As you have previously been informed, only $500.00 was provided in our current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the McIntosh School. The remaining $500.00 required for repairs to the dam is being taken from a small unallotted amount in our appropriation. Under these circumstances, no funds for other repairs and improvements can be allowed the McIntosh School during the current fiscal year. In this connection, I would refer you to official letter of June 1st, 1937. The amount mentioned in that letter is now required for repairs to the dam.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. J. M. Wardle,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of June 28th, enclosing copy of your Inspector's report with reference to the dam at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that this dam can be placed in good condition for a sum not exceeding $1,000.00. Accounts certified by your Engineer and forwarded to this office through your office will be paid.\n\nFor your information, I may say that only $500.00 was provided in our current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the McIntosh Residential School. The remaining $500.00 is being taken from a small unallotted amount in our appropriation. You will see, therefore, the necessity of keeping the expenditure within the amount approved in this memorandum, namely, $1,000.00.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could arrange to have the work proceed at the earliest possible date.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Mills.\n\nRe: Dam at McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 23rd ultimo containing a report of the Hydraulic Engineer on the condition of the above dam, we have now been advised by the Acting Director of the Indian Affairs Branch that an amount not exceeding $1,000 will be made available for the work. This has been provided from $500 shown in the appropriation for repairs to this school and $500 from an unallotted amount.\n\nAccounts are to be certified by the Engineer and forwarded to the Indian Affairs Office for payment and of course must be kept within the $1,000. It is desirable that this work be undertaken at once and completed before the school session opens in the Fall.\n\nDirector.\nDOMINION WATER AND POWER BUREAU\n\nWinnipeg, Man.,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nJuly 27, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, authorizing the repair work to the hydro-electric plant of the McIntosh Indian School at the outlet of Forest Lake.\n\nThe pressure of other work made it impossible for this office to maintain an engineer on this job continuously, so I planned to recommend that Brother Gauthier be placed in charge of the work. He has had a lot of construction experience and has been on jobs under our direction before, and as his headquarters are at the McIntosh Indian School, he is very familiar with the extent of repairs required. I have discussed the work with Brother Gauthier and he is decidedly of the opinion that our estimate of the cost of the work is greatly underestimated. In common with other lakes in that region, recent heavy rains have raised the lake level greatly, materially increasing the difficulty of unwatering the section of the dam to be repaired. He states that fairly heavy cribwork, with regular cofferdam construction, is essential, and we know that such work is costly and always uncertain. He also states that for over two years they have been unable to close the headgate so as to get at the turbine installation and that many parts of the turbine are worn and must be replaced or rebuilt. The condition of the turbine is apparently more serious than we had figured on. The penstock work is urgent and the repair work rather extensive.\n\nIt is apparent that the $1000.00 available for the work will not be sufficient. In fact, it will be advisable to have $2500.00 available for the work to be carried out satisfactorily. The light cofferdam construction we had figured on will not now be possible or advisable.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI regret that it becomes necessary to ask for more money for this job, but Mr. Rose was not fully advised as to the condition of the turbine and at the time of his inspection low water conditions prevailed and the outlook was for lower water conditions. As the work cannot be accomplished with the funds available we would ask that expenditures up to $2500.00 be provided for before work is initiated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) D.B. Gow\n\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nAugust 13, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI am attaching herewith a copy of a letter received by our Engineering and Construction Service from Mr. G.B. Gow, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, in regard to necessary work on the hydro electric plant at McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you know, authority was given to proceed with necessary repairs to the extent of $1000. It now develops that on account of the condition of the turbine and the continued high level of the lake due to heavy rains in the locality, this amount will be far from sufficient to cover necessary expenses to put the dam and turbine in good repair. The estimated amount required is $2500. Will you please advise if this amount can be made available or if it is the wish of your Branch that expenditures be held to the original figure of $1000.\n\nThe discrepancy between the original figure and what is now estimated as necessary is accounted for by the fact that Mr. Rose, who made the original estimate, was not aware of the condition of the turbine and that low water prevailed and was in prospect at that time.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6221, file 472-16, part 4)\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n5th floor, Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe McIntosh Residential School.\n\nA short time ago the Department decided to repair the dam at the above school for which an amount of $1000.00 was allotted.\n\nI saw Mr. Gow, the engineer of the Hydrometric Bureau, and he informed me he had received instructions to attend to the matter, but intimated it would be some time before he would be able to start the work.\n\nMr. John Kelly, Factory, Shop & Office Buildings Inspector, in the course of his duties visited the school, and he writes -\n\n\"The concrete of the dam is considerably wasted. I understand this will be fixed up; at the same time water turbine should be attended to and overhauled. Work should be done at once for sanitary and other convenience purposes, before large numbers of children return to school.\"\n\nWill you take this matter up immediately and also get authority to get the turbine overhauled. We understand gravel or concrete has probably got into it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFRANK EDWARDS (signed)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Agent Edwards.\n\nI understand the repair work is urgently needed and delay is only adding expense. The turbine needs repairing but this can not be carried out until the dam is repaired, and the water brought under control.\n\nMr. Gow states it will require at least $2500.00 to carry out the work and that the Department is aware of the cost. In doing the work I understand both the light and power supply will be cut off from the school. Consequently it should be started at once in order that it may be completed before the short days really set in.\n\nI would be pleased to know immediately what action the Department intend taking in connection with this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI have your memorandum of the 13th instant enclosing a copy of letter received from Mr. G. B. Cow in connection with the work required on the hydroelectric plant at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I note that the cost of the repairs are now estimated at $2,500.\n\nIf an expenditure of $1,000 will cover the cost of repairs absolutely necessary at the present time and permit the completion of these repairs at a cost of $1,500 next year, I would appreciate your giving directions to proceed with the work at once.\n\nIf, however, you consider that the complete work at a cost of $2,500 must be done this year please let me know and an endeavour will be made to secure authority for the necessary funds.\n\nAs there are so many unexpected demands upon our appropriation I trust that your engineers will find that an expenditure of $1,000 this year will keep the plant running in reasonably satisfactory condition for the coming year and, at the same time, not involve the Department in a heavier expenditure next year than that estimated at the present time.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 1, 1937\n\nEX'D.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th August enclosing copy of letter received from Indian Agent Edwards with reference to repairs required to the dam at the McIntosh Residential School.\n\nThis matter is now before the Surveys and Engineering Branch of this Department. If an expenditure of $1,000 will cover the cost of repairs absolutely necessary at the present time and permit the completion of these repairs next year, directions have been given to proceed with the work. If, however, the officers of the Surveys and Engineering Branch decide that it is absolutely necessary to expend approximately $2,500 this year, the matter will have to receive further consideration by this Branch as it is extremely difficult to obtain the amount stated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He stated that he was still of the opinion that the repairs to the dam could well be left until that date, and that he did not think there was any immediate danger of the turbine going out of business, but of course could not guarantee that it would not.\n\nMr. Gow further stated that he had not the staff to make an investigation of this kind, and after again stating that he did not consider there was any immediate rush for the work, suggested that a member of the organization of the Engineering and Construction Service should visit the site at the earliest possible date and furnish a report. Mr. Stinson advised me that they had no engineer available at the present time who could be sent to the McIntosh School, but that the first man in from the field could be sent.\n\nIf it is your wish Mr. Edwards will be advised that as soon as an engineer's services can be made available the question of these repairs will be further investigated.\n\nM.

It will, therefore, not be necessary for Mr. Byrne to go to the McIntyre Reserve for the supervision of this work.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of October 13th enclosing letter received by you from Brother Gauthier of the McIntosh Indian Residential School regarding repairs required for the turbine. The Boving Hydraulic & Engineering Company, Lindsay, Ont., from whom the turbine was purchased in 1925, is not now in business; consequently there is not sufficient information contained in Brother Gauthier's letter to order the parts he requires from any other firm.\n\nI am returning Brother Gauthier's letter and, at the same time, authorize you to purchase the parts required. No doubt you can secure these from a firm in Winnipeg. Brother Gauthier will probably be able to give more specific information regarding what is necessary.\n\nIn connection with the last paragraph of your letter, the Surveys and Engineering Branch sent an engineer to McIntosh recently. He has advised the Department by wire that repairs of the dam and penstock of the McIntosh Residential School can safely be postponed until next summer. He recommends, however, that the new parts for the turbine be secured. Authority for this has been granted in the first part of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

However, he suggests that the new parts required for the turbine be purchased.\n\nMr. Edwards wrote the Department regarding this matter, but as the Boeing Hydraulic & Engineering Company, Lindsay, Ont., from whom the turbine was purchased in 1925, is now out of business, it was not possible for us to order the parts. I have therefore returned Brother Gauthier's letter of September 6th to Mr. Edwards and requested him to arrange purchase of the parts in Winnipeg.\n\nIf certain funds are available in the current year's appropriation, the Department considers that it might be advisable to at least purchase some of the supplies that will be required for repairing the dam next summer. I would therefore appreciate if you would forward to Indian Agent Edwards a list of the supplies that you consider might be secured during the next few months. We would arrange for their purchase and shipment to the school about the middle of next March, in order that we could pay their cost out from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Byrne to the McIntosh Indian School for an inspection of the Hydro Electric installation at that place, it was found that any major repair work would necessitate the closing down of the plant for an indefinite period and as it was considered these major repairs could be safely postponed until next summer, it was decided to defer them accordingly.\n\nCertain immediate repairs to the turbine are very necessary; also it is considered advisable to reinforce the wood stave pipe which acts as a penstock between the dam intake and powerhouse.\n\nIn this connection I am sending you herewith a list of the necessary parts required to make these repairs, which material should be purchased and shipped to McIntosh as soon as possible. As no funds have been transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service for this work, it is suggested in this instance that a requisition covering the purchase of the material as listed be submitted by your Branch to the Purchasing Agent for his immediate attention.\n\nDirector\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Bailer\n\nI am in receipt of a memorandum from Mr. J.M. Wardle, Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in which he states that the following parts are required to make repairs to the Hydro Electric installation at the McIntosh Indian Residential School:\n\n\"Materials for Repairs to Turbine\n3 - 1/2\" round Tobin Bronze bars, each 5'-0\" long.\n1 - 1/2\" flat (mild) steel plate 5'-0\" long.\n2 - 5/8\" x 2\u00bd\" flat (mild) steel plates, each 3'-0\" long.\n\nMaterials for Repairs to Food Stove Pipes\n100 - 6\" round iron hoops threaded both ends with 2 hexagon nuts each for stove pipe 39\u00be\" outside diameter.\n100 - tightening lugs for 6\" round iron hoops as above.\n100 - 3/16\"x 7\" x 5\" mild steel plates bent to 19-5/8\" radius on 6\" arc.\"\n\nI would appreciate if you would arrange for the immediate purchase and delivery of the above.

Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, Ontario, your file 130-7-E, dated October 21st, some time ago an order was placed with the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company, amounting to $253.76, for repair parts necessary for the turbine at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nDue to a misunderstanding Fairbanks Morse were requested to cancel the order. They have been most considerate and pointed out that in spite of sending a wire to the East to cancel the order for 5 Hyatt hanger bearings, these had already left and are now on hand at their store in Winnipeg. They point out that these bearings can not be disposed of in Winnipeg and request that we pay the return freight, which will amount to $6.00 to $8.00.\n\nBrother Gauthier was in recently and states that the bearings sent by the Department from the East are the right size but will not give the satisfactory service which can be obtained from the Hyatt hanger bearings. The price of the bearings is $92.50 and I would recommend that they be retained and forwarded to the McIntosh School. The ones they have already received can be made use of, I understand, for other purposes.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nBrother Gauthier also lists a number of items not included in the order from the East and requests that these be shipped.

S. Assance, teacher of the South Bay School, I beg to say that, whether the charges are altogether founded on fact or are partly due to prejudice, still as both the Indians and School Inspector White think another teacher ought to be appointed to the South Bay School, the Department has come to the conclusion that in order to secure the best results in the education of the children attending this school it is necessary that a change should be made.\n\nBe good enough to inform Mrs. Assance, therefore, of this decision; but tell her at the same time that the Department is willing to give her another chance if she will accept the charge of some other school. If she agrees to this, the Department will keep the matter in mind, and try to arrange for her transfer as soon as possible. Inform Mrs. Assance, however, that, whether she accepts the proposition of the Department or not, the decision has been arrived at that she must be replaced in the South Bay School by another teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Now, the school at White Rock Lake is vacant, and Mrs. Johnson is willing to accept it. At this time, it might be well to notify her directly to proceed to that school, as I told her she would have to wait for a word from your office before going.\n\nTo fill the new vacancy at South Bay, I would be willing to give another chance to Miss Sarah Bernard of Killarney, who was formerly teacher at West Bay, and who was dismissed in my last report for misconduct. She has been begging me ever since for another school promising to work for better satisfaction. As she was quite good in her teaching, and has behaved very properly since her dismissal, and as I am not likely to find anywhere a competent teacher who will stay any length of time at South Bay for the small balance of $200, I propose this young lady for the position.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.W.

You will remember that I drew attention to the case of Miss Moran at South Bay in a letter in July 1900.\n\nThe teachers now engaged at South Bay and Wikwemikong sing receive $200 per annum, at each of the other three places mentioned the salary is $250 per annum. You will agree I am sure that these salaries are exceedingly small for teachers who are doing such good work and who are under considerable expense in reaching these remote places and in maintaining themselves there.\n\nI would respectfully urge the Department of Indian Affairs to increase the salaries of these five teachers and make their remuneration sufficient to enable them to ameliorate the hard conditions of their posts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Prendergast\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to draw your attention to some facts concerning the Indian schools situated at Roman Catholic missions on Manitoulin and the north shore of Georgian Bay. Many of these, notably the ones at South Bay, Wikwemikong, West Bay, Sagamok and Sheshogwaning, are situated in remote places, far from white settlements and distant from railway communication. It was always difficult to secure teachers with even a small degree of skill for these schools and I will admit that the salaries paid some persons who 'kept school' in these places were quite equal to what they earned.\n\nIn August Rev Fr Paquin induced the ladies who have charge of the Industrial school for girls at Wikwemikong to also take charge of these five schools. I have inspected them twice since then and have no hesitation in saying that they are doing well. It is not alone nor even chiefly that the children have acquired book knowledge but more important still, the influence of these ladies has been a civilizing one. They have taught their pupils cleanliness and industry, - or at least have made a good start in that direction for neither of these are subjects in which the Indian makes rapid progress. The girls have been taught plain sewing and other elementary branches of domestic science. The material for this purpose has been provided by the teachers at their own expense.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th recommending that the salaries of the five Roman Catholic schools on the North Shore end of Lake Huron and Manitoulin Island be increased for the reasons given by you; and in reply I beg to say that your recommendation will receive consideration when the estimates for next year are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nWm.

(RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-1, part 1)\nWikwemikong, Ont., Jan. 25, 1904.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn my capacity of Superior of the Indian Missions of the Manitoulin Island, having the responsibility of the Indian Day Schools located therein, I feel bound to call the attention of your Department to the insufficiency of the salary to its teachers. The teachers at Sheshegwaning, South Bay, and Wikwemikong receive a salary of $200.00. The teachers at West Bay and Sagamok receive a salary of $250.00. These salaries were fixed long ago, when the cost of living was lower than now, when teachers could be had for a lower salary than now, and for teachers of inferior capacity, mostly Indians or Half-Breeds of no training. And your Department must remember what trouble there was in keeping those teachers at their post for any length of time, and what poor results were obtained. It is all different now. The present teachers, as the Inspector Mr. Prendergast must have reported, are ladies of education and training and are doing very good work. No competent teacher can be hired at present for less than $300.00, and to teach in districts affording all the comforts of civilisation. Nothing but a much higher salary would induce them to go and bury themselves among an uncongenial population for ten months, and in an out of the way place, lacking every comfort and convenience. Now that we have teachers willing to do this hard work,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-1, part 1)\nIt is but just to pay them an adequate salary. I may add that this voluntary exile of ten months year after year, is made possible for these ladies only by keeping a companion with them; hence the cost of living is made double.\n\nFor the reasons alleged above, I respectfully but earnestly request your Department to take such steps and exert such influence as will be necessary to have the salary of the above mentioned teachers raised to the sum of $300.00. If you allow me to make comparisons with salaries paid elsewhere, you will readily see the justice of my request. I find in the general Report of your Department for 1902, that the teachers at Naughton with an average of 4 pupils, at Port Elgin with 8 pupils, at Sheguianah with 7 pupils, at Buzwah with 6 pupils, at Cape Croker with 7 pupils, at Christian Island with 11 pupils, at Sidney with 10 pupils, receive a salary of $300.00. Whilst the teachers at Sagamok with an average of 20 pupils, at West Bay with 25 pupils, receive only $250.00, and the teachers at South Bay with an average of 22 pupils, at Wikwemikong with 12 pupils, and at Sheshegwaning with an average of about 18 pupils (non official), receive only $200.00. I hope that my request which is also the teachers' request will receive favourable attention from your department.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Leusch. The school authorities have been contemplating this change for some time as Miss St. James requires a rest and as Miss Leusch has had many years of successful experience as teacher of Indian schools I would recommend that the change be approved by the Department.\n\nMiss Leusch has taught at Sagamok and last year was in charge of the Girls' Industrial school at Wikwemikong, since which time she has given her time to other work in connection with the Mission. It is the intention of the Mission authorities to simply have these two exchange places.

Sir:\n\nMr. Agent McLeod advises the Department that you have nominated Miss German for the position as teacher of the South Bay School in place of Miss Leusch.\n\nIn a letter received from the Rev. Father Ryan, Principal of the Industrial School, he states that Miss Leusch and Miss Dubois were to exchange places. The Department would like to know what the arrangements are; also in the case of Miss German the Department wishes to have information respecting her qualifications, so that the amount of salary can be decided upon.\n\nThe Department is of opinion that these changes are not in the best interest of the school work. Miss Leusch was meeting with splendid success at South Bay. The Department, however, will not object to her being sent to Sheshagshin if you are of opinion that she will get along with the Indians there better than Miss Dubois.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McPhee,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. P. A. Desautels,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-1, part 1)\nWinnemikang, Aug. 6th 1913\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to yours of July 31st, I beg to state that Miss Leman, supposed to have been nominated by me as teacher of the South Band school is altogether unknown to me. She was mentioned by name to Mr. Agent McLeod, so as a misunderstanding.\n\nIn fact Miss Delhamel is supposed to take the South Bay School exchanging places with Miss Leman. The reason is that Miss Delhamel having been as many years in that lonely village of Winnemikang and having met with some success with the Indians of that place in the past year wished for a change. Some of whom that Miss Leman gets along better with. The Indians of that band, Mr. McLeod says must have notified the Department of the change.\n\nAs for the Winnemikang school, the sooner the Department can arrive at a decision if the school is to be kept open or to be closed the better it will be. I am afraid I'll have difficulties to get a good qualified teacher at this time, in case the school is to open. Some of the children of the place have applied to enter the Hamlet here. Individually, we will refuse those who can easily attend their school if it is to close. I sent to Mr. Agent McLeod a complete list of all the school age children with their approximate distance to school and their aptitude to go. The average last year was 10, but it was due to six that were boarding at the school. My opinion is that without...\nIndians at the school, the average would be about 5. The Indians of that place are living on their farms. Very few families are close to the school. In my past I am in favor of day schools where it can be had.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nJ. A. Desautels\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 16, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rev.

Mr. McLeod and the doctor told me to reopen it on the 23rd of March and so I did. We had school for a week and three days only during this past term. Will you please be kind enough to let me know if I am to make out reports for those few days.\n\nMr. McLeod was here last week and I asked him about it but he did not seem to know. I was in the hospital in Wikwemikong helping Miss Oland since the 18th of December, so if I wasn't in the classroom, I was in a more disagreeable place.\n\nVery respectfully,\nEmily Frawley.\nOttawa, April 11, 1918.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo stating that the South Bay School was closed for three months on account of smallpox and asking if you are to make out a report for the few days that it was open during the March quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should make out a return in the usual way and forward it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is a question, had they done so, whether they would have been employed, as the Department is in receipt of a number of applications from experienced Roman Catholic teachers who are possessed of higher qualifications. As you are practically committed to their employment, Miss Mary Burke may be placed in charge of the West Bay School at a salary of $500.00 per annum and Miss Eddie Burke may act as assistant teacher at Wikwemikong at a salary of $450.00 per annum.\n\nWith regard to the employment of Miss Hickey I may say that the Department does not approve of the employment of aliens, but, as you are again committed in her case,\n\nRev.

You should, therefore, make enquiries with a view to obtaining a suitable teacher, and it would be well for you to consult the Separate School Inspector for the district and the local church authorities, with a view to obtaining the services of a teacher. Any nominations which you receive should be submitted for the consideration of the Department and full particulars should be given as to the qualifications and experience which the applicant possesses.\n\nI may add that the Department has no teacher in view for this school. You should give this matter your prompt attention and endeavour to have a teacher to re-open the school in the beginning of the New Year.\n\nMr. Peltier's school return should be prepared by him and forwarded through your office promptly at the end of the present quarter in order that payment of salary and bonus due him may be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR.

It is hoped that Mr. Trudeau will be able to carry on the work successfully. The salary allowed him will be at the same rate as was paid Mr. Peltier, namely, $500.00 per annum, and the bonus allowed during the period it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. You should, however, continue your efforts to obtain a suitable teacher for this school and Mr. Trudeau should be informed by you that his services will only be continued until the services of another teacher are secured.

Miss Lavallee has had no prior experience in Indian schools and took charge of the South Bay School on the 1st of September, last. She has no professional qualifications, but has taught 5 years in white schools, and the Inspector states that she is a very satisfactory and capable teacher.\n\nThere are 25 children on the Reserve of school age; 13 only being enrolled at the time of the Inspector's visit in September last.\n\nMr. Lewis states that Miss Lavallee now has an offer of $850 per annum to take charge of a white school, and if he cannot pay her immediately to that amount she intends to resign at the end of the current quarter. The Indians are very anxious that she should stay, and passed the Resolution mentioned above to pay her salary from the Band Funds. This Band has very little interest at their credit and they will receive no interest distribution this fall. At present the $500 salary which she receives is paid from Band Funds, and if the increase asked for is allowed it would have to be provided from our vote for Indian Education.\n\nThe Agent states that as this is a very isolated place for a teacher, and, as she has to live among the Indians, it would be difficult to secure a qualified teacher to replace her, and he approves of increasing her salary to $700 per annum, or allowing her a bonus of $150 paid to teachers of Indian schools. He states that there is quite a noticeable improvement in the work of the pupils in the classroom during the time Miss Lavallee has been in charge.\n\nI would recommend this request for an increase of $200 in salary to your favourable consideration, and if it is allowed it should be paid from the appropriation for Indian education and to date from the time of her appointment, September 1st, last.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $700 per annum, and she will also receive the bonus during the present fiscal year at the rate of $150, which will be paid on a monthly basis of $15.00 per month.

There is no space on the requisition form for the council to sign, or even give their approval.\n\n(2) That individuals may come on school property and take what lumber they require, because they have paid for it; this was done a couple of days ago; an outhouse was damaged & lumber stolen. A teacher cannot be responsible for property under his charge unless he has some means of protecting that property properly.\n\n(3) That there is a certain rough element here, who go about doing all the damage they can, one day evening, whilst at supper, a large stone was aimed at the house in the dark.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition, I am helped in the house, and I am about to coach a boarder for the Entrance Examination; this will be the first Indian pupil from this Reservation.\n\nI may also state that the South Bay Band had many opportunities to board with me; they living only 2 miles away.\n\nThe councillors of the Unceded Band compel their children to go to school, while the South Bay Band are very lax indeed in this respect, and there is no one appointed to enforce the attendance.\n\nI am very successful as Mr. Lewis can testify, but the chief of the South Bay Band should be notified as to the future conduct of his own band, and not come to the teacher to demand an explanation as to how certain articles for schoolhouse are obtained by whose authority.

Lloyd, B.A.,\nTeacher\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following for your consideration and further action.\n\nThe Indians are demanding an explanation as to how the money is spent, and as to who pays for the furniture lately granted by the department. They consider that I should get permission from their chief and the council before getting any supplies. Furthermore, they require me to place myself under their chief to obey any and all of his commands, as though I was myself an Indian. I am not wanting in humility, but I decline to receive orders from anyone but the department through its agent, Mr. Davis here.\n\nThey are jealous of the unceded band here, and as I have the majority of unceded pupils in my school, I must do my duty to both bands as required by my superior.\n\nThat I am boarding four pupils of the unceded band is justifiable in view of the fact that these pupils live four miles from the school, and eight miles from the nearest school in the other direction. I, therefore, secure their attendance in this way.\n\nSouth Bay,\nTeacher's Residence,\nManitowaning\nOct.\nNov. 14th/22.\nAs one of these pupils is likely to go up for Entrance Examination next year, I think it would be a shame to place any difficulty in her path.\n\nMoreover, I have a precedent in boarding pupils in your report for Indian Education, 1914, both here and at Wikwemikong.\n\nI should, however, refuse to live in such a large house without company of some kind.\n\nI have investigated the past record of this school and have spoken to Miss Lavall\u00e9e, who taught here last year, and I find that every teacher gets his or her share of persecution from the South Bay band.\n\nThe members of this band have lately stolen lumber, and broken up the interior of a poultry house used by past teachers, and wanted me to do so myself; when traced, they simply state that they are paying for everything on school property, and are therefore entitled to loot, ad libitum.\n\nThe Unceded Band have begged me to stay on here as teacher, as their children are making such rapid progress in English.\n\nI may add in closing, that I have 12 Unceded pupils, and 11 South Bay band pupils on my register at present.\n\nMy policy has been to do everything possible to help these people, I have even been called to visit sick babies of the South Bay band.\nI have commenced an English class for the winter evenings, twice a week, in my house, for all ex-pupils. I am choir-master at the church, and have altar boy's instruction at my house every Friday evening.\n\nI have given prizes for good work done, in the shape of money, to pupils of this band; in short I have sacrificed a comfortable life home-life in a town or city, with a good school, and club, friends, etc., etc., to come here.\n\nTruly then, this is more of a missionary life than anything else, and I am working, strictly, with the pupils of this mission.\n\nThey say that too much money is being spent on this school and house, but I may add that I have not even lead pencils to give my pupils to write with; I have only 6 for 16 pupils.\n\nThey have been to me to complain of the agent here, and to accuse him of spending their money for his own uses.\n\nYou will see from the above that, although I am willing, and have promised to stay here, some kind of protective measures must be taken.

Lloyd, B.A.,\nTeacher\nOttawa, November 21, 1922.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to conditions at the South Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are responsible to the Department and its authorized representative, the Indian agent. You are not obliged to take any orders from the Chief or councillors but, at the same time, you should treat them with due respect as possible, because if they become unduly offended with you, general conditions will not be very pleasant.\n\nWith reference to the boarding of pupils, I beg to say that the Department considers that this should not be done. While we realize that your motives are of the best, your action will, no doubt, be misinterpreted. It is possible that some of these pupils will suffer from the decision of not allowing them to board with you but it is considered that this decision will, in the end, prove the most satisfactory for all concerned.\n\nThe Department is writing Mr. Agent Lewis regarding the Indians taking the lumber. He is also being requested to inform them that they must not interfere with the teacher or the school.\n\nYour last requisition was received and forwarded to the Government Stationery Office on the 14th instant. This included a supply of lead pencils and it is hoped that these will reach you in the near future.\n\nWe are also advising Mr. Agent Lewis regarding the Department's decision that it is considered pupils should not board in the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

From reports received from the inspector it appears that the present teacher is fully qualified for his work and good results will be obtained if the Indians second the efforts of the teacher by sending their children to school regularly.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will take up this matter with the South Bay Indians in the very near future and it is hoped that as a result of your action conditions on this reserve, as regards the conduct of the school, will improve and that the Indians will not interfere with the teacher's work.\n\nI understand that the teacher has had three or four of the pupils boarding with him. While the teacher's motives are commendable, I fear that his action will probably be misrepresented by some of the Indians and, consequently, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of all if pupils were not boarded in the teacher's residence. Mr. Lloyd is being advised accordingly.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you in the near future regarding the action you have taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. D. McLEAN\n\nR.

After making these inquiries in this way I was informed that the teacher had a member of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band putting down some oilcloth and doing some work around the residence at the school and it was he who took the lumber to do some repairing which was required.\n\nThe chief and Indians of the South Bay Band are not interfering with either the school or the teacher, but on account of the members of the band not receiving any fall interest payment some of them are not very well pleased and they claim that it is the high cost of keeping the school open that is using their money and I know from what the chief has said Mr. Lloyd to consult the band for advice before he would resignation for supplies for the residence, such as tables, oilcloth for the floors etc., as they would like to keep the high cost of the upkeep of the school as low as possible.\n\nNo doubt but what Mr. Lloyd is fully qualified as a teacher and good results will be obtained if he remains in charge of the school as the children are attending regularly and are taking more interest in their work than they have for some time, but I might say that on account of the condition of the teacher's health he is not very well adapted to teaching among Indians and more especially in such a remote place as South Bay, and it will not be a surprise to me if he forwards his resignation at any time as he has taken a dislike to the South Bay Indians and is on bad terms with the Roman Catholic Missionaries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kitchikop. He is now living in a house which has been erected on land given to the school for a garden. He even walks on the road in front of the school watching any house movements, and he has been trying to advise the band to have no school or teacher; in fact, to sell the house & school.\n\nThe others are fairly quiet, but he is as active in the devil's work as a man.\n\nCould nothing be done to stop this one man?

Other friends along with myself have tried to give him some advice but without avail as he claims that he is old enough to take care of himself.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nI received today a month's notice to take effect on the last day of January.\n\nI do not know what is the reason for my dismissal because I have done my utmost to please all parties and I do not recognize one band or the other; I have always been neutral and treated all alike.\n\nA teacher is usually placed in an awkward position if dismissed after the new year; if it had been my fault I could have nothing to say, but what have I done to deserve dismissal when all other schools are filled?\n\nI have lived at South Bay since last September, and I know conditions better than anyone living outside of this Reserve. The trouble is not with the South Bay Band, but with three men belonging to this band who are continually stirring up strife causing the others to revolt against law & order. Since the last trouble, when Mr. Lewis warned these people to leave teacher & school alone, there has been absolutely no trouble with anyone; the attendance for will notice on my report is excellent (17.50) with only 28 pupils enrolled.\n\nI have just got accustomed to the children & had intended spending more of my time in looking after their welfare.\n\nI have always been free & open with everyone, even allowing these people to beg my last crust of bread. The only thing, apparently, that these people complain of is that they have drawn no interest money.\nfall, they even tell me this, although it has nothing to do with me.\n\nIt is very unfair on myself to have to remove from here at the end of January, when no other schools are likely to be vacant. As regards leaving, this is all on my side, but there are only those who are acting for the Butte Bay Board.\n\nI certainly expected to remain until the summer vacation or at least until March, especially as I have intended getting married this New Year's week.\n\nHave you no other schools vacant in which you could place me, in the event of this one being closed down?\n\nI am a returned soldier, incapacitated for my usual work as collegiate teacher. I can manage a school of this size but am not strong enough to continue teaching High School or college.\n\nWould you kindly reconsider your decision and allow me to either take charge of another school; or remain here until I secure a vacancy elsewhere.\n\nI am afraid that someone is very hard on me, also, I do not know, I try to do my work conscientiously and I am faithful.\n\nWould you be kind enough to answer me this letter after due consideration has been given to my past work here, and the success which is likely to result in the future; a consideration I think all teachers deserve, especially when they have no means of defense from refusals of persons who are only desirous of closing the school because of their own wants, and these people only.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam Henry Lloyd, B.A.\nTeacher\n\nIndian Affairs.

As soon as the school closes he will make out his report for the month and the same will go forth to the Department without delay.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that I understand that it will take all of Mr. Lloyd's earnings for December quarter to pay up the account which he has run in a general store in this village, and therefore, he has to ask the Department to forward whatever money will be due him at the end of the current month to reach here before the school closes, which will be on the 31st instant. It is his wish to leave as soon as the school closes and if his cheque for teaching during the current month is not here he will not have the means to pay his railway fare.\n\nIf the Department can see its way clear to forward an advance cheque covering payment of twenty one teaching days in the current month including the portion of bonus for the quarter which will be due Mr. Lloyd at the end of the month, I would most respectfully recommend that the Department would do so, in order that he may be able to leave as soon as the school closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-1, part 1)\nThe Minister of Justice,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to bring to your notice certain cases of injustice which have occurred during my term of office as teacher of the above school, in the fervent hope that, at least, a little justice may be done to one, who has twice sided in obtaining liberty & justice in the greatest war in history. Since coming here last September, I have noticed many signs of hostility and lawlessness, but the greatest of all, and the one little noticed, was an assault by two Indians on myself, to try and obtain the keys of the School and house, although I had had orders from the Agent, who lives 14 miles away, not to give them to anyone. These two men forced their way into my house and one of them seized me by both arms and tried to force me back; a very easy thing to do, as I have not been strong since leaving military hospital last year. This assault was reported to the department, who ordered the agent here to investigate & take any action necessary. Although a new chief was torn beyond repair, and I had to pay for conveyance to report to the agent, and board for four days during his absence, I have had no redress, but have been the loser, and am now laughed at by these same Indians.\n\nAt times, and often quite frequently, drunken Indians will use obscene language just outside my door. I might add that some of these men are very often in an intoxicated condition; they have even come into my house in such a condition.\n\nThis state of affairs is not temporary, as the last teacher also complained of this kind.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The ring-leaders are only about 3 inches tall. They have been trying to bring some charge against me, because I showed them an Injun Johnson, after they assaulted me; it was broken of course, and unloaded, but I felt justified in showing it, even if only to frighten them away, as I am the only white man around here for 14 miles. The revolver was only loaned me to try & fix it for a man in town.\n\nI do not, in any way, wish to go over the heads of the officials of the Indian Dept., but I presume that I have as much right to justice & redress as any other man. I write simply to ask you if an investigation could take place, not only as regards the assault, but also as regards other breaches of law & order against the laws of the Dominion or Province. To make this place safe, in case another teacher should be induced to come here, because to all intents & purposes, these Indians act like semi-savages, and once they hate, none knows what they may do. The fact that they are cowards to one's face does not make it proper for what may happen behind one's back.\n\nThe above respectfully submitted for your perusal, and if necessary, further action.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nWilliam H.

I wish to repeat our instructions of the 16th instant, File No. 19-4-3. You should personally close the school at South Bay, see that Mr. Lloyd pays any debts and inform him that he must leave the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-1, part 1)\nJanuary 25, 1923.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nOn September 16th, 1922, Mr. W. H. Lloyd called at the Department and made application for an Indian school. His qualifications were good and he was appointed to the South Bay Indian Day School at a salary of $700 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. As Mr. Lloyd was badly in need of funds, we made an advance for transportation expenses.\n\nShortly after Mr. Lloyd arrived on the reserve, he tactlessly aligned himself with the unceded portion of the South Bay Band and incurred the displeasure of the other faction. Furthermore, he openly took into his own residence boarders, four pupils, one of which was a 15 year old girl. This Department ordered a discontinuance of the practice of taking pupils into the teacher's residence, but Mr. Lloyd's associations with certain Indians continued to be unpleasant.\n\nEarly in December, after a wordy combat with two members of the band, Mr. Lloyd was scared off the reserve and he remained in Manitowaning a few days until our agent, Mr. R. J. Lewis, had poured oil on the troubled waters. Our representative reported that, as the teacher could not live in harmony among the Indians, and as he was on bad terms with the missionary, it would be advisable to close the school.\n\nIn December the Department gave Mr. Lloyd a month's notice, and, when we learned from our agent that he was about to marry a 15 year old Indian girl, there was directed a definite notice of dismissal as from January 31st. It was hoped that such action would result in an indefinite postponement of the alliance, which, at best, would be unfortunate.\n\nMr. Lloyd has written several letters to the Department, appealing against our decision; he has interested Mrs. Wilson of the Red Cross Society of this city; he has directed communications to the Minister of Justice and to His Excellency the Governor General.\n\nThis Department prepared cheques for Mr. Lloyd's salary and bonus up to the end of the current month - a total of $895. These were directed to Mr. Agent Lewis with instructions to personally supervise the closing of the school and residence, to see that Mr. Lloyd settled any accounts incurred by himself and to have him leave the reserve.\nJanuary 27th, 1923.\n\nSuperintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. McKenzie,\n\nRa W.H. Lloyd, South Bay, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe above named has written us several times regarding difficulties in which he finds himself as teacher on your reserve at South Bay, Manitouining.\n\nIt was intimated to us that his services were to be terminated with your Department at the end of the present month. It would appear that Lloyd is not in good health and we are endeavouring to have his case taken up by the D.S.C.R.\n\nKindly let us know what disposition has been made of this man's case in order that we may proceed to do what we can for him in the way of treatment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.M.

Lloyd, Teacher of the South Bay Indian Day School, and in reply I wish to state that early in December this Department gave Mr. Lloyd notice that his services would be discontinued at the end of the current month. As we wished to make it possible for Mr. Lloyd to leave the reserve promptly, about two weeks ago we directed our agent cheques for salary and bonus, totalling $295.00. This payment was in full, and our representative was requested to see that Mr. Lloyd settled any accounts that he had incurred and that he left the reserve.\n\nI believe Mr. Lloyd will be more independent, financially, than he has been for some months. When he presented himself to the Department for a position in September, last, we had to make an advance of $50 to enable him to proceed to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Box 384,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, 23rd January, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit, herewith, a copy of a letter from Mr. Lloyd who is apparently employed under your Department.\n\nI shall be grateful if you can let me know what answer I should give him.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor General's Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nSouth Bay\nTeacher's Residence,\nManitowaning,\nManitoulin Island, Ont.\nJan.11th, 1923.\n\nH.R. Earl Byng,\nRideau Hall,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nI am taking a great liberty in writing to you in this manner, and I am hoping that my letter may be read by you, and that you may use your influence in my case, although you must have more distressing cases which come under your notice.\n\nI am a fully qualified School-master, a graduate in arts, but owing to war disability, I have had to take charge of small elementary schools, but I hope, in the near future, to be able to take up my old work as a specialist in Classics, etc.\n\nI have been very weak and unwell since I came out of hospital, and I was actually a patient at the Christie Street Hospital, Toronto, when Your Excellency visited that institution last year.\n\nLast September, on my return from a visit to my parents in the old country, I was sent down here by the Department of Indian Affairs, to take charge of the above school. The trip, which had been mainly for my health, cost me a great deal of money. I was therefore glad to get into a position on my return. I understood from the officials that my position as teacher was for a year's duration, at least. I therefore did not commence saving any money, and having to supply my own food, etc.\netc. I was barely able to pay my way for the first two months, so that I have practically nothing saved up. During my sojourn here as teacher, I have given myself body and soul to the work before me, I have tried to be warm, generous hearted to all. I had even intended giving myself entirely to this work among the Indians. God only knows how I have tried. But it is generally admitted that I have the most difficult school, and people generally, to deal with. There has been trouble with a small band of Indians, and I may be guilty of lack of tact in dealing with these people. But I was inexperienced among a people of whom I knew nothing, that is the best excuse that I can make. Moreover, I was positive of success and only needed time to work myself into the confidence of these people. Success was apparent already, and 1200 of the Indians have already testified to my ability as a teacher, and only about 20 men are against me. It is pleasing these few men of the South Bay band, that the Department has decided to close this school on the 31st inst. without giving me a chance to have the case investigated, or to find another school, it being the wrong time of the year to find vacancies. I feel hurt, because I gave up a head-mastership to go overseas as a soldier, and now I am about to be thrown out of employment, owing to a few men who have always given trouble to every teacher here, so far.\n\nI am asking for nothing more than justice and fair play, from a government and country which I tried to serve faithfully, and I hope and pray, with all my heart, that Your Excellency may use your influence in having my services retained as teacher, at least until March 31st, or June 31st.\n\nThe Department of\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has written me to the effect that they have nothing to say against my ability as a teacher. I love my work here, and am not working for the salary, but in order to gain experience and so fit myself for the future. This is my first position since the war, and I want to carry on and be faithful in my duties in training future citizens for this great Dominion.\n\nThanking Your Excellency in anticipation,\n\nI have the honour to remain\n\nYour Excellency's obedient servant.\n\n(SD.) William H. Lloyd, B.A. (oxon)\n\nTeacher.\nJanuary 25, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Sladen:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a copy of a communication to His Excellency from Mr. W. H. Lloyd, Teacher of the South Bay Indian Day School, on Manitoulin Island.\n\nMr. Lloyd is, I believe, a returned soldier, and when he applied for a position in September, last, this Department was pleased to give him an opportunity. Not long after he commenced duties, he was hopelessly involved in the petty squabbles of the Indian band, and, generally speaking, outside of the classroom, he has been very tactless in all his associations.\n\nMr. Lloyd is, to put it mildly, a very excitable type and he has been guilty of some astonishing actions. In December we requested his resignation, to take effect at the end of the current month. Our representative is to hand him his salary and bonus cheques, and I understand that he will be more independent, financially, than he has been for some months.\n\nIt would be advisable to state to Mr. Lloyd that you have learned the Department of Indian Affairs has already taken action, and that due consideration has been shown in his case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nArthur F.

Lloyd, teacher of South Bay School, writing to the Department to the effect that the Indian Council at Wikwemikong, in December, passed a resolution offering to Mr. Lloyd, from band funds, the sum of $15 for his expenses at the time he closed the school and left the reserve. I have the honour to report that I have not received any such resolution from the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band and today I have been talking with the secretary of the band and he informed me that no such a resolution was passed in council, at Wikwemikong.\n\nI cannot recommend that the $15 in question be paid to Mr. Lloyd out of the funds of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band for two reasons, in the first place no such a resolution was passed by the council at Wikwemikong, and in the second place I consider that Mr. Lloyd has received ample payment from the Department for the number of days he taught at South Bay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Feb. 2, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 158-31 of the 30th ultimo, advising the Department that the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band did not pass a resolution relative to paying certain expenses of Mr. Lloyd, late teacher at the South Bay Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Yesterday I went to South Bay and found everything in the School building and residence in good order. An inventory of all the articles was made, then the buildings were securely locked.\n\nI enclose herewith a voucher in favour of Messrs. J.G.Irving & Co., amounting to $1.75 for a padlock and hasp I purchased to lock the front door of the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Feb. 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 158-31 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the closing of the South Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state we are pleased that you found everything in order, and I trust that the property of the Department is properly safeguarded until such time as a school is re-opened at this point. A few months without teaching activity may have a salutary effect upon certain members of the South Bay Band. They will have to learn that the teacher at the school can be successful only with the cooperation of the Indian parents.\n\nThe account of Messrs. J. C. Irving & Co. is being dealt with on another file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nI have this day received a communication from His Excellency, the Governor General, the Canadian Ex-soldier's fund, in which he states that your department has given me every consideration.\n\nI do not quite see the truth of this statement, but I shall again write to His Excellency, and get all the connected band of Indians to testify to the treatment accorded to me, while employed as teacher at Long Bay. I will not let this matter drop until some satisfaction has been given, and the organization to which I belong (the District) will bring the matter to Parliament if no other means are available.\n\nIn the first place, I have been dismissed, yet I only received $30 for September last, in spite of the fact that a teacher who puts in 200 teaching days during the year, as I would have done had I continued, would be entitled to full pay, and all arrears would be paid in full.\n\nThe salary charges, when they received by the agent, were noticed to be about $50 short, with a statement that I had received $50 advance on October 13th, but how the agent has no trace of this in his books; he knows that I received my Sept. salary (not advance), but he is certain that no advance came through his office. I must forget, therefore, $50 to the government, for what reason?\n\nI cared for the fires all through January myself, but I have received no salary as caretaker so far.\n\nYou will not see me grant me the fees of a parent.\ntour, or the pur\u00e9e of my board for 4 days, except after the assault.\n\nInstead, you leave this matter to the Agent, who does not, very often, even take a trip to South Bay to investigate matters, I who is partial to one band, a fact which was never guilty of.\n\nEven in your own case, you do not know anything about the vicinity of my last school; you just go by what the Agent says, in spite of the fact that 1200 Indians can testify to my good behavior while at South Bay. They even wanted me to stay as their own private teacher.\n\nInstead of closing down the school in December, you waited until all other schools were filled, so that I should be out of employment all through the winter.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I would go through fire water to get satisfaction; I am just the influence to bring this matter forward, because I offered my life, my all for this unprofitable journey. I know not what effects perhaps not from this journey, but from its publication.\n\nBelieve me, none is more loyal than I am, but I am also a believer in truth, and an impartial investigation should have followed any disturbance at South Bay.\n\nThe Agent knows nothing about the reserve, for he is very seldom there. I only take truthful tales from members of the South Battle Bay Band, who can believe or trust an Indian, anyhow, I who know better than a teacher the fruits of a community's worth.\n\nYou may have turned a deaf ear to the Red Cross' petition, but believe me, this matter will arise again, and will receive greater consideration at your hands, when it reaches the proper authorities, and eyes are opened.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam H.

She claims to have had upwards of ten years experience teaching in Indian Schools and holds satisfactory reports from different school inspectors on her work.\n\nAs the applicant has had ten years experience in Indian Schools no doubt but the Department will be acquainted with her efficiency as a teacher; therefore, I would ask the Department to advise whether she should take charge of the South Bay School for the next school term.\n\nUp until the present time I have not received any further applications for this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you advise the Department of the application of Miss Carrie Harrison for the appointment of teacher at the South Bay Indian day school.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has allowed this school to remain closed for some time with the hope that the Indians of the South Bay Band would realize that a school can only be successful if the Indian parents co-operate.\n\nBefore considering Miss Harrison's application, the Department desires a definite recommendation from you regarding the advisability of re-opening this school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that the present teacher intends to resign and therefore it will be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher for the next school year. No action need be taken by you in carrying out the repairs mentioned in our letter of the 20th instant, which were brought to the attention of the Department by the Separate School Inspector in a report on his inspection of this school.\n\nWhen the school closes, you should arrange to have the building properly secured and all furniture and school material stored. It may be possible to utilize some of the classroom material at other schools, and, if so, you may have the same transferred where required. A list of school material and classroom equipment, as well as any furnishings in the teacher's residence, remaining on hand after any distribution to the other schools is made should be prepared and forwarded for the information of the Department.\n\nThe necessary arrangements should be made when the Spanish Residential School re-opens after the summer holidays to have the Indian children referred to by you placed in that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Cold air comes in from the floor and by cracks in the door, and as some of the stove pipes are too hot, they can make no fire. She said that the chief has been notified already twice by her predecessor, but that he only had the school whitewashed and went away. I answered that Mr. Agent Stone was the right man to receive her complaints and to see that the necessary reparations may be made at once.\n\nShe added that there were no books except a few ones, all in pieces, no chalk, etc., etc., in order that she might teach with no interruption.

In reply I beg to say that Mr Agent Sims was authorized, on the 30th ultimo, to have certain repairs called for by the Chief, and no doubt this work has been done. Referring to the question of the scarcity of books, I have to say that there is no necessity for such a state of affairs as upon receipt of a requisition from the teacher, stating what is required, a sufficient supply will be forwarded without delay from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nI may add, with further reference to the school building, that Mr Inspector Freidergast, in his last report, dated 30th May, 1899, states that it is quite suitable for school purposes. It would also appear that the teacher might not have suffered from cold, had she built a fire in the stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. G. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the School building at South Bay is totally unfit for the purpose for which it is used.\n\nThe building is of logs the first tier of which are sunk in the ground, the roof leaks badly, the floor originally made from rough boards is very uneven and about half rotten, the window sash are worn out, the ceiling is very low, in fact a new building is required. It would not be wise to expend any money on the old log building. Also suitable desks are required to the number of sixteen.\n\nIt will cost about five hundred Dollars to make the above mentioned repairs.\n\nIf possible steps should be taken at once to have the work done before winter sets in as it will not be possible to spend another winter in the old building. As the work cannot be done in time for the reopening of the school another building in the village can be rented for school purposes for a time, I am informed by the teacher.\n\nTrusting this matter may meet with the approval of the Department and steps taken at once to make the repairs.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He recommends the erection of a new building.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to Mr Inspector O'Brien's remarks concerning this building. He visited the school on the 7th June last and reports as follows:\n\n\"The schoolhouse is a wretched old log building too small to accommodate the whole attendance properly. In a small corner the teacher keeps her congregation alive. The efficiency with which they discharge their duties and their self-sacrifice and devotion to the reserve would warrant them in asking for more comfortable quarters.\n\n\"I would recommend a new building like that at West Bay.\"\n\nIt seems to me that it would be a waste of money to spend $500.00 in repairs as suggested by the Agent. It would be better to put up an entirely new building and I would suggest that the Agent be authorized to submit the question of taking sufficient funds from their capital for this purpose, to the Indians, as they have enough funds to their credit to stand the outlay.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kindly attend to this as soon as possible so that any work may be done during the approaching summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nG. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to Official letter of date 9th April last asking for a report on the condition of the South Bay school with recommendations as to the repairs that are necessary to the building.\n\nI have the honor to report that the building does require a stone foundation in the worst way and it will be necessary to raise the building one foot when the foundation is being put in as one end of it is very close to the ground and every spring the snow backs up around it and water runs through the school room. The spot where the school is built is under a large hill and the ground behind it is very wet during the Spring freshet. I had a practical stone mason look over the building and he offers to do the work of putting in the foundation, raise the building one foot, build abutments under the centre of the school of stone and complete the whole work of foundation including materials for the sum of $150.00. The name of the mason is Mr. Thomas Pollard and I would most respectfully recommend that he be given the contract to do this work for the sum above stated. It will be some time yet before the work could be proceeded with as the weather has been so wet that the roads around South Bay at the present time.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nare not in a condition to haul stone on but if the Department decide to have the work done it would be well to authorize same at once in order that the contractor may make arrangements with the Indians to quarry the stone and get it on the ground as soon as the roads will permit. There will probably be some plastering to do to the interior after the building has been raised as the plastering in several places is showing signs of weakness. The steps will also require to be extended one foot but this is only a trifling matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 20, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant reporting that a satisfactory stone foundation can be placed under the South Bay school building at a total cost for material and labour of $150.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to have this work done during the approaching summer holidays and also to make the necessary repairs to the plastering and the steps at the entrance to the building. A resolution of the band authorizing this expenditure from their capital funds should first be obtained and forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nG.

The South Bay Indians are very few in number but they are furnishing education facilities for members of other bands who reside near school and they are constantly complaining of this.\n\nWhen they passed the Resolution in 1904 authorizing the erection of the school building they did not receive any interest distribution for several times and there was very great dissatisfaction among them on account of this so that with this fact before me I am positive that they will refuse to pass a Resolution authorizing any further expenditure from their funds. On looking over the last quarterly return from the South Bay school I find there are 23 Pupils enrolled therein out of which there are only 5 children who really belong to the South Bay Band. The most of the pupils attending this school are children of West Bay Indians. On the 22nd of August 1904 in reply\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the same time she informed me that this was a second time that this had occurred, but, that she had not mentioned the matter in the first instance. I told Miss St James that I would see the Chief and ask him to exercise due vigilance in trying to catch the offender or offenders which I did. To-day the chief called to inform me that he was not successful in finding out who the guilty person was and further informed me that the house had been entered again. It does not appear to be the intention of the person or persons who break into the house to steal anything as at both the other times nothing was taken. It annoys the teacher very much for this kind of thing to occur and I think the best way to prevent a recurrence of this annoyance will be to have tight shutters made for all the windows that are on the ground floor and these put on and fastened securely so as to make it difficult for any one to make\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 3, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to have shutters made for the South Bay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.

As we are sure the boys must play in the yard, and the girls on the road or the boys in the road and the girls in the yard.\n\nLast but not least one good drain would be sufficient to keep the water away from the school and house. I am sorry to say I have repeatedly asked for a drain but in vain.\n\nThe school has been replastered but the walls are again cracking because the foundation so well built last Fall has been ruined by the action of the water and ice during the Winter and Spring. The foundation under our house is in the same condition.\n\nWe trust the Department will continue to protect us in the future as they have done in the past.\n\nThanking you in anticipation. We anxiously await your answer. We hope Mr. L.D. Sims will be informed accordingly.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nMiss Laplante & Job St. James.\nSouth Bay\n(Mantowaning P.W.

I was very sorry I had done so, as Mr. Lewis proved he could not control himself enough to give her a civil answer.\n\nHe has been displeased with me ever since.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-5, part 1)\nwe sent the plan to the Department last spring. As we cannot get any satisfaction from the Agent, we ask the Department to accept the plan we proposed. Mr. Martin who made an estimate of both plans reported to Mr. Lives that to move them and build an addition would cost one hundred dollars more than merely building the kitchen behind the present dwelling. One hundred dollars would not mean much for the Department, still to us it would be worth a thousand and it is of such importance, that if the Department wishes they may take this one hundred dollars out of my salary, as we would rather pay the difference in the cost if necessary than to have the present building remain where it is.\n\nThere are many reasons which urge us to appeal again to the Department and ask to have our plan accepted.\n\nShe would be able to continue our cooking class, later we can teach our girls sewing. At noon and before school we can watch the children better.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRev. Father Quin who visited the Department yesterday in discussing school matters on Manitoulin Island stated that it would not be long till the day school at South Bay would have to be closed for lack of attendance as many of the Indians were from that district.

Again on Oct. 6th another account in favor of the same person was rendered the Department amount $6.30, this was also paid.\n\nNow as these two accounts amounted to a trifle more than the yearly amount I was told had been authorized and on receipt of a third account last month I immediately wrote Miss St. James the teacher at South Bay as follows. *date Jan. 2, 1912. Madam, I am in receipt of bills aggregating the sum of $6.30 which I calculated your quarterly report. I presume the articles shown on the bills were purchased by you for prizes for the pupils. I beg to advise you that the Department under date 21st April last informed this Office that you had been authorized to expend the sum of $12.50 per annum in the purchase of prizes and as you have already sent in amounts amounting to $12.67 I do not understand how the present one comes at this time. Did the Department authorize a larger sum than $12.50 to you? If so, be good enough to send me the date of the letter and the file number. May thus I may take the matter up. The latter sent me was very plain and explicit stating that $12.50 was the amount authorized per annum.

Sir,\n\nOn April 21st, last, you were informed that the Department would make a grant of $6.25 each quarter for the purchase of prizes for the children attending the West Bay, Bay Sheshawaganing, South, and Wikwemikong schools. This authority has evidently been misunderstood, as the teachers are sending in accounts for prizes to the extent of $6.25 from each school, which would be at the rate of $25.00 per annum. This is more than the Department pays at any school for prizes and is more than can be allowed for these particular schools. The intention was to make a small grant of $6.25 for the combined schools quarterly, instead of a total grant of $6.25 as at the end of the year for each school. The agents are being advised that the Department cannot pay this large grant for prizes, but, as the sum of $6.25 may be a little small, the sum will be changed to $10.00 per annum for each school, or $2.50 quarterly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Hug. A Papineau, S.J.,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Rev. Father Pupineau, who was informed of the grant, has evidently misunderstood the Department's letter and told the teachers that the grant would be $6.25 for each quarter.\n\nThe amount, $6.25, for the year may be a little small and the Department has decided to increase it to $10.00, or $2.50 per quarter for each of the two schools. You will be good enough to at once advise the teachers accordingly, so that they will not make purchase for the current quarter over that amount. In the meantime as the other prizes were evidently purchased in good faith you should submit the accounts for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. L. D.

By raising the\nbuilding would not help matters any on account of snow\nbeing flooded. It would be out of the question for the\nDepartment to consider putting a ditch on the side of\nthe hill above the school as it would cost hundreds of\ndollars to clear the ground and dig through the rock\nand gravel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The shed should also be put in such condition that the water will not interfere with the opening and closing of the door or the procuring of wood therefrom.\n\nThe Department has no profile of the school site to refer to, but I am of the opinion that it should be an easy matter to board up the bottom of shed on the high side to prevent the water entering the shed and if necessary to raise the grade of shed floor with earth or stone and provide a door opening on a side where the ice cannot accumulate. If this is possible and can be economically done, you should attend to this at the same time as the repairs are being made to the closets.\n\nThe expenditure, on account of the shed, should not however, exceed $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst.
