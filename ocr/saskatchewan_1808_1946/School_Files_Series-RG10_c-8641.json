The absence of shades on the windows with southern exposure results in serious inconvenience to students. It is recommended that translucent shades be provided to overcome this difficulty.\n\nAnother serious difficulty results from the lack of blackboard space. For a class of thirty-four students there is one section of blackboard 4' x 5'. About one-third of this has been broken out.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| May 14 | 20# Nails crib well SOUTH PEGUIS DAY SCHOOL | $2.40  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I am enclosing, herewith, Indian Day School Construction Reports #2, 3 and 4. I have changed these to plan #888 as requested. The three old schools are not in bad condition but will have to be covered with insul brick and the ceiling insulated.\n\nI note your remarks regarding the putting of the schools together and that the Engineering Branch do not believe that this would be practical. I disagree with the Engineering Branch as these buildings are in good condition. If the cold air was run along the walls and taken from the back end of the school the gravity system would work. I have put furnaces in buildings and used the above method and same has proven satisfactory.\n\nI do not consider the four-room school would be practical owing to the road conditions on this reserve and as you state this will not change for a number of years.\n\nA requisition will be forwarded at a later date for material and labour on schools #2, 3 and 4.\n\nThe difficulty experienced at the Big Eddy School I believe has been caused by the fact that they did not put in a proper furnace. The present heating unit is a Camp comfort heater, boxed in, and there is not sufficient air intake, therefore the classrooms cannot be properly heated. When in Ottawa I intended to take this matter up with you and to request that a new furnace be put in this school. At the present time we have a furnace at The Pas, which was taken from God's Lake. This is a coal furnace but as there is a great deal of wood at The Pas and as the cutting of the wood employs the Indians I would not\nrecommend installing this furnace.\n\nR. S.

F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Building of School at Fisher River Agency.\n\nRegarding the above mentioned construction, since putting further considerable thought on this matter, I have come to the conclusion that it would be much better to construct three single school rooms, without residence, rather than building a three room school at the Fisher River Agency as originally suggested by me.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we will be having a constant increase of pupils, and two rooms in each case will eventually be very crowded.\n\nI am attaching hereto a sketch - showing the additions which I recommend be made to the schools. They will be about ten feet from the present schools, and will be either on the sides or the ends. The plan I am forwarding calls for the heating to be placed in the centre of the two rooms, which would also allow for extra cloakrooms; and when the present rooms become overcrowded, we could take down the present cloakroom partitions and enlarge the rooms at very little cost - which would make provision for an additional ten children.\n\nThe present schools are not insulated, and as a result are very cold; and as you know by our previous correspondence, we are burning an excessive amount of coal. If the schools were built as I suggest, I would recommend putting brick siding on the outside of the old school as well as the additional classroom - thus making the two individual buildings and the centre heating plant look like one building.\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6244, file 534-5, part 4)\nAlso, I would recommend that the floors and ceilings in the old school be insulated. This would cut the heating costs, and by having the heating plant placed between the two rooms, it would cut down the cost of the whole heating system; and would, I think, make a much better heating unit.\n\nThe provision for furnace between the two schools should not be too expensive, and would draw the cold air from the bottom of both rooms, while the hot air would be expelled through vents near the ceiling.\n\nKindly let me know your thoughts re the above, and if you approve I will be able to get an estimate of the cost of building in between the two schools.\n\nR.

At the present time, no provision is made for supervising principals to authorize purchases for local school needs. All such matters must be referred to the Indian Superintendent concerned. Therefore, any articles which you consider are required for classrooms under your direction should brought to his attention and he, in turn, can apply to the Department for authority to expend the funds necessary.\n\nI would suggest that you forward a requisition for standard items of school supply such as scribblers, pencils, etc., for use as a small emergency stock. Some of our other supervising principals have done this and it ensures that they have on hand a few essential items which can be used in the event of a teacher running short.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I asked Major MacKay for his observations, and attached hereto is a memorandum of the 27th of February from the Director on the subject.\n\nIt will be noted that the Director is of the view that there will be no compensation payable in this case. It may be that the Power Company may be going down the road and not in individual Indian location. If this be the case, then the agreement as originally submitted is satisfactory. If it is to cross any Indian's holding, then no such crossing can be made without the Company paying an agreed compensation.\n\nYou may wish to discuss this matter further with the Director.\n\n[Signature]\nLegal Adviser.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION.\n\nThis is with reference to the Legal Adviser's memorandum dated March 4th immediately hereunder and our conversation regarding the agreement between His Majesty and the Manitoba Power Commission for the installation of a power line on the Peguis Indian Reserve.\n\nI discussed the matter further with Mr. Cory and I understand that the Indians have the right to compensation. If the Commission wishes to proceed then it must be prepared to pay an agreed compensation. It has been suggested that in view of the fact that the Indians will no doubt benefit from the installation of the power line then they would probably be willing to waive the right of compensation. This, of course, would be a matter to be taken up by the Commission with the individual Indians concerned.\n\nYou may wish to discuss the matter further with Mr. MacInnes when he returns.\n\nG.I.

If allowed by the Department a small amount of school material will be necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. T. H. Carter,\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\nOttawa, March 25, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated February 17th, last, which reached the Department on the 21st instant, in which you request that schools be opened for the summer term at Deer Lake and Pekangekum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation and a school to be open during the summer months only, may be conducted at each of these points.\n\nWith reference to Deer Lake, I beg to say that this school, which was open for a short period last summer, was conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church and Reverend T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being written to and requested to secure the services of a teacher for the summer term of 1916.\n\nWith reference to the school at Pekangekum, I have to request that you will endeavour to secure the services of a teacher for this place. The schools at both of these points should be opened at as early a date as possible, and remain open, if possible, until September 30th. The Department will pay a salary at the rate of $60.00 per month during the period which these schools are open.\n\nYou should submit the name of the teacher you may secure to open the school at Pekangekum, together\n\nT.

The Department are willing to send a teacher to Deer Lake and also for Pekangekum for the summer. If possible will arrange for Elijah Sinclair to go to Deer Lake. I am not sure of a suitable man for Pekangekum, but Mr Benson of the school department informs me that he has written you to secure a teacher for Pekangekum; but I pointed out to him that the only mission work that had been done at Pekangekum, Little Grand Rapids and Deer Lake, had been done by the Methodist Church. In future we will be prepared to make a nomination for teacher. However if you have a suitable man to send out it will be all right for this year. If you have not made a selection, Mr Stevens might be able to assist you.\n\nYou might let me know what you have in view for Pekangekum and I have arranged with the Department for Elijah Sinclair to go to Deer Lake.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) T. Ferrier.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter No. 420320-I of the 25th, ultimo requesting me to procure a teacher for a summer school at Pekangekum, I respectfully beg to state that I have received a letter from the Revd T. Ferrier referring to the appointment of a teacher for Pekangekum, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nI have no knowledge that any mission work has been done at Pekangekum by any church, but as Mr Ferrier states his church will attend to the appointing of a teacher for this place in the future, I most respectfully beg to recommend that Mr Ferrier be asked to secure a teacher for Pekangekum this year.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 26, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing a copy of a communication received by you from the Rev.

Original on File 427001-25.\n\nPEKANGEKUM.\n\nThe summer day schools at Little Grand Rapids, Deer Lake and Pekangekum did not operate this summer, I understand. In fact the work at these several reserves varies in operation so much that it is not very satisfactory from any viewpoint so far as I am able to figure it out. In fact so long as the Indians are of nomadic habits it is doubtful if schools can be of much advantage, as it is very difficult to assemble the children for classes owing to the erratic habits of life of the parents or guardians.\n\n(Sgd.) Jno. R. Bunn,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 5, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding the opening of a school at Pikangikum, for many years we supplied this by a summer teacher. During the war, the teachers on this river were withdrawn. We have re-opened the school at Little Grand Rapids, and would like permission to open up the one at Pikangikum about the beginning of the next fiscal year. Consideration of this will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 9, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 5th instant, concerning the re-opening of the Indian Day School at Pikangikum next spring.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that Mr. Inspector Bunn and Mr. Agent Latulippe are being communicated with and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAset. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, October 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has suggested that the summer school for Indians at Pikangikum be opened next spring. I understand that you have been in that country lately. I would be pleased to have the recommendation of yourself, and you might communicate with Mr. Agent Latulippe in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg...16th October, 1922.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,- re Summer Day School at Pekangekum for 1923.\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter, number and date as given above.\n\nThis has reference to the suggestion of the Rev'd T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, that a summer day school should be opened at Pekangekum in the coming Spring of 1923. For the summer of 1922.\n\nI visited this reserve during the past summer of 1922. I found conditions almost unchanged, so far as the residence of the Indians at Pekangekum is concerned.\n\nI am asked to submit a recommendation as to the suggestion of the Rev'd Superintendent, and to communicate with Mr. Agent Latulippe so as to obtain his views about this matter.\n\nI am of the opinion that the opening of this school is not advisable along the lines intimated. I feel certain that the results would almost Zero, and in a great measure the expenditure would be an improvident one. I arrive at this conclusion for the following reasons:\n\n1. Summer Day Schools are unsatisfactory; the season being entirely too short to accomplish much, the results being therefore unsatisfactory for the pupils and to the teacher.\n\n2. There is only a small part of the band who reside at Pekangekum in summer, not over one third of the band, and hardly that, the balance are divided and wander; a few have small gardens and live at the Old Fort, some live just west of Sandy Lake, and a few live near the Grave-yard, the balance wander. So that it will easily be understood why the children are not available. These Indians are a bunch of hunting Indians, Nomadic in their habits.\n\n3. These Indians assemble once a year at the time of the Annual payments, and as soon as this is over, they scatter to the different places above mentioned.\n\n4. It will be apparent that a school operated for Indians, that live as these do, will work under very unfavorable conditions and therefore the success of such work will be very doubtful from every viewpoint.\n\n5. The Indians also disperse to their hunting grounds early in August, and are pretty well scattered for their winter hunting operations by the end of this month. They take their families with them, to the places where they intend to winter and hunt. This removes many of the children.\n\nI have asked Mr. Agent Latulippe for his views in this connection and will forward same as soon as I receive them.\n\nIn my opinion it is only under very favorable conditions that Day Schools for Indians can be considered to meet with any success, that means a real benefit to pupils.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, Oct. 23, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have yours of the 16th instant, regarding the advisability of re-opening the Summer Indian Day School at Pikangikum. I have noted that you are not in favour of such action on the part of the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, in view of your recommendation, Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, will be informed that the Church Authorities will have to commence operations without financial assistance from this Department, and if the cause appears to be successful after a fair trial, we will again give consideration to the matter of offering a grant for the teacher's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, Oct. 23, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to the advisability of commencing a day school for the summer months on the Pikangikum Reserve. Our local officers have not recommended the Government grant in this connection, until such time as the Methodist Church Authorities and Missionary have given the cause a fair trial and are in a position to assure us of useful work.\n\nA day school activity at Pikangikum is distinctly missionary work, and this Department is unable to offer a grant towards a teacher's salary, until such time as we are convinced that the cause can be successfully operated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in reference to the opening of a summer day school at Pekangekum Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that summer day schools in the inland reserves are unsatisfactory, as the season being entirely too short, this has been tried in former years and did not prove a success. The Pekangekum Indians assemble once a year, at the time of the annual payment and as soon as this is over they return to their hunting ground with their children.\n\nFor instance, Mr. W.J. Hope, appointed teacher to the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School, came to Selkirk some two weeks ago for medical treatment, and he reported that on the 1st day of September there was not one child that attended school and do not expect them back till the next annual payment. In my opinion the short duration of teaching in summer day schools do not warrant the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.R. Bunn, Esq.\nInspector Of Indian Agencies\nIndian Office\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Today I am in receipt of his opinion.\n\nI beg to inclose herewith Mr. Agent Latulipe's letter bearing on this matter.\n\nI will not make any comment on this letter, further than to say that he practically agrees with me, and he quotes an instance and experience of William Joseph Hope, who is teacher at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nThese Indians are hunters, and to live this life in a successful manner, their habits are nomadic. The prices of raw furs for several years have been high, and continue to be so, so that the Indians are able to make a good living, and do make a fair living by their hunting. This district remains a good hunting ground, as there is practically no settlement of white people.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Agent Latulippe and commenting further upon the inadvisability of providing a grant for an Indian day school for the summer months at Pikangikum.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department is still more convinced of the fairness of the decision communicated to you on the 23rd ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Dunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 22, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 8th instant, nominating teachers for the coming academic year for United Church Indian day schools of the Lake Winnipeg district. I regret that the Department cannot favourably consider the provision of a grant for Pekangekum, as I am far from satisfied that a day school would be a success. Please refer to official letter of this file of October 23rd, 1922, in this connection. I feel that the proposed activity at Pekangekum is distinctly a missionary one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRe a teacher for Pekangecum on Berens River:\n\nThe United Church has been carrying on mission work here for many years and also the school from time to time. At present we have as missionary teacher, Mr. James Kirkness who is acting as teacher without the usual supplies from the Department. I would appreciate very much if the Department would send out such supplies as would be needed for about 20 pupils in grades one and two. Kindly mail them to Mr. James Kirkness in care of Rev. J. W. Niddrie, Berens River, Manitoba.\n\nI understand that certain repairs and supplies are required to fit up the building for classroom work. A list of the material has been prepared and sent to your Agent at Selkirk. Would the Department kindly communicate with Mr. Stevenson and if the request is reasonable, have the material sent out at the earliest possible date as the season for getting materials out to Berens River will soon be over?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGRD\nOttawa, August 27, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, announcing that Mr. James Kirkness is acting as missionary teacher at Pekangekum. When Mr. Stevenson forwards the list of repairs that are necessary to the building used as a classroom, consideration will be given. I am pleased to inform you that supplies required for 20 pupils in the primary grades will be directed to the teacher, in care of Rev. Mr. Middrie, Berens River. It is understood that no salary can be allowed for this activity at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nFrom \"The New Outlook\" November 14, 1928.\n\nWhere Paganism Survives\n\nGoing inland to the east from Berens River on Lake Winnipeg, to the Manitoba-Ontario boundary, Mr. James Kirkness and family are opening school for the children of the Saulteaux bands at Pekangakum, a point from which eastern aviators have brought out strange tales of pagan rites. Forty portages have to be crossed by the intrepid missionary teacher in taking his wife and children to their new field of labor. Eastern papers have been demanding that the Churches do something to bring light to the Saulteaux.\n\nCaring For the Saulteaux\n\nOur Church has been trying for years to help these people who are nomads by the very necessities of their situation, and therefore unwilling to live long enough in one place to permit of the carrying on of a school. Rev. Arthur Barnier, superintendent of Indian Missions, and Rev. J. W. Niddrie, of Berens River Mission, visited with them in 1921, and held services. Either Mr. Niddrie or Rev. F. G. Stevens, of Fisher River Mission, has visited them once a year for the past ten years, making a toilsome journey, and meeting with some encouragement. A few families are remaining at Pekangakum for the winter.\nBerens River and Inland United Church Missions\nVia Selkirk, Manitoba\nRev. J. W. Niddrie\nMISSIONARY\n\nPersonal. March 16th, 1929.\n\nRussell T. Frrier Esq.,\nSupt. Indian Education Ottawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast summer our people in consequence of a request from the people at Pekangecum opened a day School at that point, and it has been operated all summer and winter with an average of somewhere around 20 children. The Indian Department came to our assistance with a stove, roofing paper, and windows. We received no School supplies in the way of Books, &c., nor did we receive any mid day meal supplies. May I very respectfully call your attention to the fact that the Pekangecum people have been all Pagan; although we have made annual visits to their Reserve and tried to help them, it has been with very little success. Now I am told by our teacher at that place Mr. Kirkness, that there has been quite a turn over and some of them have been baptized into the Christian Faith. They are very anxious that their children be taught and are very willing to do all they can in the way of helping to erect a new School building, and teachers residence, free of cost\u2014that is as far as cutting the logs and building the walls is concerned. Now my object in writing you is to ask how it would be best to put this matter up to The Dept. of Indian Affairs. Especially the matters of School supplies, and mid day meal. Does this come within your jurisdiction, or shall I have to write to the Secy.\n\nLast year my requisitions lay for weeks at Selkirk, and the Indian Agent claimed he was waiting for instructions. I wondered how he could be, as I had written him and not to Ottawa. Please be kind enough to favor me with a reply and pardon my liberty in trespassing upon your time with this letter.\n\nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 8, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Hiddrie:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the day school activity at Pekangekum. I am pleased to note that some success is being realized. While it is true the Department did not grant any supplies for a midday meal or allow a stipend for the teacher, we did send, by mail, addressed to James Kirkness, in your care, readers, scribblers, etc., for the classroom work. These went forward about the first week in September, last. If a supply is now needed, if you will prepare a requisition, indicating what should be allowed, the Department will give favourable consideration.\n\nI regret that there are no funds to assist in the erection of a school building and a teacher's residence at Pekangekum. The Department believes it advisable to give this school a thorough trial before undertaking capital expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. W. Hiddrie,\nBerens River,\nvia Selkirk,\nMan.\nOttawa, May 6, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to purchase and forward a quantity of supplies for the furnishing of a midday meal to the pupils at the Pekanekum Indian Day School. The food usually supplied for this purpose at other schools consists of biscuits, tea, cocoa, Drimilk, sugar, beans, rice and salt. You should use your own judgment as to the quantities of these supplies that should be forwarded, and you should arrange for their purchase and transportation at an early date. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nC. A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nJuly 11th\n\nE. McPherson Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Selkirk, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find 2 sets of Quarterly School Returns. One of which is sent from Mr. Schuetze Little Grand Rapids. The other from our Teacher Mr. Kirkness of Pekangecum. The reason they are being sent from here is that they had no Blank Forms at the above named places.\n\nRegarding the School at Pekangecum please allow me to explain. Last year this was opened as \"A trial.\" I need scarcely say that it has proved quite a success with an average of between 16 and twenty pupils. It is then no longer a question of whether it is feasible to continue a School at that point or not, as it has been clearly demonstrated. Indeed the people are wonderfully interested in the educating of their children and have proved themselves very loyal to Mr. Kirkness in his work. The returns for this School have not been transmitted through your Office as the United Church have so far paid the Salary of the Teacher.\n\nWill you please be kind enough to forward one of the enclosed sets of School returns to the Office of The Dept. of Indian Affairs at Ottawa with a request that they will take action in the way of supplying the necessaries as on every other Reserve and Teachers Salary also. This School can be carried on successfully the year round.\n\nI am also enclosing Mr. Schuetze's School returns with an extra set for Toronto. Will you kindly give the same your signature and mail after sealing the envelope.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWill you please mail to my address I Doz Blank Forms re School Returns as I have used all of Mr. Street's up\n\n(H)\nBerens River United Church Mission\nVia Selkirk, Manitoba\n\nJuly 11th\n\nRev.

John W. Middrie of Berens River, addressed to\nMr. Indian Agent McPherson, Selkirk, Man., a copy of\nwhich I enclose, there has been an average attendance\nat that school of between sixteen and twenty pupils.\nThe average for seven months was fourteen according\nto the reports. In either case, there is every\nindication that a school is being maintained regularly.\nIn view of this, perhaps the Department would consider\nan allowance to the teacher of the usual $4.00 per\nteaching day. I shall be glad to know that this is\nsanctioned by the Department.\n\nAllow $3 for teaching\nday as he is only partly qualified.\nOttawa, August 30, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 24th instant which is concerning the Pakangekum Indian Day School, I have now to inform you that the Department will allow $3 per teaching day, upon the receipt of regular quarterly returns. Mr. James Kirkness, the missionary teacher, is only partly qualified, and the Department believes that a $3 per diem grant is fair. I note that there has been an average attendance of 14 for the past seven months. This grant will be paid to the Treasurer of your Society, as usual.

(RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-1, part 1)\n97 Craighurst Ave.\nToronto 12, Ont., August 16, 1930.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have just returned from a journey up the Berens River, which has given me great cause for gratitude. Twelve years ago, when I first visited that part of the country, everything looked hopeless and indeed some people thought that it would be impossible ever to organize the work. Great changes have taken place. The work seems to me to be well established at Little Grand Rapids and Pekangekum. It is in regard to the latter place I wish to write a few words.\n\nJames Kirkness, as you know, had for many years a poor reputation, but during the past fifteen years he has been steadily improving in his habits of life. He has become a real leader in all good things among the people. I was quite surprised when I reached Pekangekum to find the improvements which he had made there; he has cleared off a fine piece of land, has erected a comfortable dwelling, he has been teaching school in a log building which he erected but which is quite inadequate so he has proceeded to get out a set of good logs and has put up the walls of a building which will be very comfortable and commodious when it is completed. I think he ought to be encouraged by the Department of Indian Affairs in this effort, and I would suggest that when the recommendation of the Agent reaches Ottawa, it shall receive very sympathetic consideration.\n\nI was quite impressed with the transformation in the people who gathered while I was at Pekangekum. When I visited that place twelve years ago, the women and children ran away and hid themselves; I could not get near any one of them. At a distance I saw two little girls, not over seven years of age, crouching down by a camp fire, each with a dirty pipe in her mouth, pulling coals out of the fire to light their pipes. This was a sample of the general conditions then existent in the camp.\nREPORT OF JOURNEY UP THE BERENS RIVER, Manitoba.\n\nBy Arthur Barner.\n\n(From \"The New Outlook\")\n\nBy 8:10 a.m. Monday, July 21st, we were off for Pekangekum, 115 miles further up the river and about sixty miles north of Red Lake. By noon we were across the Ontario boundary line. The river here spreads out into Great Lakes, so there are not so many portages as there are in the west. The lake on which we camped is known as Sandy Lake, and is about one hundred miles long and about thirty miles broad. We reached the mission on the shores of Pekangekum Lake at 6:30 Tuesday evening, and by eight o'clock the people had gathered and we were holding an open-air meeting. If anything, the change at this place was more remarkable than that at Little Grand Rapids. It is nine years since I visited Pekangekum, principally because I knew that Mr. Niddrie was giving faithful service to the people. In July, 1928, one of our senior native members who was living at Norway House, was prevailed upon to go and live with this people. At tremendous physical labor, and with the co-operation of the Church and the Government, James Kirkness has built up a working plant which cannot be called adequate, but which has justified the effort, and in which he is working on a big piece of pioneer work. There are 225 souls in the band. When Mr. Kirkness went to Pekangekum two years ago these were all registered pagan and the government had been purchasing two years seventy have been baptized into the Christian religion and forty are members of The United Church of Canada. The contrast in conditions between the two struck me as a real work of the Spirit. When we approached the camp nine years ago the women and children disappeared, and they would not come near me. This time they came to the door nicely dressed and smilingly shook hands. Then the children looked ignorant and dull. I watched two girls, not more than seven years of age, squatting at a camp fire, each smoking a dirty pipe; now the children present had intelligent appearance, for the day school is well attended. There is real interest manifested in the services. The Kingdom of God is coming to Pekangekum. We called for a service to be held at 8:30 the following morning. Fifty people were present and we left them at 11:30 a.m. in the midst of hearty good wishes. We travelled until 5:30 that evening, when we reached Dunn Lake, where the people and the rest of the band were to meet for Treaty Payment. Here we found a village of tents belonging principally to the pagan people led by the chief, who had always shown opposition to our cause. We approached him.\nMarch 17, 1932.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nRe: Leyound v. Kirkness.\n\nMr. George Leyound, who is a trapper in the Northern parts of Manitoba and at other times resides in Winnipeg, came to see me about a year ago with regard to moneys then amounting to $163.50 owing to him by one James Kirkness for merchandise and food stuffs supplied to the said Kirkness.\n\nMr. James Kirkness was then (as I think he is now) teacher in the Pekangekum Indian Reserve, via Berens River and Little Grand Rapids in Northern and Western Ontario.\n\nMr. Leyound brought to me a letter from Kirkness to himself acknowledging the liability. I wrote a number of letters to Kirkness for payment but received in reply one letter only dated July 13th, 1931, copy of which is as follows:\n\n\"A.E. Bowles, K.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\nI received yours just lately which was written on June 5th. I was really surprised with George Leyound. I always thought that George Leyound was a man. I'll pay George the debt I owe just as soon as I have some money.

This Department allows a grant to the Church authorities to carry on the work. We are communicating with the Rev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, 299 Queen St. W., Toronto, Ont., with the request that he take up the matter of payment by Mr. Kirkness of his indebtedness to Mr. Leyound.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir:\n\nA communication has been received from A. E. Bowles, Esq., K.C., Barrister, Solicitor, Etc., 401 Huron & Erie Building, Winnipeg, relative to a debt owed by James Kirkness, teacher of the Pekangekum Indian Day School, to one George Leyound to the amount of $165.50 for merchandise and food stuffs supplied by him to Mr. Kirkness. As you are aware, Mr. Kirkness is teacher of the Pekangekum Indian Day School, which is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, this Department forwarding your Treasurer, from time to time, a grant towards salary.\n\nMr. Bowles is being informed that this matter has been referred to you, and I would beg to suggest that you take the matter up with Mr. Kirkness with a view to payment by him of his indebtedness to Mr. Leyound.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Account of James Kirkness.\n\nYour communication concerning the debt owed by James Kirkness, teacher of the Pekangekum Indian School, to Mr. George Leyound, seems to hint that possibly the salary which is being paid through this office has not been forwarded to him promptly and that this may account for his neglecting to pay his debts. Mr. Kirkness is, as you know, an Indian, and in many respects a rather unusual type of man. It would be rather difficult for us to get another man to fill the dual position which he holds at Pekangekum. He has, however, all the weaknesses inherent in his race when it comes to finances, and this is not the first time people have tried to collect their accounts through this office.\n\nI will ask our Superintendent of Indian Missions, Rev. Arthur Berner, who is well acquainted with Mr. Kirkness personally, to not only write him at Pekangekum, but also to take the matter up with Rev. J. W. Niddrie of Berens River, through whom Mr. Kirkness receives his salary cheques regularly. I think that probably Mr. Niddrie can arrange to have Mr. Kirkness give him authority to deduct a certain amount until this account is covered. As soon as we hear from Mr. Niddrie in regard to the matter, we will communicate with you again.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

He is an adopted son of Mr. Luther Schuetze, missionary-teacher at Little Grand Rapids, and has finished second year arts in Manitoba University. He has grown up in that North country and is thoroughly familiar with the type of work which is required of a missionary teacher in the area in question. Mr. Luther Schuetze has sent in to assist him his own Interpreter, who for a number of years has been helping with the work at Little Grand Rapids and is a well educated Indian. We are now prepared to recommend that Richard Schuetze be appointed as teacher at Pekangekum.\n\nIn view of the fact that the school was closed during all of January and a considerable part of February, would the Department be willing to have it continued during July and August - or such part of those two months as the new teacher deems advisable? The remoteness of the place, together with the fact that it is very unlikely that either Dr. Berner or myself can visit it during the coming summer, has added to our hesitancy in coming to a final decision regarding the teacher.\n\nHoping that you will agree to have the School continued during the summer, when most of the people are on the Reserve,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDecember 1st,\n1937\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Walter Mitch, the teacher at Pekangecum, of which I shall give you the main outline. He is writing about the possibility of having a school at Poplar Hill. He says the people there evidently want a school and he thinks we could count on a pretty good attendance, because the Chief is in favor of having a school and the people are in the habit of doing as he suggests.\n\nMr. Mitch goes on to state that the Chief says the people would be willing to cut logs and build the school, being paid in rations only, and that this is the way the school at Pekangecum was built. He would like to know if the Government would supply the extra rations of flour, baking powder, tea, sugar and bacon, to enable the school to be built. He would like these to be made available, so that the Indians could cut logs this coming Spring. He says that when he takes his holidays at the end of June, he would be glad to move down to this place while they built the school. In that connection, he says that he thinks there is very good reason why they should be encouraged, because the Indians now find it difficult to catch enough fish for their families at Pekangecum. He thinks that the Band might very well be divided, - which I gather they are, as a matter of fact.\n\nIn this letter, Mr. Mitch says he asked the Chief to find out if the people would like to have a school at Poplar Hill, say, for half the year, and at Pekangecum for the other half, and the report is that the people would like that. They hope the Indian Agent will let them have a school at Poplar Hill, where there are about thirty children of school age and lots younger. Would you let us know if there is any possibility of the needs of this district being met in this way - that is, by the Government providing rations while the Indians cut logs this Spring and then erect the school next summer, under the supervision of the teacher; and also whether the Government would make a small grant for the supply of spikes, shingles, windows, furnishings, &c.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your consideration of this matter, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have been unable to find the name of Poplar Hill in the last census report, but I am assuming that it is reasonably close to Pekangekum. The suggestion that this school should be built by the Indians - the Department providing them with rations - is a reasonable one, provided the school is actually needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

O. Plourde, O.M.I., in which he states that Rev. J. de Granpre, missionary in charge of the Berens River Mission, has been petitioned by the Indians of Poplar Hill for the establishment of a Roman Catholic Indian day school at that point.\n\nIn view of these requests, it will be necessary for you to obtain for the Department a very complete summary of conditions in the Poplar Hill district. We shall require a statement showing the Indian population; their church affiliations, if any; the distance that this Band is separated from the nearest Indian day school; and the church auspices under which the nearest day school is conducted. This and any other additional information which you can supply us would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., Dec. 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter No.200-11A. of yesterday's date relative to enclosed copy of letter received from Mr. Dorey, Board of Home Missions.\n\nFor your information I wish to point out that the Pekangekum is divided and living at three different points, Pekangekum, Poplar Hill and at Duck Lake. If a new school was built at Poplar Hill it would only be a short time until one would be requested for Duck Lake.\n\nAt Pekangekum a new school was built a few years ago and which has never been finished properly. Shingles etc. was provided by the Department but the Indians refused to freight same from Berens River. This material remained at Berens River until this fall and while at Berens late in the season I distributed this material to needy Indians of the Berens River Band. It was badly weather-beaten and would soon not be fit for anything.\n\nIn view of the manner in which the Pekangekum school was built and the Indians refusal to carry lumber inland as it is so hard to handle in canoes, I cannot recommend the building of a new school at Poplar Hill, which is not on Reserve land.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of December 2nd with enclosure.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. McPherson and attached is a copy of a letter I have since received from him. I would especially draw your attention to the third paragraph of Mr. McPherson's letter, which would indicate that the Indians are not greatly interested in school matters.\n\nI happen to know the teacher, Mr. Mutch, who for sometime taught at the Norway House Indian Residential School. He is a young man with great vision, but none too practical.\n\nI think the matter of a new school should be left in abeyance for the present and this could be given special consideration next year when the treaty trip is made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

A. W. Mutch, PEKANGEKUM INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30th, 1938.\n\n- Original on No. 125-13-2 -\n\nLast spring the average attendance for the two months - April and May - was 7.6.\n\nWhile the average attendance this summer during the month of August was 13.5.\n\nI understand the Department is considering changing the holiday season to April and May, and the above figures show the wisdom of such a course. Spring muskrat trapping is the cause of low attendance in April and May.\nOttawa,\nOctober 21, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn forwarding the September quarter return for the Pekangekum Day School the teacher states that owing to muskrat trapping the attendance is very low during the months of April and May and suggests that the holidays be taken during these two months. Please let me know your opinion of this recommendation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., October 31st, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 125-13-1 of the 21st instant.\n\nWhen treaty was being paid this summer it was noticed that a very small attendance was shown on all reserves during the month of April and May. At which time the Indians take their families and move out to the marshes for the rat hunt. It was suggested that it might be possible to arrange to have the annual holidays during that period and the schools kept open during the summer months when the Indians are all together on their reserves.\n\nSeveral of the teachers who were approached though that if this plan were adopted it would certainly insure a more regular attendance.\n\nAlso a lot of questions arise at treaty time and with the teachers away on vacation, it is not possible to get the required information on the ground, whereas it could be obtained if they were still teaching school.\n\nI would recommend that, if possible, that the period of vacation be held in April and May instead of July and August as at present on the Little Grand Rapids, Pekangekum, Poplar River, Grand Rapids and Berens River Reserves.\n\nKindly advise if the Department approves of this recommendation in order that we may inform the teachers in advance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently the teacher of the Pekangekum Indian Day School suggested that better attendance would be secured if the holiday season were taken during April and May. Indian Agent McPherson was written regarding this suggestion and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his reply.\n\nYou will note that he suggests that the holiday period at the day schools on 5 different Reserves in the Clandeboye Agency are taken during the months of April and May. While no doubt there would be a gain in attendance at the same time there are several disadvantages. Please give the matter your very careful consideration and let me have your views regarding Mr. McPherson's suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, file 125-13-1, I think holidays would least affect the attendance at Pekangekum if taken as suggested during the months of April and May, and apparently the teacher is prepared to do this.\n\nI have no doubt the arrangement would prove satisfactory for Little Grand Rapids, but at Poplar River and Big Grand Rapids the teachers are also the clergy and it may be more difficult to make this arrangement. The time comes at the 'in-between' season and it is doubtful if they could get out. Furthermore, travelling would necessarily be by plane and consequently very expensive. I think these people in the north should get out each year for holidays and this should be considered.\n\nAt Berens River, I hardly see the need for changing the present arrangements. The R.C.M.P. are stationed here and are available, usually at treaty time. I am further advised that the women and children do not always accompany their husbands, a custom more extensively practiced further inland.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Of course, he will have to submit his resignation officially to you.\n\nWe are not prepared to accept the statement of the Agent that the School should be discontinued for the period of the war, because it would mean leaving this Band of Indians without any care at all. As you know, it is very difficult to find someone who will go into these places and make it his life's work. You will also realize that this is not made any easier by the cuts in salary and deductions for this and that which have been enforced by the Department in recent years.\n\nI shall write to Dr. Cormie to find out just what suggestion he has to make for the carrying on of this work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

After that, we shall send in Mr. Herbert Smith as missionary, and are asking for confirmation of his appointment as teacher so soon as Mr. Rushforth's resignation has been received.\n\nMr. Smith is a young man, unmarried. He has had four months in Normal School in 1932, although he has not his professional teacher's certificate. He has substituted in schools near his home at High Bluff, and has been engaged for some time in the Residential School at Portage la Prairie. He is interested in Indian work, and will, I think, make a very capable man for the place.\n\nIf you have not received Mr. Rushforth's resignation, no doubt it will be forthcoming in due course, but, as you know, mail service in that part of the country is not always very good.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to supplying biscuits to the Pekangekum Indian Day School. The last return we received for this school was for the quarter ended March 31, 1943, at which time there were only 7 pupils enrolled. If the school has been in operation since that time a return should be forwarded. At the same time you should let me know what the probable attendance would be for the coming academic year. We will then be in a position to decide what quantity of biscuits should be supplied.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSioux Lookout, Ont., Sept. 3rd, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Hoey's letter of September 1st, File 125-13-1, with respect to biscuits for the Pekangekum Indian Day School. This school has been in operation all summer although the last return was for the Quarter ended March 31st. As you are aware, there is no regular mail service from Pekangekum. I had a note from Mr. Smith a few days ago, sent out by Indian canoe through Little Grand Rapids. He stated the school was operating satisfactorily and he expected an increase in attendance. It is estimated that the probable attendance for the coming year will average twelve.\n\nI trust that the foregoing will enable you to decide what quantity of biscuits should be supplied for Pekangekum without further delay.\n\nG.

Payments commenced immediately and continued until 7.00 P.M.\n\nJune 9th: Partly overcast with showers, W. wind, clear in P.M. Payments continued all morning and completed at noon. Meeting held with Band in afternoon. Here we were very fortunate in having a good interpreter. These people are very reluctant about sending any of the sick out to hospital. They had few request or demands and were very pleased with the clothing sent in during the winter.\n\nThe School and dwelling was found to be in much better state of repair than in former years and showed marked signs of improvement and cleanliness. New flooring is required for the school. This will be dealt with under separate heading.

These have been delayed on account of the late break-up, which made it impossible to submit them sooner.\n\nGifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nS:G\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Sioux Lookout Agency inspected during the month of June 1946.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAt Pikangikum a day school is operated for ten months. Mr. Smith is the teacher in charge. He has no teacher's certificate. There are 23 on the roll with an average attendance of 19. School was not in operation as the building was required for the paying of treaty.\n\nThis is a log building. The floors are in fair condition. There are two windows on each side of the building. The lighting is poor. The school is furnished with home-made benches, a table and chairs. The roof is covered with rough lumber over which is roofing paper. There is a large box heater. The blackboard consists of one piece\u201416 feet long\u2014which is not sufficient.\n\nThere are ten or twelve families who remain around Pikangikum during the winter, consequently the attendance is fairly good. This is a difficult place to operate because it is very isolated and no one wished to remain for long. It is difficult to reach except by plane and thus transportation is expensive.\n\nA.G Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe cheque for Mr. Smith comes addressed in care of the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada, 299 Queen St. West, Toronto. This is not very satisfactory as the Treasurer's office does not pay much attention to the name of the addressee and opens the mail, and we have to re-address it to Mr. Smith. I think it would be very much simpler if the cheque could be sent to:\n\nMr. H. J. Smith,\nc/o Board of Home Missions,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nI am sorry to have to ask you to make that change but I have no doubt you will be glad to assist us. Whenever there is a change of teacher, the address might still continue to be in care of the Board of Home Missions, and we shall see that it is forwarded.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDictated but signed in writer's absence.\nMr Smith the Missionary Teacher reports good attendance at the Day School. An old log building is used for the School and if all the children attend it is overcrowded, consequently I would not advocate any severe disciplinary action be taken or permanent suspension of Family Allowances under ordinary circumstances on account of non-attendance.\n\nA joint Nursing Station and School such as outlined in Co. Neary's letter of Jan. 9th, 1947, to Inspector Hamilton would be the solution to many of our problems at Pikangikum. If this scheme is not carried out here, in my opinion, the Band will continue to live in filth and ignorance and become ravaged with tuberculosis.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nApril 15, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWe have been advised that Mr. H. Smith has resigned as teacher of the Pikangikum day school as of March 31st.\n\nIt is recommended that William Everett be appointed as temporary teacher and drug dispenser at Pikangikum until such time as a new teacher is appointed. Everett assisted Mr. Smith during the time he was at Pikangikum and I believe he would be satisfactory until other arrangements are made. What Mr. Everett may lack in academic ability he would more than make up in giving the children, especially the boys, training in all sorts of carpentry, net making etc.\n\nThis school has been having very good attendance and it would be too bad to see it discontinued. Please let us have your advice on this matter as soon as possible in order that we may make arrangements with Mr. Everett before break up.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThis arrangement would also prevent any pilfering; Everett would probably take on the work for $50 per month which would be cheap and good insurance against loss.\nOttawa, April 22nd, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWe are advised by Indian Agent Swartman that Mr. H. Smith gave up duties at the Pikangikum Indian Day School on March 31st. He has been in charge of this school since April 1st, 1942.\n\nAs a temporary expedient the Agent recommends the appointment of William Everett.\n\nWe are approving his temporary appointment as teacher and it would be appreciated if you would arrange to nominate another teacher for this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Spence, student at Carleton College, in teaching at the Pekangikum Indian Day School on a seasonal basis this summer. Mr. Spence is 20 years of age and is an I.O.D.E. Scholarship student in Modern History at the College. He is interested also in missionary activities and his appointment has the approval of the Reverend Dr. Best, United Church of Canada, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nMr. Spence has obtained as much information as possible from Mr. Hotson at Carleton College with regard to teaching in Indian seasonal schools. Unfortunately, he writes his examinations in the latter part of May and will probably not be available until the last week of May. Therefore, it will not be possible to send him in to Pekangikum at the same time that the teacher for Deer Lake is going in.\n\nI would appreciate being advised as to the best means of transporting this teacher in to Pekangikum and also any details with regard to accommodation, furniture, etc., which might be required.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Pikangikum Indian Day School\n\nReference to Colonel Neary's letter of April 9th with respect to Pikangikum Indian Day School I wish to advise that the teacher should plan, if possible, to arrive at Pikangikum sometime during the first week in June. The ice should be out by that time and all the Indians in from their spring trapping.\n\nIt is suggested that Mr. Spence report to this office, if possible, early in June and we will brief him as fully as possible then on conditions at Pikangikum. (I will be out of town June 1st to 3rd on annuity payments)\n\nFrom Sioux Lookout Mr. Spence might proceed by bus or plane to Red Lake, from there he would have to arrange for a charter flight to Pikangikum which is situated some 75 or 80 miles further north.\n\nAt Pikangikum there is a log school house and a separate teachers residence, neither of which are in very good condition but should serve the purpose for a year or two or until such time as we can put up a new building similar to the plans we have. There is a Hudson's Bay Post about half a mile from the school, here staple provisions can be purchased, but anything apart from staples should be brought in from Red Lake. The teachers residence is supplied with a full line of dishes, pots and pans etc. consequently all he will have to be concerned with is food supplies.\n\nIndians at Pikangikum are rather primitive and very few can speak even a word of English, therefore it may be necessary for the teacher to secure the services of an interpreter, who is employed by the Hudson's Bay Co. This may be worked out on a part time basis but I feel that it is necessary and that some allowance should be made.\n\nA soft ball outfit should be supplied also football, skipping ropes etc.\n\nSuperintendent, Sioux Lookout Agency.\nApril 23, 1948.\n\nMr. G. G. Spence,\n39 Edina Street, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nPekangekum seasonal School.\n\nDear Mr. Spence:\n\nI have now received an answer from Mr. Indian Superintendent Swartman with regard to the above seasonal Indian School. Mr. Swartman advises that you should plan, if possible, to arrive at Pekangekum during the first week of June. The ice should be out by that time and all the Indians in from their spring trapping.\n\nIt is suggested that you report to Mr. Swartman's office during the last week in May, where you will be fully briefed as to conditions at Pekangekum. From Sioux Lookout you could proceed by bus to Red Lake. From there it will be necessary to arrange for a charter flight to Pekangekum which is situated about 80 miles further north.\n\nWith regard to the residence at Pekangekum Mr. Swartman has the following to say:\n\n\"There is a log school house and a separate teacher's residence, neither of which are in very good condition but should serve the purpose for a year or two or until such time as we can put up a new building similar to the plans we have.

(RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-1, part 1)\nPekangekum Indian Day School\n\nYesterday morning I had a visit from Mrs. Spence, mother of the university student sent as a seasonal teacher to the Pekangekum Indian Day School. In a letter sent to his aunt, he made the following observations:\n\n\"The house is filthy and running with mice. The Indians alone are enough to get one down. Many of them have T.B. and running T.B. arms (although as yet I have none in the school) and T.B. joints. Mrs. Hancock, (H.B. manager's wife) has never seen any place where the people die so fast. It is little wonder that the Indians are decreasing. Their tents are just in front of me and of course they never think of doing anything with the entrails of their fish but throw them out the tent flap. As a result there are plenty of flies as well as mosquitoes, black flies, etc.\n\nThe children don't want to learn English. Although quite a few understand, they will not speak it unless they are forced to. --- This morning I had 33 children all speaking Indian and climbing around. I really don't think it is worth staying here for the money. I feel that I would be going back to university tired and run down. I have lost some already but I think I can gain it back when I get straightened out. - - I have not decided how long I will stay here.\"\n\nHis mother is very worried about him and I have therefore instructed Mr. Swartman to accept Mr. Spence's resignation.\n\nBernard F.

In this letter he made the following observations:-\n\n\"The house is filthy and running with mice. The Indians alone are enough to get one down.

This is a matter in which he will have to make up his own mind and I therefore phrased the telegram accordingly.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSioux Lookout, Ont.,\nJune 14, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to Colonel Neary's telegram of June 9th regarding the resignation of Mr. Spence, we were unable to contact Mr. Swartman before he left Pikangikum but were able to do so at Favourable Lake where the Treaty Party stopped over on their way to Sandy Lake. In an answering radiogram Mr. Swartman states that Mr. Spence did not tender his resignation to him.\n\nPlease advise if there is anything further you would like us to do in this connection.\n\nG. Swartman,\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMrs. Spence phoned 18/6 and advised her son had resigned.

However, there was nothing that a little soap and lots of water would not correct. Upon the arrival of our Treaty Party at Pekangekum, we swept out the building and it appeared that Mr. Spence had not done much in the way of cleaning during the week he was there, prior to our arrival. Dr. Bell, Mr. Grew, Constable Thomas, and myself slept in the building for two nights and it is true that there were signs of mice.\n\nThe Indians of this particular band are rather primitive and have had no training, of course, in modern housekeeping. They depend on their dogs to clean up the fish entrails, but as I see it, Pekangekum offers a challenge to a man of determination and strong character. Mr. Spence did not tell me at the time of our visit that he was contemplating resigning, although he did say that he might not be there until September 1. In my opinion, he is about the weakest of all the summer Day School\nteachers we have in the Agency and it would be just as well if he returned home because I am sure that he would be able to accomplish very little by remaining on the job all summer.\n\nI was very much impressed with the other boys, particularly Alec Short at Deer Lake and Johnny Strang at Bear Skin. These lads are really working under difficulties and deserve a lot of credit if they stick it out for the season.\n\nG.

Neary\n\nReferring to your telegram of July 15 with respect to the Pekangekum Day School, I believe it would be a good move to place a teacher there on a year-round basis. It would require a few months to induce the parents in the vicinity to send their children in to school, but with perseverance and patience, I think this could be accomplished. I might explain that only a small proportion of the Pekangekum Indians live right on the Reserve. They are scattered over an area of from a mile to forty or fifty miles from the Reserve, but I believe if we could show them that we meant business in the operation of school many more of the families would make their headquarters right at the Reserve.\n\nThe living quarters have already been described, and while they are alright as make-shift arrangement, I would suggest that plans be made to establish a new school with teacher's quarters in the not too far distant future because the present set-up does not give much inspiration either for the teacher or for the Indians. It might be advisable to have the student who is interested in teaching there read Mr. Spence's report on the situation, as well as ours, in order that he will be fully acquainted with all angles of the situation.\n\nThe Pekangekum Indians are without a doubt quite primitive and to date have absorbed very little in the way of education or religion. Many of them hold to the aboriginal belief in good and bad spirits, also medicine. Nevertheless they are good people, and as I have already mentioned in previous correspondence, they offer a challenge to the teacher or missionary, and also to the Indian Superintendent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\n\nGS/MJJ\nJuly 28, 1948.\n\nMr. G.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nLast Spring I understand that the Department appointed Mr. Cecil Graeme Spence to act as summer teacher at Pekangecum. We were delighted to co-operate with the Department -- or probably to have the Department co-operate with us, -- and were prepared to assist Mr. Spence in doing missionary work. Now he has come back and the following is an extract from his letter:\n\n\"As you know I was appointed summer teacher at Pekangecum by the Government. I also intended to do missionary work. I was very enthusiastic about my work, having looked forward to it all winter and spring. However when I reached there I found that conditions had deteriorated during the war years. Although I expected bad housing conditions, I was not prepared for the poor health conditions. For the last decade tuberculosis has been on the increase. As a result it is not a very healthy place to be right now.\n\n\"The children lacked discipline to such an extent that I found individual instruction the only way to help them. You can understand that one of the greatest difficulties in the teaching of Indian children, who do not understand English to any degree, is the lack of a clear medium of expression. One has to show them before they understand. This naturally entails close contact with students suffering from T.B., as it is impossible to isolate known cases of it there and hospitalization is almost unheard of, facilities being so short outside. Most of the very numerous deaths there are from T.B. There are also open running T.B. Sores and joints among the people and children.\"\n\nI hope something can be done to improve conditions at Pekangecum. I shall be glad to know what the Department proposes to do, if anything.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MIT\n\nCopy to Dr. P.E. Moore\nAugust 4, 1948.\n\nPekangkum Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 29 with extract from Mr. Spence, formerly our teacher at Pekangkum.\n\nI had an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Spence when he returned from Pekangkum and the information contained in your letter presents the same picture that he gave me.\n\nI do not know what Dr. Moore plans for Pekangkum but we intend to do everything possible to establish a full-time school there again. Mr. Swartman has suggested that we establish a new school with teacher's quarters there, and thus make it more attractive for the teacher. However, our work in education must be accompanied by medical attention for these Indians, and I am sure that the Indian Health Services have similar plans for improvement at this point.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This time we require one with some experience in an isolated place. There are three applications which I believe would prove of suitable calibre:\n\n(1) C.H. Brown, Age 36, C.E. Six years R.C.N., Now Second Year Student in Anthropology, University of Toronto.\n\n(2) J.K. Arnold, Age 27, C.E. Seven years Canadian Army, Now attending Third Year Carleton College.\n\n(3) James Bond, Age 31, R.C.N. Service, Graduate Queens University, Now Anthropology Student at the University of Toronto and keenly interested in spending the summer at Pekangekum in order that he can work on his thesis leading to his Masters Degree. His religion is Baha'i.\n\nIf you are interested in writing directly to any of the above students, please do not hesitate to let me know and I will send you their individual addresses.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have just written to Dr. Best about the school at Pekangokum and would suggest that you contact him at once concerning this school. He can give you a great deal of information about Pekangokum, and I understand that Mr. Swartman has already written to you about the other information requested in your letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Kehler, for Indian Day School - I interviewed Mr. Kehler Saturday morning, and he did not impress me very much. I would not recommend that we employ this man, as he appears to be a very nervous type and I am sure would not prove satisfactory for Indian schools.\n\nR. S.

Neary:  \nRe: Pekangecum Indian Day School\n\nSince your letter of March 29th came to me in Toronto I was able to get in touch with C.H. Brown and through him, with James Bond. They are both attending classes in anthropology at Toronto University and are both interested in teaching Indian Day Schools during their vacation.\n\nLast year the school at Deer Lake Reserve was open in the summer and I presume will require a teacher this year. In that case I would be glad to nominate C.H. Brown to Deer Lake and James Bond to Pekangecum. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Swartman at Sioux Lookout. Let me know if there is anything further I should do about these appointments.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

No doubt he has sent you a report on this conversation.\n\nSince now I should like to prepare my plans for the coming summer, I would deeply appreciate any information you could give me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

Best, D.D.,\nSuperintendent of Missions,\n441 Somerset Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nPekanekum Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Best:\n\nAs agreed in your letter of April 19, I have written to Mr. Bond concerning the Pekanekum Indian Day School. I expect he will be accepting the position and will advise you further when he does.\n\nConcerning the Deer Lake School, we have already offered Mr. Brown another position in an Anglican seasonal school at Waswanipi. I am not certain as yet whether the former teacher, Mr. Short, will be returning to Deer Lake. If not, then I have another likely applicant in Mr. Peter Walmsley. He is highly recommended by his Professors at the University of Toronto and, like Mr. Bond, intends to do research work in Anthropology as well as to teach this summer. He is a veteran of five years in the Army, most of which was spent overseas as a stretcher bearer in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. He also has experience as an educational sergeant.\n\nI will write to you again when this matter has been settled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard S.

The block intended for the school is already erected, this I saw at the time of the annuity payments, but I do not know if it is the custom to provide provisions for the people while building, but it would seem to be in order to make a small grant for this purpose as the men cannot hunt while at this work.\n\nIf the Department allows the request of the Councillor I would respectfully suggest that these supplies be ordered from the Hudson's Bay Co.'s store at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, December 22nd., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th instant, asking that assistance be granted the Indians of the Pekangakum Band in material and provisions to complete a building for school purposes, I beg to state that you should submit a report on the present condition of the building with an estimate of the quantity and cost of the material and provisions required to finish the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAast.

I wrote to Mr. Middrie asking him to prepare an estimate and forward it to the Indian Agent at Selkirk. He has kindly sent me a copy which I am enclosing for you.\n\nI appreciate very much your interest in this matter. When I was at Pekanecum in 1930 I found Mr. Kirkness carrying on his school work in a very inadequate building, both too small and with a roof so low that it was oppressive, so I shall be very glad if it is possible to facilitate this work during the coming summer.\n\nWith kind wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB: NEF\nEncl.\nAPPROXIMATE COST of erection of new SCHOOL BUILDING\n\nat PEKANGEKUM RESERVE.\n\nThe walls of a building 26x30 have already been erected of splendid hewn spruce logs and a grant of $50.00 is asked for this, which is certainly a very small sum. All the other supplies and needed work is put in at the very lowest possible cost. The men have to be paid for coming down to Berens River a distance of nearly 250 miles for the supplies.\n\nTwo men from Pekangekum to Berens River by canoe.

Niddrie of Berens River has forwarded specifications and approximate cost for this work, a copy of which is attached.\n\nAn item of $1200.00 was included in the estimates of the Clandeboye Agency for the years 1931-32, and also 1932-33.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Arthur Barner regarding this matter. Owing to a considerable reduction in our Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year, no funds are provided for the erection of new buildings.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nAndrew Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF ANDREW IRWIN,\nINDIAN AGENT, Selkirk, Man., for month of\nJUNE, 1934, forwarded under date of July 2/34.\n\nOriginal on 75-125.\n\nAt 2.30 p.m. the party left by planes for Pekangekum and arrived at 3.30 and by 4 p.m. were making the payments, continuing until 9 o'clock. On Saturday 23rd June the treaty payments were completed and a meeting of the Band held and was brought to a close about 2 pm. I would like at this time to call attention to the condition of the Day School on this Reserve. It is a small log building, 16 x 18, hopelessly inadequate to house a teacher and 30 children. The roof is covered with spruce bark and leaks like a sieve, a most unsanitary and unhealthy condition, as well as uncomfortable. I trust that when the time comes for building schools, Pekangekum will be one of the first on the list to receive attention.\nOttawa, July 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is noted from your June report that the roof of the Pekanekum Indian Day School is in bad condition. Owing to lack of funds, it will not be possible to erect a new building at this point during the current fiscal year. If, however, some minor repairs to the roof would make the building more habitable, you may make the necessary arrangements. It is understood, however, that all expenditure will be kept to the lowest possible point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nAndrew Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., August 10th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 125-13-5 of July 20th, I would point out that the condition of the roof of the Pekangakum school house is such that nothing less than a new shingle roof would be worth while. The present roof is built of spruce bark and sufficiently rotted to leak like a sieve.\n\nFor the purposes of a school house the building is not worth a new roof, I would, therefore not recommend anything being done this year, in the hope that a year later there may be a possibility of a new building being erected at this point, which is after all the only solution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOffice of the Clandeboye Indian Agency,\n\nSelkirk, Man., Sept. 11th. 1934\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 75/34, amounting to $34.89 in favour of F.

(RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-5, part 1)\nSelkirk, Man. 22nd, September, 1934\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 125-13-5 of 19th instant, returning voucher No. 475-34 for $34.89 in favour of F. Berresford, Selkirk, I beg to return this voucher with corrections made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSeikirk, M., July 29th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith snaps of the interior and exterior of the Pekanekum School House which may be the poorest school building in the Dominion. The roof is covered with spruce bark and offers little or no protection from the rain and storm.\n\nThe Indians of this reserve under the leadership of their teacher & missionary, Mr. Richard Schuetze have shown marvelous enterprise in their efforts to obtain a new school. They have gone to the bush and cut logs 22 feet and 30 long without a horse or an ox on the Reserve, organized companies of men and carried these heavy green spruce logs out on their shoulders. You will notice that the logs are splendidly hewed and the block pretty well on its way to completion, with plenty of logs on the ground to finish the job. These Indians are excellent axmen and I have never seen finer dove-tailed corners anywhere, what they need now is material for shingles, flooring and sheathing. They have taken out their own stringers, joists, rafters etc. It will not cost much to complete the building. They should have six windows, one door and one screen door as well as screens for the windows, also nails and shingle nails.\n\nThey are entirely without desks in the old school and the old forms hewed out of logs as shown in the picture, but these they say could wait for another year, but they must have a heating stove and a table and chair for the teacher.\n\nIf the department will come to their assistance and crown their splendid efforts to obtain a school, $250.00 will complete the job, including the stove, table and chair.\n\nIn the event of this material being shipped the Indians have offered to freight same from Berens River, free of charge. The regular price is $7.00 per 100 lbs. I really think they are entitled to rations while freighting and while working on the school, another $50.00 would take care of this, say $300.00 in all to complete the school, Labor, material, stove, table and chair and perhaps in another year we could have the desks.\n\nIf approved kindly advise at earliest convenience.\nso that the same may be freighted in time to complete the building while the weather is still good.\n\nI need hardly say how much I appreciate and admire this splendid effort on the part of the Pekangekum Band and their leader Mr. Schuetze to make the completion of a new school so much easier to accomplish than it otherwise would have been and I sincerely hope their objective can be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing snaps of the interior and exterior of the Pekangkum Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that the Indians of the reserve, under the leadership of the teacher, have cut logs and proceeded with the erection of a new school building.\n\nThe Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $300.00, in the purchase of finishing lumber, windows, doors, screens, nails, etc.; a stove, table and chair and also rations for the Indian labourers while freighting and while working at the school. The cost of the freighting should be included in this amount. Purchase of the materials should be made from a firm on the approved list.\n\nI enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure in the purchase of the above materials to the amount of $300. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state, on each copy of your voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3361. It is understood that the erection of the building will be completed under the supervision of the teacher, at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nT. H. M. MacLennan,\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, September 19, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the enclosed voucher. As you are aware, separate files are kept for each school and, consequently, expenditures at different schools should not be included on the same voucher.\n\nWith reference to the account of the North American Lumber & Supply Co., Ltd., you should submit three vouchers; one for the supplies purchased for the Berens River U. C. Day School; another for the building material for the Bloodvein R. C. Day School and a third voucher for the building material for the Pehangshun Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This year he decided that he would requisition earlier, before the in-between season set in, then his supplies could go forward when navigation opened in the spring.\n\nThis school is all that Mr. Mutch states in his requisition. The roof is covered with bark and the building is not lined at all. Also stove pipes are badly in need of being replaced.\n\nShingles were supplied for this school and shipped as far as Berens River. However, the Indians from Pekangekum refused to freight from Berens River. This material was forwarded to Berens River by the former Indian Agent Irwin and had been at Berens River exposed to the weather for two years previous to my re-instatement. This material was badly weather-beaten and in order to salvage some value from it, I instructed the R.C.M.P. at Berens river to issued same to the needy Indians at Berens River.\n\nI would suggest that further shipments for the Pekangekum School be sent via Red Lake, Ont. which is much closer to the Reserve than by Berens River.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.McPherson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe secretary.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant you may arrange for the purchase of the undermentioned articles for use at the Pekangecum Indian Day School:\n\n- 1 Dust pan\n- 1 Buck saw\n- 4 Combs\n- 1 Wash basin\n- 12 Pkgs.

These supplies can be obtained locally at the prices shown on the requisition.\n\nIf this is approved, please advise at your earliest convenience as we would like to have the material on hand to forward by water transport to Red Lake by May 15th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS*R\nFebruary 28th, 1940.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE RE SIUX LOCKOUT AGENCY.\n\nInformation obtained from Mr. Swartman during his recent visit to Ottawa.\n\nDAY SCHOOLS : PIKANGIKUM\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Rushforth, looks after the distribution of destitute supplies and food stores in a warehouse at the school. The school is operated under the auspices of the United Church and has from 5 to 35 pupils. The Indians of the Pikangikum do not co-operate by sending their children to school. Hot coffee and biscuits are distributed during the day to the school children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-5, part 1)\nOttawa,\nApril 2, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo the Department considers it advisable to return the requisitions you forwarded in connection with the Pekangekum School in order that they may receive further consideration.\n\nWhen you visited the Department in February I understand from Mr. Christianson, Superintendent of Indian Agencies, that you stated that the attendance at this school varies from 5 to 35 pupils and that the Indians do not co-operate by sending their children to school. Under these circumstances the Department does not see the necessity for spending the amount of money you request on the building. Would it not be possible to put it in repair with a smaller expenditure?\n\nThe supplies requested for midday meal purposes appear excessive and certainly the quantities requested are more than last year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference is made to Mr. Hoey's letter of April 2nd, file 125-13-5, concerning building materials, etc., requisitioned for the Pikangikum Indian Day School.\n\nWhen discussing schools with Mr. Christianson I must have been referring to the Fort Hope School rather than Pikangikum. I regret not having made myself clear on this point. It is true, the Indians do not cooperate very fully but it is felt this will be eventually overcome, especially if the Hudson's Bay Company appoint a Whiteman instead of an Indian or Half-breed to manage their Pikangikum post.\n\nAt the time of my visit to Pikangikum last July the school building was in a rather deplorable condition. The building was very poorly constructed. The roof leaked badly which in turn had affected the floor. I promised the teacher an endeavor would be made to obtain sufficient material for repairs and I believe the enclosed requisition contains only the minimum requirements if the school is to continue in operation.\n\nI am not fully cognizant of the arrangement or agreement between this Branch and the United Church under whose auspices the school is conducted, but I do believe if the school should be closed for the duration of the war, it would not make a great deal of difference insofar as the welfare of the Band as a whole is concerned. The Missionary Teacher serves a very useful purpose in issuing destitute rations but other arrangements could possibly be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS*R Enc.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may purchase from firms on the approved list the following supplies for use at the Pekanekum Indian Day School:\n\n- 12 Rolls roofing paper\n- 2 \" Kraft building paper\n- 20 Lbs. wire nails 4\"\n- 10 \" wire nails 2\u00bd\"\n- 10 Lengths stove pipe 7\"\n- 8 Stove pipe elbows 7\"\n\n- 400 Lbs. lime\n- 1 Roll stove pipe wire\n- 1 Axe\n- 24 Yds. crash towelling\n- 12 Enamel cups\n- 2 Corn brooms\n\nAs mentioned in the last paragraph of Mr. Hosy's letter of the 2nd instant it is considered that the quantities of supplies requested for midday meal purposes are excessive. We are reducing the requisition in this regard and arrangements are being made to have the Purchasing Branch order the supplies which we consider necessary. This will not include the biscuits as we have not decided at the present time whether or not we will order biscuits in the same manner as in preceding years.

This was caused by high winds, also the boards forming the roof vary in thickness which does not permit a good job to be made with the roofing paper. We had a request from the Missionary teacher, Mr. Smith, also from the Chief and Councillors that steps be taken to repair the roof. For a roof of this description cedar shingles are the only solution. The roof on each side measures 33 feet by 18 feet which would mean sufficient shingles to cover about 1200 square feet. The cost of shingles purchased locally and delivered at Hudson is $6.50 per M. or a total cost of $71.50.\n\nPlease advise if authority will be granted for the purchase of this material.

Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nWe note from your requisition of the 28th ultimo, for shingles for the Pekangekum Indian Day School, that Mr. Swartman has secured a quotation of $71.50 f.o.b. Hudson on same. As we had no information as to the name of the firm who made this quotation, we called for tenders. The only quotation received was that of the North American Lumber Company, Winnipeg, Man., at $76.45, f.o.b.

It was proposed that the Indians whipsaw sufficient\nlumber for a sub-floor and then I would go into the matter of the\nDepartment furnishing enough flooring to cover the floor. Mr. Smith\nthe Missionary teacher is doing a fair job with the school work. He\nlabours under quite a handicap with more or less primitive\nconditions at Pekangikum, in addition to the Band as a whole being\nso little advanced. A large number of them are still pagan and\nprefer native medicine and superstition to anything the white man\ncan offer for their melioration. It is unfortunate that I am unable\nto visit this Reserve more frequently than just the annual call for\nTreaty payments. I feel that some progress might be made if we\nkept exhorting and encouraging them to improve themselves.\nIn the late afternoon a plane called to move us to Deer Lake where\nwe arrived at 5:30 p.m. At Pekangikum arrangements had been made\nwith William Everett to accompany the party as interpreter to Deer\nand Sandy Lakes.

The request was submitted to the Purchasing Branch, who state that they have obtained one quotation on Norway Pine at $65.00 a thousand. The North American Lumber and Supply Company did not quote but advised the Purchasing Branch that they would have fir flooring in their Hudson yard later in the season. Please let me know at once if Norway Pine flooring would be suitable for the purpose required.\n\nI would also like to know from which firm you obtained the price of $90.00 a thousand for fir flooring. This information was contained in your letter of March 13, but you did not state the name of the firm.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Phelan's letter of April 6th, File 125-13-5, with respect to flooring for the Pekangekum Day School.\n\nThe Norway pine flooring would serve the purpose quite as well as fir, especially if we were supplied with a gallon of paint to cover the surface. The quotation of $90.00 per thousand was received from the Beaver Lumber Company. This was for fir flooring, 4\" in width. However, it is recommended that the red pine flooring be supplied if possible, instead of fir, as the cost to land the material at Pekangekum will be considerable. It is suggested that the firm supplying the flooring be required to tie same in bundles of approximately 50' each.\n\nG.

(RG 10, Volume 6245, file 536-5, part 2)\nPekangkum Indian Day School\n\nYesterday morning I had a visit from Mrs. Spence, mother of the university student sent as a seasonal teacher to the Pekangkum Indian Day School. In a letter sent to his aunt, he made the following observations:\n\n\"The house is filthy and running with mice. The Indians alone are enough to get one down. Many of them have T.B. and running T.B. areas (although as yet I have none in the school) and T.B. joints. Mrs. Hancock, (H.B. manager's wife) has never seen any place where the people die so fast. It is little wonder that the Indians are decreasing. Their tents are just in front of me and of course they never think of doing anything with the entrails of their fish but throw them out the tent flap. As a result there are plenty of flies as well as mosquitos, black flies, etc.\n\nThe children don't want to learn English. Although quite a few understand, they will not speak it unless they are forced to. --- This morning I had 39 children all speaking Indian and climbing around. I really don't think it is worth staying here for the money. I feel that I would be going back to university tired and run down. I have lost some already but I think I can gain it back when I get straightened out. - - I have not decided how long I will stay here.\"\n\nHis mother is very worried about him and I have therefore instructed Mr. Smartman to accept Mr. Spence's resignation.\n\nBernard F.

McDonald, Esq., closed up the store here and removed to Norway House, promising to return in the fall. However, he did not, but he sent a letter to Jacob Nanawin, the head man of the band, saying, the Company were not going to trade here this winter. Hence I was left in a strait, not knowing what to do, being utterly opposed to trading, especially as the Agent and Mr Flett had said to my people, if you stand up for the missionaries nobody will help you, and I found out that those who had aided Mr Mackay had received some assistance from Beren's River. I had helped my people as far as I could without running myself on a rock, expecting a trader coming, but none came, and as they were in actual need I felt that I could not afford to sacrifice my influence over them, and leave them to the Wolf. So I decided to assist them all I possibly could, and accept of their fish and fur until a trader could be induced to come in, although it cost me much pain and trouble. Now that Mr Campbell has agreed to come in, I have turned all over to him to reimburse my outlay, and have ceased having anything more to do with trading. Hoping this will meet with your approval, ever remaining,\n\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Joseph Dargue.\"\nExtract of a letter from Rev J.A.McLachlan to Rev Dr Sutherland.\n\nDated Beren's River, Dec.31st, 1896.\n\n\"I enclose a statement which I have received from Mr Dargue, re trading at Poplar River. It will speak for itself. I need only say that from personal knowledge I know his statement of the case is correct. The circumstances of the case were very exceptional, and in my judgment Mr Dargue could not have done otherwise without seriously involving himself financially, or causing a good deal of suffering among his people. As soon as it was possible for the people to secure supplies from a trader Mr Dargue at once ceased trading. I understand that Mr Mackay has reported Mr Dargue to the Government, but I need hardly say that he has done so out of pure spite.\n\n\"I understand that Mr Mackay will leave here within a few days.

During my visit a couple of these pupils taught a class, one in grammar and the other in reading. I was very much pleased with the aptitude to teach and to govern that was displayed by both of these girls. I am of the opinion that they might make good in some of our Day schools on the Reserves. I would be willing to give one of them a trial at Poplar River on Lake Winnipeg, say at a salary of $400 for the first year, and if she makes good, increase it to $450 for the second. I have discussed this matter with Mr McVitty, the Principal, and also with Mr Littleproud, the Teacher. In a conversation with the girls concerned they expressed a willingness to undertake the work, with a promise that they would do their best.

However, it may be that the low prices of fur will cause the Indians to turn their attention to more cultivation which will compel them to spend more time in their reserve, so that the children will be in a position to attend school.\n\nI regret to have to report that at present there is no likelihood of better work being done in the Poplar River School, the people being seldom in their reserve, are habitually improvident and indifferent to education.\n\nThere is no means at Poplar River of obtaining wood for any purpose, except by floating it down the river in the fall, and as the Indians are at that time generally away fall fishing the wood business is a \"hand to mouth\" affair all winter.\n\nThe column for remarks of the school returns shows this.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report upon my visit to reserves on Lake Winnipeg:\n\nThe Councillors at Poplar River are anxious to have a teacher appointed for the day school, and I drew their attention to the indifference of the band to educational matters in the past, and they promised that they would do better in the future stating that they had already part of the wood supply for the school cut and would have plenty of wood at the school by spring. I examined the supplies at the school and gave the yarn to the Councillors to distribute to the children needing mitts as the mice were destroying it, other school supplies including 30 boxes of biscuits were in good order.\n\nT.

The work done is very elementary and does not advance much. The building requires a new foundation and some shingling. This better be deferred until it is definitely ascertained that a teacher will be available for the coming winter. In any case the building could be made to suit the work by banking well.

If the Indians could be induced to plant larger gardens their produce would be of the greatest benefit to them. And the Department should insist that some work should be done yearly on the Reserve by the Indians, such as larger gardens and improving the appearance and comfort of their houses. The Teacher is told that as soon as navigation opens all the Indians will be away from the Reserve to work for the fishing companies where they make a fairly good living for the time being. And as a rule, they generally save enough money to buy nets which they know they must have in order to procure their living after returning to their Reserve.\n\nW.J. Hope,\nTeacher\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the third consecutive year in which the same condition has occurred. (Reference official letters of September 20th, 1929, and July 2nd, 1930).\n\nWhile in 1929 and 1930 we allowed salary for the full quarter, it has been decided that the Department can only allow salary this year for one month and cheque for $95.00 is, therefore, being forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Poplar River Indian Day School and it is noted that the school was only open for three days during the quarter. On reviewing the June quarter returns for the years 1929 and 1930, it is found that this school was only open for the same period in the June quarter during each of the years mentioned.\n\nIn view of the small number of days the school was open, the Department considered that salary should be allowed for only one month and the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, was so advised. He has replied, as follows:\n\n\"I would ask the Department to kindly consider the economic conditions which prevail at that reserve. The Indians are forced to move to Black River at the beginning of the fishing season. Black River is twenty miles by water from Poplar River and, as is generally known, the Indians take their families along with them so that the constituency for the school is beyond reach. If the Department would provide suitable accommodation at Black River, Mrs. Caldwell, the teacher, has intimated that she would be very glad to continue the school at that point.\n\n\"Owing to the situation thus created, the Indian Agent paid Treaty at Black River this summer instead of at Poplar River.\n\n\"I would, also, draw the attention of the Department to the fact that Mr. Caldwell has been throughout the entire year caring for the needy and destitute on the reserve without any remuneration from the Government, and as the Indian Agent visits Poplar River only once a year, Mr. Caldwell has the full responsibility of their oversight.\n\n\"In view of the facts above stated, I feel that the Department should carry the expense of the school at Poplar River for the entire school year, and I shall be glad to receive a cheque for the balance of the teacher's salary for the quarter ended June 30th, 1931.\"\n\nIt has been decided to allow salary for the full June quarter and cheque has been forwarded to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada, Toronto.\n\nThe Department would appreciate receiving your comments on the information given in the letter quoted above. Please make your report in this regard as complete as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No.125-14-1 of 16th July, referring to the condition of the Poplar River School House, I beg to state that I fully intended making a thorough inspection of this building at treaty time, as instructed in your letter of 10th January, but on the day the treaty party were leaving Selkirk for the Lake Reserves, Mr. Caldwell notified me that all the Poplar River Indians were at Black River and suggested that the payments be made at that point. The Indians with their families were working for one of the Fishing Co. Accordingly I went to Black River and made the payment and was prevented from visiting the Reserve.\n\nPoplar River is, in my opinion, one of the poorest Reserves on Lake Winnipeg, as the Indians have no work and the winter trapping is poor. The Indians migrate to Black River every spring and fall, fishing in the summer and taking out cord wood for the Company in the winter. I suggested to the Band two years ago, when that Reserve was burnt out, that they move to another point on the Lake, where they would have a better chance of earning a livelihood.\n\nI am aware that the Poplar River school is in poor condition but no worse than at some other Reserves where there is a larger and steadier attendance for the full school term and I would not recommend that any expense be added at present.\n\nAs regards to the statement that Mr. Caldwell has full responsibility in this Reserve, I beg to state that Corporal Stewart, R.C.M.P., Detachment at Berens River was instructed by Mr. W.M. Graham, Commissioner, to oversee this point and report to the Selkirk Agency. He made several patrols during the winter and was authorized to look after the destitutes and make what purchases from the Hudson Bay Co he considered necessary.\nOwing to my not being able to visit the Reserve I regret that I am unable to give a more concise report but trust this will be sufficient information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man. 22nd September, 1931\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 125-14-1 of 10th instant, with reference to the Poplar River Indian Day School and the possibility of securing a suitable building at Black River for school purposes for May and June, I beg to inform you that I interviewed the manager of the Manitoba Transport Co., who operate a fishing station at Black River in regards to the Department renting a building from them for school purposes.\n\nHe informed me that there was no building at Black River available, as the Company used all the buildings during the summer.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Caldwell called at the office and we decided that it would not be advisable to spend any money on repairs on the Poplar River School at present and he said that he could carry on for this winter, as it is.\n\nI fully expect to see the Indians move to their trap lines, taking their families with them, for the winter, as they used to do in previous years and as I have instructed them to do, so that the chances are the school attendance will be small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nUnited Church Mission,\nPoplar River Reserve.\nLake Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nJanuary 25th 1932.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner\nSupt., of Indian Missions,\nTORONTO, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Barner,\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the people at Thunder Lake, and have time to catch up on outgoing mail. I found the people very well and very pleased to see me. They have had a fair trapping season, but have been handicapped by the unfavourable weather, rain and delayed snow at the early part of the season, and too much snow, mild weather and overflow of the rivers latterly. In general, they have had a very good winter, much better than last year, and the prospects for the Spring catch are excellent. The provisions obtained last fall as an advance on treaty money are lasting very well, and represents a very definite benefit to the people. The trip was made with little expense. I went with the H.B.C. man and his dog team. He was making a trading trip and I ran with the train. We made about sixty miles in a long day on the homeward trip and I arrived in good condition. I expect to make yet another trip later on. The trip was accomplished between Sundays and no services were cancelled here.\n\nWe have still a number of people on the Reserve, these who could not leave for various good reasons and our school attendance will average about 17. We have very little sickness and four new babies born, all doing well.\n\nA rather remarkable condition has become apparent in making up statistics for Mission information. We have approx. 180 people on the Band. Of these 90 are children from infancy to the age of 14. The great majority of these latter are between the ages of infancy to 10 or 11 years. This is going to present a considerable school problem in the near future. I have the assurance of Mr. Graham that he has sanctioned a new school in the present years estimates. This does not mean of course, that the school will be built this year. In view of the figures given above it would appear expedient that sufficient school accommodation should be provided in a new building. I think this matter should be taken up with the Department.\n\nThere is the difficulty of the band obtaining a winter living, however. To do this it is necessary for the families to spend some months in the bush, or at the fishing stations in the summer. This procedure has been the definite instructions of the Department this winter, and would seem to be very necessary, but it seriously interferes with the education of the children. If compulsory school attendance is enforced, the families cannot go to the bush or the fishing stations and we should have a return to the destitution experienced last winter.\n\nThe only solution I can see to the difficulty is compulsory boarding school attendance for all children with the mental and physical qualifications. This is an\nextreme step, but the benefits would be very apparent, both to\nthe children, and the parents, which latter would then be free\nto follow their natural pursuits. If the matter were mooted now\nit would cause considerable opposition, but I am sure the idea\nwould grow, and, if the Government were eventually induced to\nconsider it, especially as it would be a means to the economic\nbetterment of all these bush Reserves and therefore an easing\nof Governmental financial support, much of our Indian problem\nmight thus be solved. I realise the expense of enlarging the\nschools etc., but this would be less than the financial\nliability which the bush Indians are bound to become in the\nnot distant future. To follow this up, with the children in\nthe boarding schools and fitted for responsible life, the\noutside settlement arrangement as suggested by Mr. Beaton, could\nthen be made effective.\n\nAdmitting the measure is extreme, some extreme\nmeasure will have to be resorted to.\n\nSince the New Year I have added four adult and\nthree juvenile Catholics to the Church roll. I do not think I\ntold you the R.C.'s had purchased a small building on the\nReserve, evidently with the intention of starting a school.\nAs there are now only six Catholic adults and one infant in\nthe Band it is altogether unlikely that anything will come\nof this movement. It is quite possible that the whole\nReserve will be United Church before the end of the year.\n\nI have thought that it would be an excellent\nthing to have printed (preferably in English and Cree) a\nfamily Church Membership roll in the form suitable for\nframing, with space for the names of all the family, so\nthat each family could identify themselves by the possession\nof one of these on the wall of their house. The psychological\neffect would be excellent. Would it be possible to obtain\nthese?\n\nI have been able to send in a small donation\nto the M & M fund so that our annual report will not show\nblank. I expect however, a larger donation from the Band in\nthe Spring. It is gratifying to know that the Chief has\nhimself suggested this donation spontaneously, which is as it\nshould be.

Arthur Barner,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Barner,\n\nFurther to my letter to you of January 29th. In my report of the number of children tributary to Poplar River School it would be read that there are 90 children from the age of infancy to years in the Poplar River Band. This is rather misleading as 19 of this number are non-treaty children, but these will be dependant on the Poplar River School when they are of school age. We have two attending the school now.\n\nI have compiled a list of the children and their ages to give you some definite information. In this letter I will not take into account the non-treaty children, although these should not be neglected, as in no case are the parents able to send the children out for an education.\n\nAmong the treaty children you will note that the ages are evenly divided, 34 out of the total of 67 being at present of school age. It is apparent, however, that the birth rate is increasing, also, that the infant mortality has decreased considerably during the last few years. This decrease will assuredly be maintained, as better methods have been introduced in infant care. The eight children under one year are in perfect condition.\n\nIf I might digress to comment on the prospects of these infants, I may say that their chances of life, while greatly increased by better care, are still woefully handicapped by living in draughty, ill-ventilated dwellings and by, in almost every case, contamination from T.B. infects in the same dwelling.\n\nOur present seating accommodation in the school is 24, including some old desks. This takes care of our present roll, the average for this quarter being about 17.\n\nI must confess I am all at sea in regard to the education problem. If our people are to follow their natural pursuits, which they must do to make a living, then a winter school is all that can be maintained, attended by about one half of the children of school age, the other half being at the trapping grounds with their parents. The children attending school in the winter are drawn from families who are in receipt of support from the Government, by reason of widowhood or disability, or who are too indolent to exert themselves to make a living. As the school children are provided with good meals at the school, the situation would appear to handicap those who are industrious enough to leave the reserve to make a living.\n\nThe summer problem is more difficult still. If the summer migration was to a location where definitely established and permanent work was provided,\nthe school could follow the children, but the work is distributed between Black River, George's Island and Poplar Point. It is true that most of the people were at Black River last year, but this year there is a prospect of the sturgeon fishing being opened, which will distribute the people more widely.\n\nHad I been successful, while yet the fishing administration remained with the Federal Government, in obtaining a segregation of territory in the mouth of the Poplar River for pickerel fishing exclusively for the Band, they might have been held together, and school facilities arranged, but, the pickerel fishing being closed, and the administration now being with the Province, this arrangement is very remote, although it would still be feasible and without detriment to other organised fishing, could the Province be induced to make this concession.\n\nI realise that the problem pertaining to Poplar River, is accentuated on all the other reserves, especially those inland, and, this being so, I can see no other way in bringing education to the Indian children, education which is imperative in the process of emancipation, other than the establishment of collective educational institutions. The time is not opportune for anything definite to be done, but it is not too early for the idea to be sold to the Government.\n\nUnder the existing circumstances it is evident that on the Poplar River Reserve, 50% of the children will receive less than half the benefits of a day school education and 50% will receive no education whatever, and this compares favourably with other Reserves.\n\nIt might be asked why so few children of this Band are attending boarding school. This desirability has been stressed, but the consent of the parents must be obtained, and there seems to be a decided antipathy towards the boarding schools, principally due to the fact that mortality has been very high among those who have been sent to the Boarding School from this Reserve. This fact, of course, may be purely coincidental.\n\nI do not think we should fight shy of the compulsion in this proposed school attendance. After all, the white race are under compulsion to educate their children and also to provide a living for themselves.\n\nWe have had a very mild winter, with no destitution. The prospects for the Spring catch are excellent. The winter catch has been good, but the very low fur prices have tended to make what might have been a prosperous season into an indifferent one.\n\nWith Kindest regards from Mrs Caldwell and myself,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-1, part 1)\nAs previously reported the Poplar River School building is in very poor condition. The building is a frame structure on a log foundation, apparently poorly constructed in the first place. The log foundation has rotted, and the floor is sunk and the walls bulged in places. The lumber has shrunk to such an extent as to be no longer weather proof. The building is difficult to heat during the winter, and impossible to keep warm during severe or windy weather.\n\nDuring the past winter the attendance has been small as many of the Reserve families were away at their trapping grounds all winter. The fur catch was poor, especially in the Spring, and the people have expressed their intention of staying on the Reserve, or at least leaving their families on the Reserve, next winter. This will mean a much increased attendance at the school next winter, and it is very important that a new building should be erected. Owing to the condition of the foundation and the condition of the walls, it does not appear that any repairs could be undertaken on the present building with any profit.\n\nAccording to present statistics there will be Thirty children of school age belonging to the Band resident on the Reserve at the beginning of the next school year.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Day School, Poplar River, Man.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. and Mrs. A.

The school was closed and I saw little of the children's work.

Unfortunately it is difficult to reach and entails expensive travelling.\n\nMr. Taylor closed school on June 1st, without the knowledge of the Agent or myself. He appears to think he is only responsible to the Church officials. I am informed he did this last year. I would like to know if Mr. Taylor has special permission to close the school June 1st.

School was closed on June 1 as people had moved up the river in tents. From April 26 to May 5 school was closed due to the breakup of the river.\"\n\nIn view of this information it would appear that this school should only be in operation for a few months each year. However, I should appreciate your making further inquiries and advising me the definite length of time that you believe this school should be open each academic year.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., 31st July, 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that Mr. James Taylor, teacher at Poplar River Indian Day School, left the Reserve on or about 1st June to attend a Convention at Winnipeg and returned to his duties on 15th June. He was there during the treaty payments on 17th June but left next pay for Perene River en route to Winnipeg.\n\nBefore I returned to Selkirk from the treaty trip I was informed that he had sold nine sacks of flour from the destitute supplies to the Indians for $4.00 per sack. We called at the Selkirk Office on 26th June and I asked him why he had done this and what he intended doing about it. He told me that he had sold the flour to the Indians because there was no supplies of any kind at any of the traders on the reserve and that he had already replaced the flour. I warned him that he should not have sold any of the destitute supplies without authority from the Department or myself.\n\nAs this is not the first time Mr. Taylor has left his school before the term ended, I would request the Department to write to him, reprimanding him for his actions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

If starting the school season earlier works satisfactorily, I would suggest that the school be closed during May and June, owing to the Indians leaving the Reserve in May for rat trapping, and in June for fishing.\n\nPlease advise if these arrangements would be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

In view of this fact, would it be advisable to operate this school on an eight months' rather than a ten months' basis?

This will allow school to close at the end of April for break-up and the rat season, after which the Indians generally go to Big Black River for summer fishing which takes place in June and July.\n\nI am quite aware that the Indians of this reserve must be out on the trap lines during the winter months if they are to make a living and in view of this fact no doubt the attendance will not be good. On the other hand, the summer school is out of the question in view of the fact that the Indians are employed at fishing at Big Black River.

Taylor, Esq.,\nPoplar River, Manitoba.\n\nWAR/J\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nOn the occasion of your recent visit to the Department you discussed with me the situation at Poplar River. For your information I may say that on the quarterly return for the quarter ended June 30, 1939, the teacher, Mr. James Taylor, wrote as follows:\n\n\"For the first time in twelve years, school was held after the Easter holidays.\n\n\"However, only a few of the children, as recorded, were in attendance and only three attended regularly.\n\n\"School was closed on June 1st as people had moved up the river in tents.\n\n\"From April 26th to May 3rd school was closed due to the break-up of river.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Rosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSelkirk, Man., December 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: J. M. Taylor, Poplar River\n\nI wish to notify the Department that Mr. J. M. Taylor, school teacher on the Poplar River Reserve, left his school on the 26th. of October without permission from Inspector Hamilton or this office. I did not know this had occurred until the 7th. of December when I was informed that he was in Winnipeg. I went to Winnipeg and tried to locate Mr. Taylor and I was not able to do so until December 15th.\n\nThis is not the first time Mr. Taylor has left his school without permission. Last Summer he came out without any permission in the latter part of June. As soon as I received word that he was out, I informed him that he must go back at once. This he did. I asked him his reason for coming out and he informed me he was in for a Church Convention.\n\nWhen I got in touch with Mr. Taylor on the 18th. of December, I asked him if he had any permission from the Department direct, he informed me that he had not but that he had received permission from Dr. Cormie and the Church Board. Dr. Cormie is head of the Missionaries in that District. Mr. Taylor informed me that he had been unable to get a plane going to Poplar River but that he expected to leave by plane on the 19th. of December.\n\nI wish to point out that Mr. Taylor has been warned previously by this office that he must not leave his Reserve without proper permission. On August 9th., 1939, I wrote him and instructed that under no circumstances was he to leave his Reserve without permission from the Department.\n\nI would recommend that the Department deduct two month's salary from Mr. Taylor's pay and instruct him that if this should happen again without proper permission, the Church will be asked to nominate a new teacher.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 2, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo in which you advise that Mr. J. M. Taylor, teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School, has been absent from duty since October 26.\n\nI also note from your letter that you believe that he returned to Poplar River around the 19th ultimo. Please make immediate inquiries and advise me if he has returned to the Reserve and the exact date on which he did return in order that we can decide what deduction should be made from his salary.\n\nIn view of the unsatisfactory manner in which Mr. Taylor has conducted this school the Department considers it advisable to dispense with his services on April 30, 1940, the date on which it is intended that this school should be closed for the current academic year. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of September 5, 1939.\n\nYou should notify Mr. Taylor not later than March 15, 1940, that his services will not be required after April 30, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 2, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated the 21st ultimo Mr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man., writes as follows:\n\n\"I wish to notify the Department that Mr. J. M.

In view of the unsatisfactory manner in which Mr. Taylor has acted during the current academic year the Indian Agent is being instructed to inform him that his services will not be required after April 30, 1940. As cheques are issued monthly Mr. Taylor has been paid for both November and December although absent from the school the whole of the former month and the greater part of the latter. It will be necessary to deduct this amount from his salary for the period January 1 to April 30.\n\nLater on I should appreciate your nominating a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the period August 1, 1940, to April 30, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We hope to be able to hear from him in time for Dr. Cochrane to discuss the matter with you on Saturday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\nSelkirk, Man., January 5, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 2nd, File 125-14-1, I wish to advise that Mr. J. M. Taylor, teacher at the Poplar River Indian Day School, left his Reserve on October 26th and returned by plane on December 27th, 1939.\n\nI will notify Mr. Taylor that his services will no longer be required after the 30th of April.\n\nI will also inform Dr. Cormie of this change.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe - Poplar River Indian Day School\n\nWith further reference to your letter of January 2nd and to Dr. Cochrane's conversation with you, there are one or two facts which we believe should be in the possession of your Department before final decision is made.\n\nIt would appear from correspondence we have received that Mr. Taylor was in touch with Mr. McPherson some time in the summer concerning the possibility of his opening the school on August 1st instead of September last - which was the old arrangement, - so that he could get in the required number of months, and yet get a month off, either in November or December, so that he might be with his wife in Winnipeg at the time of the expected arrival of their first child. Certainly, Mr. McPherson wrote to Mr. Taylor on August 9th a letter, copy of which I enclose. From this you will note that Mr. McPherson says that he had written to the Department about the possibility of Mr. Taylor's opening the school on August 1st.\n\nWhen we received a letter from you, advising us that the Poplar River Indian Day School would be in operation for only nine months, we wrote at once to Dr. Cormie, asking him to communicate this decision to Mr. Taylor. On October 7th, Mr. Taylor wrote to Dr. Cormie and in this letter he says that the same week a boat had docked at Poplar River, bringing him a letter from Mr. McPherson, which conveyed the same decision. Mr. Taylor was rather taken aback, as he had hoped that, by teaching in August, he would have November or December off. In his letter to Dr. Cormie, he says:\n\n\"I came back here in good faith that Mr. McPherson would get the necessary permission for me to have November or December off if I taught in August. He advised me to take such a course and in letters I received as late as September last, he advised me as to procedure to follow before leaving the reserve. This led me to believe that permission would be granted as a matter of form and the letter I received from Mr. McPherson, with no reference to my request (made early in July) ignores it but implies refusal by placing the month of my regular holidays that I had taught in the newly arranged teaching year.\"\nWhen Mr. Taylor says that Mr. McPherson ignores the request, but implies refusal by placing the month of his regular holidays that he had taught in the newly arranged teaching year, he is, of course, giving his own interpretation of what Mr. McPherson may or may not have had in mind.\n\nIn view of this, I think that some of the statements contained in Mr. McPherson's letter should receive, at least, some further consideration. In the first paragraph, Mr. McPherson says that Mr. Taylor left his school on the 25th October \"without permission from Inspector Hamilton or this office.\" It is no doubt true that he was not aware that Mr. Taylor had left until the 7th December, but he certainly knew that he intended to leave.\n\nAs to whether Mr. Taylor left his school, without permission, in the latter part of June, - my impression is that there was no school going on during that month, and that was precisely the reason why your Department felt that school should only be carried on for nine months. There is nothing in our correspondence which leads us to the belief that Dr. Cormie had given any permission to Mr. Taylor to leave - certainly it is not in any correspondence which we have from Dr. Cormie. I believe it is correct to say that Mr. Taylor came down at the beginning of freeze-up under the impression that Mr. McPherson knew about it and that he had written to the Department.\n\nIn the second place, it should be noted that this year the weather was so mild that there was no plane service for a considerable length of time between the first frost and the date when it was possible to operate the planes on the ice. This will account for the fact that Mr. Taylor was so long away.\n\nI hope that you will give the matter further consideration and that, in any event, you will look into the reason why Mr. McPherson wrote to Mr. Taylor on August 9th and said, \"I have written the Department but as yet have had no reply,\" and now no mention is made of Mr. McPherson's communication with the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-1, part 1)\nSelkirk, Manitoba,\nAugust 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am making a request that the Department supply you with the following extra rations: 30 sacks Flour, 200 lbs. Dri-milk, and 5 cases of Tomato Soup. These rations must be given to the sick only; parties receiving these sick rations must be marked down separately on your ration reports.\n\nI want it distinctly understood that there must be no flour sold from the Treaty rations, and must insist that a ration list be sent in to this office every month showing the total amount of rations issued each month and the total amount on hand.\n\nWith reference to you opening your school on August 1st, I have written the Department but as yet have had no reply. I wish to point out to you that if you get permission to have December off, you must issue the December rations before you leave. On no account must you give the key of the ration house to the Indians in your absence. You can make arrangements with whatever trader is there to leave him 3 or 4 sacks of flour, a small amount of bacon and tea, to be issued only if needed.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSigned \u2014 E. McPherson.\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. M. Taylor, Esq.,\nPoplar River, Man.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of December 21 you intimated that you had no previous knowledge of Mr. Taylor's desiring to be in Winnipeg during the month of December.\n\nCopy of your letter was forwarded to the Board of Home Missions of the United Church and they have forwarded to us a copy of your letter of August 9 to Mr. Taylor. I enclose copy of this for your information. Mr. Taylor claims that you were aware of the fact that he wished to be off duty in December and this contention is apparently borne out by the contents of the second and third lines in paragraph three of your letter of August 9. However, you did not apply to the Department for leave of absence during December for Mr. Taylor.\n\nIt is pointed out to us that Mr. Taylor went to Winnipeg at the beginning of freeze-up under the impression that you knew about it and had written to the Department. We are also told that the reason for the long delay in his returning to the school was due to the fact that the weather has been so mild this year that there was no plane service for a considerable length of time between the first frost and the date on which it was possible to operate planes on the ice. In view of the information now placed before us the Department will await your reply before deciding to carry out the previous intention of dispensing with his services on April 30, 1940. Consequently you should delay carrying out the instructions contained in paragraph four of Mr. Hoey's letter of the 2nd instant until you hear further from us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRe: Poplar River Indian Day School.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant giving further information with regard to the absence of Mr. J.M. Taylor from the Poplar River Indian Day School during the period October 26 to December 27, 1939.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter a further communication is being directed to Indian Agent McPherson and on receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSelkirk, Man., January 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 11th. File 125-14-1, re J. M. Taylor, Teacher at Poplar River, I wish to state that I had no knowledge that Mr. Taylor was in Winnipeg until Mr. Hamilton informed me to that effect on December 7th.\n\nLast July Mr. Taylor intimated that he might want to get off for December. Naturally I was waiting for a request from him as to when he wanted to leave the Reserve. At no time has he ever made a request for Leave of Absence for any definite period of time. I was, therefore, unable to ask the Department for permission for him to leave his Reserve.\n\nI wish to clearly point out that when Mr. Taylor went to Winnipeg at freeze-up time, that I had no knowledge whatever of his leaving the Reserve. He should have notified me immediately so I could have written the Department. I cannot understand why he left in October to be in Winnipeg for the month of December. I was expecting a letter from Mr. Taylor to let me know when he wanted leave of absence.\n\nI wish to point out that in my 2nd and 3rd lines of paragraph 3 of my letter of August 9th to Mr. Taylor \"With reference to you opening your school on August 1st, I have written the Department but as yet have had no reply.\" This sentence was in connection with a proposed change in the school term of the Poplar River school and had nothing to do with Mr. Taylor's leave of absence.\n\nYou will note in my letter to the Department of December 21st, that Mr. Taylor informed me that he did not have permission from the Department but that Dr. Cormie and the Church Board had granted him permission.\n\nIt is not my wish to see Mr. Taylor discharged from his school, but it is my opinion that he should have two month's salary deducted and that he should be reprimanded for taking unauthorized leave of absence.\n\nI wish to notify you that I have not carried out the instructions of Mr. Hoey's letter of January 2nd, as I did not think it wise to notify Mr. Taylor too long in advance.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 22, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 9th instant and my reply of the 11th instant regarding the absence of Mr. J. M. Taylor from the Poplar River Day School during the period October 25 to December 27, 1939.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of letter dated January 15 received from Indian Agent McPherson.\n\nFrom the contents of this letter and the letter received by you from Mr. Taylor it is evident that there was a misunderstanding between the Indian Agent and the teacher in connection with the period during which Mr. Taylor could be absent from the school.\n\nI think you will agree that teachers should have definite approval in writing before absenting themselves from a school during the school term except, of course, in case of serious illness.\n\nIt has, therefore, been decided that Mr. Taylor will not be allowed salary for the period that he was absent from the school and I should appreciate your informing him that in future he should not leave the school during the regular term without receiving definite permission to do so from the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to Mr. Taylor. It appears that there was a misunderstanding regarding the time at which he could absent himself from the school. After giving the matter very careful consideration it has been decided that no salary can be allowed Mr. Taylor for the period he was absent from the school; namely, from October 26 to December 27, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nI certainly think that whatever opinion you or I may have of Mr. Taylor's judgment in leaving the school when and how he did, it must be granted that he acted in good faith in believing that the Indian Agent knew of this matter. As far as his salary is concerned, of course, if he did not teach for two months, naturally he cannot be paid; but I certainly do not agree that he should be reprimanded. I think it is the Agent who should be reprimanded.\n\nI shall notify Mr. Taylor of your decision and I shall be glad to inform him that he should not leave the school during the regular term without permission\u2014which is quite reasonable. But, of course, I expect that the Agent will use normal expedition in transmitting the request to your Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have your letter of January 23rd, enclosing copy of letter which you have received from Mr. McPherson. With regard to the fourth paragraph of your letter, I quite definitely agree that the teacher should have approval in writing before absenting himself from school during the school term.\n\nI have read Mr. McPherson's letter. It may be that there was a misunderstanding, but if I were a teacher and got a letter, dated August 9th, from an inspector to whom I had written, and in that letter the following paragraph occurred -\n\n\"With reference to you opening your school on August 1st, I have written the Department but as yet have had no reply. I wish to point out to you that if you get permission to have December off, you must issue the December rations before you leave.\"\n\nI should certainly take it for granted that the two sentences in the paragraph had reference one to the other - that is, \"written to the Department\" and \"permission to have December off\" - and I most certainly do not agree with the Agent's explanation that the sentence had nothing to do with Mr. Taylor's leave of absence. Mr. Taylor wrote in July to Mr. McPherson. At that time he had no notice from the Department that the school year was to be changed. Neither had Mr. McPherson. The reason that Mr. Taylor requested Mr. McPherson to write you, asking for permission to open the school on August 1st was precisely in order that he might have either November or December off, so that he might be with his wife in Winnipeg. When Mr. McPherson says that it was in connection with the proposed change in the school term of the Poplar River school and had nothing to do with leave of absence, perhaps he would explain why he wrote to Mr. Taylor on August 9th about this matter, when it was only on September 11th that he notified him that the school term had been changed.\nyou should reprimand Mr. Taylor in this case. I personally dislike the word \"reprimand\" and I have been unable to find the word in my correspondence to you. However, I have gone over the files somewhat hurriedly and it is just possible that the word has been used. If so, I can only express my regret.\n\nIt might be well for you to make a brief study of this file yourself during one of your regular visits to Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 26, 1940.\n\nRe: Mr. J. M. Taylor, Teacher,\nPoplar River Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 24th instant, relating to the operation of the Poplar River Indian Day School.\n\nI do not know that any useful purpose can be served in continuing the correspondence between your office and this Department in respect to Mr. Taylor's action in leaving the school without first having secured permission. Your letter, however, would indicate that a misunderstanding exists, either in your mind or mine, in respect to the whole matter. I have made a careful perusal of the letters here on file, relating to the period during which the school should be operated. There are letters here from the Indian agent, Mr. McPherson, and from Inspector Hamilton, in respect to the matter. Both the Inspector and Mr. McPherson were anxious to find ways and means of conducting the school in such a way that the school would not be open when the Indians were away, in May and June, for rat trapping and fishing. There is nothing on file that I have been able to discover that even suggests that the teaching period was changed to permit Mr. Taylor to visit Winnipeg in either November or December. I must state, however, that the paragraph quoted by you and taken from Mr. McPherson's letter of August 9 may have leant itself to a misinterpretation.\n\nOne point I want to emphasize in writing this letter is that the abandonment of his school by an Indian day school teacher, without having first secured permission from the Indian agent or the Department, is a very serious matter and looked upon as such by the officials. When a teacher abandons his school without notice, the Treasury Officials continue to pay his salary and his salary cheques are sent out monthly. When it is discovered later that he has not been engaged in his regular teaching duties, it is almost impossible in some cases to secure a refund of the salary paid. This fact in itself leads to endless correspondence and negotiations between this Branch and the Treasury officials and between the Treasury officials and the Department of the Auditor General. In fact, it would be wholly impossible to administer 234 schools, employing 389 teachers, if the practice of abandoning their schools became general on the part of teachers. The other point I want to emphasize is that it is not our intention that\n\nyou should -\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\nRe: Poplar River Indian Day School\nNo. 538\n\nUntil further advised no cheque should be issued to Mr. J.

I might also refer you to my letter of January 2, 1940, in which April 30 was again stated to be the closing date for this school.\n\nIn view of the above you should notify Mr. Taylor that no salary will be allowed to him after April 30, 1940.

This is quite satisfactory so far as we are concerned, but I wonder whether you have not made a mistake, as I understood the school was to be closed for May, June and July and re-open on August 1st. I should be glad to get confirmation on this point.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\nOttawa,\nApril 30, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant I regret stating in my letter of the 24th instant that Mr. Meadows should begin duties on July 1.\n\nYou are correct in stating that this school should re-open on August 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This should have read August 1 as it is our intention to only operate this school for a nine-month period. Such action was recommended by you in your letter of August 24, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E.

They also inform me that you are allowed a salary at the rate of $95.00 per teaching month.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. M.

In our letter of September 11th, 1939, we advised you that the Department had instructed me to advise you that the Poplar River Indian Day School should only be in operation from August 1st to April 30th in each academic year.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. M. Taylor, Esq.,\nPoplar River,\nVia Berens River, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., June 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Poplar River Indian Day School.\n\nI have received word from Mr. J.M. Taylor that he did not close his school until the 23rd of May. I wish to inform the Department that Mr. Taylor had been instructed to close his school on April 30th. I am enclosing copies of our letters to Mr. Taylor dated September 11th, 1939 and April 1st, 1940 in which we advised him that his school was to close on April 30th.\n\nMr. Meadows, the new teacher for Poplar River has been informed that his school will open August 1st, and will be closed during the months of May, June and July, in 1941.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

Your early attention to this matter would be appreciated.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant enclosing copies of your letters which you forwarded to Mr. J. M. Taylor, teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School, notifying him to close the school on April 30. Under the circumstances the department is unable to favourably consider paying him for the period he kept the school open during the month of May without authorization.\n\nThe teacher has also written inquiring regarding his salary for the months of January and February. In this regard I would refer you to official letter of January 22 last in which you were informed that no salary could be allowed Mr. Taylor for the period he was absent from the school without leave; namely, from October 26 to December 27, 1939, a period of two months. However, before we were aware of Mr. Taylor's absence during the period mentioned the cheques for November and December had been forwarded to him. Consequently the only manner in which the matter could be straightened out was to omit issuing cheques in his favour for the months of January and February. He has now been paid in full to April 30, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Taylor as teacher of the above-named school after April 30, 1940.\n\nMr. Harry Meadows has been appointed teacher of this school and he began duties on August 1, 1940. He should be paid at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month. This school will be in operation from August 1, 1940, to April 30, 1941.\n\nI attach staff questionnaire and copy of letter of appointment.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nSelkirk, Man., September 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to advise the Department that Mr. Harry Meadows, school teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School, did not open his school until August 18th this year. His instructions are, as the Department advised, to open school on August 1st and to operate until April 30th. I have just received this word today and I am advising you in order that you may know that he taught school during the month of August from the 18th to 31st, inclusive.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

The teacher, Mr. Harry Meadows, was also in charge of this school during the last academic year.\n\nAt the end of September a cheque should be issued in his favour for the amount due him from August 18 to September 30 and at the end of each month in future to April 30, 1942, he should be paid his salary.\n\nSalary is allowed him at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month plus the cost-of-living bonus.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSelkirk, Man., October 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will note on Mr. Meadows' report for the quarter ended September 30th, that he states that school was not open until August 18th, owing to not having the school re-painted, also because the blackboard was in bad condition. This School is not in as bad condition as Meadows is trying to make out and I think his excuses are very poor for not opening as instructed on August 1st.\n\nYou will note also that he had to close school on August 28th and 29th owing to a stallion being in the vicinity of the school and the children were afraid of it. Last Summer I instructed the Indian who owns this horse that he must keep it tied up or build a corral for it. There is no reason why Meadows could not have had the Indians round the horse up and put it in a suitable place.\n\nHe states also that the Truancy Officer is most inefficient. I wish to state that this man was discharged a few years ago by the Department and there is no Truancy Officer paid by the Department but only a man appointed by the Indians to act in this capacity.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

McPherson, Indian Agent to write your office for information on the following subject.\n\nWhen I was first employed as teacher on the Poplar River Reserve I understood that my salary was to be $95.00 per month, commencing in the fall of 1940. However my monthly cheque is for $90.25. Would you let me know what the reduction is for. I do not think it would be National Defense Tax as my salary falls below the minimum, I believe and no National Defense Tax reduction was shown in the statement forwarded by the Department for purposes of computing Provincial Income Tax.\n\nWould it be possible to have the invoices accompanying all cheques forwarded to me while the cheque is forwarded to my bank, rather than both invoice and cheque going to the bank as at present.\n\nYour attention to these matters will be most appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He further states that he taught school a total of 121 days, which is 5 days more than is required. According to Mr. Meadows' quarterly reports the information as given above is correct. I do know that the Indians informed me that he was teaching school in the month of May.\n\nIn view of the fact that this teacher had his school in operation for the required number of teaching days, I would recommend that he be paid for the two weeks that he taught in May, 1942.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

Edward Shanks, Poplar River, via Berens River, Man.\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of October 25 and November 19 in connection with your services at the Poplar River Day School.\n\nWe have not yet received form T.D. 1 and cost-of-living bonus form. I attach copies of these and you should complete them and return them to this office immediately. You will note that the cost-of-living bonus form requires the signature of a Justice of the Peace. In your case this will not be necessary if you have it signed by the Indian Agent.\n\nYour salary has been computed as follows:\n\nBasic salary ........................................ $ 95.00\nBonus (17% of $95.00) ......................... 16.15 $111.15\n\nDeductions\n\nRetirement fund (5% of $95.00) .......... $ 4.75\n(This amount will be refunded to you when you leave our service.)\nIncome Tax ........................................... 15.05 19.78\n\nNet balance $ 91.37\n\nAs soon as we receive the forms mentioned above we will be able to decide what amount of income tax, if any, you should pay and it is quite likely that an adjustment will be made of amounts already deducted.\n\nFor your services as dispenser you are allowed $30.00 a year and I enclose cheque D012466 for $15.50 being the amount due you for the first three months.\n\nP.S.C.\nI note that you ask what amount you are allowed for dispensing Indian relief rations. I was not aware that this was part of your duties and I am writing to the Indian Agent in connection with your statement.\n\nWith regard to the caretaking of the school, the Department will allow an amount of $5.00 a teaching month and I am so informing Indian Agent McPherson.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\nA\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which is being sent to Rev. E. Shanks, teacher of the Poplar River Day School. You will note that I refer in this letter to his question regarding the amount allowed him for dispensing Indian relief rations. In view of the fact that Rev. Mr. Shanks has only resided on the reserve for a short time, it is difficult to understand why he has apparently been requested to issue Indian relief rations. It is unlikely that he will be in a position to decide who is entitled to relief and, besides, if he refuses some it is quite possible that such families will keep their children home thinking that by doing so they are spiting the teacher. When all is said and done the teachers are not appointed to distribute relief and I should appreciate hearing from you in the matter at once.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training, Ottawa.\n\nI received your letter of December 8th file number 125-14-1 regarding Mr. Shanks distributing rations on the reserve. I wish to advise you that when I took over this agency all rations on the reserves were handled by the Missionaries. Some years ago I requested the Department to allow me to have the Hudson Bay handle our rations at Poplar River and Little Grand Rapids as I was not satisfied with the way the Missionaries were handling them. Also at Berens River I had the R.C.M.P. take over the rations. As there are no Hudson Bay stores at any of the other reserves the Missionaries have always handled them and I find that they have done a very satisfactory job and no complaints from the Missionaries and very few from the Indians.\n\nThe Missionaries have always been instructed that no-one gets rations that is able to work and I feel satisfied that this has been carried out. This summer Mr. Talbot, District Manager for the Hudson Bay Company informed me that they were closing their store at Poplar River and that I would have to make other arrangements for the rations. There is no-one more fit to handle the rations at Poplar River other than Mr. Shanks and at the time the Hudson Bay closed I wrote Mr. Shanks requesting him to take the rations over. He wrote me and said he would be only too pleased to do so. I had the Manager of the Hudson Bay, who has been handling the rations for some years, give Mr. Shanks a list of those who receive rations and Mr. Shanks has been using this list as far as I know.\nI interviewed Mr. Shanks in Selkirk before he left for Poplar River and gave him all the instructions I could for the length of time the boat was at dock at Selkirk. When he arrived at Poplar River, he wrote me requesting more information which I immediately wrote him and gave him all the information he requested.\n\nI wrote and told him that he would receive $3.00 per month for 9 months for the janitors work at the school and $50. a year for dispensing drugs.\n\nIf Mr. Shanks is not willing to handle the rations as other Missionaries are doing, I wish you would please advise what steps I should take.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\nCross Lake Manitoba,\nDecember 9, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis is to state that I have not as yet received payment for the final two weeks of my teaching at the Poplar River Indian Day school for the year 1941-42.\n\nIn the fall of 1941 school was not opened on the first of August as is usual because I had received a letter from Indian Agent McPherson stating that repair material for the school building was being forwarded. I have this letter on file. However when, after two weeks no material arrived I commenced school. The last two weeks were made up at the end of the term in May. In fact more days were put in than required by the department. However no salary was received; I was only paid for eight and one-half months of teaching.\n\nWhen in Winnipeg in July I interviewed Inspector Hamilton and explained the situation. Inspector Hamilton contacted Mr. McPherson who stated that in a letter dated July 18 he had recommended payment of the full salary. However I have as yet not received payment. I would greatly appreciate you investigating this matter and having the amount of salary owed me deposited to my credit in the Royal Bank of Canada, Portage and Good Street, Winnipeg; savings account number 2420.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, in which you state that there is a balance due you for salary for the period you taught the Poplar River Indian Day School.\n\nAs Mr. McPherson advised you, he wrote to the Department on July 18 with reference to your claim. In a letter dated July 25 we advised him that we had reviewed our payments and, in our opinion, you had been fully paid. Mr. McPherson informed us in a letter dated October 15, 1941, that there was no reason why you should have delayed the opening of the school until August 16, 1941. You had no authority from this Branch to keep it open after the 30th of April, 1942.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. Meadows,\nUnited Church Mission,\nCross Lake, Man.\nCross Lake Manitoba,\nJanuary 12, 1943.\n\nRe: Mr. Hey, Esq.,\nSup't of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is apparent from your letter of the 23rd ultimo that you were not fully informed regarding the situation at Poplar River about which I wrote.\n\nIf Mr. McPherson wrote on Oct. 15, 1942 that I had deferred opening school until August the 16th without cause he did not state the case as it actually was. I had requested that major repairs be made to the school building and Mr. McPherson led me to believe that they were being forwarded. If you wish to have his letter I will forward it. Would it seem reasonable to you to open school then immediately close it to have the repair work done, it did not seem so to me. Please bear in mind that at Poplar River I had no way of contacting the Agent, to get instructions. I expected the repair material to arrive daily and so did not open school. It is apparent to me that Mr. McPherson wrote the letter dated Oct. 15, 1941 which you mention out of personal animosity as he had clearly placed himself in the wrong by promising material which had never been purchased. It was he not I who held up the opening of school, I was at Poplar River ready to commence on August 1.\n\nYou state that I had no authority from your branch to keep school open after April 30, 1942, may I point out that on the other hand I had no authority from the branch to open on August 1 either, as the Branch seems to infer. The only communication I received from the Branch was a circular giving October 1 as the opening date. I only supposed that school should be opened on Aug.1 because that was the date I had opened in 1940, however even that year Mr. McPherson twice changed the date.\n\nFrom the above it will be apparent to you, I am sure, that I attempted to discharge my duty fully as teacher at Poplar River even to making up\ndays which were lost through no fault of mine. After serving the Branch in three different schools and attempting carry on my work as teacher to the best of my ability it seems strange to treated thus by a department of the government.\n\nIt is interesting that Mr. McPherson should write as he did on Oct. 15, 1941 as the same year the Indian school at Berens River was closed while the teacher went in to Winnipeg without permission. Mr. McPherson told the teacher to make up the days lost if possible, if not, not to worry. This teacher lost no salary and did not make up the days.\n\nI am sure that when you have given the above facts your consideration you will agree that I am justly entitled to the two weeks salary I am asking for.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Meadows\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Poplar River Indian Day School, No. 538.\n\nIn my memorandum of June 18, 1942, I advised you that Mr. Harry Meadows would give up duties at the end of April, 1942.\n\nSubsequent information which has recently been received shows that he kept the school in operation to May 18, due to the fact that the Indians had not left the reserve. Under the circumstances it has been decided to allow him salary for the period May 1 to May 18 inclusive and it would be appreciated if you would forward a cheque for this amount to H.

The question of school fuel can be attended to in due course.\"\n\nExtract from letter addressed to Mr. Hughes from Chief C. Nanowin dated Dec. 6, 1946.\n\n\"When I was in Winnipeg last fall, I went to see Mr. Best our head man of our mission. I told him that I would like to have a missionary also school teacher, and when I saw you at Berens River we both thought that the minister would be at Poplar River, so we are not blaming you for this matter. When I got back home this fall, there was no missionary or teacher, then we had a council meeting, as you will know that I have my regulations and we appoint one to teach school, and have the children go there, every day. We are using all the school supplies that were sent out and the school is in operation now. We have appoint this Andrew Mitchell who is a graduate from the Brandon Residential School years ago. I got Andrew just teaching for the time being till we can have someone from outside.\n\n\"Another matter there's school wood will have to be cut this winter yet. There was 12 cords allowed for the season, because the school is very cold we use lots of wood. I want to do this because this wood will have to be used expense is...\"\n$4.50 per cord delivered at school door.\n\n\"Also about school scrubbing, because this will have to be done regularly for the public health expense. You will know what to do.\"\nOttawa, 13 January 1947.\n\nRev.

I believe there is an annual migration of these Indians at the time the fishing season begins. The question to be decided is what salary should be allowed for the June quarter. Last year, the school was open ten days and salary for one month was allowed. This year, the school was open twenty days, apparently until about the middle of May.

Ferrier,  \nBRANDON, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nWe are in receipt of yours of December 20th, re the September quarterly Report.\n\nIn this regard may I advise you that Mrs Caldwell found it necessary to go to Winnipeg at the beginning of September and was operated on at the Victoria Hospital for appendicitis and other abdominal troubles, on the 8th of that month. We arrived home at Poplar River on October 1st, and opened school on Oct., 3rd. The journey was undertaken on the advice of Mr. Barnet, whom we met at Selkirk when on our return journey to Poplar River at the beginning of August. Mr. Stevenson, the Indian Agent, was also advised of the delay in opening the school.\n\nThe first opportunity we had of sending mail from here was about the middle of December, therefore we delayed sending the blank return for the September Quarter until the December Return was completed. Both these returns are now going forward.\n\nRealising that a medical certificate will be required to validate the closing of the school, we are, this mail, requesting Dr. Leggett of Winnipeg, the operating surgeon, to forward such a certificate to you at Brandon.

R. B. Cochrane, D.D., who is out of the City, to your Mr. Russell Ferrier's letter of the 2nd instant (File 125-14-3) in reference to the Poplar River Indian Day School, would say that we were not aware that this school had been open only four days during the June quarter. Assuming that the school was being carried on regularly an amount of $237.50 was forwarded to Mr. A. E. Caldwell in payment of the salary of the teacher for that quarter, this being at the rate of $950 per year.\n\nThe matter will be looked into and report made to the Department.\n\nI note that the Department cheque for $285 received on the 10th instant has been entered as payment for the June quarter. This may perchance be our mistake and it may belong to the March quarter when no payment has been credited on our records.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHS:AMA.\nOttawa, July 21, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the salary of the teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School.

Ferrier under date of July 21st - File No. 125-14-13 - in reference to the salary of the teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School. I am now able to give you the explanation for the school's being kept open only four days during the June quarter. Our Superintendent of Indian Missions, Rev. Arthur Barnet, in a letter from Lake Winnipeg, dated August 12th, states:\n\n\"The Poplar River Reserve is very much broken by waterways. In the spring and fall these are quite impassable. About 1924 a boy was drowned while crossing broken ice on his way to school. Since then the people will not run any risks, so that every June quarter report is small. Mrs. Caldwell says that she makes notes of these things on the reports. The reason the attendance was smaller than usual this year is because the breakup was earlier. Mr. Caldwell thinks that by building two foot bridges the school days might be increased. He is taking up this matter with the Agent at Treaty this week. In May the people leave for the fishing grounds and take their families with them.\"\n\nI understand that when a condition such as is above described has existed in other seasons, the Department has been good enough to forward to this office the cheque for that particular quarter, although the school may not have earned the full amount. I trust that the Department will see its way to forward the cheque for the June quarter. The amount, as already reported to the Department, has been paid the teacher for that quarter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJNS.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the third consecutive year in which the same condition has occurred. (Reference official letters of September 20th, 1929, and July 2nd, 1930).\n\nWhile in 1929 and 1930 we allowed salary for the full quarter, it has been decided that the Department can only allow salary this year for one month and cheque for $95.00 is, therefore, being forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

Cochrane, D.D. is to hand regarding the payment of $95 which the Department intends shall cover the salary of the teacher at the Poplar River Indian Day School for one month instead of for the full quarter.\n\nIn reply would say that I would ask the Department to kindly consider the economic conditions which prevail at that Reserve. The Indians are forced to move to Black River at the beginning of the fishing season. Black River is twenty miles by water from Poplar River, and as is generally known, the Indians take their families along with them so that the constituency for the school is beyond reach. If the Department would provide suitable accommodation at Black River, Mrs. Caldwell, the teacher, has intimated that she would be very glad to continue the school at that point.\n\nOwing to the situation thus created, the Indian Agent paid Treaty at Black River this summer instead of at Poplar River.\n\nI would also draw the attention of the Department to the fact that Mr. Caldwell has been throughout the entire year caring for the needy and destitute on the Reserve without any remuneration from the Government, and as the Indian Agent visits Poplar River only once a year, Mr. Caldwell has the full responsibility of their oversight.\n\nIn view of the facts above stated, I feel that the Department should carry the expense of the school at Poplar River for the entire school year, and I shall be glad to receive a cheque for the balance of the teacher's salary for the quarter ended June 30th, 1931.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJNS:NEF\n**Province of Manitoba**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs**\n\n**Teachers' Salaries**\n\nFor Quarter Ended June 30th, 1931\n\n| Name of Teacher | Name of School | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Mrs. G.M.

You will, no doubt, remember that there was some correspondence in connection with this school last year.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the June quarter return and it has been decided that, this year, the Department can only allow two months' salary. A cheque for this amount, viz., $190., less 10%, is being issued and sent to your Treasurer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Ferrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 18th,\n1932.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nYour letter of July 15th, informing us that the Department can allow the teacher at the Poplar River Indian Day School only two months' salary for the June quarter, is to hand.\n\nI suppose when everything is taken into consideration that this is probably a fair division of the responsibility for Mr. Caldwell's salary between the Department and the Church. It is, of course, through no fault of the teacher that he cannot carry on until the end of June, as they do in most of the other schools. Last year I remember discussing this matter with him when we were at the Norway House Conference. It was his suggestion that Mr. Indian Agent MacPherson should pay Treaty at Black River, where the Indians go for the fishing, in place of at Poplar River, and while he spends the time there with his people, there is no building which could be used as a school-room. Besides, I am sure we all recognize that once the children have been scattered and their attention diverted, as would undoubtedly happen in the moving of the Band from Poplar River to Black River for the fishing season, the attempt to get them back into school would be almost certain to fail.\n\nThe Department have been very considerate in regard to the grants made for the Poplar River School and we are willing to accept the decision contained in your letter of July 5th as final for the current year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\n**PROVINCE: MANITOBA**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\n**FOR QUARTER ENDED September 30th, 1938.**\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Mrs. G.

It is noted that the school was only open for twelve (12) days during the quarter. This was due to the same reasons as previous years and, in this connection, I might refer you to official letter of July 5th, 1932, and your reply of July 18th, 1932.\n\nThe teacher, Mrs. C. M. Caldwell, is, I understand, the wife of the missionary and resides at Poplar River. Last year, the Department allowed two months' salary for the June quarter. The Department feels that we should not allow more than this amount this year.\n\nHave you any information regarding the time these Indians return to reside on the reserve? It is possible that, in the case of this school, it would be preferable to have it open from, say, July 1st or August 1st until April 30th of the succeeding year. I would appreciate an expression of your views regarding this suggestion as it is necessary to have some definite understanding in connection with this school due to the fact that our payments are very carefully scrutinized at the present time by the Auditor General and it would be difficult for us to explain why two months' salary is allowed when the school is only open for such a short period during the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. J. B. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nAug. 18,\n1933.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Poplar River Indian Bay School\n(File No. 125-14-8)\n\nThe situation at Poplar River has not changed since our correspondence of July 1932.\n\nThe Indians go off fishing before the end of May, sometimes early in April, and the holding of school is impossible. So far as I know they do not return until the whitefish season is over, usually the end of August or early in September. It is satisfactory to us to accept two months' salary for the June quarter.\n\nI am not sure that the Department of Indian Education is the one that should carry all the burden for caring for this band of Indians, but certainly the Indian Department is under a tremendous debt to the missionary and his wife at that point. I just discovered incidentally, for instance, that Mr. Hamilton, the Inspector, has never been at Poplar River. As a matter of fact the Indian Agent has not been there for at least three years unless the acting man went in this year. They pay Treaty now out on the lake where the Indians congregate for the early fishing. There is no doctor nearer than Selkirk and the missionaries are responsible for a great deal of medical work. In addition to that they have given constructive leadership in the matter of rebuilding the homes of the Indians which were destroyed by the disastrous fire of three years ago, along the line of co-operative buying and reduction of individual debts, and in the development of agricultural plots, particularly potatoes. My personal opinion is that the Board of Home Missions of the United Church and the Department of Indian Affairs have few servants more efficient and more worthy of support than Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Distrowe\nTeacher\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward requisition for school material and furniture from Mr. J. A. Distrow, Teacher, Poplar River School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that the children are attending more regularly now, consequently the 6 forms and 2 tables supplied are insufficient to seat them.\n\nThe flexible black board supplied the school is now useless, as the chalk will not adhere to it. The same complaint is made from other teachers who have been furnished with black boards of the same material, a wooden one is asked for.\n\nAs soon as the ice breaks up in the spring the Indians move down to the mouth of the river for the purpose of fishing, when it is impossible for the pupils to attend, as it is too far away and dangerous for them to travel to the school, inclement and obstructions in the way by land. There is therefore generally a very small attendance during\n\nE. McCall, Esq.,\nInspector of Ind. Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nduring the spring, summer, and fall, so that a tent large enough to accommodate the pupils would be useful and convenient during that time. But as the school was moved to the same grounds every spring and remained there until late in the fall, I believe that a simple frame house constructed out of single matched siding for walls, shingled roof, and a matched floor, would be the best and cheapest at least. For if the material was furnished the Indians could put it together themselves without cost to the Department.\n\nIt would last longer than canvas and protect the children better during bad weather. The school material, furniture, and livestock would be safer than in a tent. Therefore should the Department see fit to supply the material for a building such as above described, I add below the quantity of lumber required:\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEstimate of material necessary for a school shed for Poplar River.\n\n\u2014 Size of shed 20 x 20 Feet, 7 Feet walls \u2014\n700 ft. common lumber for roof 12 ft. long, 500 ft. matched flooring 14 ft. long\n700 ft. matched siding 6 inches wide 14 ft. long, for walls, 6000 Shingles\nshingles, scantling 2x4 in. 16 ft. long, for roof 14 pieces 2x4 in. 20 ft. long\nfor floor joists, 14 Pcs.

Outside of these two sources these Indians had nothing within reach to gain an existence from, and at the time of my visit I do not believe they were getting one meal per day. Traders Hyre and Campbell held a few sacks of flour on the Reserve for trading purposes, and they demanded 10 fox skins per sack for it, and which in my opinion was equivalent to $7.50 per sack, with chances of realizing $10.00 for the skins. There were 14 poorly clad children at the School, and I was sure that some had come without a morsel of breakfast, and poor chances for either dinner or supper. I took possession of five sacks of Mr. Hyre's flour, and handed it over to Mr. Dargue to issue to the children who attended the School, at the rate of 10 oz. per pupil for a full day's attendance, and I authorized Mr. Dargue to get five more sacks in the event of the Indians not getting any fish. I may say that there were no biscuits on hand to issue, neither had there been for weeks before; in fact the teacher had not made up the School returns for two or three Quarters previously, owing to his inability to get forms from the Agent.\n\nThe attendance at the School increased to about 42, and the small issue of flour was the attraction. I think that Mr. Hyre placed a small valuation on the flour, when he could, without question, have made at least 50 per cent more out of it.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nSgd. J.A. Markle,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nWINNIPEG SEPT 26th. 1898.\n\nI hereby authorize and empower Messrs R. J.

Hyre and Brother, for flour supplied to the Poplar River School, I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter of explanation from Mr Agent Markle, upon whose order the flour was supplied, and to recommend that under the circumstances the voucher be paid.\n\nI also enclose a copy of a Power of Attorney from Mr Hyre authorizing Messrs. R.J. Whitla and Company to receive this cheque.\n\nThe delay in forwarding this document is due to the fact that the account was not presented sooner, which Mr. Hyre explains as having been due to the impossibility of obtaining a receipt from the Teacher at an earlier date, and his holding the account until he should visit the City, which he only did recently.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to the Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMemorandum for the Department.\n\nMr. Inspector McColl had just returned from his inspection of the Beren's River Agency, and reported that the stove at the Poplar River School was broken and utterly useless.

Hope.\nTeacher.\nOTTAWA, June 14th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School, in his annual report for the last fiscal year, states that the foundation, which is of wood, has quite rotted away.\n\nI will be pleased if you will, upon the occasion of your next visit to this Reserve, make an inspection of the building, and furnish a report as to its present condition and what is required in the way of repairs to the foundation and approximately the cost of having the work done.\n\nDuring the summer of 1920, material was supplied to the amount of $255.00 for repairs to the building, and I may say that it was considered at that time that the quantity of material supplied would have completed all repairs to the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hope\nTeacher\nOTTAWA, July 5th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe June Quarterly Return of the Poplar River Indian Day School has been received.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Hope, requests that a new stove be supplied. He states that a stove the size of the one at present in the school be obtained. If the present one is unfit for use, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a new stove. Before making the purchase, you should obtain competitive prices and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. You may also purchase any stove pipe necessary.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your early attention in order that the new stove can be forwarded during the present summer and set up ready for use when the cold weather commences.\n\nYou should furnish properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the stove, stove pipe and any freight charges. You should also attach a memorandum giving the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted by them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 14th last No 125-14-5 I beg to say that I have inspected the Poplar River Indian Day School, and I found that the foundation which is of wood is in a fair condition and I consider that no repair is required for this year.\n\nThe repairs of this school which were authorized last year have not yet been completed. The work is being done by the teacher Mr. W.J. Hope after school hours and during holidays. When completed I will report to the Department.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n| ARTICLES       | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|---------------|----------------------|---------|\n| 1 Box Stoves 36\" | 25.30                |         |\n|               | 21.25                |         |\n| 24 - 7\" Pipe Pipes | 5.52                 |         |\n|               | 5.76                 |         |\n| 2 - 7\" Elbows | .80                  |         |\n|               | .68                  |         |\n| 1 Box Stoves 36\" | 25.30                |         |\n|               | 21.25                |         |\n| 24 - 7\" Pipe Pipes | 3.22                 |         |\n|               | 3.36                 |         |\n| 2 - 7\" Elbows | .80                  |         |\n|               | .68                  |         |\n|               | 60.94                |         |\n|               | 52.98                |         |\n\n**NOTE**\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDept. of: [Department]\n\nDate: Sept. 19th/21\n\nCity or town: [City]\n\nProvince: [Province]\n| DATE   | ARTICLES          | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|--------|-------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| Sept. 15 | 1 only 36\" Box Stove | 213   | $21.25        |              |       |\n|         | 14 7\" Stove Pipes |       | $5.36         |              |       |\n|         | 2 Elbows 7\"       |       | $0.68         |              |       |\n|         |                   |       |               |              | $35.29|\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Day school, I sent forward the return for the quarter ending 31st December, 1926. This shows favorably as to attendance, the food assistance in 1 meal to the children and the 2 biscuits to the children have placed for the children their means of sustenance and adds to their better health conditions. Mr. Caldwell asks for the following supplies for the pupils of the Day School. The greater attendance makes it necessary to furnish some more biscuits:\n\n- 8 boxes of Biscuits are needed for the pupils for the daily meal to each pupil in attendance daily, the following will be required:\n  - 300 lbs White beans,\n  - 100 \" Rice,\n  - 100 \" Sugar, granulated\n  - 20 \" Cocos,\n  - 6 doz. Mild, Borden's (or 2 cases)\n\nThe attendance has increased, in fact the attendance has about trebled, being for quarter ending 31 Dec, 1925, 4.5 and for the quarter ending 31 Dec 1926, 13. These conditions will in my opinion explain why Mr. Caldwell the teacher finds it wise to provide these extras. Finding the improved conditions I feel that this sufficient warrant for me to recommend the purchase and help to hold up the advantages gained.\n\nAll of which is submitted and recommended.\n\nMr. Caldwell leaves on Friday the 28th, and he would like to hear before he leaves.

The quantities now authorized, with the supplies already forwarded, will make an increase of nearly four times the quantities previously supplied. We note that the attendance has greatly increased, but it is thought that there should be a reduction in the quantities asked for next year.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the supplies you are now authorized to make and have forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the matter of the desks which are requisitioned for you ask for the makers name of the desks on hand. There does not appear to be any name on them. They are a mixed variety. The number of desks ordered will not accommodate the whole school, as there are 28 children on the roll this quarter, and five more of school age who have been at the trapping grounds this quarter and whose names do not appear on the roll, but I will be able to utilise some of the old desks by making one out of two, if the desks on order are supplied.\n\nThe closets for the school are a very necessary requirement, as the only accommodation which the children have at present is the surrounding bush. This may have been considered sufficient when the attendance was limited to about six daily, as it was some two years ago, but the growing attendance demands better conditions. I have figured a closet which would be satisfactory but if the Department wishes another style built, a plan of this could be sent to me. It appears to me necessary, however, to have separate closets for the girls and boys.\n\nYou will notice that I have asked for an increase in the school rations. I have found it necessary to purchase recently another 100 lbs of beans from the H.B.Co here to complete the term. I have done this at my own expense and trust that the Department will see the advantage of supplying the required amount this year.\n\nRe the additional dishes required. While we have 15 on hand, the daily attendance often exceeds this number.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(signed) A.E. Caldwell.\nSelkirk, Man. 16th June, 1928\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose requisition for school material, and supplies for children's mid-day meal from the teacher of the Protestant Indian Day School at Poplar River.\n\nThe request for new desks was forwarded last fall and in your letter No. 125-14-5 dated 7th September you suggested re-ordering in spring.\n\nThe school building requires painting both inside and out, as it is in a very weather beaten state.\n\nThe supplies for mid day meal are greater than last year. (166 lbs beans and 100 lbs rice more being asked for). 32 boxes of biscuits have already been shipped this year and the yarn and soap are on hand and will be forwarded in a few days.\n\nI also enclose copy of letter received from Mr. Caldwell.\n\nI beg to recommend that these requisitions be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 20, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Poplar River Indian Day School for supplies for the pupils' midday meal, also for new desks, the painting of the school building both inside and outside, and the erection of new toilets.\n\nIt is noted that there is an increased attendance at this school and that the teacher is requesting a larger quantity of supplies for the midday meal. The Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase and delivery of the following, which, it is considered, should be sufficient for next year's use, taking into account the average attendance of pupils as shown by returns received:\n\n300 Lbs. Beans,\n150 Lbs. Rice,\n50 Lbs. Sugar,\n40 Lbs. Cocoa,\n2 Cases Condensed Milk,\n\n6 Enamel Plates,\n6 Enamel Cups,\n12 Spoons (inexpensive),\n1 Large Stew Kettle.\n\nBesides the above, you may also purchase the following supplies for the use of the school:\n\n2 Each Brushes & Combs,\n1 Mirror (inexpensive),\n12 Yds. Tovelling,\n1 Scrubbing Brush,\n12 Panes Window Glass, 12\"x26\",\n\n1 Cross Cut Saw,\n3 Brooms,\n2 Galv. Water Pails,\n5 Lbs. Putty.\n\nIf possible, competitive prices should be obtained for the purchase of the above supplies, and they should be secured from the firm quoting the lowest price. These supplies should not be forwarded until the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays. Please forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the above supplies.\n\nIt is noted that you will arrange to forward the biscuits, yarn and soap required.\n\nRelative to the painting of the school building, both inside and outside, and the erection of toilets, I have to request that you will forward an estimate of the cost, including material and labour. You should also state how it is proposed to have the painting and the building of the toilets carried out.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-5, part 1)\n\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nIt is considered that separate toilets should be erected for the boys and girls. It is not intended that expensive toilets be erected, and it is considered that the list of lumber and other materials supplied by the teachers is excessive and that toilets, which would be satisfactory could be erected at much less expense. I am returning herewith the requisition for the material for the toilets and for the painting of the school building, and shall be pleased to have your views as to whether less material would not be satisfactory, stating full particulars as to the cost, etc.\n\nRegarding the 15 single school desks, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n9 Single School Desks for Pupils 7-9 Yrs.,\n9 Single School Desks for Pupils 10-14 Yrs.\n\nYou should obtain prices from the following firms for the supplying of the above desks, and you should ask them to quote F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the School:\n\nWestern School Supply Ltd., Christie School Supply Ltd.,\n1402 Rose St., Brandon,\nRegina, Sask., Man.\n\nWestern Seating Co., E. N. Moyer Co. Ltd.,\n179 Bannatyne Ave. E., Winnipeg,\nWinnipeg, Man., Man.\n\nYou should make the purchase of the desks from the firm quoting the lowest price, obtaining an account, in duplicate, and upon receipt of the desks, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment. Please arrange for the shipment of these desks during the present summer. They should be shipped in a knocked down condition, and assembled and set up in the classroom when they arrive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.

It should be lined with wall-board on the interior, and new floor and brick chimney, with paint both for interior and exterior. The school is very cold this winter for the children.\n\nH. A. Stewart.\nOttawa, January 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police a report regarding a patrol made to the Poplar River Indian Reserve. A visit was made to the school, and a good attendance was found. It is stated that the school building requires considerable repairs, and that it should be lined with wallboard on the interior, a new floor and brick chimney installed and both the interior and exterior of the building painted.\n\nI have to request that on the occasion of your next visit to Poplar River you will make an examination of the school building, and inform the Department of the repairs required to place this building in good condition. An itemized statement should be given as to the work required and the approximate cost of same, also how you would recommend that the work be carried out. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing having the repairs required carried out next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your annual report form, just received owing to the condition of the ice. It is unlikely that you will receive this form completed until sometime in June, when it will be sent from the nearest point of call for the boats.\n\nMay I suggest that the form for this point be sent somewhat earlier, say in February, so that we may be able to get it mailed to you on the last ice mail?\n\nMay I request you also to give your attention to the remarks re the condition of the school building? I am aware that the Department is unlikely to wish to undertake any expense during the present time of depression, but it is absolutely necessary that something be done to provide a more comfortable building for the children. The foundation has rotted, and the ship-lap boards with which the building is lined, have dried to such an extent as to be no longer weather-proof. The walls also are bulging owing to the lack of foundation support.\n\nAs the register during the past five years will show, the attendance has been steadily increasing, and it is our wish to have this increase maintained. More desk accommodation is needed, but this should be taken up only after something is decided about the building.\n\nMay I suggest that the labour of a new school building would be of great benefit to the whole reserve this summer or fall, as the labour conditions at the fishing stations are not good, and it would be greatly more desirable to spend money in this way rather than to supply rations to the band.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-5, part 1)\nOttawa, June 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of January 10th, last, regarding the repairs required to the school building at the Poplar River Indian Day School. A report has been received from the teacher regarding the condition of this building. He states that the foundation is rotting and that the shiplap boards with which the building is lined have dried to such an extent as to be no longer weatherproof.\n\nWe will have no funds this year to provide for the erection of a new building, and, as it will be necessary to carry out the minor repairs required to make the building as comfortable as possible for the next school year, I have to request that you will furnish a report regarding the repairs which you would recommend be carried out, stating the approximate cost of any material and labour required. Only the work absolutely necessary should be considered. Your report should be forwarded as soon as possible, in order that any work authorized can be carried out before the cold weather sets in next fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJanuary 20th,\n1932.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nA New School at Poplar River.\n\nRepeated representations have been made to us by our missionary at Poplar River that a new school building is urgently needed. I understand that the present building is in such a bad state of repair that he has been advised by the Agent or his deputy to give up trying to conduct classes in the building during the winter, if the weather becomes particularly inclement.\n\nJudging from our experience in rebuilding at Poplar River after the fire of two years ago, we have in Mr. Caldwell a very fine building supervisor. I understand, also, that Mr. Indian Agent McPherson and Commissioner Graham are recommending that a grant be placed in the estimates for next year for this purpose. I feel sure that Mr. Caldwell can erect the building at a minimum of expense, and that it would be the part of wisdom, if the money can be obtained at all, to let him proceed with the work. Certainly, from our standpoint, no group of Indians on Lake Winnipeg have made the progress in the last three years that those at Poplar River have made under Mr. Caldwell's guidance and leadership.\n\nYour attention to this matter will be very greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6245, file 538-5, part 1)\nOttawa, January 25, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the representations made by the missionary of the United Church at Poplar River for the erection of a new school building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that no funds for this purpose were provided in our Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year. The need at this point has been noted, and the Department will endeavour to provide in the Supplementary Estimates the funds required to erect the building. Should, however, the item be disallowed, the need will be kept in mind and an effort made to have the funds provided at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is noted that the last steamer leaves Selkirk on the 12th instant. The Department is of the opinion that arrangements should be made to have these requisitions forwarded much earlier in the year, in order that due consideration can be given to what articles can be allowed.\n\nThe requisition sent has been carefully reviewed, and, owing to lack of funds, the Department is only prepared to supply the following:\n\n- 200 lbs. Beans,\n- 3 cases Condensed Milk\n- 150 \" Rice,\n- 24 bars Soap,\n- 40 \" Cocoa,\n- 1 Scrubbing Brush,\n- 10 \" Salt,\n- 1 Axe Handle,\n- 2 Brooms,\n- 6 Panes of Glass,\n- 1 lb. of Putty.\n\nWater pails, kettles, basins, an axe and a number of the other articles requested on the requisition this year were supplied last year. The Department sees no reason why it is necessary to again secure them, if reasonable care was taken of the supplies previously allowed.\n\nAs pointed out in the first part of this letter, it is impossible to have the school supplies shipped in time to catch the boat on Monday, next. Please let me know how these supplies can reach the school. Your reply will be awaited before an order is placed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk,\nMan.\nSelkirk, September 11th, 1932\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter #125-14-5 of the 9th instant, referring to the requisition for mid-day meal supplies for the Poplar River Indian Day School, I beg to inform you that the date of the sailing of the last Steamer, leaving Selkirk for Black River, has been changed from September 12th to September 21st.\n\nThe supplies, authorized have been purchased, and will be forwarded direct on that date.\n\nIf the Department will forward the school supplies at once, they may arrive in time to catch that boat. If not, they can be forwarded to Berens River and from there by mail carrier to Poplar River before navigation closes.\n\nThe delay in forwarding this requisition was owing to the mail service from Poplar River, being only once a month. It was forwarded from this Office, to Ottawa the day it was received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

I am very sorry that I have been unable to make a report on this sooner as I wrote Mr. Meadows on receipt of your letter but have just received a reply owing to the poor mail service to this point.\n\nIn our letter to Mr. Meadows we requested that he supply us with a list of materials required to repair the school and asked him to advise if he would rather have paint supplied or repairs made, as we could not supply both. He informed me that it would be impossible for him to give an estimate of the repairs required as he is not a builder. I also informed him that the Department would not allow anything for the labour of putting the paint on. He stated in his letter that if nothing was allowed for putting on the paint, there was little use in supplying it.\n\nI consider that Meadows can get along for another year without paint or repairs to his school and I would recommend that this matter be left over for the time being.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

Our present facilities do not include a teacher's residence, the United Church manse being used as teacherage. The school was improved to some extent last summer having been insulated with saw-dust from our saw mill on the Reserve, and other minor repairs effected.\n\nDuring our recent discussion in Winnipeg it was agreed our present inadequate facilities could not be replaced prior to 1950 but might then be erected. Assuming this having some validity may I make the following suggestions.\n\nWe have a sawmill and planer on the Reserve. If supplied a bill of materials required for standard one room school and teacherage we could supply locally a large percentage of building requirements to mutual advantage of local Indians and at great saving to Department. Of course, windows, doors, flooring, and some finishing materials would have to be shipped in. I would ascertain what we could advantageously supply after obtaining bill of materials. If this is acceptable our logging operation this winter would be accordingly increased for sawmill cut during summer 1949, then dry piled for use in spring and summer of 1950, if school were then to be built.\n\nThe foregoing plan would, perhaps, entail joint consideration by Education and Welfare Branches. The Branch is well aware of Poplar River as the problem band of this Agency. It seems feasible, if any plan put into effect were to be mutually advantageous, it should receive consideration. I submit the foregoing proposal merits consideration.\n\nIt would be beneficial to me to know probable reaction before the end of January in as much as our winter logging operation at this reserve will be affected accordingly.\n\nB.

Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the Poplar River Indian Reserve.\n\nIf you have not already done so, I suggest that you discuss the matter at the earliest possible date with Regional Supervisor Davis.\n\nMr. Davis is coming to Ottawa for a meeting early in January and if he is aware of your recommendations regarding Poplar River, we will be in a position to make a decision when Mr. Davis is in Ottawa.\n\nBernard F.

For some time I have observed a decided and growing desire on their part in this direction, and trust therefore that so long as the rising generation of these heathen Indians may receive the benefits of education.\n\nI beg further respectfully to inquire, in the event of the Department granting the request of these Indians, what steps are to be taken in the erection of a school house, and if the same shall be established at the Indian Village. It is a suitable locality, as you yourself are personally aware, though it is not on the Reserve, but is asked for by the Band in exchange for their River portion. It should also be noted that the School Houses hitherto built in this agency are very unsatisfactory buildings.\n\nC. Macall Reg.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg.\nbuildings for so important a work as that of training the minds of the young. Moreover, the distance to this point is nearly 100 miles from the Bas up the Carrot River. It will therefore be expensive to have necessary articles for building purposes landed. It appears to me that to build a suitable structure at Red Earth the sum of $300 (three hundred dollars) will be required.\n\nYour reply is respectfully solicited.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n[Name]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter, dated the 15th inst., from Mr. Indian Agent Reader, with regard to the building of a schoolhouse for the Red Earth Band of Indians, at the Indian village on Carrot River, and that a teacher be furnished there.\n\nIt will be remembered that the Reserve surveyed for this portion of the Pas Moutain Band is several miles distant from this location, where these Indians are domiciled, and that they have asked\n\nThe Deputy of\nThe Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nasked a Reserve to be allotted them where their village is, and a timber limit given them a few miles up the Barrot River for the use of the Reserve in exchange for the Reserve on Slate River. This request, both Mr. Agent Reader and myself have recommended, and if granted by the Department the schoolhouse should be built at their village; but inasmuch as the erection of such a building in such a remote and inaccessible place on the government plan furnished me would cost upwards of two thousand dollars, I would suggest that a building of hemlock or tamarack with dove-tailed corners eighteen by twenty-four feet in size (18 x 24) ten feet walls in height, with a roof having good substantial rafters of the same kind.\nkind of timber as the building covered with inch boards and shingled with tarred paper underneath the shingles between the shingles and the sheathing. The square logs in the walls to be laid on top of each with a sufficient coating during its erection, with good mortar made of two parts of clean sand and one part of lime properly mixed with moose, deer, or cattle hair; and the next upper square log laid upon this mortar and this process continued until the walls of the building are completed, these hewn logs to be not less than ten inches square.\n\nThe flooring to be double, made of matched lumber 1/2 inches in thickness, 6 inches wide, with broken joints between the upper and lower flooring.\n\nThis I consider would make a warm...\nwarm and comfortable building,\nas dry wooden walls of this\nthickness are better non conductors\nof heat than those made of any\nother material available. In order\nto protect the corners of the building\nfrom wet and consequent decay\nit will be necessary to have them\ncovered with good matched inch\nand a half boards. As this pro-\nposed building is smaller than the\ngovernment plan furnished, only\ntwo windows, on each side, of the\nsize in the plan, and one at the\ndoor end of the building will be\nnecessary.\n\nI submit these suggestions for\nyour consideration and if ap-\nproved I would recommend that\nMr. Reader be instructed to have\nthe work properly done for an a-\nmount not exceeding three hun-\ndred dollars ($300), provided the\ndoor\ndoor, five windows and the foundation laid on blocks or stone, and having sleepers beneath the flooring according to the Government Plan in my office be placed in the building also. The stove, pipes and fats could be furnished afterwards by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Affairs.\nMemorandum\n\n27th April 1893\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nI think the log building for a school-house at Red Earth (as described by Mr. McColl) will be the best class of building for a school-house at Red Earth.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. McColl proposes that the usual school desks be furnished by the Department at a subsequent date. I think Mr. McColl might be asked whether the freight charges would not be very high and whether it would not be better to have ordinary desks and seats of lumber made at Red Earth.\n\nThe exchange of reserve at the Platte River Reserve for a reserve at Red Earth is now under consideration of the Dept. Until this is decided no steps can be taken towards the erection of a school building.\n\nIn this connection I desire to state...\nthat the Pas Mission is about 70 miles in a straight line\u2014nearly 100 miles by the river\u2014from the village of Red Earth. From Mr. McColl's letter (under 15th April) it might be inferred that the timber limit is for the Red Earth Indians only whereas it is intended for the whole Pas Mountain. (Alex from)\n\nthe correspondence regarding the exchange of reserves referred to (on file 87372) strongly suggests that the Red Earth Indians are exceptionally industrious. It would therefore appear that the interests of the two bands are widely different and as their reserves are far apart, trouble may ensue if they are continued as one band and in the near future may prevent the surrender or subdivision of any reserve or the execution of any measure requiring the vote of the entire band. Therefore respectfully submit whether measures should not be taken to permanently separate these two portions of the Pas Mountain band into two separate bands.\n\nSam Brow\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a letter from Mr. Agent Reader relative to the building of a schoolhouse for the Red Earth Band of Indians at the Indian village on Carrot River and the appointment of a teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that (here copy from memo under A.B. changing \"I\" to \"the Dept.\" etc.)\n\nYou will therefore be good enough to report whether\nwhether it would not be advisable to take measures for the separation of the bands composing the Pas Montano community into two separate bands.\n\nYours,\nManitoba Superintendency.\n\nOFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR,\n\nWinnipeg, May 5th 1893\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant relative to the building of a schoolhouse for the Red Earth Indians at the Indian College on Carrot River, and the appointment of a teacher, and in reply, I say to\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibby Youngman\nDeputy Chief Engineer\nof Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-1, part 1)\nI fully agree with your note about the government freight charges on Palisade Creek and asked that it will be better to have ordinary tents and beds made of canvas sewn by hands at Red Earth.\n\nWith regard to the timber limit asked by the Indians of Red Earth, I do not understand that it was intended for the Indians living at Chetwynd Lake unless they decided to leave their reserve in Crow Creek at Red Earth as much as three\nis plenty of pine timber for building and other purposes at Shoal Lake, for the use of the Indians living there, and as Shoal Lake and Red Earth are about 15 or 20 miles apart it would be an impracticable affair to convey the timber from the latter to the former place.\n\nWith regard to the advisability of operating the Red Earth Indian Reserve, two councils provided they are not willing to have a reserve in common at Red Earth, I beg to be informed what two councils...\ncould be allowed one at Red Earth and another at Pehewal Lake, each having one Owen Cillar to look after the interests of the different Bands.

As there are only four children at present living in the vicinity of the Cumberland School it should be closed at the end of this quarter and remain closed until such time as there are a sufficient number of children at that point to warrant its being re-opened.

I beg to nominate him for appointment. I am telling your Agent here, Mr. W. R. Taylor who I believe approves of Francis Daniels. I have written to F. Daniels telling him to open school again teaching at once as the children have been idle for some weeks now. I told him that his salary will begin from the time he begins teaching so I hope the S.D. will agree to this. I suppose you will notify F. Daniels either direct or by your Agent Taylor of his appointment, the rate of his salary, his duties, etc. I assure you that he will be suitable & willing to carry out the duties of working after Indians & medicine, if you have no one to care to appoint him.\n\nYours faithfully,\nJ.

I advised His Lordship of the fact that Chamberlain was to be transferred from Cumberland to Red Earth. The Bishop was against the transfer, on account of Chamberlain's being a cripple, and unable to endure any hardship, and as Red Earth is a hard place to get into, also hard to get supplies into I concurred with the Bishop in the matter.\n\nFrancis Daniels who formerly taught Shoal Lake School made application for the school, and as his Lordship was agreeable to his appointment he has been appointed in Fred Young's place.

Waddy, Indian Agent, The Pas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOfficer in Charge of\nI.D. Stores, Winnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that Mr. Badger, the Teacher at Red Earth Day School wishes to take two weeks holidays after the Easter holidays, and he has promised to open his school two weeks earlier in the summer holidays. His reason for asking for this holiday is so that he may go out on a rat hunt for a couple of weeks and earn a few dollars at the same time when he is away. Practically the whole population will be out in the rat swamps, and there would be hardly any attendance at school during that time.\n\nI have the honour to recommend that Mr. Badger be allowed to take the two weeks holidays for the reasons stated above.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 25, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, in which you recommend that Mr. Badger, teacher of the Red Earth Day School, be granted two weeks extra leave after the Easter holidays, in order that he may go hunting.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the extra holidays being granted to the extent of two weeks. It is understood that he will re-open the school two weeks earlier after the summer holidays, in order to make up this time. You will be good enough to inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to ask that an increase of salary be allowed the School Teacher at Red Earth day school. This man receives only $400.00 per year, while the school teachers at Shoal Lake and Chemawawin get payed higher salaries for doing the same work.\n\nI would be obliged if the Department would give him a slight increase.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. McLennan,\n\nMr. Agent Waddy forwards a request for an increase in salary to Isiah Badger, teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School.\n\nHe was appointed teacher of this school on September 4th, 1917, at $400.00 per annum, the amount of salary which he is at present receiving. Besides this he receives bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum and $50.00 as dispenser and issuer of rations. He has no professional qualifications, but Mr. Inspector Jackson, who recently visited the school, states that the pupils are making good progress and that he congratulated the teacher on the success he had met with during the past year. He keeps the school neat and clean and is probably as successful in his work as a teacher having the proper qualifications would be. Mr. Badger is an Indian. There is an enrolment of 25 pupils, with an average attendance of 20.\n\nAll the other teachers in the locality receive $500.00 and bonus, and I would recommend that Mr. Badger's salary be increased from the first of the current quarter to $500.00 per annum. I shall be pleased to have your decision regarding this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 30th, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th, instant, applying for an increase in the salary of Isaiah Badger, teacher of the Red Earth Indian day school.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that it has been decided to grant Mr. Badger an increase of $100.00, from the first of July, last. This will make his salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, from that date.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform him of the increase granted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ.W. Raddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that on November 20th I visited the Red Earth Reserve, and while there intended to inspect the school. However, the teacher was ill in bed for three days, and was still very sick at the time I made the visit.\n\nThe attendance showed an average of sixteen children for this quarter, but will be much less toward the end of the quarter, as the parents are taking the children away on the hunt.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report I visited Red Earth Day School on the 17th of June. The teacher at this school had a first class garden, although it was flooded for three weeks this Spring. He had the ground nicely cleaned up and the place in good shape.\n\nOn the register are nineteen girls and eleven boys. There were present ten girls and sixteen boys. The average for the past month would be twenty, but during three weeks of the term, school was closed, on account of the high flood. Two children in the fourth grade were advanced in all the subjects of that standard. In standard sr. XXXX, there are eight children very good in reading, recitation and arithmetic. The balance of the children are in the Kindergarten class. I am well satisfied with this school at present.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear sir,\n\nWith reference to above I would be glad if you could fix it so that school holidays in this reserve could be held during April & May instead of July & August. This would fit in so much better here as all the people leave during April & May for the spring that hunt taking the children along with them but they are generally all round during July & August another thing I may mention is the difficulty the few children who are around during April & May have in getting to school on account of the flooded conditions generally prevailing at that time & it is my opinion that it would be better in every way to have the Summer holidays in April & May.\n\nAn early reply will greatly oblige\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaiah Radgy\nTeacher\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith application from the teacher at Red Earth Day school to hold the summer holidays during the months of April and May next.\n\nHis explanation is satisfactory, as during these months most of the people are in the swamps after the rats, and I would recommend that the holidays be arranged as suggested.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, January 10th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Isaiah Badger, teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School, in which he requests that the summer holidays be taken during the months of April and May, next, instead of during July and August, and stating the reasons for making this request.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the explanations furnished by the teacher for changing the time of the usual summer holidays and also in view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of the annual vacation being taken during the months of April and May, next, on the distinct understanding, however, that Mr. Badger will keep the school open during the months of July and August.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mr. Badger accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to letter 128-8-1 of the 10th January last giving authority to Issiah Badger the teacher at Red Earth Day School to close the school during the months of April and May on condition that the school be kept open during July and August, and to the application made by Mr Badger which I sent the Department, I beg to say that the teacher acted in an underhand manner about this.\n\nThere is no doubt the school should be closed during these two months, as the children are away with the parents on the hunt, and also there are floods at Red Earth Reserve every spring at this time. However, I found out lately that Badger really wanted the holidays so he could act as agent for a firm of fur buyers during the holidays.\n\nI called him into town and he admitted that this was his reason. I had the Missionary, Mr. Fraser in the office when Badger was here, and the teacher asked that the Department might give him another chance to teach the school, but that they withhold his salary for April and May.\n\nBadger understands that his salary is a yearly one and that he was wrong in acting as agent for the fur firm, as well as lying to me about it. However, I beg to recommend that his salary be cut off for the two months and that he be given another chance.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 31, 1922.\n\n1679-109\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the request made by Isaiah Badger, teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School, that he be allowed to take the annual summer holidays during the months of April and May, on condition that the school be kept open during July and August.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that Mr. Badger misinformed you as to his reason for requesting that the holidays be taken during April and May.\n\nHe should, at the end of the present quarter, June 30th, prepare a return showing the number of days he actually taught and he will be paid salary for that period only. He may, if he desires, and there is a sufficient number of Indian children who will attend, keep the school open during July and August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Barrie,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPas., Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 20th inst., I visited the Red Earth Day School on the Red Earth reserve.\n\nThe teacher here is Isaiah Badger, a treaty Indian of the Red Earth band, who has taught this school for a number of years.\n\nThere are 30 pupils on the register, the average for the quarter is 22, and 25 were present at time of my visit. School was closed for the holidays during April and May as previously reported, so the children were not very much better than at time of last visit, but they are getting on fairly well.\n\nThis school has a good garden this year.\n\nThe pupils in standard one can read, spell, write, divide, add, subtract, and multiply simple sums. Standard two in addition to above can do long division and can give recitation from lessons. Three pupils in standard three are very good at arithmetic, except that they attempted fractions with poor results. All the pupils here are very good at writing.\n\nThe premises were in first class clean shape, and the pupils were tidy.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJ. W. Waddy Eggs\nThe Pas Man\n\nDear sir,\n\nI hereby tender my resignation as school teacher from Red Earth Indian Day School... To take effect on the first day of April...\n\nYours truly,\n\nIsaiah Badger\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose a letter received from the teacher at Red Earth day school, in which he states he wishes to give up his position as teacher at end of this term.\n\nI understand that Mr Badger wants to go trading for one of the fur companies. I saw him a few weeks ago and he made no mention of the fact that he wished to resign, he was very friendly and I have had no trouble with him at all, in fact he is one of the best teachers we have up here.\n\nI presume we will have to accept his resignation. I have no one in view for the position just now.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 13th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing the resignation of Isaiah Badger, teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the resignation of Mr. Badger is accepted. He should prepare and forward his return to you, promptly at the end of the quarter, for transmission to the Department, in order that the amount of salary and bonus due him can be paid. The address to which the cheques are to be sent should be stated on the return.\n\nRegarding the securing of a teacher to succeed Mr. Badger, I have to request that you will consult the authorities of the Church of England, under whose auspices this school is conducted, with a view to obtaining a suitable teacher for this school. We hope that you will be able to obtain the services of a teacher with the necessary qualifications to begin duties at as early a date as possible after the Easter holidays. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by the Church authorities should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYou should give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 14th inst. I visited the Red Earth Day School.\n\nMr. F.J. Daniels was teaching.\n\nThe register showed 18 boys and 13 girls, with 14 boys and 8 girls present; the average for the quarter up to time of my visit was 13.\n\nThere were 4 in the a.b.c. class who were just learning the alphabet and their figures, and 7 more who were also in about the same class though they were a little further advanced.\n\nFive pupils were in the 1st junior standard who could read, add, subtract, spell, multiply, and divide, they were quite smart at their work.\n\nTwo were in the senior 1st and were about the same as the above five.\n\nThe balance of the pupils were in the 2nd standard and could do all the above work as well as usual in their standard, and could make up and write sentences in English quite well.\n\nThe pupils in this school are always smarter than elsewhere, they attend the school more regularly just now, I hope they keep it up.\n\nThe school is very clean, with a nice garder for the pupils.\n\nIn regards to a teacher for this place I beg to state that Mr. Isaiah Badger will go back to work for us if the Department will accept him. Rev. Mr. Fraser the Rural Dean for this point has asked me to recommend Mr. Badger.\n\nIf the appointment is made he would not start school until October 1st next.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the Red Earth Indian Day School. It is noted that there has been a fairly regular attendance, and that the children were progressing favourably, also that the classroom was kept clean, and that there was a garden for the pupils.\n\nRegarding the obtaining of the services of a teacher for the next school year, I beg to say it is considered, in view of the attendance and the evident interest taken by the parents in the education of their children, that the services of a teacher having some professional qualifications should be obtained. Mr. Isaiah Badger, whom you recommend be re-appointed, has no professional qualifications, and during the period he taught this school very little real progress was made. I have, therefore, to request that you will, in conjunction with the Church authorities, endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher having some professional qualifications. If the services of such are obtained, we would be prepared to pay a larger salary, the amount to depend upon the qualifications possessed by the person engaged.\n\nYou will please give this matter your early consideration, and endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher for this school in time to begin duties after the present summer holidays. The name, qualifications and experience of the person nominated by the Church authorities or yourself should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. If you are unable to obtain a qualified or experienced teacher, we might then consider the re-engagement of Mr. Badger. We note that he would be unable to begin duties until the 1st of October, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter 128-8-1 of the 7th ultimo, regards teacher for Red Earth Day School, and beg to say that I have taken this matter up with the Church authorities, and they state that at present they have no one in sight who could take this school over, and that it would be advisable to allow Mr. Badger to start work on the 1st of October as suggested, and if anyone can be obtained in the near future Mr. Badger's services can be dispensed with.\n\nThere is no teachers residence at Red Earth, Mr. Badger uses his own dwelling.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 14, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, relative to obtaining the services of a teacher for the Red Earth Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that you have taken this matter up with the Church Authorities, but that at present they have no one in view who would be suitable as teacher at this school. If they do not succeed in securing a teacher before the first of October, next, the Department will approve of the temporary re-engagement of Mr. Isaiah Badger, in order that the school may not remain closed. His retention of the position, however, would depend upon the period it will take the church authorities to obtain a competent teacher.\n\nYou may inform Mr. Badger accordingly, and if he will agree to carry on the work until another teacher is secured, you may instruct him to begin duties on the first of October, next. Kindly advise the Department as to the action taken. You should, however, again request the Church Authorities to make an early nomination of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on December 7th I visited the Red Earth Indian Reserve and examined the school. There were 15 boys and 11 girls in attendance as per the register. There were present 10 boys and 6 girls. The average for the quarter up to the time of my visit was 12. These children are in the following classes. Beginners 12; Grade One, 10; Grade two, 4. The attendance had been very irregular as the children's parents had been away on the rat hunt. The children did not show much improvement. However, they have been working under different teachers and this helps to hold them back as these teachers all have different systems of teaching.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\u2014 I have the honor to report that on the 3rd inst\nI inspected the day school at Red Earth Indian Reserve.\nThere were 9 boys and 8 girls present, and the register\nshowed 15 boys and 9 girls in attendance.\n\nThe pupils in standard 3 were well up in\ntheir regular studies with the exception of writing,\nthe teacher had got careless and the pupils had\nbeen getting no writing exercises. I told him to\nget busy and have the routine work carried out before\nmy next visit. The children were being made put\nin too much time on fractions and higher arithmetic\nwork for which they were not qualified.\n\nThe other grades were doing well.\n\nThe school building was very neat and clean\nand the pupils were tidy.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 14th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, reporting on your monthly visit to the Red Earth Indian Day School. Your remarks regarding the progress the pupils are making in their studies have been noted, as well as the teaching methods employed by the teacher.\n\nA year ago the question arose as to the appointment of a teacher to succeed Mr. Badger. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of August 14, 1923. I shall be pleased if you will state whether any action was taken by you with the Church authorities with a view to obtaining another teacher for this school. A difficulty in securing another teacher is due to the fact that there is no teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to Red Earth Indian Day School, and your letter No. 126-8-1, of the 14th ult.\n\nI beg to state that His Lordship Bishop Lloyd visited Red Earth reserve last summer and informed Mr. Badger, the teacher, that he would probably recommend a qualified teacher for the above school in the near future.\n\nBishop Lloyd made arrangements with Mr. Badger to instruct the new teacher in the Cree language, and I understand Mr. Badger is to be kept on in the employ of the church after the Indian Department appoints a new teacher. As matters stand at present no teacher is in sight for the position. I placed in the estimates an amount sufficient to build a house for a teacher if one is sent to that district, but there is no use going ahead with the building until we see if a teacher is to be supplied in exchange for services rendered by Mr. Badger.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. J. W. WADDY, INDIAN AGENT,\nDATED NOV. 24th, 1924.\n\nAnother matter to be considered is that of labour, it is impossible to supervise day labour unless an official is right on the job. Perhaps His Lordship Bishop Lloyd has a teacher in mind who would be willing to go to Red Earth in company with a carpenter we could supply, and the teacher could work at the building and draw wages while doing so. If it is possible to do so, the new teacher should have agricultural qualifications. If this is not looked into we may have to supply a farm instructor to this reserve in the near future.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honor to enclose the quarterly return for June quarter 1925 from the teacher of the day school at Red Earth reserve.\n\nI understand that the Church authorities are recommending a qualified teacher for this place, to begin work at start of next term.\n\nOn instructions of Commissioner Graham I have obtained material for the teachers new residence at Red Earth, the lumber, paint, etc went forward in June and was delivered safely last week. The men who are to construct the house are working on the house for the teacher at Chemawawin, and expect to be through there in two weeks. They will then proceed to Red Earth and will put up the house there before September 1st probably by August 15th.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

A cheque in payment of salary will be forwarded in due course.\n\nIt is noted that the material for the teacher's residence in connection with this school has been obtained and that it is hoped to have this house completed before September 1st, next. We hope that the Church authorities will be able to nominate the services of a qualified teacher in time to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays. Please take this matter up with them and forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Naddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the new teacher's house being built at Red Earth Indian Mission, and the termination of the appointment with the present Indian Teacher, Mr. Badger, as soon as the new house was ready. I beg now to nominate Mrs. Mabel Burbridge of Pontrilas, Sask., as the resident Teacher.\n\nShe is an Associate in Arts of the University of Oxford, has gone through the Normal School in Saskatoon, and held the second class Professional Diploma for Saskatchewan. She has had fourteen years experience in teaching, of which four years prior to the Normal School has been served in schools in Saskatchewan. She also holds the St. John's Ambulance certificate with distinction for Home Nursing, First Aid, and Hygiene.\n\nAt the time I approached Mrs. Burbridge, my understanding from the Indian Agent was that he needed a teacher who could give farming instruction as well, so as not to have to appoint a Farming Instructor.\n\nMrs. Burbridge's husband is a very good man for that. He understands the Indians thoroughly, and has given up his farm on purpose to go to Red Earth. If you will give him a half appointment as Farm Instructor, something of the nature of part time or half time, we will give him sufficient work for the other half time. They are both very good candidates for the Indian work.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott\nSuperintendent Gen.

D. McLEAN.\nThe Right Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.\nBishopsthorpe\nPrince Albert\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI was both surprised and disappointed when I read your letter of August 18th citing the refusal of the Indian Department to accept your Lordship's nomination of myself as teacher at the Red Earth Indian Reserve.\n\nI quite realize that the decision is final in so far as the Dept. is concerned, yet I cannot forbear acquainting your Lordship as to the circumstances in which we are placed by said refusal.\n\nFrom the time of my interview with you in April last till the receipt of your letter I had had no intimation or knowledge that a married teacher...\ncircumstances as myself might not be employed on the Indian Reserves.\n\nEarly in July my husband visited Rural Dean Fraser at the Pas with reference to our probable appointment or the advisability of my resigning from Pontrelas School where I was then teaching.\n\nUpon receiving definite assurance that we might hold ourselves in readiness to proceed to Red Earth to commence our duties on or about September 1st. I resigned from the school my husband in order not to delay matters rented the farm for three years (with buying option) selling his stock at considerably less than their worth & issued bills of sale of the remaining farm & household equipment.\n\nThus we find ourselves both homeless & workless since we only received your letter containing the Dept's decision while making final arrangements to proceed to the Pas by today's train.\nOur disappointment is the keener in that we must relinquish hopes of taking up a work that has been our cherished ambition for several years. We clearly perceive that the Indian Department is solely responsible for our non-appointment and therefore tender our sincere thanks for the interest your Lordship has shown in this matter.\n\nAnd beg remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMabel Burbridge.\nwhose name was mentioned for Big Heads, had been there before and it might be better to place him in some other place where a Catechist is needed.\n\nI sincerely hope that Mrs Burbridge can be appointed there for they seem to me to have had hard treatment.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr General Superintendent Scott\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nI am sending you enclosed a letter which I have received from Mrs. Burbridge with regard to the appointment at Red Earth. I cannot but feel that they have been badly treated in this matter.\n\nProbably had I not been in England on immigration matters during the months of May, June, and July, this would not have fallen out in this unfortunate way.\n\nWhen I discussed the appointment to Red Earth, I understood the Pas Agent to ask for a teacher who had agricultural knowledge; otherwise, the department might have to appoint a farming instructor on that reserve.\n\nIf we are to have qualified teachers, we have to make up the amount the Dept allows by a Catechist grant to make a living wage. With those two qualifications necessary, it was hardly likely that we could find a third qualification in the same person. It was because Mr. Burbridge had a good deal of agricultural knowledge and was a fit man to act as Catechists as well while the wife was a qualified teacher that the suggestion was made to them to take up this work. They did not offer, the suggestion was made to them in April, and they went up to look over the work in July. If they were not suitable why was not objection taken at that time? Everybody at the Pas knew that their names were suggested for this work. I had no idea their names had not gone before the Department long ago. Surely the agent should have said then that only a married male teacher would be accepted for that post and not leave it until they have sold up everything and are starting for the post.\n\nPerhaps Mrs. Burbridge can be appointed to Big Heads as a Catechist is not really needed there and Mr. Burbridge could be found some other work elsewhere especially as the Missionary at Fort a la Corne suggests that Mr. Gentleman\nOTTAWA, Sept. 2, 1925.\n\nRight Rev.

The teacher had left the reserve to visit The Pas, and would not be back to teach school until about the 27th. During the month of September the school had been open nine days to the time of my visit. The teacher had remarked in the register for the first week of September that there were no children present on the reserve and the school was not opened during that time, but upon inquiring I was informed by the Indians that Mr. Ash was not on the reserve himself during the first few days of the month, but there were fifteen children waiting there to attend school. I saw Mr. Ash on the morning of the 20th when he was on his way to The Pas, and he told me there were no school children on the reserve so he was going to Town. I saw some school children on my arrival, and the Indians informed me that there were fifteen children ready to go to school that day.\n\nI do not know just what to recommend in this case, as the teacher seemingly takes more interest in his own affairs than he does in those of the Department, but I think it would be well to ask His Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan, to endeavor to have us supplied with another teacher by January 1st.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst.

C. Ash, teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School, I regret to state that Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, of The Pas, has reported in part as follows:\n\n\"I beg to state that I visited the Red Earth Indian Day School on Sept. 20th. The teacher had left the reserve to visit The Pas and would not be back to teach school until about the 27th. During the month of September the school had been open nine days to the time of my visit.

I saw some school children on my arrival, and the Indians informed me that there were fifteen children ready to go to school that day.\"\n\nIn view of this report, the Department is allowing Mr. Ash only one-half month's salary for September. And I wish Your Lordship would seriously consider arranging for a more interested incumbent at the end of the calendar year. Mr. Waddy states that the teacher appears to take more interest in his own affairs than he does in the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

He states' school could not be opened till Tuesday September 7th as the children had all been taken away during a hunt. Four days were lost (including labour day) Mr. Waddy visited the school reserve Sept 20th and 21st.

The teacher asked when he could leave and I told him it would be advisable to close the school at end of this term.\n\nI do not like taking any harsh action, but this teacher is an impossibility altogether. He is very well educated, nice manner, but lacking in many ways. The Department has to trust these people being honest, they are away off by themselves, and when they cannot be trusted it makes things bad all round.

We expect the new teacher to be appointed almost immediately, but it will probably be a month before he arrives at the reserve.\n\nI would consider that Mr. Badger should receive for his services a similar sum to what would be paid a teacher, as he is staying on the reserve by my instructions until the new teacher arrives.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $60 per teaching month, this being the full amount we can allow for his services. Please inform him of his temporary appointment, and arrange with him to begin duties as soon as possible.\n\nWe are informing the Church authorities of the arrangements made to carry on the work, and will again request them to endeavour to nominate the services of a qualified teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We will allow Mr. Badger salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month during the period he is engaged.\n\nI would request that Your Lordship make an early nomination of a teacher having the necessary qualifications to carry on the work at this school, and that you will forward for the approval of the Department full particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Red Earth Indian School, No. 128-3-1.\n\nRelative to previous correspondence under date of Dec. 11 regarding the resignation of Mr. Ash of Red Earth School and the nomination of his successor, I have pleasure in submitting the name of Mr. J.T. Blewett who has just resigned his school at The Barrier.\n\nMr. Blewett has 2nd Class Academic standing and 3rd Class Professional Normal in this Province. He has been teaching with much acceptance at The Barrier but that school is about to be closed owing to the paucity of children in that place. He is favourably known to your agent Mr. Waddy and also to our superintendent Reverend A. Fraser of The Pas and it is largely on their recommendations that I am now submitting his name.\n\nBelieving that your Department would be favourable to the appointment of Mr. Blewett, and because of the urgency of the case in view of the loss of time already involved, I have taken the liberty of advising Mr. Blewett to proceed at once to Red Earth and he is in all probability at work there at the present time.\n\nTrusting that my action in this respect will be approved by your Department, and that you will see your way to appoint Mr. Blewett to the position at Red Earth, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCharles W. McKim\n\nVice Chairman of Bishop's Commission.\nOttawa, February 8, 1927.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, nominating the services of Mr. J. T. Blewett for the position as teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School to succeed Mr. J. C. Ash, and stating the qualifications and experience which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Blewett. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. It is noted that Mr. Blewett was instructed by you to proceed at once to Red Earth and that he is in all probability at work there at the present time.\n\nWe hope that Mr. Blewett will meet with every success in his work at this school. We are informing Mr. Agent Waddy of his appointment and requesting him to give Mr. Blewett every assistance he can in his work. Mr. Commissioner Graham is also being informed of the approval granted for the appointment of Mr. Blewett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Canon G. W.

The Department is approving of his appointment with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. We understand that Mr. Blewett has proceeded to Red Earth and that he is in all probability at work there at the present time. I have to request that you will give him any assistance you can in his work at this school.\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of the 4th ultimo and the Department's reply thereto of the 13th of the same month, relative to the temporary appointment of Mr. Isaiah Badger to carry on the work at this school until a teacher was appointed. If Mr. Badger has been performing teaching duties, it will be necessary for him to prepare a return covering the period he was so engaged, and this should be forwarded through your office in order that any payment of salary due Mr. Badger can be made.

Lovell, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1938\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a letter from Chief Isaiah Badger of the Red Earth Band making certain complaints against the teacher on that reserve. Will you please be good enough to inquire personally into these complaints and furnish the Department with a report, returning the enclosed letter therewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Henry,\nSupt. Welfare and Training.\n\nSamuel Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nThe Pas, Man.\nUnfortunately some of these people have been carried on paylists at the same time we were paying them on voucher and this has led to further complications.\n\nThe situation is not particularly due to anyone's neglect or fault, but I think it requires direction from you as to how these people should be paid. My recommendation is that all dispensers and issuers of rations should be paid on voucher and under no circumstances should appear on paylists. The first thing to do as I see it is to make a clear distinction between dispensers of drugs and issuers of rations. I will undertake to be responsible for the appointment and payment of the former, the latter it seems to me, are administrative employees.\n\nThe Representative of the Treasury complains justly of this state of affairs.\n\nR.

In the meantime your proposal to get out the spruce logs this summer is approved and you may have this work done. The Church authorities, to whom rent is paid for the present building, should be asked to make at least some repairs, in order that it may be comfortable for the teacher and pupils next winter.\n\nYour remarks in regard to the site have been noted and the only suggestion that the Department has to make is that the building must be erected upon land belonging to the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nF.

In view of these prospects it is not considered advisable to incur further expenditure in the erection of new day school buildings at the present time.

File 10627-7\n\nThe building used for the school is the Chapel rented by the mission and is in a very dilapidated condition, the roof is leaky so that when it rains water drips all over, the mortar is falling off the walls, there is no chimney only the stove pipe going through the roof which is liable to set the building on fire during the winter.\n\nThere is neither porch nor double windows on the building making it uncomfortable during the cold weather.\n\n(Sgd.) Fred. Fischer,\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Sept. 5th., 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that the building used for the school on the Red Earth Reserve is in a very dilapidated condition. The roof leaks and when it rains water drips all over the floor. Mortar is falling off the walls and there is no chimney; the stove pipe simply goes through the roof and is liable to cause the destruction of the building by fire at any time. There is neither porch nor double windows.\n\nAs Your Lordship is aware the Department pays an annual rental of $40.00 for this and also for the Shoal Lake and Moose Lake school buildings. The Shoal Lake building also requires repairs, and it is stated that this matter has been repeatedly brought to the attention of the Church authorities but that no action has been taken. I would ask Your Lordship to see that these buildings are put in such a state of repair that they will be at least habitable, as if this is not done the Department will be forced to discontinue the payment of any further rental.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

If these are not made the Department will be forced to withhold the rental for the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred.

I have just returned from Red Earth. I think the state of the old log is quite so bad as to report implies. However, I gave orders while there for the immediate thorough repair of roof i.e., fresh shingling, & to make it habitable. We are not anxious to spend much on it, for the walls of a new building are up, & they are hastening to finish it, & may possibly use some of the material of the old building. But I will give orders to put it in suitable condition meanwhile.\n\n2. Shell Lake. a) The matter of repairs has not been repeatedly brought to the attention of the Church authorities. As a matter of fact, the school was closed for a year or two only lately re-opened. b) Here also the people are putting up a new building, & wish to abandon the old one. I was there last month & went into the matter thoroughly. They are going to set about it at once, I believe. It is a difficult situation but the people seem in earnest about it, & I have promised them some financial help. I trust this will satisfy you.\n\nI remain, yr. faithfully,\n\nJ. Saskatchewan\nI beg to enquire if it is the Department's intention to complete the day school building on the Red Earth Reserve this season. I understand the Indians have built a new chapel at that point and that the school is being held in it; the old chapel has been torn down.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances, the Department does not consider it advisable to complete the day school building on the Red Earth Reserve this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(Church of England.)\n\nThis school building is owned by the Church of England, and is also used for church services. Two panes of glass are held in by nails. The inside walls of school are very dirty, and the roof leaks in many places, in fact I counted ten places where you can see daylight through the roof. At the time of my visit, I went over to see the new school building which is being erected.

There is a building wall height, upon which the Department expended some money some two years ago. The building was never finished. The logs still stand with rafters in place.\n\nWill the Department inform me whether it is the intention to finish this building, and when.

Deputy & Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa. Can.\nOttawa, November 24, 1913.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nSome years ago the Red Earth Indians commenced erecting a school building on their reserve, which was not completed as the Department was offered the use of the church at an annual rental. This building is in a very dilapidated condition and the question of completing the day school has been brought to the attention of the Department, but, before authorizing the necessary expenditure, it would like to know whether, in view of the early completion of the new boarding school at The Pas, this day school would be required. The Department would like to hear from you in regard to this matter as soon as convenient so that, in the event of carrying on the building, work could be done this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, November 24, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing an estimate of the material required to finish the Red Earth Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Ven. Archdeacon MacKay has been written to and asked whether, in view of the early completion of the new boarding school at The Pas, this day school will be required. As soon as a reply is received from him you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nBattleford, Sask.\nJan. 5th 1914\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter No. 100927/5 of the 24th Nov.\n\nEnquiring whether a day school would still be required on the Red Earth Reserve in view of the early completion of the boarding school at the Pas. I did not reply at once as I was about to make a visit to the Pas agency. After making inquiries I am inclined to the opinion that even if a few of the children are sent from Red Earth to the Pas School there will still be enough remaining to make it desirable to continue the day school at Red Earth.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nCanada\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe building in which the day school at Red Earth is being conducted by Mr. Kennedy is said to be in very bad condition and it would require an expenditure of about $200.00 to repair it. Before authorizing this expenditure Ven. Archdeacon MacKay was asked whether, in view of the early completion of the new boarding school at The Pas, this day school would be required. A reply has been received from him in which he states that he is inclined to the opinion that even if a few of the children are sent from Red Earth to The Pas school there would still be enough remaining to make it desirable to continue the day school at Red Earth.\n\nI find on looking up the census return that there are 26 children of school age on the reserve. Twenty-one of these were enrolled in the school during the September quarter and the average attendance was only 8.6 for that quarter and for the past year 10. If all the\nthe children of school age were enrolled at this school there should be an average attendance sufficient to justify its continuance, even if a few of the pupils were recruited for The Pas Boarding School.\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, who recommended that an increase be given to the teacher, stated in his letter to the Department that he considers Mr. Kennedy one of the best of the old teachers that are employed. The increase was granted and he is now in receipt of a salary of $400.00 per annum.\n\nWould it not be well to have the building repaired, as recommended by Mr. Agent Taylor? If this is done the Agent should be instructed to see that the attendance is regular.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-5, part 1)\nOttawa, January 17, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 14th of November, last, I beg to say that the Department has decided to have the Red Earth Bay School repaired. You may purchase the material required in accordance with your estimate submitted in the letter above referred to and you should have the work done as cheaply as possible.\n\nWhen this building is repaired you will be expected to see that the attendance is regular.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This was probably due to not allowing for loss due to planing tongue and groove in the lumber.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose the report from the teacher at Red Earth Reserve day school for the September quarter.\n\nI visited this school on the 2nd inst., and found 14 boys and 7 girls present. I examined the children and found they have made progress in their studies. The pupils in the higher grades could do practically any sum or question in the text books but got flustered when set questions relating to sale of bale offur containing pelts of different values. I instructed the teacher to get busy on questions of this sort which will crop up during the after years of his pupils.\n\nThe pupils at this place pick up the work very quickly after starting school, but it is hard to advance them past the second standard on account of absences from school.\n\nThe school building was very clean, but requires 2 panes of glass 14 X 28, I would be obliged for authority to purchase same at cost of about $2.00.\n\nThe storehouse at this point flooded through the roof leaking, and spoiled a lot of biscuit. A new roof will cost $50.00 and should be built in spring of 1923. This hardly comes under the educational department, but as it is mixed up under school supplies and destitute supplies perhaps you can get a grant of that amount next spring, at which time I will take the matter up again.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 14th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School, and also a report on your visit to this school on the 2nd instant.\n\nIt is noted that the children have made progress in their studies and that the building was clean and in good condition.\n\nYou may purchase and have installed 2 panes of glass, 14 x 28, and you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the condition of the store house, I beg to say that you should draw the attention of the Department to the need of a new roof for this building early next spring and at that time furnish an estimate of the cost of having the repairs required carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that Isaiah Badger, the school teacher of Red Earth day school, has asked me if I will apply to the Department for assistance to the amount of $200.00 to help him put up a house, as his old shack at Red Earth is in bad shape. This man offers to pay back $25.00 per quarter if the money is advanced to him. The money to be taken out of his school salary.\n\nThis teacher is a treaty Indian, of the Red Earth band, and if he loses his position at any time there would be no way in which we could collect the money from him. However, he is teaching the school in a very satisfactory manner, and I do not anticipate any trouble with him. I beg to recommend that the Department allow him up to the sum of $150.00 of material and freight charges, if there are any funds on hand for this purpose.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 25, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nA treaty Indian, Mr. I. Badger, the teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School, has asked for a loan to assist him with the erection of a house. The Indian agent recommends that $150 be allowed for material and freight charges. As this Indian is in our employ and is living on the reserve, I wish to recommend that the Department allow a grant of $150 from School Vote to assist him with his building operations and that no deductions be made from his salary, which is at the rate of $500 for the ten teaching months plus bonus allowed by law.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2559/109 of the 18th instant, with reference to the request of Isaiah Badger, Teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School. In view of the fact that there is no residence provided for the teacher at this school, the Department will make a grant of $150 for material and freight charges to assist him in erecting a new house. No deductions will be made from the teacher's salary because of this grant. The material should be purchased by you, after securing competitive prices, and when you are submitting accounts in favour of the firm given the business, you should support them with a memo showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the meantime he wishes to be supplied with sufficient equipment to carry out the work. This equipment could be sent up on the boat during the summer. He would also like 20# cocoa. He states that the Indians would supply vegetables for the soup. However, I think it would be advisable if the Department allowed him some rice, split peas, and barley also.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn a requisition dated April 25th, on file 128-8-4, the following articles were requested for the teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School:\n\n1 Teacher's Desk\n1 Chair\nKitchen Table and Chair in use at present.\n\n1 Stationery Cupboard\n4 Window Blinds\n24 Clothes Hooks\n1 Water Pail\n3 Yds.

(RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-5, part 1)\nOttawa, May 6th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the providing of a midday lunch for the pupils of the Red Earth Indian Day School during next winter and the forwarding of the necessary supplies.\n\nIf the teacher will undertake this work without any charge for his services, the Department will approve of his doing so. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the equipment considered by you to be absolutely necessary in the serving of the meal. You may also purchase and forward 20 lbs. cocoa, a quantity of rice, split peas and barley. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred.\n\nA requisition has been received from the teacher for classroom equipment and supplies for the school. You may purchase and have forwarded the following:\n\n- 4 Window Blinds (of the dimensions required),\n- 1 Lb. Colored Wool,\n- 24 Clothes Hooks,\n- 12 Cards Needles,\n- 1 Galv. Pail,\n- 24 Thimbles,\n- 3 Yds. Canvas,\n- 2 Yds. Factory Cotton.\n\nThe teacher has asked that a teacher's chair and desk, also a cupboard, be supplied. Relative to the cupboard in which to keep classroom supplies, it is thought that you could arrange to have a suitable cupboard built with very little expense, and you may arrange to have this done. You may place an order with Christie School Supply Ltd., Brandon, to forward a teacher's table, No. 5, and a teacher's arm chair, No. 10. You should obtain accounts, in duplicate, which you should certify and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYou should also forward properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure authorized in the purchase of the supplies for the midday meal and for the school equipment.\n\nYou should arrange to have all the above supplies forwarded by boat during the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Haddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that the Teacher of the Red Earth Day School has informed me that the drinking water supply at that point is very poor, being contaminated with salt. He asks me if the Department would supply him with eavestroughing and two rain water barrels so he can catch the rain water, and use it for drinking purposes. The cost of this would be $35.00 after freighting, etc., is paid. I beg to recommend that he be supplied with this equipment.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the request of the teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School to be supplied with saves troughing and 2 rain water barrels, in order that he can catch the rain water to be used for drinking purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that water obtained by this method would be unsanitary and unfit for drinking purposes unless it were first boiled. If you consider that, in order to obtain a water supply for domestic purposes, this saves troughing is necessary, you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $35 in having the same supplied and freighted to the school. The Department will leave the matter in your hands to take the action considered advisable by you.\n\nIf any expenditure is incurred in the purchase of the above, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the spring, after the ice has gone out, there is no water fit for drinking, nearer than the lake, a distance of a mile.\n\nIf you could make a grant of fifteen dollars ($15) I will see that a substantial building is erected, and will pay any balance over $15 myself.\n\nI do so hope that you will be able to grant this, as otherwise the conditions next year will be nearly unbearable.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours obediently,\nJohn C.

I saw the teacher when I was at Red Earth and he stated that it was also necessary to have an ice supply as the rain is not to be depended upon in the spring. I beg to recommend that the grant be allowed.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

We note that this building is required owing to the water conditions which are very bad at this school, and that the teacher will see that it is satisfactorily erected.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, after you are satisfied the work has been completed, covering the above authorized amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I estimate that\nit would cost at least $50.00 to have stone\nbrought to the reserve and some more logs placed\nunderneath the building after it is raised up.\n\n\"The teacher's house requires a fence, which\nwas placed in the estimates last year.\n\n\"More desks are required at this school. I\nestimate that three #3 double desks, made by The\nC. C. & S. F. Co., of Preston, Ont., would be\nsufficient.\"\nOttawa, August 15th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of June 20th reporting on the Red Earth Indian Day School which had reference to repairs and replacements required. I regret that it has been overlooked. You may expend $50 in having the foundation of the school building repaired, and you may arrange for a suitable fence for the teacher's residence. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in this connection, as our funds are limited.\n\nYou may place an order for 3 No. 3 double desks with the Canadian Office and School Furniture Co., of Preston, Ont. You should give them shipping directions, and have them attach their freight receipt to the voucher. When the desks have arrived, if in good condition, you should certify to the account, in duplicate, and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

The food had been used up too fast and was about gone. The teacher stated that the system was not satisfactory and that he would like to see it done away with as when the grub was brought to the school to be eaten it messed up the desks and he had trouble in keeping the place sanitary. I talked the matter over with the Indians and they said it would be well to quit it for this year. Under the circumstances I told the teacher to store away our dishes and equipment, and gave the rest of small food supply to the woman who had cooked all winter.\n\nI have authority to put logs under the walls of the school. On sizing up the place it would appear as if this would only be a temporary arrangement and a waste of money as the building will have to be replaced in another year or so in any event, these old log places are unsatisfactory.

Blewett, he assembled his pupils, fifteen in all, he put them through a course of exercises such he would work out in a regular school day, classes are elementary, but they seem to know what had been taught to them in a fairly clear manner, and they all sang well, hymns, the national anthem and O Canada were very well rendered. The school building is log walls which require some badly required repairs, the floors should also be levelled, the sills, so far as I could judge, are rotted and should be renewed, a new stove would add to the comfort, door and windows seem to be alright; if made a little more weather tight it would be more comfortable, the furniture seems to be adequate; desks, table for teacher and chairs are all in fair shape. The teacher is dispenser and looks after destitute supplies, he is an unmarried man, he is in his probation period, his objective being to take holy orders. The school teacher at Shoal Lake is also a dispenser.\n\nJ. R. Bunn,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 22, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Bunn, in a report on his visit to the Red Earth Indian Day School during treaty payments, states as follows:\n\n\"The school building has log walls which badly require repairs. The floors should also be levelled. The sills, so far as I could judge, are rotted and should be renewed. A new stove would add to the comfort. Door and windows seem to be alright. If made a little more weather tight it would be more comfortable.\"\n\nIf it is not too late in the season, you may arrange to have any needed repairs made to the building in order to make it as comfortable as possible during the coming winter. You should, as far as possible, arrange to carry out the suggestions of the Inspector regarding the doors and windows in order to make them weather tight. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements, before the extreme cold weather sets in, in having the repairs absolutely required carried out. You may also purchase a new stove of a type that would be satisfactory.\n\nPlease keep all expenses as low as possible, and forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe matter of supplying a new stove should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He will go to the reserves and get out foundation logs, lift the buildings with jacks and put both places in shape. He will have to employ men at both places to assist him.\n\nBoth these schools should have a new layer of flooring put down at the same time and he would also do this work if it is approved and the lumber supplied. The lumber would cost about $60.00.\n\nHe will require an advance cheque to pay for labor, material etc., and I would be obliged if I can be given $200.00 which would include the work of laying the floors also. I cannot judge the exact cost of the work but it will be in the neighborhood of $300.00 for floors, labor, and other material I should think.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 9, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nWith Cheque -\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department of the action taken by you in having the repairs required carried out to the foundations of the Red Earth and Shoal Lake Indian Day Schools. Besides the work required to the foundations, it is noted that both schools should have a new layer of flooring, and that you estimate the total cost of the labour and material to be in the neighbourhood of $300.\n\nI am enclosing herewith accountable cheque No. 6099 for $200 to pay for the labour. You should arrange for the purchase of any material required, and you should forward accounts, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost. In accounting for the cheque which is sent you for the labour, you should forward the usual vouchers stating fully the number of days the men were employed and the rate paid per day. In forwarding accounts for material and in accounting for the cheque for the labour, it should be clearly shown the expenditure incurred for each of the schools separately. Accounts should be forwarded for material and for the cheque which is enclosed for the labour before the books of the Department close for the present fiscal year on March 31st, next.\n\nYou should see that a satisfactory job is completed at each of these schools. It is hoped that weather conditions will permit this work being carried out at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The work that was done on the school fence was very trivial.\n\nTen dollars for the house and an additional three for the school fence would, in my opinion, be adequate pay.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.

He also repaired the school fence.\n\nHe then asked this office to take up with the Department the matter of payment for his labor and on investigation it appears that he put in sixty fence posts, stretched the wire etc., and put up a gate. He also put the school fence in order which was a small matter. The teacher thinks that $15.00 would be ample for his work, but Mr. Waddy tells me that if the man gets $10.00 he will be well paid, as under ordinary circumstances the job should have been done in a day or day and a half by Badger and his helper.\n\nI would be obliged if the Department will advise me if a voucher for this work may be submitted for payment and for what amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

He further reports that the walls need whitewashing, the entrance door to the school is in such condition as to need replacing, that, presumably owing to the sinking of the foundation, the floor at both ends of the classroom is from four to six inches lower than at the centre. This ought to be remedied. A small book-cupboard is also needed to keep the school equipment in.

A small cupboard for books may also be purchased.

J. Paul\n\n(Commissary for the Bishop of Saskatchewan.)\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Red Earth School building, Saskatchewan.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Lovell, Mr. Lowe the Teacher and Chief Badger have consulted together about this matter, and have asked me to write to you about it.\n\nI think the Bishop of Saskatchewan wrote about it some time ago.\n\nDuring the last few years the number of this band of Indians has increased, and the number of children attending school has increased considerably.\n\nThere are now 28 children attending school, and the size of the building is 23 by 17 feet. There is no porch, and quite insufficient seating accommodation. I visited the School on Oct. 8th, and there were 27 children in attendance that day. Some of the small children were sitting three in a desk, and an arrangement of boxes had to be used for some of the children to write on.\n\nUnder the circumstances I thought the children were making very good progress, but the crowded conditions make it impossible for the pupils to do the best possible work.\n\nIt is an old log building, cold in winter, and should be replaced by a new building.\n\nWe found it necessary to build a new Church there two years ago; and the School needs replacing just as much as the Church did. Again the site of the building is unsuitable and dangerous for small children, as a few feet from the School fence is a sheer drop into the Carrot River. During recent years the flood waters in the Spring have overflowed from the lake into a natural cut-out a few yards from the school, and have eaten away the bank of the river, forming the abrupt drop of which I speak.\n\nThere is a very suitable site South-West of the present school, on the other side of the Teacherage, and I would suggest to you\nOttawa, November 6, 1936.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the condition of the present school building on the Red Earth Indian Reserve and requesting that provision be made to erect a new building, on a new site, southwest of the present school, with accommodation for at least thirty children.\n\nIn reply I have to say there were so many demands for new day school buildings and for repairs and alterations, that it was not possible, when preparing the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, to include an item providing the funds required for the erection of a new building at Red Earth. However, the need at this point will be kept in mind.\n\nThe Department will give favourable consideration, next spring, to providing some new desks and carrying out any minor repairs necessary to make the building more comfortable, until it is found possible to provide funds to erect a new building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVenerable W. E. J.

When forwarding requests of this kind, you should make a definite recommendation, stating whether you approve or not.\n\nInformation forwarded the Department some time ago indicated that the Red Earth School was in need of repair, and, in view of this report, an amount of approximately $150.00 was placed in our appropriation for the current year. This is all that we can expend at this school. Consequently, if the paint requested by the teacher was secured, there would not be much left for repairs.\n\nPlease let me have a definite recommendation from you, stating in what manner you consider it advisable to expend the amount that has been provided in this year's appropriation. You should, of course, give an estimate of the cost of any repairs recommended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nEnc.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-5, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have, as you know, put down in the 1940 estimates for a new School for Red Earth Reserve. The old School is in very bad shape and it is also much too small for the number of pupils it has to accommodate. The Ven. W.E. J. Paul has been pressing for a new school for this point for a number of years.\n\nIf we are going to build this school during the coming summer, it will be necessary to get the logs out and on the site during the winter. It would be practically impossible to do this during the summer, as there are no roads and much of the land around Red Earth is swamp. I would therefore like your authority to engage the Indians to cut logs and haul them to the site. I estimated this would cost $110.00.\n\nIt would be far better too if the material could be purchased and hauled in during the winter. Summer freighting is extremely difficult. The material should be purchased at Carrot River, Sask. It is out of the question to purchase the material here as it would mean shipping it by rail 500 miles to Carrot River and then it would have to be trucked in to Red Earth.\n\nAs far as I know there are no firms on the preferred list at Carrot River. There are two firms dealing in lumber and building supplies there. Lang Bros, Carrot River and the Beaver Lumber Co., Carrot River, Sask. I would like this material to be purchased so that it could be delivered by March 15th at the latest. After that date the roads are liable to be bad.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 539-5, part 2)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant regarding your request for a new school on the Red Earth Reserve.\n\nVery careful consideration was given to your request for a school on this Reserve but due to the fact that definite instructions were received to curtail expenditure to the greatest possible extent it was not possible to include an item for this school in our appropriation for the year 1940-41. Under these circumstances it will not be possible to proceed with the erection of a new school at this point during the summer of 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.
