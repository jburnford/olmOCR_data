What work they accomplished, or that portion of time, or whether anything of real benefit to these Territories has been done, we have little means of judging owing to the exceedingly meagre reports of the proceedings published in the Report of the Council, or rather, substituted organ of the Government, or to speak more correctly, of Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney. It appears to be the opinion of that functionary that the North West Council ought to be paid for publishing the ordinances passed by the Council or the bills submitted to them during the session. This is done partly with a view to induce the people into returning for what we pay into the Dominion Treasury, we ought to be entitled to a small grant for legislative expenses. As the N.W. Council is at present not doing its duty, we hope that the representatives who have been elected will be instructed to vote for what they pass into the Dominion Treasury, we ought to be entitled to a small grant for legislative expenses.\n\nAs the N.W. Council is at present not doing its duty, we hope that the representatives who have been elected will be instructed to vote for what they pass into the Dominion Treasury, we ought to be entitled to a small grant for legislative expenses.\n\nThe proceedings of the meeting were conducted in a manner which was that of men who were working under great pressure, but who were determined to exhaust all legitimate means of procuring the desired result, and who were prepared to take any measure necessary to obtain their ends.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the Premier of the Dominion, to whom the proceedings of the meeting were addressed, will be able to see the gravity of the situation and will be convinced of the necessity for immediate action to allay the rapidly growing feeling of discontent which unhappily prevails in these Territories.\n\nIn regard to the present composition of the North West Council, we must confess that it partakes largely of the nature of a race. With six elected members and six nominated by the Government it is certainly a mongrel composition, and the race is about to be abolished. The better, and a properly elected House of Representatives, responsible to the people established. Not only has the Lieutenant-Governor the casting vote, but he has absolute vote, so that with the aid of the six nominated members, who certainly stick together like wax during the last session, he has the power to override the representative members on any question, and there are several instances. In this way the representatives of the Crown who are responsible to nobody can control the whole legislation of the Territories, and the representation of the people are powerless. We must therefore be about time that this formal institution which at present does duty for a Legislative was swept out of existence and representative institutions established, as they exist in other portions of the Dominion.\n\nTHE MASS MEETING.\n\nThe public meeting of the inhabitants of Prince Albert and vicinity, which was held on August 27th, for the purpose of establishing a Settlers' Rights Association or Union was largely attended and was highly representative of the public and private interests.\n\nIt is to be regretted that some of the older settlers were not present, who have the most stake in the communal welfare generally, and concerned in the necessity for some such organization in order to secure our rights and obtain a redress of our admitted and acknowledged wrongs and grievances. These men should have been there, and their presence would have counteracted the tendency of the speakers. Perhaps before long they may have cause to regret their apathy or it may be their timidity\u2014for it may have been detected from being unable to express themselves on something of a religious or solemn character. If they had been at the meeting they would have found out their mistake as one of the speakers very appropriately remarks, \"the voice of the one is lost in the noise of the many.\"\n\nThere was no consideration given to put out the language of the resolutions passed, and the tone of the speeches was temperate, but firm and independent, and the attitude taken by those who spoke was one of restraint and dignity. It was evident that of those who were called upon under great pressure, but who were determined to exhaust all legitimate means of obtaining their ends.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the Premier of the Dominion, to whom the proceedings of the meeting were addressed, will be able to see the gravity of the situation and will be convinced of the necessity for immediate action to allay the rapidly growing feeling of discontent which unhappily prevails in these Territories.\n\nIndian Schools.\n\nOur Indians in the North West Territories have just cause of complaint with the Government for the non-fulfilment of that part of the Treaties in which the Government agreed to provide schools for the education of the Indian children. In some places the clause is entirely ignored, in others a small salary is offered for a teacher, but this salary, $5 per annum, is so small that no teacher can be found willing to undertake the work. In a few of the reserves the salary is supplemented by one or other of the various missionary societies who devote their time and energy to the training of the Indian children, and in many cases a teacher is sometimes secured. But the educational interests of a very large number of the reserves are entirely unsecured for. In this connection we must again urge the Government to expend a large sum of public money being made in aid of the denominational schools, under the title of industrial schools, by the Government. Without industrial schools we have no faith in them, but we feel sure that the system should either be made sufficiently comprehensive to provide for the education of the whole of the Indian youth, or schools of some kind should be established for the benefit of those not thus provided for.\n\nNOTICE.\n\nA regular sitting of the Saskatchewan District Court, Division No. two, will be held at Prince Albert on the twenty-fifth day of October, A.D. 1883.\n\nJ. VINLAYSON,\nChairman of the Court.\n\nA CARD.\n\nTo the Citizens of Prince Albert\u2014\n\nWe beg leave to state that we have again got our Factory in running order, and we have decided to reduce the price of goods and all kinds of work to suit the times.

The new scheme is to have the Winnipeg and Hudson Bay Railway Company locate their terminus here, on condition that they will run their line from there into Winnipeg. It is proposed to go ahead with the railroad as soon as possible, and if this can be accomplished and the line built that would be a great thing for Winnipeg. Thinking that this was perhaps a foundation, here was raised a question called upon Ald. Wilson, chairman of the railway committee of the city council to ascertain the truth of it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it is perfectly true,\" answered Ald. Wilson, in reply to a question from the reporter, \"although it is a little premature yet.\"\n\n\"I do not think the company will go ahead with the railroad?\"\n\n\"I am sure they will if Winnipeg and other places give them sufficient encouragement.\"\n\n\"And what will the result be?\"\n\n\"The railway would go ahead, would it not, even if the council refuses to\u8865\u52a9?\"\n\n\"On yes, but we are anxious to have the railroad running into Winnipeg, and it will not do so by many miles if a boom is not started here.\"\n\n\"If it is proposed to go on with the rail road at once?\"\n\n\"I believe it will.\"\n\n\"Do you think the council will grant the bonus?\"\n\n\"It will, of course, have to be submitted to the people, who will, I am sure at what a big expense it will be to this city and province.\"\n\n\"It will be one of the best bonuses ever granted, and the road going on will raise the value of real estate here no more -- second C. R. boom.\"\n\n\"What will the amount of the bonus be?\"\n\n\"I think the company want about $250,000. It would pay the city to grant double that amount at once.\"\n\nAld. Wilson was interrupted by the reporter, and said he thought the building of the railway would greatly benefit Winnipeg, and raise a second boom. He was sure, however, that getting the railway into Winnipeg would be a great thing, and if the people were alive to their interests they could do anything asked.\n\nSeveral other prominent gentlemen, who were interviewed on the subject, expressed themselves as greatly pleased with the prospect of a second great boom, and that they thought the building of the railway would greatly benefit Winnipeg, and raise a second boom. He was sure, however, that getting the railway into Winnipeg would be a great thing, and if the people were alive to their interests they could do anything asked.\n\nPRESBYTERIAN MISSIONS.\n\nProceedings of the Great Mission Committee.\n\nYesterday, Oct. 12\u2014The Presbyterian Home Mission Committee has resolved to suspend the mission at Mactaquac, owing duty to Manistique, to the amount of $600, and will participate in a surplus, providing the same does not exceed $300. What there is above fifty dollars will be deducted from the above amount. It is not to be regretted to reduce the number of missions already inducted.\n\nRev. J. Swartwout, Prince Albert, gave a report of the progress of his mission. He stated that the work of four churches was building in that field, and that the work was progressing well.\n\nHe strongly urged the formation of a Presbyterian school.\n\nThe committee returned from Algoma, where they visited the mission station. Mr. Fred Baker, of Walters & Baker, has just returned from the East end. He completed the sale of goods previously selected by him in the Ontario market.\n\nQuarter master Sergeant A. W.

[We can beat that in the District of Louis. When these returns are in we will publish an article.]\n\nNorth West Appointment.\n\nMr. Rockham, of Agincourt, P. Q., is the latest Eastern Canada farmer to receive an appointment in the North West. Sir John appears to have a pretty small opinion of the capability of the farmers here and there. Manitoba, Jan. Winnipeg Sun. [We presume this is the newly appointed Judge for this District, in the place of Mr. Rockham, who has been in Regina, although there has been no official information received of the appointment so far as we know.]\n\nEmigration.\n\nThe C. P. R. Company have been distributing some emigration literature in the Press, which gives a list of the places in which they are engaged will be gleaned from the title page of one of their pamphlets. It is entitled \"The 'Daily' Dominion Sunday School Bible,\" and \"Manitoba and Canadian Railways, North British and Canadian Pacific, Inhabitants of Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and 'Northern Chronicle,' 1883.\" We commend the above to the careful attention of our newly formed St. Andrew's Society.\n\nRepresentative Government.\n\nThe Regina Leader asks us how come why the North West Territorials are not represented in the Dominion Parliament. The question is a very pertinent one. The Territorials have the next thing to a local government, and if they do not have machinery for selecting representatives for their territorial council, there can be no question but that they are out of the councils of the nation. If we have a representative government, then there is a possibility wrong done to any man who is different from the majority. It is a golden opportunity for the Conservative Government to give a medium of expression to the Territorials. We should rally round the cause above from the Winnipeg Sun. The Territorials are heavily taxed for the support of the Dominion Government, and yet receive no return whatever except a batch of officials from Ontario and Quebec, who are West of the prairies. By all means let us have the North West Council, and have local Legislatures, and representatives. Do not let the Reformers rush quickly. Until then, we fear our grievances will be unredressed and our wants unsatisfied.\n\nPROSPECTUS OF THE PRINCE ALBERT DIRECTORY\n\nAND BUSINESS GUIDE.\n\nIt is proposed to issue a Business Directory for the town of Prince Albert and District of Louis in a pamphlet form which will contain the advertisements of each business house in the town, to be inserted at a moderate rate, and a descriptive notice of each.\n\nThe booklet will contain a history of Prince Albert, its present condition and future prospects, together with a statement of this year's crops, as far as they can be obtained, the extent of land in the District of Louis, extent of average cultivated, number of headless persons, balance over last year's crop, production of cattle, and other matters of interest written by a well-known journalist.\n\nAbout 500 or more copies will be published, and distributed at the commencement of the season, which will be distributed throughout the Dominion and the Maritimes.\n\nThis legal land by this means, benefit will result, not only to each individual farmer, but to the community at large whose welfare will be more better known and appreciated at both home and abroad and a healthy emulation encouraged to this end.\n\nPrice of advertisement, whole page, with matter on opposite page, $10; two pages, $15; three pages, $20; four pages, $25.\n\nMama, Mrs. Little Homestead, residence who died May 26th, Mrs. Cook, and a son and daughter, was burying on Oct. 12th.
