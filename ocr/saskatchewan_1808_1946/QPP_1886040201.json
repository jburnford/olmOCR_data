We do, no doubt, see that the present route to Prince Albert is best, for it says that it \u201cwould like to use the best suitable route, whichever it is,\u201d adopted; but a correspondent signing himself as \u201cSaskatoon\u201d (or perhaps \u201cSaskato?\u201d) writes to the Leader and it publishes the letter. The correspondent gives evidence by which he endeavors to make it appear that the Toronto-Prince Albert-Saskatoon route is shortest, but the figures he gives will not bear investigation. They are false in nearly every particular. He compares first distances with air lines, and that is impossible, while his figures are impracticable. It is easy to make such comparisons on paper, but is another thing to make them practicable. Also could it be argued that these mail roads cannot start with advantage from Fort Qu\u2019Appelle. In fact this would be much more sensible; but this is not what has been proposed. The new route would run from Regina to Saskatoon then to Prince Albert by one line and to Battleford by another. Now the only place that would be better served than at present would be Saskatoon, but with the Battleford route the new route would not be so well served as the present one. The question therefore arises, are the Prince Albert and Battleford mail contracts worth keeping? Col. Irvine has returned his petition of commission of the Mounted Police and Mr. Lawrence, W. H. Breton, has returned his petition. Department answered him as commissioner, Col. Irvine asked to re-examine some time ago but owing to circumstances did not press his resignation until now. He has been sworn in years in the force.\n\nThe vote on the Lamont motion was composed as follows: Against the motion, 122 Conservatives and 24 Liberals; in favor, 25 Conservative members, 3 former French, 3 former Holter, 17 former Liberals, giving a majority against the motion of 94. This will show the feeling of Conservatives upon this matter.\n\nDINNER TO THE DELEGATES.\n\nA most successful and enjoyable dinner was given last Friday evening at the Lansdowne Hotel, Regina, to Messrs. Percy and Ross, of the London Central Council, recently a delegate to the Federal convention by invitation of the Regina council. The dinner was attended by Mr. Ross, Mr. Percy, the Mayor, several prominent citizens, and the Mayor, the President. The dinner was almost an informal affair, as many of those present were guests. The dinner was served promptly, and too much credit cannot be given to Messrs. Percy & Co., who have done a splendid job, providing food at less than twenty-four hours notice.\n\nThe usual royal toast having been drunk, the Mayor proposed the health of the guests, followed by Mr. Percy and Mr. Ross, who replied lengthily, giving a very favorable account of their reception here and what had been accomplished.\n\nIn response to the toast the N.W.M.P. Band, under the direction of J. R. Hamill, presented a short program. The N.W.M.P. Band, under the direction of J. R. Hamill, presented a short program. After the music, Mr. Baldwin gave a talk on the proper use of firearms. The band played again, and the evening having been spent, the company broke up considerably early midnight.\n\nKATEFWA.\n\n\u2014Where are we to have a church here?\n\n\u2014Sturgeon Bay is still good north of the river but the valley is bare.\n\n\u2014The Miss Gibsons\u2019 company will be a great acquisition in this town. The ladies are so much appreciated.\n\n\u2014On Monday last Mr. Gibbons, originally from Pembroke, Ont., having made the long journey in five days, bringing with him a cart of stock and other effects. Mr. Gibbons is a charming young English lady who has joined her husband who is engaged in trading at the Red River. Mr. Gibbons is of Fort Qu\u2019Appelle.\n\n\u2014The strength of Mr. Harold Brown\u2019s resolution to attend the tent on Friday evening March 16th, was shown on Sunday morning when he appeared in a condition which can only be described as deplorable. His appearance was such as to call forth the greatest sympathy. He was seen standing on the corner of Main Street and 1st Avenue, looking pale and listless. He was immediately recognized by friends and acquaintances, who came to his aid. He was carried home by a friend, and there he remained until late into the night.\n\nCol. Irvine has returned his petition of commission of the Mounted Police and Mr. Lawrence, W. H. Breton, has returned his petition. Department answered him as commissioner, Col. Irvine asked to re-examine some time ago but owing to circumstances did not press his resignation until now. He has been sworn in years in the force.\n\nThe vote on the Lamont motion was composed as follows: Against the motion, 122 Conservatives and 24 Liberals; in favor, 25 Conservative members, 3 former French, 3 former Holters, 17 former Liberals, giving a majority against the motion of 94. This will show the feeling of Conservatives upon this matter.\n\nFinding Our Way on the Prairies.\n\nTo find the way for yourself is a difficult task, and to drive anywhere after dark is almost impossible without the aid of a lantern. Even during the daytime, it is often necessary to rely on landmarks or signs.\n\nThe Great Divide is the name given to the highest point between Canada and the United States. From this point, the divide runs westward through Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and finally ends at the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe divide is marked by a line of trees, rocks, and other natural features. It is also known as the Continental Divide because it separates the watersheds of the two oceans.\n\nThe divide is an important landmark for travelers, as it marks the boundary between the two countries. It is also a popular destination for hikers and campers, who come to enjoy the stunning views and the opportunity to explore the wilderness.\n\nThe divide is located in the Rocky Mountains, and is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world. It is a place of great natural beauty, and is a reminder of the incredible power of nature.\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of One Dollar, with the object of ensuring advance payment.

E. SYKES' ESTATE IN IOWA.\n\nWe have received a copy of the Stockport (England) Advertiser, and we find in it the following reference to Mr. E. Sykes' fine Eddy farm near this place. Written by the agricultural correspondent of the contemporary press. The first consignment of fish was landed at Liverpool for Landwood Town, the American estate of Mr. Sykes, of Stockport, this week. Mr. Sykes is a native of Nisman. They comprise twelve three-year-old pedigree heifers, and a ten-year-old bull purchased at \"Black Deer\" the first in his class at Preston Royal Show, 1885. All have been selected with great care and attention to breed and type, and the result of the selection is the proof of Colonel Platt's, Gambling Island, and the agent, Mr. William Williams, Mahalya, Iowa. Colonel Platt's name is well known throughout the Principality as a prominent breeder of thoroughbred and excellent breeds of Welsh cattle, and as the possessor of the largest and best herd in Wales. His stock is based on the black and white breed, and the Welsh farmers are under a great obligation to him for introducing him into the Principality in the welfare and opening a market of such promise and extent. The herd which he now possesses in America is certainly one of great merit. The heifers are handsome to look at, and the cows are large, and has a straight back, good shoulder, strong neck, well filled thighs to the hocks, and legs well set. The head projecting well forward, fine short head, broad forehead, and is altogether a notable herd.\n\nHOT COFFEE.\n\nThe Easiest Way TO GET A CUP OF The Best Coffee IS BY USING Lyman's Fluid Coffee\n\nNO COFFEE POT NEEDED.\n\nCan be made in Two Seconds, in a china cup, a glass tumbler, a pitcher, or anything that will hold hot water.\n\nEconomical Convenient Nourishing!\n\nFor sale by Grocers and Drugists Everywhere.\n\nPound Bottles (makes 10 cups) $1.00.

The company is to have power to build a railway from Edmonton on the North-Western Route to Northwestern Railway near Minnedosa and Rapid City, thence westerly to the Assini-\nboine River, and thence northerly of said line. The Consolidated Act of 1879 is to apply to the company, excepting the particular-\nties.
