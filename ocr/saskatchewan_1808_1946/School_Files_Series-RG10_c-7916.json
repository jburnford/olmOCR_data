One of the school teacher's children first developed the disease, and although they are not sick, Dr. Young has got a positive swab from the teacher and both her children.\n\nThe school will consequently be closed until the doctor gets a negative swab.

I would respectfully submit the following comments related to Mr. Fenez's letter.\n\nFor some time past, the teacher has intimated to me that he could get a higher salary at other Agency Day Schools; particularly in the Port Arthur Agency; and the matter was discussed by him with Mr. Greenway, the Catholic School Inspector.\n\nThis in itself seems very irregular to me. First, in that there seems to be different salaries offered to teachers in the different Agencies, and a higher salary in some instances to teachers having very much smaller attendance than at the Whitefish Bay School.\n\nSecondly, I do not favour, as an Agent, having a School Inspector discussing the matter of wages or inducing a settled teacher such as Mr. Fenez, to make a change. Mr. Fenez has done a very good job at Whitefish Bay and I feel confident in verifying the statements in his letter. Our associations have been cordial and we have worked together in a cooperative sense, to the benefit of the pupils at the school.\n\nMr. Fenez took unto himself a wife last September, and no doubt feels that it is up to him to better himself, and I in no way would care to step in his way. However, if an increase in salary is in order under your present regulations, and money available, I would recommend this request be given your favourable consideration.\n\nNo one is irreplaceable, but after giving some considerable time to the welfare and betterment of the Whitefish Bay pupils, I feel that changing and replacing teachers of Mr. Fenez's calibre, is not conducive to the advancement of our Indian children; regardless whether there may be teachers having special certificates, or not, as teachers with first hand knowledge of Indians are not easy to get.\n\nPlease do not consider the foregoing critical to Department methods. I only wish to place before you, in a small measure, my ideas in regard to the welfare and betterment of our Indian Day School pupils and give some encouragement to the Day School teachers as a group.\n\nNorman Baldwin,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 29, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\n- MR.

He expressed the opinion that the Indians are discontented with the services of the present teacher. The serious shortage of teachers was pointed out to Mr. Roy and the possibility that it would be very difficult to obtain a replacement for Mr. Fenez.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated if you would discuss this complaint with Mr. Roy and also with the Roman Catholic missionary on this reserve. The impression was obtained that the actual conditions of the complaint would be revealed to yourself who is better acquainted with local conditions than we are.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEPE/MGD\nOttawa, June 1, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nWe have received your application for classification on Indian school teachers' salary schedule. You have claimed classification as a Grade 2 teacher with a salary of $1,650. If you read the regulations carefully, you will note that only certificated teachers can be classified as Grade 2 teachers. You will fall into the Grade J category as you hold only a teaching permit and not a certificate. Your teacher training apparently consists only of a two weeks' course in Winnipeg. Therefore, this will mean that your salary will remain unchanged from its present rate of $1,120 until you have increased your qualifications. I would recommend that you see your local Provincial Inspector of Schools with a view to doing this as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Greening, Esq., B.A., B.Ped.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n258 Harrington Avenue,\nFort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School,\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of March 22 particularly the information about Mr. Douglas and Mr. Jones. I, too, hope Mr. Douglas drops in to see me during the Easter holidays and that we have an opportunity of discussing our future plans (which I hope will be mutual).\n\nI was pleased to find out that Mr. Jones intends to go to normal school and note that he will require at least five Grade Thirteen papers before he can do so. The information which you gave him was entirely correct and we would be quite willing to grant him a year's leave of absence without pay to attend Normal when he is ready. We certainly would try to give Mrs. Jones a small school so that she could help by earning money while he is at Normal School. At the present time Mr. Jones is a temporary civil servant and cannot apply for permanency until he gets a proper teaching certificate. Therefore, teaching at Kenora would not greatly affect his civil service standing because he is not yet permanent. As you suggest, I am writing to him directly and so far as he knows, am indicating that you have advised only as marked by pencil in your paragraph. I attach a copy of my letter to him for your information. I will write to him again when I hear further as to his plans. In the meantime please accept my sincere thanks for the interest which you have shown in our work in the past and are continuing to show at present. I hope to see you in Toronto for the Ontario Education Association Convention and will then be able to discuss these and other matters.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Further, I have written to the Saskatchewan teachers who answered your advertisement in an attempt to interest them in positions in that province and possibly in Alberta.\n\nMain River School\n\nMr. Ross has been transferred to the Main River school. It is too bad for the Main River Indians to lose such a very good teacher. However, he is just the type we need at Gauthier, and he is not lost to us.\n\nYou are probably aware of the isolated situation of the school at Main River, and I hope Mr. Ross will be able to improve conditions there. I am enclosing some photographs of the school and the Indians so that you may see what he will be able to do when he arrives. If he does not come, we will try to find another person at once. Would you please return the photographs after showing them to him?\n\nI attach one of our application forms which he should complete and return to me.

She is an Indian girl from St. Regis and has had nine years of teaching experience. Her record is as follows:\n\n1939-1941 - St. Regis Village\n1941-1945 - Chenail\n1946-1948 - Chetlain\n1948-1949 - Caughnawaga R.C.\n\nShe has the equivalent of a Second Class Teaching Certificate. She is 32 years of age and had her teacher's training at the Institute of Pedagogy in Montreal. She is not an outstanding teacher but is steady and good with the primary grades.\n\nWhen we hired three male teachers at Caughnawaga this year to replace the women lay teachers formerly there, she was not willing to accept a transfer to a school too far from her home because of the fact her mother was ill.\n\nNow I understand she is prepared to accept a school in Ontario and I have given her your address.

The Fort Frances Highway runs about \u00bd mile South of Sarrome Landing, which is situated on a Bay lying south of the Reserve, and is roughly 1 mile by Lake from the Day School. In the summer months, access to Reserve is made by outboards or canoes. During the freeze up walking from the highway or transportation by pony is the only means of travel. A daily bus service from Kenora serves the District.\n\nThere is a population of 185 on this Reserve composed of 86 men, 40 women and 57 boys and 52 girls under the age of 21. An average of 50 pupils are in attendance at this school. They are predominantly of the Catholic Faith with some few Protestants and pagans.\n\nThere is no R.C. Church on the Reserve. The Rev. Father Antonio Lascelle, O.M.I. is the missionary for this district and holds services in the school house periodically. There is a small R.C. Mission situated on the Fort Frances Highway near Sioux Narrows, this being about 10 miles from the Reserve.\n\nThe Band members on this Reserve make their living by Commercial Fishing, guiding and trapping. At Sioux Narrows there is a Post Office, Day School and 3 or 4 stores. This is a busy community during the summer months serving and catering to the Tourist Trade.\n\nThe present teacher, Mr. Peter Perez is married and have a little girl 2 years old. They are of French Canadian stock from Manitoba. Mr. and Mrs. Perez are a very nice couple and have taken a great interest in the welfare of this Band; and have made many friends in and around Sioux Narrows.\nThe new School as perhaps you are aware is a two room school with teacherage attached. It has a full basement, no running water or electric lights. Outside toilets for pupils and an inside toilet in the teacherage. It is situated about 300 yards from the lake and in the center of the Hamlet.\n\nThe Indians in this Agency are of the Ojibway tribe and with the exception of some aged Band members all speak fairly good English.\n\nFor your further information I am enclosing a map of the area.\n\nI trust this information will be helpful to you in gaining a full picture of the location etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nPP/S\n\nc.c. to B.F.

I don't necessarily mean Caughnawaga, but anywhere close by.\n\nIf all the reports made against me at Cheltenham School have anything to do with all this stalling around, please would you give me a chance to tell my side of the story. I'm not trying to deny nor apologize for anything because my conscience is clear as far as that is concerned.\n\nI was told of illness at the Cheltenham school. If it is serious enough to require a new teacher, do you suppose maybe Miss Beck and myself could be shifted around?\nMaybe not yet, but I have great hopes for vacancy somewhere close by before Christmas.

I have received a letter from a teacher indicating that she is not prepared to go to a new two-room school which we are building near Kenora. This teacher's mother has been ill and she does not wish to go too far from her home in Hogansburg.\n\nThe school is Whitefish Bay Day School and it is situated on the Whitefish Bay Indian Reserve approximately fifty miles south-east of Kenora. I can best describe the school by quoting from a recent letter from Mr. Norman Paterson, our Indian Superintendent, to the teacher formerly interested in this position.\n\n\"It is accessible by Highway, Lake and Air.

I have already been in correspondence with three teachers concerning the Whitefish Bay Day School. Mr. Lisowski wrote in concerning the Fort Alexander Day School. We have already accepted another teacher for this position, with a First Class Certificate and 15 years of experience. I believe we can place Mr. Lisowski in a day school in Saskatchewan, his home province. The teachers' quarters provide living accommodation for two single teachers and if one of the teachers is married, then alterations can be made in the basement to permit bedrooms being provided there. We do not wish to rent extra accommodation as these renting of teachers' quarters costs the Department a great deal of money and we are discouraging it everywhere.\n\nI note that Mr. Jones might not be staying there after the end of the year term. I am also advised that the contractor will probably not finish this project until March 15, 1950. I believe that we can obtain the services of a single male teacher at that time and possibly replace Mr. Jones with a married couple for September, 1950.\n\nIn conclusion, may I extend to you my sincere Greetings.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Ducharme at a salary of $70 per teaching month, and you may employ him immediately to supervise the completion of the building that will be used as classroom and teacher's residence. The Department will allow wood for the heating of both the classroom and the residence, but I regret that no transportation can be allowed the teacher and his family.\n\nWhen the teacher arrives at the school, he should make requisition for whatever is required to complete the equipment and to conduct classes. Immediate and favourable consideration will be given to whatever you recommend. It should be remembered, however, that only what is absolutely necessary will be allowed, because of the experimental nature of this activity.\n\nAt the end of September you should in a separate communication make application for Mr. Ducharme's salary. His appointment as teacher will date from the day that he arrives at the school.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nT. K. L. MacLennan,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLanora, Ont.\nEnclosed herewith are the pay sheets for the Kenora agency.\n\nAs instructed by your letter #129-8-5 of 20th August last, Mr. Dominique arrived in Kenora on the 27th August to take up his duties as Teacher at the Whitefish Bay School. Due to Inspector Dunn being here at the time, Mr. D. Ducharme was not able to reach the school until Sunday the 30th, so I presume his salary will date from the 27th.\n\nHis salary will be $70.00 per teaching month plus wood for the heating of the premises.\n\nCheque for Mr. Ducharme's salary should be sent to this office and can be paid from here at the same time the other salaries are paid.\n\nI shall be glad to know if any deductions are to be made from the salary for any reason such as superannuation &c.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nProvince of ONTARIO\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFor Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1925\n\nD.

Ducharme, teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, I beg to say that a cheque to the amount of $87.50 in his favour has been sent you. This covers the amount due for one week in August and month of September last. We are allowing salary at the rate of $70.00 per month, payment to be made quarterly upon the receipt of his quarterly returns showing attendance, days, etc., There will be no deduction for superannuation, etc., as teachers in Indian Day Schools are not classified as permanent civil servants and are therefore not eligible for superannuation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Perrier,\ngupt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of October 19th re salary of teacher at Whitefish Bay School.\n\nMr. Macdonald arrived here with no funds, and I had to order supplies for him from the Rogers stores and at our own guarantee payment, also I had to purchase a quantity of supplies and take them up to him for the winter, so the school is situated over 50 miles from the Town, it would have been too expensive for him to hire teams and take them up in the winter.\n\nUnder the circumstances and as he is only engaged for the quarter, he has refused to be paid the amount due in advance, but will be glad to do so to the extent of his immediate needs.\n\nOur Department Surveyor Mr. Anderson who has returned to Ottawa from the Whitefish Bay Reserve, will be able to give you information as to the necessity for this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department is making an advance of $150 to Mr. Ducharme, teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, on his December quarter salary. A cheque for this amount will be forwarded to you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

At the close of the present quarter, you should arrange to have the usual return forwarded, and on receipt of this the amount due for the March quarter will be sent.\n\nI am aware that we have allowed Mr. Ducharme advances on his salary for previous quarters, but it is not intended to continue this practice indefinitely.

Under these circumstances, the Department can only make an advance of this amount and a cheque is being forwarded in his favour, to you.

It is noted that Mr. Lascoursire began duties on the 15th instant and it is presumed that the school will close on or about June 15th, next, as salary is only provided for ten months in the academic year.\n\nUnder the regulations, it will not be possible to grant him a further advance on his September quarter salary. I trust, therefore, that you can assist him in his difficulties until some time in October, when, as stated in official letter of the 21st instant, an advance could be made on his December quarter salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Father Pleurde, Winnipeg, with an application from Bp. Guy Chauviere for the position as teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, to begin duties as from November first next. It is noted that his appointment is approved by Father Pleurde.\n\nThe qualifications of Mr. Chauviere are satisfactory, and the Department will approve of his appointment as from the date mentioned above, with salary at the rate of $70 per teaching month. I would request that you inform him accordingly and arrange with him to take up duties at the time mentioned. Later, you should advise the Department of the date when Mr. D. Lescoursiere gives up duties and also the date upon which Mr. Chauviere commences work.\n\nOwing to present regulations, it is rather difficult to make an advance on the salary of a teacher of an Indian day school. Possibly, you could guarantee payment for any supplies that Mr. Chauviere wishes to purchase and take in with him to the school. In that event, you should advise the Department, and his cheque at the end of November will be forwarded to you, in order that you can adjust the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nA.

You can imagine what it will be to have this number in a room 23 x 27, especially during the hot days and in winter time when everything is closed in.\n\nI have to consider my health and the one of my pupils attending this school, and believe me Mr. Neary you would have to see the school the way it is now.\n\nWe have children from this reserve attending the Kenora R.C. school at St-Mary's, and if we had our new school they would be attending here on this reserve.\n\nTherefore the enrolment for this coming term should be as follows;\n\nGrade 6 - 4 pupils\nGrade 7 - 5 \" maybe six (one from St-Mary's)\nGrade 8 - 3 \" plus two girls who are coming back to school and 2 more from the Kenora R.C. School.\n\nthus my enrolment should at least be even more than sixteen.\n\nI will leave the matter with you Mr. Neary and you can decide what is best.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Bernard F.

Much of it is still of value and I shall be pleased, on request, to send it to you for the Whitefish Bay School. The only stipulation I have to make is that your office will pay the express. As I understand it, much of the Indian teaching can be accomplished by pictures.\n\nIn addition to the above, I am sending you, under separate cover, a standard set of specifications for ventilating school of this type, approved by the Ontario Departments of Health and Education.

On receipt of this information, the Department will consider what amount, if any, can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nWhitefish Bay, Ont.\nJuly 5th 1934\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAlthough it is not the custom for a teacher of an Indian Day School to write directly to The Department officially, I think that after reading this letter, you will give me your approval.\n\nBy this time, any quantity returned for the quarter ending June the 30th must have reached you if it has not been delayed in Kenora by The Indian Agent.\n\nYou must have noticed that this school has been closed for two different periods during the last term.\n\nFirst in the month of May which was reported to the Agent in due time.\n\nThe second period which is\nthe last week of June needs some personal explanations which if I don't give them myself will never reach you.\n\nIn 1932 the Town of Kenora was celebrating the 2nd centenary of the coming of the first white man to its shores. The celebration was going to take place on the 1st & 2nd of July. In the months of May and June of the same year the Indian Agent at treaty asked the Indians to come to town and organize a big \"Pow-Wow\" which they did and which was a real success. But since then, last year and this year and most probably for the years to come, unless some drastic measures are taken to stop it, when the middle of June comes, the Indians of this reserve as well as those of the other reserves start to go to town one by one taking their children with them, hoping\nto renew the show they have put up in 1932. This year and the last I have told the parents of my pupils to wait until the school year be finished to go to town, but the temptation was too great. The result was that on the 23rd of June I was left there with a possible attendance of 5 pupils which had not showed up for school on the 21st of 22nd which were nice weather days. In front of these facts I decided to close school for the summer holidays.\n\nAnother thing I want to bring to your attention is the need of standard desks for this school. Last fall when we built the school we put up the building in quite a hurry. When it came to school furnishing as to desks, tables & chairs for the pupils, we took whatever lumber was left and made some. But the whole work is so poor that\nI am not getting the full interest of the pupils in their schoolwork due to lack of equipment. I would ask you, if it is possible, to supply it with standard single desks and I believe until I get them it will be hard to make a success of this school.\n\nAnother thing I want to bring to your attention is the furnitures for the dwelling. When I came here four years ago I understood that the Department was supplying the furnitures for the dwelling. And last fall beside the $5.00 or so that was set aside for buying the material for putting the building up, I understand that $200.00 was sent to the Agent to supply the dwelling with furnitures.\n\nAll that I received as far as now are:\n\non November 8th:\n1 scrubbing brush .35\n1 furnace .20\n1 Gal Oil can .65\n1 mirror $1.20\n1 wash basin $.60\n2 doz table spoons $.75\n2 doz tea spoons $.45\n12 plates $.20\n1 pr salt & pepper $.80\n1 double bed $.25\n5 yds table cloth $.25\n1 sauce pan $.65\n2 Beds Spring & Matt $28.00\n1 Kitchen Table $.50\n6 chairs $.60\n\nTotal $48.90\n\nThe stoves & stove pipes that were sent here then were bought out of the $500 set aside for the building of the house.\n\nI have on the 12th of May this year I have received:\n\n12 blinds that doesn't fit the windows; 12 screen windows made that don't fit the windows; 3 screen doors made to order and which like the screens, the blinds don't fit.\nthe doors. The result is that we are eaten by mosquitoes at night. My baby who is only 10 months old is covered up with mosquito bites. More than that I haven't even hinges for the screen doors.\n\nBesides that on the same day we have received:\n\n2 gall turpentine\n6 gall paint\n4 1/2 pint jars\n2 paint brushes\n1 garbage can\n1 table\n4 yds oil cloth\n2 cooking pots\n1 dish pan - scrubbing brushes\n\nand for which I have never seen the bills. Now I had to buy the rest of the furniture from my own pocket out of the salary paid me by the department.\n\nBesides this, this house will\nneed a ceiling will need to be plastered this fall as the plaster that was made last year is bound to fall off this summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. L. Bourcier.\n\nWhitefish Bay,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 11, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. Mr. Agent Edwards is being written and requested to state what additional articles of furniture he believes should be supplied. On receipt of his reply, the matter will receive further consideration, but I would point out that, as our funds are limited, it is doubtful if any large expenditure can be allowed.\n\nIt is noted that the blinds and window frames which have been supplied do not fit the windows. If it is not possible for you to cut them down so as to fit, you should arrange with Mr. Edwards to return them and secure the proper size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. Lescurelere, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nWhitefish Bay,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 11, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department understands, from a letter received from the teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, that he considers some additional furniture should be supplied for his residence. Please give this matter your consideration and advise the Department what additional articles of furniture you believe might be supplied. At the same time, you should give an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn connection with the Whitefish Bay School, I would refer you to official letter of April 26th, last, to which no reply has yet been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n108-21\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nAugust, 17th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our letter 129-8-5 of July, 11th last, re \"Whitefish Bay Day School.\"\n\nWe have repeatedly written to the Teacher to call at the Office when he is in Kenora, as he comes in frequently, but he has failed to do so.\n\nAt Annuity Payments he promised to give us a list of his requirements, and we now inclose a letter we have received from him.\n\nWe bought standard sized blinds for the windows and as they were a little too wide, we asked him to bring them in and we would have them cut to the proper size by the merchant from whom they were purchased, and you will notice in his letter he refuses to do this, and as we cannot get the size he wants from him, we are unable to do anything.\n\nWe also asked him what articles he had written to Ottawa about and he refuses this information, saying it is a personal matter between himself and the Department.\n\n\"We cannot understand his attitude in these matters, as we have done all in our power to make him comfortable at the school. We allowed his wife to use part of the building as a Post Office, at the request of the Keewatin Lumber Co. and other residents at Whitefish, so they could have a little more money, we have guaranteed his grocery bill on several occasions, and he also received advances on salary from the Department, so we think he has no cause for complaint.\n\nWe believe one of the reasons why the school has not been opened regularly, is that he has been transporting men in his boat to and from Kenora, for the Keewatin Lumber Co.\n\nRegarding his requirements for the coming year, he says he does not want to rush a list, as he wants to have it complete.\"\nHe also wants the walls plastered before freeze up. We advised him in the first place not to plaster the walls last fall, but to chink them with Moss, till the logs dried out, but he insisted on the plastering, with the result that the plastering has fallen out, now that the logs have dried.\n\nWe consider he should be supplied with the single desks he requests, and these will be included in the estimates and if we can see the Teacher before the estimates go in, we will include whatever requirements we consider necessary.\n\nHe requests a balance of furniture for which $200.00 was granted, but this was expended as per E.R.1012 and 1080 Vote 188 1933-34.\n\nWe would suggest you communicate with the Separate School Inspector, Mr. Greening, who will be able to give you a report on the Teacher, and also as to our attitude and treatment of him, since he was appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWhitefish Bay, Ont\nAugust 9th 1934\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your many letters since June 1st I am sorry to say that since then I am still waiting to be fixed up. As far as taking the window blinds to Kenora with me I didn't do it and don't intend to do it. If I get an order to deliver them to someone I'll be glad to do it.\n\nAs for your letter of the 26th of June I didn't answer it for your informer must have given you all the information that you were in want and don't believe I had anything else to add.\n\nAs for your letter of the 18th of July asking for a copy of the\nletter I have written to Ottawa. I didn't do it and don't intend to do it for this is personal matter between me and the Department. As for your letter of the 1st instant I can't understand why you are so anxious to see me although I have been in town more than once. I really didn't have much time to spare. If there is anything special drop me a line and I will be glad to answer any question to best of my ability.\n\nAs for the requirements for this school for the coming year they are many and didn't wait to rush a list which wouldn't be complete for they are many.\n\nFirst this house will need to be plastered before the freeze up. The plaster that is actually on the walls is actually falling. As for the quantity of lime requi...\nred for the job I haven't got the slightest idea of what it will be and nobody around can inform me. All the Indians are gone berry picking.\n\n15 cords of state wood.\n4 ridge roof caps (one for each stall)\n\nStandard simple desks, one for each pupil. Although I was able to carry on with the tables I had last year, for best results I would advise the Department to furnish this school with desks as above mentioned.\n\nA small shed about 4'x10'.\n\nCeiling for the residence at least.\n\n1 Compass saw\n1 Brace & 3 bits (\\(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\))\n1 Hammer\n1 Axe handle (27\" long)\n4 - Safety hinge traps\nSoap to scrub the schoolroom\n\n1 W. mel - barrow\n1 shovel\n1 Ice chisel\n1 Kitchen cabinet\n1 Chiffonier\n1 Teacher's desk\n1 Union jack and Penn.\n\nBesides I am still expecting the balance of furnitures I've asked for last fall and for which $200 was approved by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 21st, 1834.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say that you may have the walls painted at the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. This work should be done at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to authorize the purchase of additional desks at the present time.\n\nMr. Lacroix is being written and informed that he should send the blinds to you in order that you may have them cut to the proper size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, August 21st, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of July 5th, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Edwards states that you were requested to bring in the blinds in order that he can have them cut to the proper size. Please do so at once. The Department cannot understand why you have not carried out the Agent's wishes in this matter before this time.\n\nMr. Edwards will arrange to have the blinds chinked.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to purchase additional desks at the present time.\n\nRegarding additional furniture, I would point out that $200 has already been expended in purchasing equipment for your residence and there are no funds available for a further expenditure in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. Lescurelere, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School,\nWhitefish Bay, Ont.\nWhitefish Bay, Alta.\nAugust 31st 1934\n\nMr. McKenzie, Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 21st 1934, saying that the Department could not understand why I had not carried out the Agent's wishes in not bringing the blinds down which he requested to do so. It is because I was caught too many times before. Experience has taught me not to mingle any more with the Agent's furniture.\n\nIn the spring of 1933-34 I was notified that the Department had been good enough to grant us a few dollars to buy a few furnitures that we were short. So\nwith the approval of Agent Edwards I was authorized to spend $40.00 to buy whatever we needed the more so with his approval I went to Town's Furniture Store in Kenora. I took the furniture up with me the same day they were bought aboard a boat belonging to one of my friends. On reaching home I had to pay $6.00 for freight which I gladly paid as I was going to need the benefit of little chair. That was in the month of May. Later on in the month of July, the first time I went into town I was met by Mr. Edwards & Mr. Macleod that I had spent too much money and paid too much for certain pieces etc. due to that I would have to give someone around $40.00 back to square the account. The receipt I got then was burnt.\nlast fall with the old school,\nand Mrs. Lacombe is actually\nin the hospital, that's why\nI am not sure of the amount.\nSo to have peace and make\neverybody happy I paid what\nwas asked from me, and\nnever said a word about it.\nThen last fall while we\nwere rebuilding this school\nI was asked to make a list\nof the most necessary things\nthat I needed for the building.\nAfter the list was completed\nMr. Clark, Mr. Macker and\nmyself figured out that $200\nwould be more than sufficient\nto cover the list and the\nagreement was sent to\nthe Department. It had\nbeen in the last part of\nOctober. Then I came back\nhere to supervise the construc-\ntion and help as much as I\ncould. On the 1st of November\nor about I made another\ntrip to town to see if there\nwas any answer concerning\nthe furniture. It was clear\nnow. Winter was coming\nfast and it was just a\nquestion of a few days\nbefore the lake would freeze\nand I needed the furniture\nright away. I didn't have\ntime to wait for an answer\nfrom the department. So\nI made a bargain with the\nagent. I was going to go\nto the store and pay for\nthe said furniture. If they\nwere selling the house they\nwere going to be paid by\nthe department. If not I\nwas going to pay them from\nmy own pocket. So with\nthat understanding I bought\nfor $8 somewhere around $65.00\non the instalment plan giving\n$20.00 cash to get the furniture\nout. A few days later, after\nI was back in the money\ncame but I never saw the\nshade of my $20.00 any more.\nThen this spring in the 12th of May I arrived too late to board\nof the first boat that came\noff after the ice was gone\non the 14th. The Agent was\nhere to pay treaty. I told\nhim that I needed some\nhelp to fix them. He\ntold me to hire someone\nand to send him the bill.\nSo I hired an Indian and\ngave him $300 for the job\nfrom my own pocket and\nsent the receipt back\nto the Agent. But I never\nsaw the shade of my $300\nyet.\n\nSo to come back to the\nblinds I was not anxious\nto take them down with\nme for when I travel on the\nlake I have to pay my own\nfare and my freight. Believe\nAnd when I put something\naboard a boat or a truck,\nthe freighters keep me responsible\nif the amount.\ntold me to put them aboard any boat of his choice. I would have done so gladly. Upon receipt of your letter I have sent the said friends in the first boat that went to town.\n\nI hope this will explain my kind of conduct.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: It might be necessary.]\nOttawa, December 7, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant, I beg to say that the necessary change in the christian name of the teacher of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School will be made on future cheques issued to him.\n\nYou may purchase the quantity of cocoa, sugar and Dri-milk which you consider absolutely necessary to supply a hot drink at noon to the pupils of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School during the months of December, January, February and March.

This request, we have been told, has not been granted.\n\nThe purpose of the fence was partly in the cause of neatness but principally for the protection of a proposed garden. Under the circumstances, what with stray cattle and innumerable dogs all of which are always famished, a garden without a fence is out of the question. For the sake of the garden, then, and neatness of the premises, can't you reconsider this $90.00 appropriation from the funds of the Whitefish Bay Band?\n\nLast year, a temporary dock was built at the foot of the school. It is now in such dangerous shape that I consider it unsafe for the use of the children. Cannot something be done toward constructing a new dock? I am certain that should the Department furnish spikes and a little food for the Indians, the latter would erect a safe and solid dock.\n\nAnother item requiring early attention is the school chimneys. If brick chimneys are not installed soon, there is a possibility of losing this creditable building. Why, for the sake of a few dollars, run such risks to life and property?\n\nVery sincerely yours,\nDear Sir:\n\nInclosed please find a letter we have received from the Teacher at Whitefish Bay Day School. What he has asked for has been recommended by the Separate School Inspector Mr. Greening. It looks quite a lot but everything was burned of course when the school burned down, so we will be glad if you can possibly approve of the requisition.\n\nOur estimates sent in last October included $80.00 for a brick chimney $75.00 for a ceiling in the residence and $75.00 for a shed.\n\nThe teacher also asks for some strong wire netting to protect the windows when the pupils are playing baseball.\n\nThis can be purchased locally at no great cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your 108-21 of the 9th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the repairs to the chimneys at the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School at a cost of $80.00 and, also, the repairs to the ceiling in the teacher's residence at a cost of $75.00. Purchases should be made from firms on the approved list.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter, the Department does not see the necessity for the shed mentioned. Our funds are limited and, unless this is absolutely necessary, favourable consideration cannot be given to this expenditure.\n\nIn his letter, the teacher also requests the erection of a fence and repairs to the dock. Funds for these purposes are not available in the appropriation for Indian education.\n\nYou may purchase the wire netting required to cover the windows.\n\nIn a requisition recently received, the teacher requests ten desks; five fronts and five rears. Would it not be possible to do without these new desks for another year?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|------|-------------|-------|----------------|---------------|---------|\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nWESTERN GROCERS LIMITED\nWHOLESALE GROCERS\nKenora, Ont.

We would try and get them to do this work without cost, but should this not be possible, may we spend up to $15.00 for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase two hoes and one axe for use at the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the toilets moved. It is noted that the cost of the lumber for this purpose will not exceed $10 and that you hope to have the Indians do the work without cost.

Ottaway\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast winter I received some Billy-\nmaterial which I used to make a ceiling\nin the school room, partitions, cupboards,\nwardrobe etc., in the residence. Right now\nI am busy making an ice box. All this had\nto be done as the place was offering very\nlittle comfort to a man who has to do\nhis own housekeeping. It already looks\nvery different from what it was 8 mo.\nago when I first took charge of the\nschool.\n\nThe building is only a little over 2 yrs\nold, but as the Indians had to put it up\nin a hurry (in Nov.), green logs were being\nused. After two yrs, these logs have shrunk\nquite a bit, thus causing the plaster\nto fall off. It makes the house very cold in the winter & causes the floors to look very gray, not to say dirty, hard to keep clean. The local agent, Capt. Edwards has already sent me some \"lime,\" I shall need little more in addition to this, a small amount of cement and \"lime\" to prevent the plaster from cracking. So, I have sent a new list of requisitions\u2014mostly all building material & hope to get it as soon as the boats begin to run.\n\nThe floors too, need to be painted, as the paint has all disappeared.\n\nI have asked Capt. Edwards for some wallpaper, Board, Board or Plaster (something anyway) to finish the residence so soon as the plaster has been removed. Hope when this requisition is sent in it will be granted. It is badly needed.\n\nMay I be permitted to say that our local agent Capt. Edwards has always shown a very pronounced interest towards our local affairs & my personal activities. He has encouraged me a great deal.\nI have gradually developed a great liking for the place & the work I have started. I wish to assure the Department that all my efforts will be directed towards the betterment of the place & the people placed so confidently in my charge. I thank you for everything you have done for me.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nJune 2nd, 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe shall be glad to know the amount available for improvements to the Whitefish Bay Day School.\n\nThe original cost of the school and expenditure since has not amounted to very much, when it is considered what we have.\n\nWe believe that the principal of this school is getting married in July and some repairs should be made to make the place a little more comfortable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the repairs and improvements required to the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I would request that you furnish a detailed list of the work you would recommend be carried out, together with an estimate of the cost.

You might take up the matter with the teacher and get a list of the various improvements which are considered necessary. Our funds are limited, but, no doubt, it will be possible to authorize a reasonable expenditure in placing the school building in good condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nK.O.R.F.A., Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe teacher is now back at the school and we have proceeded with the chinking of the walls before the school reopens.

The extras are roof dormers, shutters, bay windows etcetera shown in photographs. The Cape Cod Dormers for instance are $157.00 extra. Of course these are true dormers and come five feet wide enlarging the upstairs floor space to that extent. The other stated extras come in lesser amounts.\n\nThe basic price of plans 256 R supplied under our 251 R or 521 R memorandum of Specification B, enclosed is $4047.00. This price includes delivery to Kenora, Ontario where I believe you would take it by boat to Whitefish Bay.\n\nWe have just received an order for one hundred houses from the City Of Winnipeg for emergency shelters and our schedule is going to be very tight until December. However, we will be very glad to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED\n\nE. W. MacKenzie\nOttawa, August 25, 1947.\n\nE. V.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training.\n\nThank you for your letter of August 11th in connection with one of your Precision-Made Homes for Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nUnfortunately, the plan is last year's plan, which has been discarded.\n\nWe are enclosing our new portfolio of floor plans, elevations and photographs, which will give you a much clearer picture of the completed unit. This year's plans are slightly larger in floor size and have many improvements over last year. Take Plan 251R for instance which is very similar to one old plan 152R. The front bedroom is slightly larger; the living room is a foot longer; the kitchen is larger and the corner windows in the back bedroom give much more wall space for the placing of furniture.\n\nWe would like you to look over all these plans and we will gladly quote you prices on any plan you choose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LTD.,\n\nE.

You will find that Miss Walton has recently requested purchase of such a house at the Peguis South Reserve. I would like to discuss the plans of this house with you and to decide whether it would be suitable.\n\nAgent's residence at Norway House file 21-123 (P.R.)\n\nBernard F.

It should be large enough to accommodate one married teacher and a single teacher to board with the family.\n\nThe present school building and living quarters can serve as a two-room school until a two-room school and residence (for the second teacher) is built a short distance inland. The old school could then become an Indian community hall.\n\nOscar Lundgren at Sioux Narrows is said to be a competent if small builder.

As you are probably aware, we are having a great deal of difficulty in getting contractors to erect schools which are located considerable distances from towns.

For the play books it was too late to write the Department to ask them to purchase them for me for my concert.

What is the condition of this equipment at present in the school?\n\nR.A. Hoy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1944.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, you may purchase the following articles for use at the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School:\n\n- 6 Knives\n- 8 Forks\n- 6 Teaspoons\n- 1 Doz. enamel soup bowls\n- 1 \" cups\n- 2 Pudding pans\n- 1 Roasting pan\n- 1 Square cake pan\n- 1 Teapot\n- 1 Wash tub\n- 1 Wash board\n- 50 ft. wire clothes line\n- 1 Mattress 54\" wide\n- 8 Pillows\n- 2 Window shades 38\" x 90\"\n- 1 Tin stove polish\n\nThe first item on the requisition is a request for a songoloom rug 18' x 24'. This appears to be a very large sized rug and the Department was not aware that there was any room in the school that would require a rug of such size. Further information should be supplied.\n\nI note that the teacher requests a set of dishes suitable for six persons. It is not our usual practice to supply dishes in any such quantity as this. We are prepared to supply the more frequently used dishes, but any additional amount should be supplied by the teacher himself.\nKenora Indian Agency, September 7th to 9.\n\nTeacher - Peter Fenez -\n\nThe school is an old log building -- opened with full number of pupils in attendance - 28. Oil-cloth or linoleum required for living quarters. The toilets are in a disgraceful condition.

He required linoleum to cover two rooms as follows:\nBedroom - size, 9 feet 10\u00bd inches by 9 feet 3 inches.\nSitting and dining room - 17 feet 3 inches by 13 feet.\nThe old floor covering has been removed as it was worn out.\n\nRegarding the request for dishes, this is, I believe a necessity at this particular school. Mr. Fenez has at times our Treaty Party and other Department Officials. Last Spring there were seven in the party and we were invited to use his kitchen and dining room as it was very wet. A set of white porcelain dishes such as six cups and six saucers, plates and bowls would cost at Fife's Hardware approximately $8.00, and I would recommend they be purchased for the school.\n\nThere has never been a desk or chair at this school - a flat top ordinary table is now in use.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted for your information.\n\nNP/C\n\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 3, 1944\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Whitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 78 ALLOTMENT 24-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Mr. P.

This would in some measure, compensate him for the many hours he puts in at the school, for which, no remuneration is received.\n\nNorman Paterson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 21, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, you may purchase the articles shown on the attached list for the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, with the exception of the fire extinguisher.\n\nThe Department approves payment of $24.00 to Mr. Fenes for 6 days' labour at $4.00 a day, in order that he may receive payment for the work he will do during the holidays in repairing and painting the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDep't of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Requisition for School Supplies.\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your 129-8-5 dated June 10th, in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nThis authority covers only a portion of the requisition submitted with my 106-21 dated June 10th.

Due to payment of family allowances, it is reasonable to presume that the children will receive better food and should also be provided with more food for their midday lunch.\n\nWith regard to the items requested on the attached requisition, please let me know for what period of time these would be sufficient.

School has been re-painted and whitewashed outside, window and door frames repaired and painted, new storm windows purchased and ready to put on. Teacher's living quarters has also been re-decorated and painted and school room painted & improved.\n\nThe Boys' Club garden of approximately an acre was in fair shape and some garden exhibits were sent in to Kenora Agricultural Fair, also some school exhibits such as embroidery and fret work, writing etc. Pupils received several prizes and it is hoped that the Boy's Club efforts will in some small measure encourage them to a continuance of this training.\n\nOut of 400 live day old chickens received in June, some 200 or more had been lost through overcrowding. The balance has been distributed to 3 families and 100 kept by Mr. Peter Fenex, teacher, for the boys club.

Approximately 20 pupils are here for lunch and when the weather is cold or stormy everyone stays at the school.\n\nSome children bring a few sandwiches.\nfrom home and we serve them with a bowl\nfor two of porridge and a cup of cocoa, according\nwith all child's appetite.\n\nLet me state that there is no waste in it\nas the teacher serves the children herself and let\nit take plenty of milk and sugar, just for one meal,\nand also plenty of work besides the rest.\n\nHoping this will help you to understand\nthe situation of the midday meal, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher\nOttawa, November 22, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 19th instant, you are hereby authorized to purchase the following material for the lunch at the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School:\n\n- 1 case Cowan's sassa 1 lb. tins\n- 6 sacks Rolled oats 20 lb. sacks\n- 35 lbs.

I stated in my communication of October 19th we are prepared to allow the same amount for midday meal purposes as last year. I cannot agree with the reasoning of the teacher. Certainly with the payment of Family Allowance the children should receive better food and Indian Agents are expected to review from time to time the manner in which the Indians are spending their Family Allowance to make certain the children are obtaining adequate benefits from the payments.\n\nI cannot understand why the teacher is asking for rolled oats. It requires time to prepare and classroom work will inevitably suffer. The Supervisor of Family Allowances has just handed me this circular letter of October 27th which should be brought to the teacher's attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Quantity | Description                                      | Unit Price | Total |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 1        | HEALTH BISCUITS FOR WHITEFISH HAY SCHOOL         | $2.10      | $5.25 |\n\n**TO FREIGHT CHARGES TORONTO TO M.

The present building is of log construction and was built some 16 or more years ago. The foundation is collapsing and in a bad state of repair.

The school was built to accommodate 25 pupils. The matter of comfort is also of some importance and this is lacking in the present set-up.\n\nIt is believed that there will be a steady increase in attendance and a new school should be planned to take care of at least 50 pupils. This increase would also mean the addition of another teacher. The present teacher lives in the east end of the present building, which I do not think is a good arrangement.

Owing to conditions existing at the present time it may be difficult to have these constructed. However, no provision was made for a new school at Whitefish Bay during the current fiscal year.\n\nWhen preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49, we will give further consideration to the necessity of providing a school at the Reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 27th, 1947.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nFurther to our letter of April 9th, please be advised that the misunderstanding with regard to this school was caused by the fact that the councillors and yourself requested a two room school rather than the one room school originally requested by Chief Roy.\n\nWould you please assure the council that we do intend to build a school at Whitefish Bay, either this year or next year.\n\nThere are three possibilities raised after considering your letter of April 2nd:\n\n(a) That we erect a pre-fabricated teachers residence this year and the school next year. As you are probably aware, we are having a great deal of difficulty in getting contractors to erect schools which are located considerable distances from towns. We have already purchased four small teachers residences from a pre-fabricated construction firm and may consider doing the same at Whitefish Bay,\n\n(b) That we construct a one room day school and residence combined,\n\n(c) That we construct a two room day school and residence combined.\nMajor C.A.F. Clark, our educational Survey Officer is at present in the Yukon but is expected to be flying out shortly.

Could you please let me have the approximate cost of this building, complete with furnace, chimney and plumbing.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard J. Heary,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 15, 1947.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention: Mr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training.\n\nThank you for your letter of August 11th in connection with one of your Precision-Made Homes for Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nUnfortunately, the plan is last year's plan, which has been discarded.\n\nWe are enclosing our new portfolio of floor plans, elevations and photographs, which will give you a much clearer picture of the completed unit. This year's plans are slightly larger in floor size and have many improvements over last year. Take Plan 251R for instance which is very similar to one old plan 152R. The front bedroom is slightly larger; the living room is a foot longer; the kitchen is larger and the corner windows in the back bedroom give much more wall space for the placing of furniture.\n\nWe would like you to look over all these plans and we will gladly quote you prices on any plan you choose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LTD.,\nE. W. MacKenzie.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEWH/JL\nOttawa, August 25, 1947.\n\nE. W.

These are:\n\n(a) Plan 256 R\n(b) Plan 251 R\n(c) Plan 521 R\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you with price quotations on the above plans.\n\nBernard V. Berry,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 29, 1947.\n\nDepartment Of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. Bernard Henry.\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nRE: Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 25, in connection with the above; All our one and a half storey Precision-Made Homes are basically the same price. The extras are roof dormers, shutters, bay windows etcetera shown in photographs. The Cape Cod Dormers for instance are $157.00 extra. Of course these are true dormers and come five feet wide enlarging the upstairs floor space to that extent. The other stated extras come in lesser amounts.\n\nThe basic price of plans 256 R supplied under our 251 R or 621 R memorandum of Specification B. enclosed is $4047.00. This price includes delivery to Kenora, Ontario where I believe you would take it by boat to Whitefish Bay.\n\nWe have just received an order for one hundred houses from the City Of Winnipeg for emergency shelters and our schedule is going to be very tight until December. However, we will be very glad to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED\n\nE. W. MacKenzie\nSTATEMENT\n\nSept. 2nd, 1947\n\nM. Department of Indian Affairs\n...

In this way they could save a lot more money rather than to buy lumber.\n\nSupposing they want to buy 20,000 feet of lumber for the school @ $70.00 per thousand feet, would come to $1400.00.\n\nJust rough figuring we would cut pine logs @ .06\u00a2 per foot from 4 inch tops and up.\n\nLet's average 6 inch tops 16 feet long would take 31 logs per thousand feet of lumber.\n\nI hear A. Elders charges to make lumber @ $16.00 per thousand feet (finished lumber). 20,000 feet lumber when finished would come to $496.00. 31 logs to make a thousand feet of lumber would take 620 logs. 16 feet long @ .06\u00a2 per foot would come to $29.76 per 1000 feet. 20,000 feet lumber would be $595.20 making a total of $1091.20.\n\nThe difference would be $305.80 which the Department would save by buying the timber from us.\n\nI could take the contract for the 620 logs and would pay the cutters so much leaving some for defraying expenses such as skidding and piling on the road. I wish you would forward this suggestion to Mr. Neary. I think this is worth considering both for the Department and members of this Band.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Tom Roy, Chief.\nOttawa, March 3, 1948.\n\nMr. H. Paterson, Superintendent of Indian Agency, Kenora, Ont.,\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 108-21-1 (129) of February 24.\n\nI am forwarding you under separate cover the following documents:\n\n(a) Drawings of a standard one-room Indian Day School with attached teacherage\n\n(b) Specifications for above\n\n(c) Bill of Materials for above\n\nBy now you will have received a copy of a letter which I wrote to North American Buildings Limited with regard to a prefabricated teacher's house.\n\nWe are actually faced with two alternatives at Whitefish Bay:\n\n(a) The erection of a prefabricated school\n(b) The erection of our standard school using Indian labour and under a white foreman carpenter.\n\nYou will note that I consider it unlikely that we can get a Contractor to handle this job. However, I would welcome your views on this point.\n\nYou will also note that the drawings which I am sending you call for a one-room school with a full basement. This basement can quite easily be used as an extra classroom if an additional teacher is required. You will note that there are plenty of windows in it and in the ones which we have constructed elsewhere; it has been found that the basement is just as light as the classroom. The storeroom and the boiler room in the\nbasement can also be easily converted for additional teacher's quarters.\n\nIn other words, this is a one-room school plan which has been carefully worked out so that it can be converted to a two-room school with a minimum of expense. In view of your local knowledge, I would appreciate your comments with regard to the above points.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRez Prefabricated House, Whitefish Bay Indian Day School Teacher's Residence\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of copy of your letter file 129-8-5-(E), dated the 26th ultimo, to the North American Bldg., Ltd., 711 Royal Bank Building, Winnipeg, in connection with the above noted subject.\n\nMr. E.W. McKenzie of the North American Bldgs., Limited contacted the writer this morning by phone, enquiring as to the method of transporting the pre-fabricated house, and advised that he was writing Mr. B.F. Neary in this connection.\n\nIt would seem to me that this residence cannot be erected before March 31st and no doubt a basement will be provided for the building. It would therefore mean the transportation of a fair amount of equipment along with the house itself. If this job were considered about the 1st of June, transportation of all equipment and material could economically be effected by boat and barge, from Kenora Dock to landing at the site of new school on Reserve.\n\nThere are no transportation facilities at Whitefish Bay and this could be provided at Kenora.\n\nThe aforementioned is submitted for your information and consideration.\n\nvia Air Mail.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency\nMarch 9, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKensha, Ontario.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nMy letter of similar file of March 3 and your letter of March 4 have evidently crossed in the mails. I have yet to hear from North American Buildings, Limited, but it is evident that they hoped to fill our order for a prefabricated teacher's residence as soon as weather conditions permitted.\n\nIf such is the case, they will have to provide you with detailed plans for the necessary foundations, which will have to be put in before the house is delivered. If this is done, then we can obtain from you the name of a sub-contractor and his tender for the putting in of the foundation and basement. If this is not possible, are there any Indians available who can put in this foundation?\n\nIt is possible, of course, that you might not wish to have this order filled but would prefer the erection of the standard one-room school and attached teacher's residence, plan of which was forwarded to you with my letter of March 3. I will expect to hear from you, with a recommendation as to which plan you would prefer,-\n\n(a) erection of a prefabricated school and separate prefabricated teacher's residence,\n\n(b) erection of our standard one-room school and attached teacher's residence, using Indian labour and under a white foreman-carpenter.\n\nNorth American Buildings Limited are now working out a prefabricated one-room school and attached teacher's residence,\nwhich would be very similar to the school suggested in (b) above. Another possibility is that you might wish to cancel the order for the teacher's residence and to substitute this prefabricated one-room school and teacher's residence.\n\nBernard J. Berry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 4, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttention Col. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\n\nRe: Your Purchase Order #22942 for Precision-Made House delivery to Whitefish Bay.\n\nWe have been in contact with Indian Agent Patterson in this connection and this situation is not good. Apparently no foundation has been put in and delivery can only be made by barge from Kenora, Ont., which will be in the spring when navigation opens. It is only possible to get within three miles of the site by road, which means barging in any case.\n\nWhen we received your order last September we immediately contacted Mr. Patterson and, of course, the same situation was in effect at that time and delivery could not be made. However, we are keeping your order on file and stand ready to give you the best of service on delivery whenever you are ready for it.\n\nAll our quotations, of course, are subject to change in price caused by increase in material or labor and we have no doubt that you are aware that materials did increase in price to a considerable extent.\n\nOur present price on Plan 521 R with finished upstairs supplied under our Memorandum of Specification B is $4,665.00. This price includes delivery to Kenora, Ont., and the services of our erection supervisor for two days labor at the site. He will supervise the erection of the panels by your men the first day and the second day he will sort all the finishing materials and get your carpenters started on the proper method of finishing. The erector's transportation and personal expense will be charged at cost and his travelling or working time less the two days will be charged at wages in effect at time of delivery plus 10% profit.\n\n(over)\nMarch 10, 1948.\n\nE. W. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nNorth American Buildings, Limited,\n711 Royal Bank Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nI have just received your letter of March 4th with regard to the provision of a Precision-Trade House at Whitefish Bay, in the Kenora Agency.\n\nYesterday I had written to Mr. Indian Superintendent Paterson about this teacherage and had suggested to him the possibility that we consider a prefabricated one-room school and teacherage, such as you recently provided for the Little Grand Rapids Reserve.\n\nI will advise you by air mail as soon as I hear from Mr. Paterson as to his reaction to our proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard V. Beary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCamp sent to Mr. N. Pehnson\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRes: Whitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letters dated the 3rd of March, your file 129-8-5(a) and the 9th of March, file 129-8-5(b), relative to the above noted.\n\nThe writer met Chief Tom Roy, and Mr. Peter Fenez Teacher on the Whitefish Bay Reserve yesterday and after discussing this matter fully, I would now report as undernoted.\n\n(1) A prefabricated school (2 room) sufficient to take care of increase in attendance up to 60 pupils is desired. A separate prefabricated Teachers residence to accommodate if the need arises, a married teacher and a single assistant teacher.\n\n(2) In former reports relative to this proposed new school, I had suggested as outlined above. There are now 40 pupils in attendance regularly and it is anticipated that there will be 6 to 8 new admissions this coming fall term. The Northwest Angle Bands 33 and 37, have Reserves just across from Whitefish Bay Reserve and each year, additional Band members are moving to this location. This means that they expect their children to be admitted to the Whitefish Bay Day School. It is considered that, taking a long view as to the needs of the new proposed school the question of attendance should be considered and it is quite probable that within 5 years the attendance at this school should reach 60 or more pupils.\n\n(3) There is also the matter of teachers. At present Mr. Fenez the teacher is overburdened if an assistant teacher were supplied quarters of course would have to be considered. It is therefore necessary to have separate Teachorage quarters, apart from the 2 roomed school.\n\n(4) Were it decided to go ahead with the teachorage and 2 roomed school, the first consideration is the digging of the basements. This would require I believe a bull dozer or mechanical digging equipment. Hand labour even if by Indian help would increase cost considerably.\n\nThe erection of the buildings could be economically built by say an experienced carpenter and helper with several Indians for casual labour, rough carpentry work etc.\n\nThe transportation of equipment and material would have to be made by water. A boat and barge can be procured any time at Kenora.\n\nLocal building contractors could be contacted and asked for tenders.\n\nThe aforementioned is respectfully submitted for your information.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency\nKenora, March 17th, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRe: Proposed New Day School,\nWhitefish Bay Indian Reserve\n\nFurther reference is made to our letter of\nthe 13th instant, file 108-21-1(129), and yours of the 3rd\nand 9th of March, file 129-8-5-(E), in regard to the above\nnoted.\n\nA letter has been received from Chief Tom\nRoy of the Whitefish Bay Band of Indians in this regard\nand a copy of the Chief's letter is attached for your\ninformation.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency\nSioux Narrows P.O.,\nMarch 15th, 1948\n\nMr. N. Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Paterson,\n\nFurther to our conversation regarding the plan for a one room school you brought over for me to see, I want to further my objection to the one room school as it will not suit this reserve whatever. There are at present 40 children in school. Roughly figuring there will be at least 30 or 35 of age to start going to school within the next three years\u2014while there are only 5 to go out at that time possibly less, if they should continue going to higher grades.\n\nWe can safely assume that there will be 70 in class in three years time. To prepare for all eventualities we will have the teachers residence large enough to accommodate other people such as the nurse and other guests who are interested in Indian Welfare. Both the school Inspector and the teacher agreed that this school requires two teachers even at the present time. There are from one to grade nine in class which is really too much for one teacher to handle, no wonder they are not progressing very much.\n\nTherefore I demand that we get the two room school and separate building for the teacher's residence.\n\nI forgot to mention about the labour I thought I saw in the letter from Mr. Neary you showed me that there will have to be free Indian labour. I want you to forward my letter to Mr. Neary so that he may know the conditions on our Reserve. You know just as well as I do that the members of this reserve are not rich people. They have to keep going to make a living with the very tough difficulties they have in their occupation in fishing. They cannot be expected to work at the school for nothing. It is not a matter of wanting to get paid for what they have to eat too. Most of the able bodied working men are busy fishing during the summer months from which they receive good pay. I trust that you will forward this letter to Mr. Neary for his information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Tom Roy, Chief\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, March 27, 1946.\n\nE. W. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nNorth American Buildings, Limited,\n711 Royal Bank Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nI have now received a further letter from Mr. Indian Superintendent Paterson of the Kenora Agency with regard to the above day school. From the information obtained in the letter and from our census figures, it would seem evident that a one-room school will not be sufficient for our needs at Whitefish Bay. Therefore, Mr. Paterson recommends that we supply two prefabricated buildings for Whitefish Bay:\n\n(a) A Teachersage - such as has already been ordered for this place (5ZLR).\n\n(b) A prefabricated two-room school. This would be on the same plan as the prefabricated one-room school which you are supplying for us at Nelson House but would of course contain two rooms.\n\nCould you please advise me whether you could undertake the prefabrication of a two-room school of this nature and, if so, whether you have blueprints or drawings of such a building on file.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, March 27, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nProposed Whitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 106-21-1 (129) of March 13 and 17 -\n\nI note that you request a prefabricated two-room school for Whitefish Bay. I doubt very much if the North American Buildings, Limited, can prefabricate a two-room school. However, I am writing to them, by Airmail, asking if they can undertake such a building.\n\nIt is agreed here that a two-room school is needed at Whitefish Bay and therefore we will drop all consideration of a one-room school. If a prefabricated two-room school is supplied by North American Buildings, Limited, the usual practice is for them to provide a building supervisor who stays on the site for two days and leaves sufficient instructions for the other workmen to complete the building. They do everything possible to have the roof up on the first day and then to carry out the necessary finishing after that.\n\nI will advise you as soon as I hear from North American Buildings, Limited, with regard to the two-room school. It was not our intention that the Indians would provide free labour. I do not understand how Chief Roy got this impression, but it is our intention to pay for labour at the prevailing rates.\n\nBernard F.

I am of the opinion with an expenditure such as is involved, and the building of the Teacherage and School could well be handled by a competent engineer of the Engineering Branch.\n\nThe matter of having contractors here take on this work itself would be a prolonged affair in that contractors would have to have specifications, then go out to the site to enable them to put in bids or estimates. The school site being 50 miles from Kenora too would handicap a contractor.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted, so that delay which may be caused by misinterpretation of your wishes in this matter, can be alleviated.

We do not find asbestos shingles satisfactory.\n\n(2) We would like one extra cupboard in each classroom. These can be placed in the corners diagonally opposite to the cupboards already indicated in your blueprints.\n\nWe agree to the proposal you make with regard to the roofline. It is felt that this will definitely improve the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard J. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Norman Paterson, SUBT I.A., KUNGRA.\nColonel Neary:\n\nPre-fabricated two-room school:\n\nThe building which I inspected at Bannatyne Ave. and Curtis St., Winnipeg, is now being used as a Child Guidance Clinic, not for class-room work. It was built as an adjunct to the former Normal School. Teacher-training is conducted elsewhere now.\n\nIt appears to have been warm enough for Winnipeg winters.\n\nSome changes seem indicated:\n\n1. Outside finish: the asbestos shingles on the north wall show such extensive breakage that one questions the desirability of this finish for schools.\n\n2. Fenestration: this is little more than 15% and through storm windows would be less. Perhaps two more casement windows could be added to those walls which already have two.\n\n3.

However we are quite confident that construction of the basement would be much easier in the spring than it would be at this time of the year, and we will be pleased to forward your buildings in the early spring as you may advise us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED\n\nF.J.

The Department has purchased the necessary materials and Mr. Helgason, a local builder is supplying the labour.\n\nWe have received a request from our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Manitoba for one of your Engineers to visit this school about once every fortnight during the course of construction. While we realize that you cannot take the responsibility for the erection of this building, we would appreciate receiving the advice of your Engineers during the course of the building.\n\nWhile our Indian Superintendents are quite prepared to assume the responsibility for the erection of one-room Indian Day Schools, they feel that some assistance and advice is required for the erection of tworoom schools.\n\n(2) Whitefish Bay Indian Day School, Kenora Agency\n\nOriginally it was intended to erect a prefabricated two-room school and a separate prefabricated teachers' residence on this Reserve. However, due to delays which have occurred, it has been decided to erect a standard\ntwo-room Indian Day School with attached teachers' residence during the 1949-50 fiscal year.\n\nWe would ask that your Branch assume the responsibility for the erection of this school. It is felt that due to the comparative isolation of this Reserve (some 40 miles from Kenora, Ontario) that the normal procedure should be followed with regard to advertising for tenders, etc.,\n\nOur reason for advising you at this early date of our decision in this regard is to enable you to have Mr. Gow or one of his staff visit this Reserve, to prepare the necessary site plan and thus be ready to advertise for tenders early in the Spring of 1949.\n\nActing Director.\nOctober 15, 1948.\n\nMr. N.

MARY'S MISSION VAN, BOX 40 KENORA, ONT.\n\nNovember 8, 1949.\n\nM. Benidickson, M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Chapel Site at Regina Bay, near Sioux Narrows, Ont.\n\nI have been trying to secure Title to an Island on Regina Bay, on the Lake of the Woods, for a Chapel Site. My application cannot be filed under Ont. Land Act till I produce evidence that the owner of the building is not opposed, or else surrenders title to the building.\n\nThe said building is the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School owned by Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch. It is now being replaced by new two-room school house.\n\nBy letter of Dec. 30, 1948, Mr. Phelan was informing our charge-d'affaire, at Ottawa, that the policy of the Department in such case was to turn over any unused building to War Assets Corporation. This would further delay my endeavour to make use of this Island for missionary purposes.\n\nThis log house is of very little commercial value but I would like to be offered first chance, or a document showing that it is surrendered to me, or rather, to the Oblate Fathers so that I could go ahead with my plans to secure Title to this Island.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) A. Laclelle O.K.I.\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nEducation Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nRe: St. Mary's Indian School\n\nI attach hereto copy of a letter I have received from the Rev. A. Lacelle of St. Mary's Indian School, Kenora, respecting the matter I discussed with you on the telephone.\n\nIf the old building referred to is to be abandoned, I can appreciate it that it is desirable to find some short-cut, if at all possible, if there is no reason why the Oblate Fathers should not be aided in obtaining early title in connection with their application to the Provincial Department of Lands and Forests.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. M. Benidickson,\nM.P. for Kenora-Rainy River.\nNovember 27, 1949.\n\nW. N. Denidickson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just acknowledged your letter of November 15 and as I advised you in our telephone conversation, I am referring this matter at once to our field officials. I have checked the files here and find that the Department purchased a parcel of land comprising 1.45 acres from an Indian owner for school purposes. However, this property is close to the present day school and was purchased to give additional playground facilities.\n\nIt will be necessary, therefore, to make certain that the old school property is not also required in connection with the operation of this new two-room school.\n\nWhen a reply is received, I will advise you immediately.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Matters\nand to Mr. H. Paterson\nNovember 17, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKensington, Ontario.\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached self-explanatory correspondence as follows:\n\n(a) Letter from Father A. Laselle, O.M.I., of Kenora, to Mr. H. H. Benidickson, M.P.\n\n(b) Letter from Superintendent of Education to Mr. Benidickson.\n\nI would appreciate a report from you on the following points:\n\n(1) Is the new school on the island referred to by Father Laselle?\n\n(2) How far is the new school from the old school and will the present school grounds also be required as play area for the new school?\n\n(3) Is this land an Indian reserve (as it would seem to be from our files and information here)?\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot find any trace of the survey made and a search is being carried out at the present time in the Lands and Development Services Branch; otherwise I would not be asking some of these questions.\n\nAny further information you have on this matter would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 19, 1949.\n\nMr. C. Beck,\nChief Architect,\nLands & Development Services\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School.\n\nDear Charlie:\n\nI believe this contract was handled by your Branch and that you will have this deposit on your file.\n\nBernard F.

IA-413\nKenora, November 14th, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Whitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter dated the 31st ultimo, files 445-5(E) & 445-1, relative to requirements for the teacherage of the above school.\n\nDuring an inspection trip to the Reserve on Sunday November 6th, I was advised by Mr. Swen Florstrand, Contractor, that with weather favourable he thought that the school would be ready for occupation about the end of January 1950.\n\nThe work has been delayed on several occasions due to exceptionally bad weather and previous to running cement foundations they were held up for reinforcing steel.\n\nTo date they have made fair progress and are at present erecting roof and covering. The weather has again turned for the worse with intermittent rain and sleet. This with the near advent of freeze up will no doubt hinder the work.\n\nMr. Florstrand also advised that once the building is covered work should proceed regardless of weather conditions.\n\nPlease find attached in triplicate, Requisition for material for the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School teacherage.\n\nNorman Paterson\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nNovember 19, 1949.\n\nMr. H.

This should begin to arrive by about the middle of December and you can advise Mr. Fenn accordingly.\n\nPlease find attached a requisition covering the standard list of furniture requirements for the new Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. As this is a two-room school we are supplying two sets of bedroom furnishings.\n\nThe Department does not provide pillow cases, sheets, blankets, comforters, nor towels, as these are items of a personal nature and must be supplied by the teacher concerned.\n\nBernard J.

Anderson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\n[Attach.]\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRes: Whitefish Indian Day School\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter received from Mr. N. Paterson, Superintendent, Kenora Agency, regarding use of school buildings for other purposes. Before replying, I would appreciate your comment on my interpretation of such usage.\n\nIn general, I think school buildings should be used for concerts, etc., provided that whoever is in charge of the activity ensures that the classroom is left clean and desks, etc., restored to their proper places. In this particular case I cannot see the need for 100 chairs. The most that would be used at any time would be 50. However, I do not anticipate that the Educational Division will supply these at all.\n\nWhere any Religious body has desired to use schools under my jurisdiction in the past for church services I have allowed them to be so used. The only rules laid down in this regard were first: That the school should be available to any denomination that had adherents on the Reserve, secondly: Nothing permanent was to be erected and the classroom was to be restored for teaching purposes after the service.\n\nApparently some action has been taken at Morson without Mr. Paterson being advised. This should not be done, otherwise the Superintendent, who is definitely in charge is ignored.\n\nKindly let me have your observations on my general rulings.\n\nYours,\n\nF. Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnc (2)\n\nC.C. Mr. N. Paterson, Kenora\nDecember 12, 1949.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\nCamp Chippewa,\nNorth Bay, Ont.,\n\nWhitefish Bay Indian Day School\n\nReference your 129/6-1-445\n\nWe are anxious that our school buildings be used for community purposes but naturally must insist that they be properly cleaned and restored after such use.\n\nAt the present time we do not have the funds required to buy the chairs and normally these are bought with funds raised by the Indians of the Band. We have paid out a great deal of money in erecting this school and my funds are for use in educating Indian children. It is felt that the provision of chairs for community gatherings will not be considered a legitimate use of school funds.\n\nWe agree with your policy in connection with Church service. I do not believe there will be too much of a problem at Whitefish Bay as the R.C. Missionary is endeavouring to get a piece of property near the school on which he intends to erect a chapel.\n\nI have referred the point which you have raised concerning the building at Morson to our Secretary as it does not involve a school building.\n\nBernard F.

I also need your help in preparing for the upcoming exams.\n\nI have been away for two days due to personal matters. The Indians will be all gone in 2 or 3 days for their fishing trip, and I will be back soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nthe school and take my 6 weeks holidays, as you told me to do in July last.\n\nI remain Sir\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. H. Blair\nFort Williams, Oct. 26th October 1877.\n\nJ.A. Smart, Esq.,\nDept. Superint. Gen'l of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have recently returned from a trip to some of our\nIndian settlements east of here, I beg to say a few words about the schools\nat them, Jackfish Island, on Lake Temagami, and Big Flat.\n\nAt the former place, the school-house badly needs to be raised\u2014it\nhaving settled a good deal during the last two years\u2014and shingled since\nthe old shingles, now more than ten years old, being rotten\u2014, as also\nto be whitewashed inside and outside. Already two years ago did I call\nthe attention of the Indian Agent J. D. Donnelly to this; but for some\nreason or other, nothing has been done in the matter so far (I was up\nthere a month ago), the school having been built without any aid from\nthe Department, these people deserve\u2014I think\u2014they help from the\nGovernment, as they are very poor.\n\nI am sorry to say the teacher, Mr. J. A. Bliss does not keep his school\ntidy; at least I invariably find it looking otherwise. He cannot say,\nno remark has been made to him about it, in the past.\n\nI have also been told\u2014after I had left Jackfish Island\u2014that he does\nnot teach regularly, and that some parties up there wanted to report the\nfact to the proper authorities, but that they refrained from doing so,\nof compassion for the man.\nHowever, I am of opinion that, with what has been spent on them in repairs, we could almost have been built, thus giving ladies at least a neat & warm place to live in... the houses are too far gone.\n\nBy November 1st we shall have 2 residences in this District, one at Pic River and the other at Big Rapids. One of the two I expect to fill shortly, and have for some time been in correspondence with a new teacher for the former place. The candidate is a young lady.\n\nI may say that our men teachers have given less satisfaction than the ladies.\n\nYours, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Mr. [Name], Missionary\n232956\n\n[Handwritten text not legible]\nwhat is the demand\nnow - all over for\ncharity work at home\nas the I will do other\nI will send you the\nchange - having you\nan will take me\nthanks for the good you\ndid once when I was\nfor in need. I am\nmore than\nthankful.\n\nW. P. Clark\nin person\nof the Board of Supervisors\nand its friends\nSir,\n\nHerewith I beg to forward report of the Jack Fish Island school for the quarter ending 31st of March 1901 also application for teachers salary.\n\nI also enclose letter from Mr. Blais in which he tenders his resignation as teacher, and would recommend that the Department accept this resignation.\n\nOwing to the poor attendance Mr. Blais was forced to close the school at the end of January, he however remained until the end of the term. I would therefore ask the Department to pay him for the full quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. H. Hodder,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nC.F.A. A.1. L.2.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to reply to your letter of 10th inst. In that letter you state that you are interested in the question of the proposed school at Port Arthur; and I have the honour to inform you that I am not aware of any proposal being made by anyone to establish a school at Port Arthur. If such a proposal exists, I would be glad to have an opportunity to consider it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nJ. P. Hodder, Esq.,\nAgent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nRef no. 131861\n16th April, 1901\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report regarding the Jack Fish Island school, that no effort is being made to secure a teacher to succeed Mr. Blais.\n\nIn view of the poor attendance under Mr. Blais and the certain decrease with the removal of his family, I would recommend that the school be not reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. J. Hodder,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 20th April, 1901.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nNepigon, May 1st 1908\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI write in the name of the Chiefs and Indians of the Nepigon, especially those who belong to the Sack Fish Island Reserve, and in my own name, being now in charge of these missions, asking the Dept. to have the School opened again at Sack Fish Island.\n\nI have found a man well qualified to teach who is ready to take the School next fall, for the ordinary salary of $300.00. His education since his return from England, after passing through the elementary school training, has followed the Ottawa University Course, including Latin and Greek course, for four years.\n\nBut so many young people get discouraged and come West some fifteen years ago. He has tried to develop a liking for trapping and has combined with the Indians of the Nepigon for about ten or twelve years; he has married this Indian woman and does not intend to return among white people. I think that it is a real chance to have joined such a man as teacher.\n\nIn summer there are always from twenty to twenty-five children of school age, and the rest of the year eight to twelve. School would be opened in summer and holidays would take place in winter.\nI am convinced that more families would remain at Lake Fish Lake in winter if the school was opened.\n\nThe schoolhouse, which is a log building of 29 x 19 ft., would need some repainting though. It has to be shingled. There should be a floor over the logs to keep the little ones from walking on the logs with their shoes. It would take nine thousand (9000) shingles that cost $4.25 each. But certainly, the freight from Port Arthur to Lake Fish would be at least two thousand. We could also use lumber and fencing common boards to make roughsheds, the stair case, and a partition in the attic.\n\nI do not know exactly how much it would cost to have the work done. I figure that it would cost about $30.00 or $35.00. With a little paint for the desks and blackboard, paintbrushes, some pine (there is a pine store), the whole amount might be $125.00 or $130.\n\nMost of the material could be bought only near winter, but I think we could manage to open the school in September if the Lake Fish people were willing and able to help. The school would be located at the lake's edge, so as to be convenient to the settlers' homes.\n\nI was asked by the Chiefs of the Lake Fish to come to a formal meeting to discuss this matter, but as I would have to travel a considerable distance...\nthat this letter will be sufficient.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer as soon as possible, for I will be away a great part of summer, visiting the Missions so that I may take the necessary steps to be ready to enter the school in Sept. 1908.\n\nWith humble regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Place and Date]\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nHerewith I beg to hand you letter from Rev Father LeMarche on behalf of the Indians of Jackfish Island - Nepigon band asking that a school be again opened at that reserve. The Rev Father states he has a man who is well qualified to teach and will take charge of the school next September.\n\nThere are in summer some 25 to 30 children and in winter 5 to 12 with the probability that this would increase. He estimates it would take about $130 to put the old building in proper repair, the roof would have to be re-shingled, about a thousand feet lumber, lime for plastering, paint for desks and blackboard.\n\nThe man for teacher was Rev Father LeMarche recommends is John Pitsback, married to No 81 Red Rock band.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 29, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent McDougall forwards a letter from Father Lemarche, asking for the reopening of the Jackfish Island school, at Lake Nepon, on the ground that there are from 20 to 35 children of school age, who could attend during the summer and about 8 to 12 during the winter months.\n\nThis school was closed in 1801 for want of attendance and although the money was voted for the teacher's salary for some years, it was dropped out of this year's estimates. Father Lemarche says there is a teacher available and that $150 would put the old building in proper repair. It would need reshingling, plastering, and painting and some lumber for desks and blackboards. Mr. Scott, of this Department, knows the locality and could state whether it is advisable to reopen the school or not.\n\nMartin Brown\nOttawa, May 30th., 1908.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nI think Mr. McDougall might be asked to report in this matter when he visits Nipigon House this summer. You will observe that in letter of May 25th, he does not touch upon the most important point, that is, whether John Fitzback is really a competent man and should be appointed as teacher. It may be simply an attempt to get a position for Fitzback. At the same time, I am of opinion that it will be well to open the School if we can get a competent teacher. My idea would be to authorize McDougall to prepare for the repairs if he considers that the person recommended will fill the position to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, June 1, 1906.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., inclosing a communication from Rev. Father Lamarche, in which he asks that the Jackfish Island school be reopened with Mr. John Pitseck as teacher and that a grant be made to repair the building, the cost of which is estimated at $150.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed to grant the request for the reopening of this school, provided a competent teacher can be secured. As to Mr. John Pitseck, who is recommended by Father Lamarche, the Department would like you, when you visit Nipigon House this summer, to satisfy yourself that he is a fit and proper person to have charge of the school. If, after visiting the locality, you are convinced that he is suitable for the position, you may take the necessary action to have the building put in repair when the school may be reopened. You will be good enough to send a full report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.D. MOLLAR\n\nSecretary.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 1st\n\nNo. 161864\n\nIn accordance with your letter of above date, Mr. LeMarche has been instructed to have the repairs to Jackfish Island school provided he can secure a competent teacher. I can hardly agree with him that John Fitzpatrick would be the proper man to put in charge; the Rev. Father is trying to secure Mrs. Xavier de Lancy.\n\nThere are about 40 children here in summer and there would be probably half that number during the winter. The regular visits of the Rev. Father would tend to keep the school in good order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa August 30, 1900-\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd inst., I have to request that you will be good enough to advise the Department, if Father L\u00e9vesque is successful in obtaining the services of Mr. Xavier Molson to take charge of the school on Jackfish Island.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. MOLEAU\n\nSecretary.\n\nH. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, March 18th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nDuring the summer of 1908 authority was given to have repairs made to the school building on Jackfish Island, Lake Nepigon. These repairs have been made and the accounts presented to the Department and paid, but it does not appear that the school has been re-opened. At the time that the above negotiations took place Mr. McDougall, late Indian Agent, stated that you were endeavoring to secure the services of Mrs. McLaren to take charge of this school, but this lady has since been appointed in charge of the Mountain Village School on the Fort William Reserve.\n\nBe good enough to advise the Department whether any further action was taken by you to secure a teacher for the Jackfish Island school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. F. Lemarche, S.J.,\nPort William, Ont.\nNepigon, April the 1st 1910\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of March the 18th No 151864/1 was received late because it was addressed to Fort William, went to Mission Bay before it arrived here. In reply to this letter I must say that although authority to repair Jack Fish Island School, Lake Nepigon, was given during the summer of 1908, the material was bought only that falls because the precedent falls, the narrow gauge railway, from the river to South Bay, on Lake Nepigon, had finished too late to allow the bringing the lumber back with it. I took the lumber there myself last summer, but as I was unable to remain long enough to supervise the work, after having the falls built and brought on the ground, I agreed to pay the Indians $14.00 for the sills and replacing the old ones; they were to put the shingles without any charges. But they did not do the work yet; so we could not use the building without repairing it.\n\nI will go to Jack Fish Island, as soon as navigation\nOpens on the Lake, and will try to have the work done on time to open the School next summer, if possible.\n\nYour humble servant in X't.\n\nRev. H. Lamarche\n\nT\u00e9ponon, Ont.\n\nTo Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 5th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant in reference to the re-opening of the Jack Fish Island school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await a report from you upon your return from your proposed visit to that locality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. F. Lamarche, S.J.,\nNepigon, Ont.\nOttawa, October 26, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have again to call your attention to the fact that in 1908 repairs were made to the school building on Jackfish Island and on April 1, last, you advised the Department that they were not, for reasons stated, attended to during the summer of 1909 but that you would have them done early in the past summer.\n\nNo report has as yet been received and in view of the fact that material was purchased I have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department know as soon as possible what has been done in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P.E. Lamarche, S.J.,\nHepigon, Ont.\nFort Arthur, Ont., March 8th\n\nTo the Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt last I found a good man willing to teach school on Jackfish Island. His name is Mr. J. A. Blair who taught school there for some time and will be ready to reopen the school in the beginning of April. Please let me know as soon as possible if I can send him there, then as the man is known to us, I suppose there will be no objection to his appointment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Dr. McLean.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegina,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a letter from Rev. I.V. Dugas S.J. wit' regard to the re-opening of the School at Jackfish Island, Lake Nipigon.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nAss. Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXD.\n\n191864/1\n\nOttawa, March 10, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a communication from the Rev. Father Dugas in which he nominates Mr. J. E. Blais as teacher for the Jackfish Island School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when Mr. Blais was previously in charge of this school his services were not altogether satisfactory. He did not keep the school open regularly and was somewhat untidy in his habits. The Department is, however, prepared to engage him on probation till the end of the month of June at a salary of $300.00 per annum. You will be good enough to require Mr. Blais to make you monthly reports on the regular Agent's report forms and forward the same to the Department when received by you. When you visit this locality you will be good enough to inspect the school and make careful inquiry from parents and others in the vicinity and upon your return submit a full report, as it will be upon this report that the Department will decide whether to continue Mr. Blais' services. As soon as Mr. Blais leaves you will be good enough to advise the Department, stating at the same time his post office address and giving instructions for the sending in of the material and supplies that may be needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. P. Horrigan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of yours of 10th inst. No. 151864/5 with regard to the appointment of Mr. J.A. Blais as Teacher at Jackfish Island School, Lake Nepigon.\n\nMr. Blais has written to me stating that he will be prepared to leave for Jackfish Island on the 4th of April.\n\nHis post-office address will be Jackfish Island, Lake Nepigon, Via Nepigon, Ont. and school material and supplies may be sent to him so that they may reach him before April 4th.\n\nHe can then take them in with him, otherwise they may not reach him for some time, as the lake is liable to be impassable for some time after the ice breaks.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nActing Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Monthly Report for Lake Helen School, Red Rock Reserve. This school was not visited by me in person, and the report is therefore made out by the Teacher, Miss C. Harrison.\n\nI have not received Report from Jackfish Island, Lake Nepigon School for April, and do not expect that this will reach me for some time, as traffic is not opened up across the lake as yet.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nActg. Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, Quarterly School Report ending December 31st last for Jackfish Island, Lake Nepigon School. I also attach account for teacher's salary for the Quarter viz: $75.00. Mr. J.A. Blais, the teacher, informs me that he does not intend to teach this school longer than the end of next Quarter, March 31st prox.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 19, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 4th instant in which you advised the Department of the resignation of Mr. J. A. Blais, teacher of the Jackfish Island school on March 31st, next, I have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with the Missionary in charge with a view to securing the services of a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. McKnight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMay 31st, 1915\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of this date, I have the honour to inform you that this man was up with the leading men in the matter of the sale of cattle and since then I have not had any single hint to make them. I want to find one that is certain that if this leader goes he will not be able to look for another one, but all was useless.\n\nThe intention of the Department is to pay more to those who only sell their cattle, so I will try to find one that is sure to succeed and somebody in such a place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. W. Knight, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI beg to attach the enclosed letter from Rev. Charles Ballanger S.J., Roman Catholic Missionary at Lake Nipigon reserves with regard to Jackfish Island School.\n\nIt would appear that the attendance of children at this school in the past would not warrant reopening it at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.M. Knight\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 6, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with an enclosure from Rev.

You should make arrangements to have the building closed so that the furniture and school material will be taken care of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

A. Brown,\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, August 24, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing a communication from the Chief of Jackfish Island Reserve asking that a school be established on this reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would not be advisable to establish a school on this reserve at present and you will be good enough to inform the Chief accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nAugust 10th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nDuring the recent annuity payments at Whitesand I was approached by the principal members of the Whitesand Band regarding the advisability of erecting a school on their Reserve. There is approximately 40 children of school age, and the Band have been very anxious to have a school for some years.\n\nAt the present time the children are running around like wild animals, and they should receive education. I have been advised by the Hudson's Bay Factor and the Chief that the parents will live on the Reserve if the Department will erect a school.\n\nThe council house on the Reserve could be repaired and used as a temporary school until such time as a new one is erected. The cost of same would be approximately $300.00. Regarding this statement I would refer you to Mr. Paget, who accompanied the Treaty party and knows the conditions on this Reserve.\n\nMiss Morriseau, who is now teaching in the temporary school at Gull Bay can be transferred to the Whitesand Reserve.\n\nIf the above meets with the Department's approval the school could be repaired for September 1st, and Miss Morriseau transferred to Whitesand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Kirk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBay, viz., $40 per teaching month. She should arrange to begin duties at Whitesand when you have completed the fitting up of the council house. In view of her transfer, I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department whether you would recommend that the work at Gull Bay be continued, and, if so, you should state the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher whom you recommend be appointed to succeed Miss Morriseau.\n\nClassroom supplies will be required for the use of the new school at Whitesand, and you should prepare and forward a requisition for what is considered necessary for the coming winter. You should give the address to which they should be forwarded. If any blackboard is required, you should give the length and width of same.\n\nIn place of providing desks at the present time, it is thought that tables and benches could be made which would be suitable for the purpose.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised when you have completed the fitting up of the building and the date on which Miss Morriseau begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 16, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, recommending the advisability of providing school facilities for the Indian children of the Whitesand Band, and the fitting up of the council house on the Reserve to be used as a temporary classroom until such time as a new building can be erected.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of temporary arrangements being made for the carrying on of teaching activity for the Indian children of this Band. You may arrange to have the council house repaired and fitted up for temporary school purposes. The cost of repairing and placing the building in suitable condition for classroom work should not exceed your estimate of approximately $300. You should arrange for the purchase and forwarding of any material required and for the labour in carrying out the work. The Department will leave the matter of the repairs and fitting up of this building in your hands, to make it comfortable and as suitable as possible to carry on the school work. Please keep all costs as low as possible. It is to be understood that this arrangement is only temporary and that the providing of a new school building at a later date will depend upon the success which is achieved during the coming winter. After the above authorized repairs have been carried out, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and labour.\n\nThe Department will also approve of transferring Miss Florence Morrison, who is now teaching in the temporary school at Gull Bay, to the school on the Whitesand Reserve, and will allow her salary at the same rate as she receives at Gull Bay.\n\nJ.G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your 9-3-1, of the 16th inst., relative to previous correspondence regarding the advisability of providing temporary school facilities for the Indians of the Whitesand Band, I beg to advise I will proceed to this Reserve and arrange to have the Council House temporary fitted up for school purposes. Unfortunately I will not be able to leave for some time, as the fire situation on two Reserves will not permit me to leave.\n\nReferring to the 3rd para. each I note it will be in order to transfer Miss Florence Wilson, who is teaching in the temporary school at Hill Bay, to the school on the Whitesand Reserve.\n\nWith reference to engaging a new teacher for the Gull Bay School, I am to report qualifications, etc., will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nWith reference to desks, etc., for the Whitesand School I would most certainly recommend tables and benches, which will, undoubtedly, answer the purpose of a temporary school.\n\nOn completion of the temporary repairs, etc., I will again communicate with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Mark,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, M.A.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of August 16th, file No. 9-3-1, relative to previous correspondence regarding the advisibility of providing school facilities for the Indian from the Whitesand Band, I beg to advise I have recently returned from the Reserve and have made the necessary arrangements to repair the council house for temporary school purposes. I would be pleased if you would send sufficient school supplies for 20 children at your earliest possible convenience.\n\nThe repairs should be completed by the end of this month. Miss Florence Morriseau, who has been teaching in the temporary school at Gull Bay will be transferred to the Whitesand Reserve, and open the school on October 1st.\n\nI would suggest that sufficient school supplies be sent to last from October 1st until May 25th, 1930, as navigation very seldom opens on Lake Nipigon until the latter end of May. Consequently all school supplies during the winter months would have to be taken up by dog team, a distance of 96 miles from MacDiarmid.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 21st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that you have made the necessary arrangements to repair the council house for temporary school purposes for the Indian children of the Whitesand Band, and requesting that a supply of classroom material be forwarded sufficient to last until the opening of navigation next spring.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that an order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send, addressed to Miss Florence Morriseau, c/o J. H. Bealish, Macdonald, Ont., the supplies considered necessary for the period mentioned. Included in these supplies is an asbestos slate blackboard, 5'x4'. This will go forward by express. You should inform Miss Morriseau of the order placed for these classroom supplies and she should arrange to accept delivery of same. The blackboard should be taken to the school and installed. It is noted that Miss Morriseau will open this school on the 1st proxime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF J. G. BURK, INDIAN AGENT,\nPORT ARTHUR, Ont. dated November 13, 1929.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to postpone the opening\nof the temporary school on the Whitesand Reserve until\nnext spring. The lumber, stoves, etc., were purchased\nand are now stored at Nipigon House Post, at the upper\nend of Lake Nipigon. The teacher was unable to open\nthis school owing to very poor health, and I was\nunable to secure another teacher, but will open this\nschool the first thing in the spring.\nSir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence of August 16th, last, regarding arrangements to repair the council house on the Whitesand Reserve for temporary school purposes. In this connection I wish to advise lumber and material were shipped to Whitesand Reserve last fall and arrangements for the necessary repairs to the old council house were made with the Chief and councillors.\n\nUnfortunately the boat which carried the lumber and supplies was stranded on Shakespeare Island reef and the supplies did not reach the Whitesand Reserve until the end of October. With the result the Indians naturally concluded the school would not be opened until this year and left for their hunting grounds.\n\nI recently visited the Whitesand Reserve and find the Indians have completed the repairs to the council house and have also erected temporary quarters for the teacher which is attached to the council house. The Band are extremely anxious to secure a teacher and open the schoolhouse as soon as possible.\n\nI recently interviewed Miss McGuire, who would be willing to teach at this isolated school for $40.00 per month. I interviewed the Reverend Mother St. George, of the St. Joseph's Boarding School, Fort William, and was advised that Miss McGuire would make a very capable teacher and would be able to teach for 3 or 4 years at this school.\n\nWould you kindly advise if it will be in order to open this school and employ Miss McGuire as teacher?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Zunk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the opening of the Whitesand Indian Day School and nominating of the services of Miss McGuire for the position as teacher.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that the council house, which is to be used as a temporary classroom, has been repaired and made ready for use for school purposes, also that temporary quarters attached to the council house have been erected for the teacher's use. As the Indians are anxious that this school be commenced as early as possible, the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss McGuire as teacher, with salary at the rate of $40 per teaching month. Please inform her of her appointment, and arrange with her to proceed to the school and commence duties as early in July, next, as possible. You should give her any assistance you can upon commencing duties. It is hoped that this school will meet with success and that there will be a good attendance of the Indian children residing on the Whitesand Reserve. Please advise the Department later of the date on which Miss McGuire opens the school, also her Christian name and any particulars regarding her qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacNuttie,\nActing Ass't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJuly 30th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo, 9-3-1, regarding the appointment of Miss McGuire for the position as teacher at the Whitesand Indian Day School, I wish to state that this school was opened on July 10th. The Council House was recently repaired and will be used as a temporary classroom.\n\nWith reference to Miss Amelia McGuire's education I beg to report she received her education at the Fort William Residential School, and has taken a special course at this school during the past 2 years for the purpose of teaching at Whitesand Reserve. She has been highly recommended by the Principal of the Boarding School and should be capable of teaching at Whitesand Reserve for the next 4 or 5 years.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to the appointment of Miss Amelia McGuire as teacher of the Whitesand Indian Day School. The qualifications which Miss McGuire possesses have been noted, also that the school was opened on the 10th ultimo. It is hoped that Miss McGuire will meet with every success in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nDec., 22nd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Quarterly School Return for the Quarter ending September 30th.\n\nThe Whitesand Indian Day School was opened as a temporary school in the Council House on July 10th last. Unfortunately this school is extremely isolated and consequently mail quite frequently goes astray. The teacher, Miss McGuire, reports she has already forwarded to this office the original of the enclosed report, but apparently same was lost enroute.\n\nMr. Greening visited this school and reports Miss McGuire is getting along very nicely. I find that the nearest store is situated at Nipigon House Post. The Hudson's Bay Company provide the teacher with provisions at this point. The cost of living is naturally extremely high--flour $9.00 per bag, etc. Under the circumstances would it be possible to pay this girl at the rate of $75.00 or $80.00 per month?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, December 27th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the Whitesand Indian Day School and requesting that the teacher, Miss Amelia McGuire, be allowed an increase in salary over that mentioned in official letter to you of June 24th, last. In reply I have to say that Miss McGuire will be allowed salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month and she is being paid at that rate from the date she opened the school, viz., July 10th, 1930, to the end of the September quarter and cheque for the salary due will be sent her in your care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Separate School Inspector Greening's Report regarding his visit to the WHITESAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on November 8, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 9-3-6.\n\nHad I been consulted, I do not think that I should have been very favourable to the idea of sending a half-breed young lady, of tender years, of no great academic standing, and of still less professional preparation, to open a new school at Whitesand, far from parental oversight of any kind. To bring along successfully a new school requires an ability of a high order, while, to my mind, the task of starting off properly the neophyte along his educational path is the most difficult task facing the ordinary teacher. Fewer teachers of experience are capable of doing this really well than is generally supposed. How much less, then, can it be done by teachers of such meagre preparation. However, it might have been difficult, in view of the remote location, and the none-too-promising quarters, to secure a really good qualified lady teacher, and the Department having engaged Miss McGuire, I should be most loath to do anything towards her removal, especially as her work is quite as good as that done by white teachers of equal qualification, or should I have rather said equal lack of qualification.\nOttawa, December 31st, 1931.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department notes from the quarterly returns of the Whitesand Indian Day School that practically all the children are credited with full attendance during each quarter. This is rather unusual in Indian day schools.\n\nNo doubt, you have a day school register in which you enter the attendance each day and the information given on the quarterly return should be taken from the register. The number of days present, as well as the number of days absent, for each pupil should be carefully noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMiss Amelia McGuire,\nTeacher,\nWhitesand Indian Day School,\nNediammid, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nAugust 3rd, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMay I draw the Department's attention to Miss A. McGuire, teacher of the Whitesand Indian Day School.\n\nThe Reserve at Whitesand is one of our most northern Reserves, with the result a supply of rations is shipped up in October in care of the teacher, and the rations are given out each month by the teacher. Miss McGuire has been doing this for the past 3 years, and as her salary is extremely low, I was wondering if it would be possible to compensate Miss McGuire in some way for her services.\n\nIn conclusion I may say she is assisting her mother and father. Her father has been out of work for several years. Miss McGuire has rendered exceptionally fine service, not only in the classroom but also looking after the sick. Arrangements have been made whereby the doctor will not visit the Reserve unless he receives a letter from the teacher. In this way hospitalization is reduced, and also doctor's fees.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMr. MacAulay,\n\nAs I understand it, the vote for relief cannot be used to pay salary for a teacher & fire but supplied relief or medical & Secretary must decide the point.\n\n[Signature]\n\n14/5/35\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, August 15, 1935.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nRe your note under. I understand that in the Prairie Provinces and N.W.T., where Purchasing Branch administers relief, issuers are sometimes paid on voucher. If the same practice were followed in this case, it is presumed that vouchers would be paid from relief vote.\n\n[signature]\n\nFor Mr. [signature]\n\nThese paid as dispensers in Prairie Provinces in northern parts are not employees otherwise of this Department. In the case in point the dispenser is an employee and I cannot see how we can pay two salaries even from Relief Vote which has no amount provided for such service.\n\n[signature]\nOttawa, August 24th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, asking that some compensation be made to Miss A. McQuire, the teacher at the Shitamand Indian Day School, for her service in distributing rations, I beg to say that it is unusual for the Department to pay two salaries and this would be the case if an allowance was given to this teacher who is receiving $600.00 a year from the Department as a teacher.\n\nYou report that this young woman is assisting you very materially and also by the interest shown in the welfare of the Indians is reducing the cost of medical relief.\n\nWhat do you consider would be a fair remuneration to pay her for this service to the Indians? In what form could you submit a voucher that it would be acceptable to the Auditor General? If anything is paid to her, it will have to be out of the relief appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Dark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nAugust 28th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of August 24th, (9-3-1), regarding compensation to Miss A. McGuire for her services, in addition to her teaching duties.\n\nWhen Miss Moodie was here, she arranged with Miss McGuire to dispense medicines and do home visiting at Whitesand Reserve. Miss McGuire is to submit a report at the end of each month, outlining the work she has done, and the amount of remuneration is to be $5.00 per month.\n\nShould a similar voucher be submitted for issuing rations, or could an additional $5.00 be included in the same voucher? If it would be preferred Miss McGuire could be paid quarterly, but I believe the arrangement with the Medical Branch is, that she is to receive $5.00 per month for 10 months of the year.\n\nPlease let me know if you would prefer to have a voucher submitted every 3 months, or if it should be included with that for dispensing medicines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 31st, 1920\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence on the subject of payment to Miss A. Macquire at Whitesand for her services in distributing rations and dispensing medicines, I have to instruct you to make a voucher at the end of each month for payment to her of the sum of $10. In case Miss Macquire did not describe in detail the method of procedure, I may say that this payment is to be based on an account prepared by Miss Macquire; she should make up a list of the Indians to whom she has dispensed drugs or given rations, with some very brief notation of the reason for the issue, and place at the bottom of it a statement that her charge for the service is $10. You will then prepare a voucher, in any suitable terms but avoiding the use of the word \"salary\". This is just such an account as Doctor Gillis gives you for his work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F.

We have both talked this matter over with Mr. Van Hatten and consider him particularly suited for this position.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would advise me if it will be in order to advise Mr. Van Hatten his application has been accepted.

G. Buck\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, the present system of issuing salary cheques to the teachers requires our preparing the information immediately after the first of each month. At the time this information was being prepared for the month of October, we were not aware of the exact date on which Miss McQuire had begun duties, consequently, her name was not included on the October pay list.\n\nYour letter of the 7th ultimo stated that she began duties on September 21st and the amount due her at the end of November will be 10/30 of $70.00 or $23.33 for September; and $70.00 for October and the same amount for November, or a total of $163.33. A cheque for this amount will reach her about the 30th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department approves of the Whitesand Indian Day School remaining in operation until July 15th, 1937. It should reopen on September 15th, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Neay,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, July 7, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the R.C.M.P. in connection with the seizure of an outboard motor by the Indian constable on the Whitesand Reserve. No doubt, this report has been brought to your attention but, for your information, I quote paragraphs 7 and 8.\n\n\"I would request that Indian Constable Frederick Wanskimik be instructed to return the motor to Frank Phillips, and that a letter be written to Miss Amelia McQuire informing her that she is not to allow any white men or other persons to sleep at the school house over night, notwithstanding the fact that she has her sister Agnes McQuire staying with her.\n\nI expect to be at the Whitesand Indian Reservation some time during the first week in July assisting in paying treaty monies to the Indians. The Indian Constable will be interviewed and a further report submitted.\"\n\nYou should inform Miss McQuire at once that the Department concurs in the instructions that have been issued to her by the R.C.M.P.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, April 28, 1938.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nYou will recall that in September last word was received by Indian Agent Burk, Port Arthur Agency, to the effect that you were critically ill and that Infantile Paralysis was suspected.\n\nMr. Burk chartered an aeroplane and Dr. J.J. Pratt and Mr. W. Leroy, Clerk at the Indian Office at Port Arthur were sent to Whitesand Reserve to investigate.\n\nUpon arrival, Dr. Pratt found that you were not suffering from Infantile Paralysis but to have a condition which necessitated your removal to hospital. You were consequently conveyed in the chartered aeroplane to the hospital at Port Arthur.\n\nThe cost of chartering this aeroplane was $77.50 and as it is not the practice of the Department to pay cost of transportation of sick employees, payment of the account has been authorized with the understanding that one-fifth of the amount, viz., $15.50 be recovered from your salary.\n\nThe deduction has been made from your salary for April and I am enclosing cheque No. 57470 for $54.50 herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W. McCutcheon,\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nMiss Amelia McGuire,\nArmstrong, Ont.\nI am sorry but I have just received communication from Mr. Andrews, Secretary of the Board of Education Department requesting me to advise the Department that the request be forwarded to the following address:\n\nWalter A. I. M. School,\nWoodland Station,\nVia Amisk, Alta.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMarch 8, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention: Educational Department\n\nI have just been advised by Dr. Leslie L. Murray at Armstrong that Miss McGuire, teacher at the Whitesand Reserve school, has been sick for the past two weeks with a very serious attack of influenza, and has been unable to attend school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, July 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Greening, in a report on the Whitesand Indian Day School, dated June 24, 1939, states:\n\n\"The teacher will no doubt be relinquishing her work at this school, having been married.\"\n\nThis reference in the Inspector's report to the marriage of Miss Amelia McGuire was the first intimation we had that this teacher had been married. No doubt, you are aware that existing regulations prohibit the employment of married women, except in cases where the husband is physically incapacitated. You should inform this teacher that her services are dispensed with, and you might also at the same time explain why the marriage of this teacher was not reported to the Department at the time the marriage itself took place.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report dated June 24 regarding the inspection of the Whitesand Indian day school by Inspector Greening. From this report it appears that the teacher has recently married. You are aware of the regulations which require her to give up duties. I should, therefore, appreciate receiving her resignation immediately.\n\nMr. Greening recommends that a male teacher be engaged for this school. Please let me know if this suggestion meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. C. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJuly 29, 1939.\n\nAttention-Chief Training Division\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that approximately ninety-eight percent of the Whitesand band of Indians leave their reservation early this month and do not return until the 15th of September. As they depend entirely on the blueberry crop to purchase supplies for the fall hunt, I regret I did not communicate with the Department at an earlier date to inform you that the school would remain open until July 15th, and will re-open Sept. 15th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 2, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Whitesand Indian Day School\nNo. 146\n\nOwing to the peculiar habits of the Indians this school was kept open until July 15, 1939, and will not re-open until September 15.\n\nUnder these circumstances the teacher, Miss Amelia McGuire, should be forwarded a cheque for one half month's salary for the month of July.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1939.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nThrough oversight cheque 13168 for $57.33 was issued to you at the end of September. As you did not teach at the Whitesand school during any part of that month the cheque should be returned to the Department immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A.

No further payment should be made to her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you were informed when visiting the Department today we did not receive from you any definite information regarding the fact that Miss Amelia McGuire had given up duties as teacher of the Whitesand Indian day school. As a result cheque 15168 for $37.33 was issued and sent to Miss McGuire (Mrs. Donie) at the end of September.\n\nI have written to Mrs. Donie requesting her to return the cheque immediately. However, I should appreciate your getting in touch with her to make certain that this cheque has been refunded to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. O. Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Whitesand Indian Day School,\nPort Arthur Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Port Arthur.\n\nThe teacher of this school has given up duties\nand it is, therefore, necessary to secure another\nteacher.\n\nThis is a very isolated reserve and accommodations\nare not the best. I feel that it would be advisable to\nappoint a male teacher with Ontario qualifications. He\nshould be a Roman Catholic as all the Indian children\nattending this school are Catholics.\n\nThe salary rate is $700.00 a year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n8th November 1939.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nReferring to Dr. McGill's two memoranda of the 20th ultimo we are advised that Mrs. Harriet Reed, Teacher at the Gull Bay Indian Day School, and Miss McGuire, Teacher at the Whitesand school, are willing to continue on until June. If this is so there is no need to secure anyone else for the time being.\n\nW. C. Bethune,\nAsst. Private Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nTo Note:\n\nW. J. Pratt.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Bethune's memorandum of November 8 with reference to teachers required at the Gull Bay and Whitesand Indian day schools.\n\nI note that the memorandum suggests the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Reed as teacher at Gull Bay. She is a married woman and I understand her husband is able to support her. I may add that when Indian Agent Park visited the Department recently he stated that Mrs. Reed had given birth to a child last June.\n\nMiss McGuire is mentioned as a possible teacher for the Whitesand school. While she has taught at that school for some years she was married early this spring. Her married name is Mrs. A. Stone and I understand her husband is working.\n\nIndian Agent Park did not advise us until the latter part of October that neither of these teachers had resumed duties on September 1 and when we received this information from him the question of appointing new teachers was immediately brought to your attention in my memorandum dated October 20.\n\nI understand that it is not the policy to employ as teachers married women whose husbands are in a position to support them. Besides, in view of the number of qualified teachers at present unemployed it is difficult\nto justify the selection of married women.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I should appreciate your reconsidering the selection of teachers for the two schools mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nNov. 14, 1939.\n\nAttention-Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th ultimo, file No. 9-3-1, I beg to report that I communicated with Mrs. A. Donio, nee Amelia McGuire, former teacher of the Whitesand Indian Day School regarding cheque No. 13162 for $37.33 being issued her in error, and have advised her that this is to be returned to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nW.J. Greening, B.A.B.PAED.\nInspector of Separate Schools,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\n288 Harrington Avenue\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nDecember 27, 1939\n\nDear Mr. Burk,\n\nI am sorry that I have not been able to discover any teacher in this locality desirous of accepting the Whitesand Indian Day School.\n\nActually there is no teacher unemployed locally, but if there were I should, if consulted, strongly dissuade any white young lady from going there.\n\nThe living conditions there are entirely unsuitable for white young ladies. The school building is easily among the poorest I see anywhere, and the Indians are more than usually backward.\n\nIf I knew of any male teacher unemployed, I would mention the school to him, but I doubt very much if any male teacher would consider the school as anything but a very temporary proposition.\n\nBecause, besides the conditions outlined above, the salary, (Sixty Dollars per month), is most unattractive. The enrolled strength at Whitesand is about equal, (or greater) to that of the neighbouring schools, all of which are allotted greater salaries.\n\nIn my opinion, which is given for what it is worth, you have been extremely lucky to have Miss McGuire stay at Whitesand so long. Only the fact that she was partly Indian allowed her to do so, and, as you know, she refused to stay there any longer, and only returned, (after the lapse of a year), because she had been unable to get anything else to do. The male teacher we had in her place was not too greatly inclined to remain there for another year. If I had my way, this being the most unattractive school in your Agency, I would make its salary the greatest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSgd. (W. J. Greening)\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMemorandum for file:\n\nRe: Whitesand Indian Day School\n\nIn a letter dated December 4, 1941, on file 9-9-1, Indian Agent Burk stated that up to that date he had been unable to secure a teacher for this school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware, the Whitesand Indian Day School was not in operation for the academic year 1941-42, presumably in view of the fact that a teacher could not be secured. Please let me know if you have made any effort to secure a teacher for this school for the year 1942-43. Incidentally, you might state the number of children of school age who would attend the Whitesand School if it were in operation. An immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1943.\n\nDear Miss DesCoteaux:\n\nWith reference to your recent visit to the Department, I have carefully reviewed all the vacancies that we have in Catholic Indian day schools throughout Eastern Canada and the only school available is known as the Whitesand Indian Day School. This is situated in a rather isolated place at the north end of Lake Nipigon, which, as you know, is north of Port Arthur. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $80.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. There are living quarters for the teacher at the school. If you are interested in this school you might let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Juliette DesCoteaux,\nPlaisance, Que.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. J.C. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nWe have had an application from Miss Juliette DesCoteaux for appointment as teacher of an Indian day school. The only Indian day school conducted under Catholic auspices for which teachers have not yet been secured are those in your Agency. It is quite possible that Miss DesCoteaux will accept any one of them and I suggested to her possibly Whitesand. Perhaps you would prefer to have her placed at some other school. In any case I should appreciate hearing from you in the immediate future, stating which school you would like to have her handle and at the same time you should let me have full particulars regarding the accommodation for the teacher and the distance of the school from a railway station.\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nA large majority of the Whitesand Band have been living on the Transcontinental railway between Longlac, Ont., and Armstrong, Ont. The male members are working as section hands, for the railway and are paid at the rate of .50\u00a2 per hour. The Roadmaster, Mr. J. Pederson, very kindly offered to convey the Treaty Party from Longlac to Armstrong, via gas car, in order not to cause any delay by the Indians leaving their work, to go to the Whitesand reserve for their Treaty money. This saved a great deal of time and gave us the opportunity to interview a great many of these Indians personally. The Can. Nat'l Railways officials were extremely pleased that we were able to pay these Indians in this manner and not cause any delay in the track work.\n\nA separate letter will be forwarded later regarding the number of children along the track, who are not receiving any schooling.\n\nFor the past several years we have not notified the Indians when we would pay treaty, as they invariably wasted a great deal of time from their work. The only protest we received regarding this method of payment, was at Heron Bay, at the Pic Reserve.

I have asked Mr. Burk to send her some material for this work.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nWhile far from satisfactory, the school building will do for a while.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nThe results being secured here might warrant the school being graded as a fair to good average Indian Day School.\n\nHad I been consulted, however, I do not think that I should have been very favourable to the idea of sending a half-breed young lady, of tender years, of no great academic standing, and of still less professional preparation to open a new school; it was, and is, far from parental oversight of any kind. To bring along successfully a new school requires an ability of a high order while, to my mind, the task of starting off properly the neophyte along his educational path is the most difficult task facing the ordinary teacher. Fewer teachers of experience are capable of doing this really well, how much less then, can be done by teachers of such meagre preparation. However, it might have been difficult, in view of the remote location, and the none-too-promising quarters, to secure a really good qualified lady-teacher, and, the Department having engaged Miss Macaire, I should be most loath to do anything towards her removal\u2014especially as her work is quite as good as that done by white teachers of equal qualification, or should I have rather said equal lack of qualification.\n\nAs a result of a carefully considered investigation of these Indian Day Schools (including a discussion of them with such other inspectors as I meet from time to time who visit such schools) I find that there are several reasons for their failure to do work of as high an order as the expenditure and care lavished upon them by the Department would seem to merit. I have spoken of two of these reasons in my recent report upon the Lake Helen Indian Day School. While I am far from denying that, occasionally, an unqualified teacher will be found doing better work than a qualified (inferior) teacher, nevertheless I should like at this time to claim for the unqualified teacher at least a part of the blame for this deficiency.\n| Grade | No. of pupils on roll | No. of pupils present at inspection |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|       | Boys | Girls | Total | Boys | Girls | Total |\n| Grade I | 5    | 7     | 12    | 4    | 6     | 10    |\n| Grade II| 1    | 4     | 5     | 4    | 10    | 14    |\n\nIt will be noted that registration has practically doubled since this time last year.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nWHITESAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of Inspection: June 6, 1920.\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\n- Boys: Two\n- Girls: Eight\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: Two (12 desks).\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Miss McGuire\nAge: 32\nSalary: Six hundred dollars per year ($600)\n\nQualifications: No professional qualifications but specially prepared at St. Joseph's Boarding School for this work.\n\nHealth: Good.\n\nSuccess: Very satisfactory.\n\nSuggestions: I think that Miss McGuire is doing good work and have made a fine impression upon the pupils.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nAs the school has only been opened a short time, the pupils are all in the lower grades, although two girls have recently been moved to Grade III. I examined all pupils in reading, spelling, writing, and arithmetic so far as such work pertained to their ages, and was well pleased with the results. The little beginners' command of English was much in advance of that of similar pupils at Band Point.\n\n[Signature of Inspector]\n\nNote\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nForm No. 143\nATTENDANCE PROBLEM, REMEDIES SUGGESTED, Etc.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION\n\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF FURNITURE\n\nCARE OF MATERIAL\n\nCLEANLINESS OF PUPILS\n\ndo School-house\n\nOBEYANCE\n\nCONDUCT OF PUPILS IN SCHOOL\n\ndo out of School\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nINVENTORY.\u2014Teacher's Desk Home made Desks 12 Benches Chairs\n\nCupboards 200 Blackboards Stoves Stovepipes Washbasins\n\nBrooms Axes Soap Towels Pulis\n\nDrinking Cups 12 Looking-glasses Other equipment\n\nIf possible, I should like sufficient sewing and other material supplied to permit of Miss McQuaid's taking up more ambitious work along these lines.\n\nNew Equipment Required\u2014\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspectors will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nWhile far from satisfactory, the school building will do for a while.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nFor a teacher with such a poor organization, Miss Lougheed is doing quite good work. She has very evidently taken pains in this respect, and it is to be hoped that she will continue to do so.\n\nMiss Lougheed is teaching the ordinary academic work. Miss Lougheed is teaching the girls to sew and knit. She is a very clever needle-woman herself and does excellent sewing work to help her money, which I am sure she will be able to teach her class.\n\nI understand that Miss Lougheed's salary was set at six pounds per month, but I have not verified this fact. Compared with what Miss Lougheed could earn elsewhere, I think this payment is worth the trouble.\n| Grade       | No. of pupils or rolls | No. of pupils not present |\n|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Beginners  | 1                      | 1                        |\n| Grade I    | 2                      | 3                        |\n| Grade II   | 1                      | 4                        |\n| Grade III  | 0                      | 2                        |\n\nNote: One pupil was absent on the day of the count.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nWHITESAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of Inspection October 30, 1932.\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\nBoys: Five\nGirls: Eight\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: One (12 double)\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Amelia McGuire\nAge: 22\nSalary: Six Hundred Dollars per annum (less 10%)\nQualifications: No professional qualifications but specially prepared at St. Joseph's Boarding School for this work.\nHealth: Good\nSuccess: Satisfactory\n\nSuggestions: I have made a few suggestions.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nThe pupils are all in the lowest grades, but I examined them all in Reading, Literature (oral discussion of extracts read), Memory Work, Writing, Spelling and Arithmetic. The results are very satisfactory.\n\nThese little people, though very isolated and getting little opportunity of using English, show more self-control and much less reserve than many of the pupils of other day schools.\n\n[OVER]\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSPECTOR\n\nNOTE\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only\n\nForm No. 142\nAttendance is reported as most satisfactory\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY: Satisfactory\nCLASS ORGANIZATION: Good\nPRESERVATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF FURNITURE: Furniture is good enough for the time being.\nCARE OF MATERIAL: Satisfactory\nCLEANLINESS OF PUPILS: Excellent for such a building.\ndo School-house: /do/\nCONDUITANCE: Excellent\nCONDUCT OF PUPILS IN SCHOOL: Excellent\ndo out of School: Reported as being very good.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nPlease indicate what classroom equipment should be supplied:\n\nINVENTORY.\u2014Teacher's Desk: Home-made, Desks: 12, Benches: Chairs: 1\nCupboards: none, Blackboards: Satisfactory, Stoves: Satisfactory, Stovepipes: Satisfactory, Washbasins: 1\nBrooms: Axes: 1, Soap: Satisfactory, Towels: Satisfactory, Pails: 1\nDrinking Cups: 12, Looking-glasses: Other equipment:\n\nPlease supply immediately: 6 boxes of coloured crayons, 12 boxes of word builders.\n\nI have asked Mr. Agent Burk to purchase a dozen thimbles locally for use of this school. The children are very interested in sewing and knitting, and the teacher is going to have them make over some second-hand clothes. She cannot do so, however, without the thimbles.\nBUILDINGS AND PREMISES\n\nInspector will please mention the number of buildings, indicate their ownership and comment on their condition.\n\nWhile far from satisfactory, the school building will do for a while. I fear, however, that it will be rather cold in the winter.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nI think that Miss McGuire is doing good work. Compared with the work of other teachers more highly paid, I think that Miss McGuire's work, both on account of the quality of her work and the unattractive school conditions\u2014location and building\u2014warrants a higher net salary than fifty-four dollars per month.\n\nMiss McGuire is a very skilled worker in beads and silk. Indian silk work, I have been told, is rapidly disappearing, while the work in beads is much less widespread. If a few dollars could be spared to provide material, I am sure that Miss McGuire could have good work done in these lines at Whitesand.\n\nThere is one pupil at this school who is very deaf, and who is securing very little advantage, (except in manual arts) from her attendance at school. She ought to be sent to the School for the Deaf at Belleville, I think, or to some similar institution. She has some little hearing left and talks very readily. She could be easily trained at Belleville.\n|                | No. of Pupils Present at Inspection | No. of Pupils on Roll |\n|----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                | Boys | Girls | Total | Boys | Girls | Total |\n| Beginners      | 1    | 2     | 3     | 1    | 2     | 3     |\n| Grade I        | 3    | 3     | 6     | 5    | 3     | 8     |\n| Grade II       | 1    | 1     | 2     | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| Grade III      | 2    | 2     | 4     | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n|                | 5    | 8     | 13    | 5    | 8     | 13    |\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nWHITEHEAD INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of Inspection: Jun 29, 1932.\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\nBoys: 5\nGirls: 6\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: One (1P double)\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Mr. W.

We had no difficulty, however, in entering the school. We had simply to remove a pane of glass, which was \"glazed\" with a couple of hooks, and thus enter the school. There is absolutely no security for anything stored in the school building.\n\nIn order to keep out the cold in the winter, (when the temperature may fall to forty or more below,) the teacher has sheets of ordinary brown wrapping paper tacked to the log walls. It is quite possible to no enclose the building and put ones hand between the logs, thus perforating the paper which is the only thing between the occupants and sixty or seventy degrees of frost.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nWhen we reached Whitesand, it happened that Miss McQuire was away from the Reserve. Her services had been requisitioned as matron with an escort-taking Julia Maclean from MacRiver to MacDiarmid. Julia, an Indian girl, had had serious fits, and was very violent, and Miss McQuire was the only suitable woman available to look after her.\n\nI am thoroughly satisfied with Miss McQuire's work and am certain that her absence from school was unavoidable and in the best interests of the Department.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of Inspection: June 7, 1934.\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\nBoys: Eight\nGirls: Six\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: One, (12 double seats)\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Amelia LeGuire\nAge: 24\nSalary: Six Hundred Dollars per annum\n\nQualifications: No professional qualifications, but specially prepared at St. Joseph's Residential School, Fort William, for this work.\n\nHealth: Good\nSuccess: Good\n\nSuggestions:\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nClasses were taken in Reading, Oral Language, Arithmetic and Spelling.

Mr. Duncan is Chairman of the local Musical Festival Committee, and we had the children at Whitesand sing for him in English and Indian.

Mr. Agent Burk is, however, seeing to it that the building is as habitable as possible.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nI think that Mr. VanHatten may be expected to do really good work at Whitesand, if one might judge from the progress already made.\n\nIn this connection, might attention be called to the disparity of salary at Whitesand with that paid at any other school in this district. The attendance at McIntyre Bay, Gull Bay and Whitesand, and the qualification of the respective teachers is as follows: McIntyre Bay: 21, No professional certificates, but considerable experience with Indian children; Gull Bay: 20, Interim Second Class (Ontario); Whitesand: 19, Interim First Class (Ontario). Moreover, whatever may be the reason, (perhaps the higher qualification of the teacher), the reading, conversation and discussion by the pupils at Whitesand is the best of all the three schools. There would appear to be little justification for the difference in salaries viz: McIntyre Bay $850; Gull Bay $900; Whitesand $600; when it is remembered that both McIntyre Bay and Gull Bay have splendid residences.\n| Grade   | No. of pupils on roll | No. of pupils present |\n|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| Grade V | 1                     | 2                    |\n| Grade IV| 1                     | 2                    |\n| Grade III| 2                   | 3                    |\n| Grade II | 3                     | 4                    |\n| Grade I | 1                     | 2                    |\n| Beginners | 5                  | 6                    |\n\nTotal: 13 boys, 6 girls, 19 total\n\nAll present\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nWHITE SAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of Inspection: October 6, 1936\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\nBoys: Thirteen\nGirls: Six\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: One, (12 double seats)\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Norman Charles VanHatten\nAge: 20\nSalary: Six Hundred Dollars per annum.\nQualifications: Interim First Class (Ontario) Certificate.\n\nHealth: Good\nSuccess: Very promising.\n\nSuggestions: I have made some few small suggestions.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nThe classes were examined in Reading, Literature, and language work generally, in Arithmetic and in Spelling.

A six year old boy, Joe Kwatibens, was seized with pains in the mastoid region and ran a temperature of 105. As the Indians were all away from the reserve leaving no concern on the reserve, the teacher was unable to get the child to hospital. It was not for about a whole week that the patient was got away. How he has since fared I have not heard. Might it not be advisable for the Department to look into the circumstances so that something serious may not happen one of these days.\n| Grade | No. of Children on Roll | No. of Children present |\n|-------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|       | Boys | Girls | Total | Boys | Girls | Total |\n| Grade 5 | 1    | 1     | 2     | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| Grade 4 | 1    | 1     | 2     | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| Grade 3 | 2    | 1     | 3     | 2    | 1     | 3     |\n| Grade 2 | 2    | 1     | 3     | 2    | -     | 2     |\n| Grade 1 | 7    | 3     | 10    | 5    | 2     | 7     |\n|        | 13   | 7     | 20    | 11   | 5     | 16    |\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nWHITESAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of inspection October 5, 1936.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys: Eleven\nGirls: Five\n\nNumber of classrooms and number of desks in each: One, (12 double seats).\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Amelia McGuire\nAge: 25\nBorn: 6th Sept. 1911.\nSalary: Six Hundred Dollars per annum\nQualifications: No professional qualifications, but specially prepared at St. Joseph's Residential School, Fort William, for work at this school.\nHealth: Good\nSuccess: Good\n\nSuggestions: I have made some few small suggestions.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nThe children present were all in the lowest grades, but they were taken in Reading, Literature and Oral Language, generally; in Spelling and in Arithmetic.\n\nThe results were satisfactory.\n\n[OVER]\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSPECTOR\n\nNote\u2014This form to be used for Indian Day Schools only.\n\nForm No. 142\nAttendance has always been good at this school.\n\nORDER, CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE\n\nPUNCTUALITY\nSatisfactory\n\nCLASS ORGANIZATION\nGood\n\nPREPARATION AND ARRANGEMENT of Furniture\nAs good as circumstances permit.\n\nCARE OF MATERIAL\n- do -\n\nCLEANLINESS OF PUPILS\nGood\ndo School-house - do -\n\nOBEDIENCE\nExcellent\n\nCONDUCT OF PUPILS IN SCHOOL\nExcellent\ndo out of School Reported as being very good.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE\n\nINVENTORY.\u2014Teacher's Desk 1 Desks 12 double Benches Chairs\nCupboards 2 Blackboards Inadequate Bathrooms Stovepipes Satisfactory Washbasins 0\nBrooms 2 Axe 1 Soap 0 Towels 0 Pails 0\nDrinking Cups 0 Looking-glasses 0 Other equipment\n\nNew Equipment Required:\nI wish Miss McGuire could be given a supply of busy-work material for the little ones.\n\nIt will be noted that there are no washbasins or other facilities for the washing of hands by the children.

The school residence would be quite unfit for a white girl.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nTo those unacquainted with Indian Schools at such places as Whitesand, the results being secured might be rather disappointing, as the children now in Grade 3 have been going to school for some five years or so. This may be partly the result of Miss McQuire's not having any Normal School Training, but I do not think that very much better results could have been secured by even a well-trained teacher, having in view the settlement and the class of Indians there resident. Miss McQuire has always had a good influence upon her little charges, and I was personally more than pleased to see her return.\n| Grade   | Number of Pupils on Roll | No. of Pupils present |\n|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n|         | Boys | Girls | Total | Boys | Girls | Total |\n| Grade 5 | 1    | 0     | 1     | 0    | 0     | 0     |\n| Grade 4 | 0    | 1     | 1     | 0    | 0     | 0     |\n| Grade 3 | 3    | 1     | 4     | 3    | 1     | 4     |\n| Grade 2 | 3    | 1     | 4     | 3    | 1     | 4     |\n| Grade 1 | 5    | 3     | 8     | 6    | 3     | 9     |\n| Beginners | 12   | 6     | 18    | 11   | 5     | 16    |\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nWHITESAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDate of Inspection: June 12, 1937\n\nNumber of Pupils present:\nBoys: Eleven\nGirls: Six\n\nNumber of Classrooms and number of desks in each: One (10 desks)\n\nTHE TEACHER\n\nName: Amelia McGuire\nAge: 25\nSalary: Six Hundred Dollars per month\n\nQualifications: No professional qualifications, but specially prepared at St. Joseph's Residential School, Fort William, for work at this school.\n\nHealth: Good\nSuccess: Good\n\nSuggestions:\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nThe pupils (boys in the lower grades) were tested in oral work in reading, spelling; Oral Lessons; Arithmetic.\n\nThe higher girls were asked to do some written English.\n\nConsidering the lack of previous teaching on part of the teacher, the results were surprisingly good.

The situation and the school building are quite unsuitable, and I should strongly advise any white young lady against accepting the appointment, although I should not object so strenuously to its being filled by a male teacher. I do not know what salary is being paid to this school, but when Mr. Van Hatten was at the school he received the lowest salary of any teacher visited by me.

J. H. Macdonald, D.D., professor in [illegible], &c., &c., which he has also sent a letter from that lady addressed to the Hon. [illegible], representing her case.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n[Signature]\n\n15-1715-1\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that the members of the\n\nJ D McLean\nWitwenikong, Oct. 21, 1897\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of Dec. 9, to Rev. Richards, concerning teachers at Whitefish School was referred to me for answer. It appears that under Miss Emma Reid, another lady missionary has been at Whitefish teaching school, although some correspondence has been carried on about them both, between your office and mine, no missionary paid or other. The position is so little inviting that both ladies would have accepted it rather than none, but having failed better positions in the mean time, they have not even justified the missionary in charge. It appears that the Whitefish School has been closed now for a few months, pending correspondence and understanding, etc., between the missionary, your office and the Department.\n\nPermit me, Sir, to suggest that the manner of appointing teachers in these day schools be simplified and brought back to the system existing four years ago; viz.: that the supervisor of Witwenikong Division be trusted as to the choice and appointment of same teachers, with the obligation of reporting his action afterwards to your office for confirmation. The actual system demands long and close correspondence, causes much delay in the appointment of teachers, the effect of which is that schools will remain closed for months, and that candidates have time to secure better positions in the mean time. It follows that correspondence is carried on weeks about two or three since, advice candidates for our second school, the last one being often the least desirable.\n\nI will say further that the actual\nIn connection with the above objectionable practice, it does not appear to me that a higher grade of teacher than before, for the department has invariably fallen back upon the missionary for the task of teaching as a teacher. Therefore the teacher are now as before the nominees of the missionary. The latter has still the trouble of looking for a competent teacher, having but a low salary offered him, and in the end he goes by the salary. It is unnecessary to say more about this. The case of the white teacher is a plain illustration of this statement.\n\nNow as to the question of teachers at White Rock, if the proposition already made to the Department about $1000 is accepted, going there, and Miss Sarah Brown going to South Bay, both vacancies will soon be filled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB. W. Ross, Agent\nMaintenance\nand would respectfully ask for instructions as to what reply to make rather than\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nReferring to Official Letter of Oct. 19th last, I have the honour to inform you that a letter has been received from the Principal at Whitefish Lake, Montana, in regard to the condition of the school building there. The letter states that the building is in need of repair and that the school is unable to operate without additional funds.\n\nI am instructed to convey these facts to you and to request your assistance in obtaining the necessary funds.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nB.O.R. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKiamtowaning, Ont.\n\nOttawa, 2nd Nov. 1878.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th Oct. No. 3, enclosing a letter from the principal of the Ojibwe Industrial School in regard to the appointment of teachers for the White Rock Lake school. You will recollect that Mr. Charles F. Brown was to be transferred to the White Rock Lake school another place in the South Bay school filled by Miss Sarah Bernard; it is presumed that these changes have been made.\n\nWith reference to Father Reginald's remarks as to the attitude that ought to be assumed in the case of teachers, they today that the Department will write you a separate letter on this subject.\n\nA.

She was informed that the Department would consider her request for an increase, should the attendance at the school keep up and the Inspector's report be favourable. As it will be some time before the Inspector visits the school, probably not till next Spring, she is unwilling to wait, and as it would be a difficult matter to secure another teacher this fall, I think it would be better to retain her services by adding $50 to her salary.\n\nIt is a very out-of-the-way place and she has had previous experience and is qualified and, judging by her letter, is quite an intelligent young woman.\n\nThe special vote in the estimates will meet the additional outlay.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, September 30, 1908\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst., renewing your application for an increase in salary as teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian school, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of the conditions existing at this school, the Department will pay you at the rate of $350 per annum instead of $300.\n\nBe good enough to notify the Department if this is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Joannah Kelly,\nTeacher,\nWhitefish Lake Indian School,\nNaughton Station, Ont.\nNaughton Station, Colville\n\nOctober 15th, 1879\n\nTo Mr. Smith\n\nI have the pleasure to inform you that I have received your letter of the 15th instant.

The Rev. gentleman states that Miss Sweezy has nine years experience as a teacher, that she has a district professional certificate which she received with honors in the year 1906.

The Department regrets the delay that occurred in your receiving the final decision.\n\nAs to the salary I may say that $400.00 was paid to Miss Kelly, but she had been some years in the school and had performed very satisfactory work and it was thought that an initial salary of $350.00 to Miss Sweezy would be fair. You will note that the Department contemplated a raise in the future should her services be satisfactory. However, in view of the letter sent you by Mr. Sims, who stated the salary was $400.00, the Department will consent to Miss Sweezy's appointment at that rate, her retention in the position to be dependent upon the success with which she meets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

She received her training under the supervision of the sisters of Notre Dame of Mount Pleasant training college, Liverpool. At the King's Scholarship examination held in December 1904 she was successful and obtained a place in the 4th Division of the 3rd Class.

He states that Mrs Labranche is well recommended to him and has had some experience in teaching near Massey Ont. He further states that this woman will not take the school if more than one month's salary is deducted from the yearly amount of $400.00 per year.\n\nI would recommend that the Department confirm the appointment of Mrs. Labranche at once in order that she may take charge and be in readiness to open the school by the 1st Premise.\n\nRev. Specht informs me that it will be necessary to replace the stove pipes and also several lights of Glass 10 X 12.

Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSt. Ann's Rectory\n\nSudbury, Oct. 17th March 1962\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor some time past I have been in correspondence with Indian Agent H.C. L. D. Sims of Manitouining in regard to the school situated on Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve. With letters dated January 1st, February 1912 - No. 284-20, informing me that the department intends to set up a new school on the reserve with a view to the teacher whom it may open, and that it has even advertised for tenders to that effect.\n\nIn the former letter he was kind enough to say: \"The Department hopes you will be in a position to nominate a competent teacher to fill the vacancy at the school before long.\"\n\nThat remark, somewhat encouraged me to put an advertisement in a paper that a teacher was wanted at this school, a female teacher who I have received five applications one of the applicants being a widow, Mrs. Burnett of Willow Creek. In her first letter she says: \"I am a school teacher for twelve years previous to my marriage having taught in some of the best schools in the County of Renfrew and being very good for understanding the Indian people. On receipt of this letter I explained further the situation in the Whitefish Lake school. Whereupon she answered: I am sorry to say that I do not think it best to accept your school. It is too far from a depot and so inconvenient as well as a boarding place that I do not think I am strong enough for such a place, particularly at this season of the year.\"\nSudbury, Ont., 190\n\nI hoped this lady would take the school; she would have been just the person wanted.\n\nThe other three applicants are young ladies, probably.\n\nI am quite convinced that they would either not take the position when told of the situation or if they became ill, would not stay and I told them so in a most tactful manner.\n\nLet us drop the matter.\n\nNow, sir, allow me to make a suggestion. Would it not be more advantageous for the Department and for the children of that Reserve at least, to do what was done in the case of those in New Manitouwans? The children were sent to the Wikwemikong Industrial School and the teachers spent their time to keep a teacher appointed there at that institution. I think it is now too late to find time, so show the wisdom of the Department by doing in the matter. But still the Wikwemikong Industrial School will be at the fish station; it will be easy to send the children there.\n\nI thought it proper to propose this plan to the Department etc., and contract for the proposed school building at Whitefish Lake as soon as possible.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Rev.) J. Specht, S.J.\n\nP.S. Just returned from the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nP.S.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\n22nd March 1912\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter addressed to you by the Reverend Joseph Specht, S.J., which he has requested me to forward to you regarding school matters at Whitefish Lake.\n\nI do not think the suggestion of the Rev. Gentleman would be practical and the case of Buswa cited by him is not parallel with that of Whitefish Lake. In the case Buswa school it was on account of the non-attendance that the school was closed but this is not the case at Whitefish Lake, but, on account of the difficulty in getting a teacher.\n\nI am of the opinion that when the new school is built with comfortable quarters for the teacher that this will, to a certain extent, make it more easy to secure the services of a teacher for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 27, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in which you recommend that no action be taken to erect a new school-house on the Whitefish Lake Reserve and that the children be sent to the proposed new industrial school at Spanish River when it is ready for occupation.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the case of Buswah, which was quoted by you, is not at all parallel with this. There were not sufficient children at Buswah to warrant the continuance of the day school. There are a large number of children of school age on the Whitefish Lake Reserve for whom a day school should be provided and it is considered that when a new building is put up with comfortable quarters for a teacher it will be possible to secure the services of a competent person to take charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Specht, S.J.,\nSudbury, Ont.\nOttawa, March 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant enclosing a communication from the Rev. Joseph Specht in reference to the school on the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department quite agrees with you and Mr. Specht has been informed that a day school should be provided for the children on this reserve and it is expected that when proper accommodation is provided he will be able to secure the services of a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

She has been appointed by the school board and will take up her duties next September.\n\nMiss Smith is a young woman who has had experience teaching in the residential summer school two years. For the last two years she has been employed as a teacher in the residential school at Fort Frances.

Dated May 7th, 1913. Original on file\n\nIf this teacher attended the Summer School at Sturgeon Falls it no doubt would help her in methods of procedure. However, I expect to see her make better use of the natural method of teaching language as I exemplified with the pupils present how the work should be done. The pupils were being taught to read (or rather any words) without any knowledge of what they were doing. The methods in arithmetic also showed a want of knowledge of method or how to attain the end in view.\nOutler, Aug. 30, 1913\n\nTo the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs - Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am trying to hire a teacher for the Indian school at Whitefish Lake, but I have no hope to find one very soon. Whitefish Lake is a lonely place, cut off from all communications, a poor old school, and it is very hard for a teacher, especially a young person, to live there. I think, therefore, that the salary should be increased, or else it will be almost impossible to find a teacher for that place.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW. Remmert\nOttawa, September 17, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to the salary of the teacher at Whitefish Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not understand your remarks with regard to the building at this place, as considerable money was spent in repairing it and the Department was given to understand that it was in very fair condition.\n\nIn regard to the salary the Department will, under the circumstances, allow for a qualified teacher a salary of $450.00 per annum, which is an increase of $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. V. Renaud, S.J.,\nOutler, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.,\nSeptember, 19th, 1913.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to report having received a letter from Rev. V.

He asked me to write to the authorities at Spanish and Wikwemikong, asking them to furnish a teacher, which I have done, but without result so far. Does the Department know of any person who would take this school? If so the matter might be taken up with the Rev gentleman, his address is Sudbury, Ont..\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont..\nOttawa, September 23, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has not at present any applicants for a position as teacher of an Indian school. I may say that on the 17th instant Rev. Father Renaud was written to and informed that for a qualified teacher a salary of $450.00 per annum would be allowed at the Whitefish Lake School. It may be that this will be the means of obtaining the services of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitouining, Ont.\nWutler, Oct. 8 - 1913\n\nTo the Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am very thankful for the increase of teacher's salary at Whitefish Lake.\n\nVery likely Miss Catherine Rintoul, from Garden River, will be there this week. I was myself at Whitefish Lake last Sunday.\n\nThose who reported that the school house there was in satisfactory condition did not look at it with very good eyes. It is an old building, which must be very cold in the winter, and very unhealthy in the spring. Miss Martha Keen, who was teaching at Whitefish last year, knows something about it, and I wonder if Miss Rintoul will be able to stand it through the whole winter. As the school stands at the foot of a hill, it was right in the water last spring, and, even then, the kitchen floor looks like this.\n\nIt is not my place to advise the Department about the matter. I beg to say, though, that a new school...\nbuilt in some other place, is badly needed. There is quite a few children of school age, if the parents would only send them to school regularly. I remain\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nW.

Father Renaude nominating Miss Catherine Rintoul for the position of teacher of the Whitefish Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when the Department offered a salary of $450.00 per annum for this school it was upon condition that a qualified teacher would be obtained. As Miss Rintoul does hold these qualifications, the Department is only prepared to engage her temporarily, her retention to be dependent upon the success with which she meets. You will be good enough to inform Father Renaude accordingly and draw his attention to the fact that the condition laid down by the Department has not been observed. The salary will be $450.00 per annum. Please advise when Miss Rintoul takes charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nWm.

McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitouining, Ont.\nSudbury, 28th July\n\nTo the Secretary of the Indian Office,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. McLeod, Indian Agent residing at Manitowaning, went beyond the limits of his authority by hiring Mrs. Gilbert to teach another year in the mission school at Whitefish Lake. From his communication, it has always been the privilege of the missionary to secure a teacher for that place. For my part, I did not care any longer for the Gilberts, as there were complaints, complaints, about her losing too much time; and yesterday a man came to me to ask for another teacher. But of course, there is a reason to be satisfied with Mrs. Gilbert.\nanother year; for the kitchen is in poor shape, and I think that more but the Jaffet would stay there. Besides, she promised to teach more regularly, and to make her home at the Indian village. I am afraid, though, she will not be able to give very good attendance.\n\nIf I was authorized to do so, I would have that kitchen repaired... It would take about 800 ft of lumber flooring and V joints for the whole thing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. Renaud S.J.\nOttawa, Aug. 5th, 1914\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the White Fish Lake school, I beg to say that as you admit that no one else but Mrs. Jalbert would remain there as teacher, the Department fails to see why you object to her being kept on.\n\nMr. Agent McLeod will be written to in regard to the repairs needed for the kitchen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.

Father Renaud does object to her continuing. When I was at Whitefish Lake paying Robson Treaty Annuity in July last I interviewed Mrs Jalbert and she informed me that she was willing to teach for another term as the school is convenient to her home.\n\nIf the services of Mrs Jalbert were disposed of it would be difficult to get another teacher to take charge of this school as it situated in such a backward place.\n\nThe kitchen requires papering, but will be difficult to hang paper on the rough logs which were whitewashed last spring, and the floor should be covered with oil-cloth.

But it was all the same too late, as Miss Murphy had already secured another position. Fortunately, Miss Bernadette Murphy, Kathleen's sister, wrote me, saying she was sorry I had been disappointed, and offered herself to fill the vacancy, although she had decided not to teach this year. Judging from her letter, Miss Bernadette is a far better qualified teacher than her sister Kathleen. Besides, she...\nshe states, that she has been one year with Indians, and\nthat she can get along with them all right. Therefore, the\nchange is for the better. \u2014 But Miss Bernadet has to\nmake preparations, and cannot leave for Whitefish until\nthe 15th September.

The old school of Whitefish Lake was burned down a year ago last Spring when Miss Fitzpatrick was in charge. We were told last year that the Department was not prepared to build another school during the war\u2014We are now building a chapel which could be used also as a place-room in the mean time.\n\nWe have nearly 30 children of school age who wander through the village. Could you give us a teacher and kitchen furniture? The Indians of Beanage have all left the village and the school is not used. To economize, you could perhaps transfer the desks of Beanage school to the Whitefish Lake school. The cooking and Hop stones of Beanage could also be removed to Whitefish Lake.\nI will be grateful to you for an early decision, as we will have to look for a teacher and make application to you in the office of teacher.\n\nWishing you perfect health,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nMissionary\nOttawa, July 16th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev.

E. A. Pepinseu, S.J., suggests that the desks and stoves at the Beaucage School, which is now closed, might be transferred to Whitefish Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the desks and stoves at the Beaucage School being transferred to Whitefish Lake and you should make arrangements with Mr. Agent Cockburn for the transfer of these articles.\n\nMiss Fitzpatrick, who formerly taught this school, has been informed that the Department will be prepared to place her in charge, if the school is re-opened. You will be good enough to advise the Department when the building will be ready for occupation so that Miss Fitzpatrick can be informed when she should begin her duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nLett's Circuit, Aug 19th, 1918\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me a few words of explanation about the Whitefish Lake School. Some five weeks ago, I wrote to Mr. Benson, but received no answer\u2014\n\nLast winter, during an interview with Agent R. Lewis, of Manitowaning, I told him: \"If we build a comfortable building, where school could be held, will you give us a teacher, for Whitefish Lake Reserve?\"\u2014Yes.\u2014was his answer.\n\nUpon this promise, we have made great sacrifices and have succeeded in building a chapel, that can be used, both partly for a class-room, and partly for the teacher's residence. I was somewhat disappointed when I saw your answer (Letter No. 15-1715/1, Aug 1st) to Miss Fitzpatrick's application.\u2014I hope that you will assign your a teacher for that Reserve.\n\nThere are 34 children of school age, and they are all within \u00bc mile from the school hill. The children are all bright and intelligent, and their school can be made one of the most\nBenefit of all the Indian Reserves. I know\nthe schools of Sagamook, Butler, Shishigaming\n(the anglican school), South Bay, Dokes Reserve etc.\ncannot be compared to the Whitefish Lake school\nfor the number and talent of the pupils, and\nthey are granted a teacher.\n\nMoreover, the Indians, who have worked so\nhard this winter and this spring (cutting and\nsaving logs, etc., for their future school) are so anxious\nto have a school that they will be infinitely\ndisappointed, if they are not given a teacher.\n\nI understand that the Department will not build\nany school during the war. It was on account\nof that decision, we build the school ourselves.\nFor the desks and stories (working and stories)\nmay I suggest that the Department let us\nuse those of the former abandoned school of\nBeaverage? The Indians will never go to\nlive on the barren and windy pointe of Beaverage;\nthey have already settled in Yuletide and Charles-\nwood creek\u2014those places are fine, useless\nbeing spoiled by the dampness of the forsaken\nbuilding. Why not make use of them\nfor the immense betterment of our Indians?\nIf it were the pleasure of the Department I would gladly attend to the transfer of those books and stories from Beauce to Whitefish Lake.\n\nI wrote to Our Agent Lewis, and kindly reminded him of his promise. I hope all will be arranged satisfactorily.\n\nSince January, I have given all my free time and energy to the preparation of that Whitefish Lake School. I tramped in the deep snow to cut logs, I carried the heavy lumber, timber and planks; I dug at the foundations etc etc. I hope my strenuous efforts will not be vain.\n\nWith all confidence in your management,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nAugust 20, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in regard to the re-opening of the school on the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to re-open the school on this reserve and on the 14th instant Mr. Agent Lewis was instructed to make arrangements for having the desks and stoves at the Beaucage School transferred to Whitefish Lake.\n\nOn the 10th instant Miss Fitzpatrick, who formerly taught this school, was informed that the Department would be prepared to place her in charge there, if the school were re-opened, and that she would be further advised as soon as the Department knew definitely whether a suitable building could be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

As soon as the Department hears from him you will be advised as to when you should take up your duties there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Tillie Fitzpatrick,\nMissoula, Que.\n\nAsst.

McClean, M.P.,\nDeputy Sect. of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nLadies:\n\nWe, the undersigned, members of White Fish Lake Reservation, do hereby assert our grievance concerning the insufficiency of our day Public School.\n\nI. The present system in the teaching of our children is out of date, i.e.; The prayers and the rudiments of our Catholic Church is being taught by our school teacher, Miss Tillie Patrick, and that is in our Indian tongue, consequently our children do not at all make any progress to attain the English language, which is our main object to learn in establishing the school among our children.\n\nII. The hours are not regular in calling the children to school when the bell rings, some time 10 o'clock in the morning, and dismissing them at the hour of 11 o'clock, (A.M.) In the afternoon at the hour of two o'clock, the bell rings, they are dismissed again at the hour of 3 o'clock.\n\nIII. No proper school text books are used in teaching the children. It is all about the Catholic religion. We must have the regular course of Ontario public school instruction, prescribed for the Ontario Protestant Schools.\n\nIV. The School teacher shall be an English person purely. Protestant need necessarily not be barred. He should not teach religion in the school. Of course ordinarily he should read the form of prayer established in the Indian School Register, both at the opening and the same closing of the school in each day. Our present teacher Miss Patrick must be removed for incompetency.\nV. We Indians, of this White Fish Lake Reserve exclude the Roman Catholic Priest in the appointment of School teachers, that he does not in any form or shape interfere with our Public School.\n\nVI. Henceforth, we give the Indian Department of Ottawa in the appointment of School Teacher, for our Public School.\n\nVII. Considering our present surroundings, all English speaking neighbors, therefore our Tribe must be Anglicized eventually absorbed into the English race, it becomes us as a band of Indians in Council called in due form to adopt the foregoing items.\n\nMoved by James Nootoktai, seconded by Joseph Penay, that we, as Band of White Fish Lake Reservation adopt the foregoing clauses and items in their respective form and meaning; In doing so, we do not fight against our Catholic religion; only the sole intent to establish an efficient public day school for our children, therefore, we entrust the entire confidence upon the Indian Department to possess the sole power in the appointment of our school teacher;\n\nTherefore, our Council humbly pray that this shall be rectified by the Department of Indian affairs.\n\nUnanimously carried.\n\nSIGNATURES.\n\nEx.

If there is a time table kindly forward a copy to the Department.\n\nThe teacher should give the pupils some religious instruction each day, but the time devoted to this should not encroach on the time that should be given to other subjects.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to the complaints of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The only complaints the Indians could make were that the teacher taught the pupils their prayers in the Indians language and that her hours for teaching were not regular. Miss Fitzpatrick admitted that the prayers were taught in the Indian language, but that the hours for teaching were regular, and that she had a time table for the class-room which she follows, a copy of which I enclose herewith.\n\nI might state that it is my opinion that most of the trouble started over the teacher not being in favour of the Indians holding their council meeting in the church which is used as a class-room also, and the Indians have taken it into their heads to have the Department discharge her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 21, 1919.\n\nSirs,\n\nIn further reference to the letter from yourself and other Indians of the Whitefish Lake Reserve complaining of the manner in which the school is conducted by Miss Fitzpatrick, the teacher, I beg to say that, as a result of the inquiries made, the Department does not consider that you were justified in making the complaints referred to.\n\nI. No fault should be found with Miss Fitzpatrick in endeavouring to teach the prayers and rudiments of the Catholic religion to the children in their native tongue.\n\nII. A regular time table is followed.\n\nIII. The text books authorized by the Department of Education for the Province of Ontario are used in this school.\n\nIV. Miss Fitzpatrick is a Canadian of Irish extraction and Mr. Inspector Finn, who visited this school as late as the 21st ultimo, reports that she is doing satisfactory work. The appointment of Miss Fitzpatrick was made by the Department.\n\nThe Anglicization of Indian children must naturally take considerable time, as they have no opportunity of using the English language in their homes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Her retention in the position will depend upon the success with which she meets in her work.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform her of her appointment and arrange with her to take up her duties as soon as possible, and you should give her any assistance you can in the work.

Ladouer, teacher of the Whitefish Lake (R.C.) Indian Day School, for an increase of $50.00 in her salary.\n\nMiss Ladouer was appointed teacher of this school on September 1st, 1920, at a salary of $500. She also receives bonus at the rate of $150. A total of $650. She has a third class professional certificate and a second class non-professional, and has had 6 years' experience, 3 of which were in Indian schools.\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in his report dated May 19th last, states as follows:\n\n\"This teacher seems to mean well and will do for this Indian school. As far as knowledge is concerned, she is alright, but she is very peculiar. She takes great pains in forcing the Indian children to come clean and neat to school. She seems earnest enough, but she is peculiar and would not do in any other school of mine. She certainly makes these children do what she says. The school is so far away from Sudbury and so isolated that it may be difficult to keep a good teacher.\"\n\nThere is an enrollment of 25 pupils, with an average attendance of 18.\n\nIt is difficult to get a teacher for this school, and I would recommend that she be retained for another year, and that, if you agree, she be granted an increase of $50.00 from the 1st of September, next. She is doing fair work, and is able to keep up a good attendance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, June 15th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Miss Annie T. Ladoucer, teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, stating that the clock recently supplied for the use of the school is out of order, and is at present useless for the purpose. I may say that this clock was ordered from the E. N. Moyer Company, Limited, Toronto, and is the same type as is supplied by them to both white and Indian schools. There does not appear any reason why this clock should not be put in good condition, and it may be that it was damaged in transit to the school. You should make the necessary arrangements during the summer holidays to have this clock put in repair. The work should be done as cheaply as possible, and when completed, you may forward a voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the work. You will be good enough to give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nThe Department is granting Miss Ladoucer an increase of $50.00 per annum in her salary from the last of September, next, the date on which the school will reopen after the summer holidays. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $550 per annum, and she will also be entitled to the bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year; this being the amount of bonus allowed to teachers in Indian Day Schools. Miss Ladoucer has been informed of this increase having been granted her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. L., P.C.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitoba, Ont.\nOTTAWA, June 15th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the clock which was recently supplied for the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School. This clock was ordered from the E. H. Moyer Company, Limited, Toronto, and is the same type of clock as is supplied to a large number of both Indian and white schools. It may be that it was damaged in shipment. I am referring the matter to Mr. Agent Lewis, and requesting him to take the necessary steps to have the required repairs made.\n\nRegarding your request for an increase of $50.00 in your salary; I beg to say that the Department is pleased to approve of this request, and this increase will be granted from the 1st of September, next, the beginning of the next school year. This will make your salary from that date at the rate of $550 per annum, and you will also be entitled to the bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year, this being the amount of bonus allowed to teachers in Indian Day Schools. Mr. Agent Lewis is being informed of the increase granted you.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state whether you will continue as teacher when the school reopens after the summer holidays, and if you will remain for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ladouer, teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, be dispensed with as she has not proved a success, and that the parents are not satisfied with her teaching, and recommending that Miss Priscilla Lavallee, who formerly taught this school, be engaged to replace Miss Ladouer.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that, as you were informed by official letter of the 15th ultimo, the Department granted Miss Ladouer an increase of $50.00 per annum in her salary, and she was informed to this effect and requested to state whether she intended to continue as teacher when the school reopened after the present summer holidays. No reply has been received from her.\n\nIf Miss Ladouer gives up her duties voluntarily, the Department will be pleased to accept the services of Miss Lavallee, but in view of the fact that an increase was granted to Miss Ladouer for the next school year it is not considered fair at the present time to dispense with her services. You should communicate with her and inform her that the Indians are not satisfied with her work, and if she decides to resign, Miss Lavallee could then receive the appointment.\n\nKindly ascertain from Miss Ladouer as soon as possible what she intends to do and inform the Department accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I understand the objection to Miss Ladoucer is that she does not teach the children properly in English. They had Miss Levalley for one year and she was much more successful in teaching and they would like very much to have her again. You mentioned in your last letter that Miss Ladoucer was ill and so far this term the school has been without a teacher. I also understand that Miss Levalley would be quite willing to come to the school instead of the one where she is at present teaching.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, Oct. 13th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nSeveral communications have been received from Mr. J. S. McKessock, Barrister, Etc., Sudbury, in which he has requested, on behalf of Chief Petantaquose of the Whitefish Lake Reserve, for a change in the teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School. The Indians request that Miss Ludouser, the present teacher, be dismissed and that Miss Levalley be appointed to succeed her.\n\nMr. McKessock has been informed on several occasions that it was not the intention of the Department to make a change at the present time; also that Miss Levalley is acting as teacher of the South Bay Indian Day School, and the services of Miss Ludouser were reported by the Separate School Inspector to be satisfactory. It now appears that the Indians are strongly against Miss Ludouser continuing as teacher and desire the transfer of Miss Levalley.\n\nI will be pleased if you will forward a full report as to your views regarding the request of the Indians. You should state whether Miss Ludouser has recovered her health and resumed duties, and you should also state the nature of her illness.\n\nOwing to the persistence of the Chief, the Department is anxious to have a full understanding of the trouble existing between the teacher and the Indians at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, in order that it can arrive at a decision as to whether it is advisable to carry out their wishes or not.\n\nAn early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Leslie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 13th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with further reference to the request made by the Indians for a change in the teacher at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is referring this matter to its Agent, Mr. R. J. Lewis, Manitowaning, Ontario. On receipt of his reply the Department will be in a position to finally decide this matter, and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. S. McKeesock, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister, Etc.,\nSulbury, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Official Letter No. 19-8-1 of the 13th instant, in regard to the Department being in receipt of several communications from Mr. R.R. McKeanack of Sudbury, in which he requested in behalf of Chief Petahstogoose of the Whitefish Lake Reserve, for a change in the teacher of the Whitefish Lake School, I have the honour to report that when I was returning from the Whitefish Lake Reserve on the 20th instant after paying the Indians their full interest annuity I met Miss Laducer at Naughton Station on the C.P.R. on her way to Whitefish Lake to reopen the School. She informed me that she has been suffering from a skin disease, known as the itch, which had gone through her blood, but she had recovered her health and expected to be able to do satisfactory work in the class-room at Whitefish Lake School during the current school term.\n\nWith regard to Miss Lavallee, the present teacher at South Bay, being transferred to Whitefish Lake School, I have to report that the Indians at South Bay are strongly opposed to the transfer of Miss Lavallee and they have passed a resolution in their council requesting that Miss Lavallee's salary be increased to $500.00 per annum, which went forth to the Department on the 17th instant.\n\nAs Miss Laducer has just reopened the school at Whitefish Lake after her illness it would be unfair to discharge her at the present time; therefore, I would most respectfully recommend that the matter stand until the Christmas holidays and by that time if her teaching is not satisfactory to the Indians an effort should be made to secure the services of another teacher to replace her. I might say that when I visited this school last term I found Miss Laducer's teaching satisfactory, but it appears that the Indians do not care for her personally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 29th, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the request of the Chief and Indians of the Whitefish Lake Reserve for a change in the Teacher at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that as Miss Ladomar, the present teacher, has re-opened the school after her illness, the Department agrees with you that it would be unfair to discharge her at the present time. If her teaching continues unsatisfactory to the Indians an effort can be made to secure another teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays next.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to the success with which Miss Ladomar is meeting in her work. It is not the intention to transfer Miss Levallois from South Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.B. Holman),\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs, Dept.,\nIndian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nDecember 17th, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. I9-8-I.JDS/G of October 26th, last, I have the honour to report that I visited the Whitefish Lake School on the 14th instant and found the teacher, Miss Ladoucer, trying to do good work in the class-room, but it appears to be a rather difficult task as the majority of the Indian parents have taken a dislike to her and do not give her any encouragement. All the pupils attending the school are juniors whom Miss Ladoucer is quite capable of teaching and she is doing very good work in the class-room regardless of the fact that the Indian parents are not assisting her very much.\n\nAs it is the intention of Miss Ladoucer to teach at Whitefish Lake until the midsummer holidays, and she has purchased her supplies for the winter, and she being capable of doing good work at the school, and at the present time there not being a teacher in view to replace Miss Ladoucer; therefore, I would most respectfully recommend that she may continue to teach until the midsummer holidays and then the services of another teacher be secured in order to satisfy the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, December 22nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, reporting on the work that is being performed by Miss Ladoucer, teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of Miss Ladoucer continuing as teacher until the end of the present school year, namely June 30th, next. You can then inform her that her services will not be required for another year.\n\nYou should inform the Department in due time, forwarding Miss Ladoucer's resignation, in order that a new teacher can be secured to begin duties after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ladoucer as teacher at their school.\n\nWith regard to this resolution I have the honour to report that I was called to Whitefish Lake by the Indians as there was trouble between the teacher and the Indian parents, and when I visited the school on the 8th instant, I found the school closed and the teacher had herself locked in the residential portion of the school building and after having some little difficulty in gaining an entrance to the building I managed to have an interview with her in connection with school matters which she explained to me that it was all the parents fault as she was still doing good teaching in the class-room, but the parents had refused to send their children to school, therefore, the school had been closed during the current week.\n\nOn looking over the school register I noticed that the pupils had not advanced in standard since Miss Ladoucer took charge of the school, and the Indian parents informed me that she does not teach regular hours and that their children are not advancing any in education, and that they will not send their children to school any more if Miss Ladoucer is left in charge of the school.\n\nAs there has been contention between Miss Ladoucer and the Indians since she took charge of the school, and it has now reached the point where I cannot put up with her any longer, therefore, I would most respectfully recommend that the Department dispense with her services immediately and the school be closed until after the midwinter holidays, or until such time as the services of a qualified teacher can be procured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, March 15th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a copy of a resolution of the Whitefish Lake Band regarding the services of Miss Annie T. Ladoucer, teacher of the Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of this resolution and your report as to the work Miss Ladoucer is performing, it is considered that it would be advisable to ask for her resignation to date from the end of the present month, which is also the end of the present quarter. You will be good enough to obtain her written resignation.\n\nMiss Ladoucer should at the end of the present quarter prepare her returns of attendance, etc., and forward them to the Department through your office, in order that payment of salary and bonus due her can be made.\n\nIf you are unable to obtain another teacher to carry on the work during the balance of the school year, the school may remain closed until after the midsummer holidays.\n\nYou should inform Miss Ladoucer immediately of the Department's decision, and obtain, if possible, her written resignation, which you should forward. As the Indians request her removal, and as she is making no progress in her work in the school, it is useless to continue her services after the end of the present month.\n\nIf you obtain the services of another teacher to succeed Miss Ladoucer, the name, qualifications and experience of the one secured should also be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. If you are not able to obtain a teacher, the school should, as stated, remain closed. In that event, all school material, etc., on hand should be properly stored until required when a new teacher is engaged after the midsummer holidays.\n\nYou should keep in mind during the coming summer the securing of a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

BENNETT, B.A.\nInspector of Separate Schools\n47 BROWNING AVENUE\nTORONTO\n\nToronto, May 11/22\n\nConfidential\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter driving from Sudbury to visit Whitefish Lake Indian School I was hindered five miles from the school by two bridges which had been swept away by the floods. Circumstances demanded that I reach the school so I hired a canoe and an Indian guide, who as I found out later, was about half drunk.\n\nI found the school not in operation. The register showed that no one had attended since March 3rd. The teacher, Mrs. Ladouceur, was there however and the building and class room in good clean shape. The door was locked.\n\nThe teacher claims that the Indian people will not send their children. The chief acknowledges this. They will not send their children and what the reason is I don't know and couldn't find out. I understand that it is not due to any punishment that she may have given them, however, while I cannot definitely prove so yet it appears from what I hear, that she is at least \"strange and queer\" to say the least. She claims that a Miss Lavallee of South Bay has written the Indian Chief and others and this has caused the Indians to turn against her. She further claims that the Indians say that they closed the school themselves. It is a question if this is true. It is hard to say who is to blame.\n\nIf Miss Lavallee did write, and if the Indians want her, then she should not be sent to them for fear that the Indians will consider that their wishes in teachers should be law. I told the chief that the Department of Indian Affairs engaged and hired the teachers and that the Indians cannot expect to have any say in the matter of teachers.\n\nMrs. Ladouceur cannot leave with the bridges down. It is a reasonable fear that the Indians might dump her trunk in the lake for there is no doubt they hate her.\n\nThe teacher claims that the Indians have tried to break in on her. She never leaves the school.\nOTTAWA, May 16th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of inspection of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, together with your account covering the expenses incurred by you and for the fee charged for making this inspection.\n\nA cheque for the amount due will be sent you in the course of the next few days.\n\nI am also directed to acknowledge receipt of your confidential report of the 11th instant, regarding the situation at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School. It is noted that Mrs. Ladoucer, the teacher, has not had the school open since the 3rd of March, last, that she is afraid of the Indians and keeps herself locked in the school, also that the Chief and other Indians are determined that no children will be sent as long as she remains at the school.\n\nI may say that we are today instructing Mr. Agent Lewis, Manitowaning, to proceed to the Whitefish Lake Reserve and take charge of the removal of Mrs. Ladoucer and her property to Naughton Station. Under the circumstances related by you, it is considered that it would be advisable to get rid of her as soon as possible, and have her removed from the Reserve.\n\nMiss Lavallee, whom you state the Indians desire to have appointed to succeed Mrs. Ladoucer, made application to be transferred from the South Bay Indian Day School, where she is at present teaching, to the Kaboni Indian Day School, for the next school year, beginning September 1, 1922, and this transfer has been approved. We have, therefore, no intention of acceding to the Indians' desire to have Miss Lavallee appointed as teacher of the Whitefish Lake school. The school at Whitefish Lake will remain closed for the present. It may be necessary, as suggested by you, to leave them without a teacher in order that they will appreciate one when such is appointed.\n\nWe hope that Mr. Agent Lewis will succeed in having Mrs. Ladoucer removed from the Reserve without any trouble. We have also requested him to forward a voucher for any balance of salary he considers is due Mrs. Ladoucer.\n\nThe letter forwarded by you will be treated as confidential as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq., B.A.,\nInspector, Separate Schools,\n7 Browning Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActg. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA, May 16th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of confidential information concerning Mrs. Ladoucer, the teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School. This lady has been acting strangely of late and keeps herself at present locked in the school and is not giving any service to the Department or to the Indian Band. The Indian children are prohibited from attending school by their parents, and there is rather a hostile feeling against her. I understand she would be glad to leave the Reserve if someone with the written authority of the Department would remove her and her effects under protection to Naughton Station.\n\nIt is considered useless to allow Mrs. Ladoucer to remain any longer in charge of this school, and I have, therefore, to request that you will proceed at an early date to the school and take charge of removing herself and property to Naughton Station. Any expenses incurred for this purpose will be paid upon receipt of properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure. We will not be responsible for her after she arrives at Naughton Station. Kindly attend to this matter as soon as possible and inform the Department when you have succeeded in removing her safely.\n\nThe Department understands that the Indians are anxious to obtain Miss Priscilla Lavallee, as teacher, but authority has recently been granted, as per official letter to you of the 8th instant, for her transfer to the Kabinini Indian Day School for the next school year, beginning September 1, 1922. The Band at Whitefish Lake have acted in a rather high-handed manner of late and should not be permitted to take any unauthorized action in connection with school matters. We will, therefore, not accede to the Indians' request in this regard, and the school at Whitefish Lake can remain closed, as it may be necessary to leave these Indians without a teacher in order that they will appreciate one when such is appointed.\n\nIf you consider that any balance of salary is due Mrs. Ladoucer, you should forward a voucher for the amount you consider she is entitled to.\n\nWe are anxious to get rid of her services at as early a date as possible in order to prevent any further trouble. I might inform you confidentially that there are strong reasons for doubting her sanity, and she should be removed by you to Naughton Station with little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

A cheque for $137.50 in full payment of her salary for the quarter ending June 30th, is being sent to you under separate cover and, upon receipt of this, you should forward it to her.\n\nShe will also be allowed bonus for the June quarter, but cheque for this amount cannot be issued until after the end of the quarter. It will then be sent to you also for transmission to her.\n\nYou should consult the Roman Catholic Church authorities with a view to obtaining the services of a suitable teacher to succeed Mrs. Ladoucer.

We have, however, a vacancy for a teacher in the Indian day school at Whitefish Lake, about 5 miles from Naughton Station, on the Soo Branch of the C. P. R. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $650 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nLiving quarters for a teacher are provided in the school building, and it would be necessary for you to do your own housekeeping. I shall be pleased to hear from you immediately as to whether you will accept this position or not and, if so, whether you will be ready to begin duties when the school re-opens on or about September first, next.\n\nI may say that we replied to your letter of the 5th of July, and offered you a school at South Bay, on Manitoulin Island. As no reply was received, we engaged another teacher for this school. Our letter to you was dated July 8th, and addressed to Valois, Que., the address given.

He was once a soldier in the Imperial Army. He is highly educated, having been a teacher. But like many others who have left him without a position and with a feeling of nervousness when it comes to responsibility. At present I have him in a school (English) but being an Englishman he will not be able to stay there long.\n\nYou will remember that Miss Macdonald the teacher on the Whitefish reserve did not intend to stay. Her raise in salary may induce her. However, if she leaves, I would like if you would send that school for his friend mine. I know he will stay for maybe a couple of years and he would do well there. Let me know as soon as it becomes vacant. If there is a vacancy in any other school let me know. However, I would prefer that he come to Whitefish Lake (McLeod Agency).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M.

She states that the Reverend Father Porcheron advised her to apply for the position, and that she is twenty-one years of age and holds a Quebec certificate and has three years of successful teaching, her present term being in an Indian school and would be ready to take charge at Whitefish Lake on or about September the 1st, next.\n\nMiss M.A. McDermott, the teacher in charge of the Whitefish Lake School at the present time, has given me to understand that she does not intend to return to Whitefish Lake after the mid-summer holidays and that she has asked the Department for a transfer to Garden Village Indian School in the Sturgeon Falls agency for the next term.\n\nNo doubt but the Department will be acquainted with Miss Toner's ability as a teacher on account of her being engaged as a teacher in an Indian school during the present, therefore, if her services as a teacher are satisfactory to the Department I would most respectfully recommend that she be engaged to take charge of the Whitefish Lake school for the next term.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that you have received an application from Miss Angela Toner for the position as teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we will approve of the appointment of Miss Toner, to take charge when the school re-opens after the midsummer holidays, on or about September 4th, next. Miss Toner taught last year at Coulais Bay, in the Sault Ste. Marie agency. The Separate School Inspector stated that she is a capable and earnest teacher. She is resigning from that school at the end of the current quarter.\n\nMiss McDermott, the present teacher at Whitefish Lake, is being transferred to the Garden Village School, in the Sturgeon Lake agency, after the holidays.\n\nThe salary allowed Miss Toner will be at the rate of $650 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law. This is the amount she receives as teacher at Coulais Bay.\n\nYou should inform Miss Toner of her appointment and the salary allowed, and ascertain from her whether she will accept and be ready to take up duties early in September or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\n11-8-1\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: DEPT.

She returned to her home on the 20th instant from the hospital, after undergoing a successful operation.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that she be granted her request in order that she may recuperate before returning to the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 29, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, recommending the re-engagement of Miss Angela Toner as teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian School for the next academic year.

This woman has eight years teaching experience and taught in the Whitefish Lake Indian School previous to her marriage. During the time she taught school in this agency her work was quite satisfactory, but as she is now married with a family of children I would not recommend her to the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-3-1.\n\nOttawa, July 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School for the next school year, and informing the Department regarding applications which you have received.\n\nWe are communicating with Miss Florence Craig, Renfrew, Ont., requesting her to furnish the Department with further particulars regarding her qualifications and experience.

The salary allowed you will be at the rate of $80 per teaching month. As you have been informed, there is living accommodation provided. There were multiple buildings when the former teacher gave up duties, but it might be advisable for you to take a quantity of bedding, linen, etc. The nearest railway station to the school is Saguenay - about four and a half miles, at which point you can obtain your supplies. You should be at the school and ready to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. Besides teaching duties, if you perform your own janitor services, salary for same will also be allowed.\n\nThe local Indian Agent is Mr. R. J. Lewis, Manitowaning. He, however, resides at a considerable distance from the school. We are informing him of your appointment and requesting him, during his visits to the reserve, to give you every assistance he can. Should there by any supplies required either for the classroom or for your living quarters, I would request that you prepare a list and forward same to the Department.

I believe that the choice could not be better. I trust that the Department will do the same for Bishop Scott and Pickton. For Mr. Daly, regret is too much stuck in the qualification, and therefore is liable to pick up a young girl from the normal school, without experience, provided she would have her second class certificate.\n\nSo I hope that the Department will throw himself into these two schools and I wish he could be as happy with his choice as he was for the Whitefish Lake school. Thank you very much, and be sure that I will co-operate with the Department in helping out.\nin Burnett, and in encouraging him to stay as long as possible.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. L. Pollock\n19-8-1.\n\nOttawa, May 9, 1932.\n\nDear Mrs. Burnett:\n\nIt is entirely probable that you are quite happy at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School and are not desirous of a transfer, but I should like to give a move to the young lady who is teaching at the Maniwaki Indian Day School, in Quebec. I write to enquire if you would like to trade schools with her. The same salary would be allowed.\n\nThe Maniwaki Indian Day School is one and a half miles from the white village of Maniwaki. There is no residence attached to the school and you would board in the white village. The class is heavier than you have had, as there are from 20 to 30 in attendance, depending upon the season of the year. The Indian Agent lives at Maniwaki. I thought it probable that you might like a school closer to your home and that an opportunity to live with white folks again would be attractive. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you would like to consider this transfer. To refresh your memory I may say that Maniwaki is 88 miles north of Ottawa and is on the railroad.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

He was very much pleased with their work. He stated that without doubt my year was a success and that it was the best for some time, and hopes that I would return in September.\n\nI have worked while in school to the best of my ability and would li...\nto remain at Whitefish Lake School for another year.

Miss Spottwood called at the Department today and has been granted leave of absence until the 13th instant. If the Indian parents offer no objection, she will teach during the coming Easter holidays to make up for the time lost.\n\nWe understand that the Indians leave this reserve about the 15th or 20th of June, next, taking their children with them, and Miss Spottwood has been authorised, when the Indians leave near the end of June, to close the school for the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is expected that the separate school inspector will be visiting this school sometime in June, next. However, I may say that, from your seven years' experience in white schools, your work is no doubt successful at the Whitefish Lake Indian School. You will likely be visiting Ottawa on your way home for the summer holidays, and you could at that time call at the Department, when the matter of your re-appointment will be determined.

In a communication from Mr. H. J. Lewis, Indian Agent, Manitouwining, Ont., he states he was advised by the Chief of the Band that Miss Spottswood was retiring on account of ill health. Miss Spottswood, in her telegram, stated that she was writing but no communication has been received.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher, with at least Second Class Ontario qualifications, to succeed Miss Spottswood. As the Indians of the Band are Catholic, it would also be necessary that the teacher appointed be of that denomination. There is an enrolment of 14 children, with an average attendance of 12.\n\nI would request that you advise me, as soon as possible, of the name, address, qualifications, experience, etc., of the teacher whom it is desired to be given the appointment.

In the meantime the school is closed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, February 5, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, regarding the communication you received from the Chief of the Whitefish Lake Band, informing you that Miss Lyla Spottwood, teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, had departed from the reserve and did not intend to return. In this connection I have to say that a telegram was received from Miss Spottwood, dated the 31st ultimo, in which she states: \"I resign duties at Whitefish Lake School. A letter follows.\"\n\nI may add that we have received no further information from Miss Spottwood as to her reasons for giving up duties. As it is evident it is not her intention to return to the school, the Department is taking up, through the office of the Superintendent General, the matter of the appointment of another teacher. When information is received concerning the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher to receive the appointment, you will be advised. In the meantime, the school will have to remain closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

She has been employed there for several years and has proven herself to be an excellent teacher. Her experience and dedication to the welfare of the children of the band should be given serious consideration.\n\nIn response to her application I might say that Miss Smith has been visiting at Whitefish Lake Reserve during the last four or five years but had a life of illness, and did not apply herself to lack of employment, which I must blame the Indians. The Chief assured me that Miss Smith was someone in the best interest of the children, and that he would be willing to employ her. However, it would not be possible for the Department to approve of her services as she is not liked by the Indians, and he thought that the services of a white girl would be more satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSIR:\n\nIn reply to Departmental Letter No. F-111 of the 24th of July last, I have the honor to inform you that Mrs. Smith will not be required for the academic year 1936-37, and the following qualifications, namely, the entire of the Department has an opportunity to qualify Indian teachers, and there is nothing to be accomplished further in an Indian Day School.

I have reason to believe that this illegitimate child may have been born within the last six months past, and therefore it is difficult to secure definite information in this case.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J. A. Smith, who is connected with the Department of Education, who has written to me in regard to the case of Miss Mary Kinloch, etc., and stated that she had been subjected to an illegitimate child, and that he was unable to secure definite information regarding the case. It is stated that she has been subjected to an illegitimate child, and that he was unable to secure definite information regarding the case.\n\nAs the Board has no definite information regarding this matter, I have not been able to obtain any definite information regarding this matter from anyone, and I am sure that this cannot be really so.\nI am for the plan of Mr. Beckett but \nnot for the proposal to let the new plan for \nthe school be used by Mr. P.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nWikwemikong 1st Sept. 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn answer to yours of the 25th, I was told by the sister of the person where she is living (Mary Kinoshameg) now at Lake Panage. The day of Mary Wabegijig's wedding I asked her if it were true that Mary Kinoshameg had a child, she answered immediately yes. The story goes on at Wikwemikong as true.\n\nTo be more certain, I would advise you to write to Mary Wabegijig Mrs. Theodore Naponn, Lac Polson Blanc P.O. Naughton, ON.\n\nAnd do as you are informed, because I would not like Mary Kinoshameg to lose her chance if it is not true.\n\nThis is the only information I had.\n\nMary Kinoshameg had a very free life around here and in Killarney.\n\nSorry to give you that trouble, but I thought it my duty to inform you for the respect of your teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

O., Naughton, Ont.\n\nYou are aware of the Department's reasons for hesitating to approve the appointment of Mary Kinoshameg as teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School. I would, therefore, appreciate if you would get in touch with Mrs. Napoos at the earliest possible date and ascertain definitely whether or not the previous report received is correct.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.

She is my niece, and has been visiting me recently and she is much and favourably impressed with our work in Indian Schools. She is very anxious to teach in a mission school but the fact of her holding only Quebec qualifications might we understand hinder her in this.

I have the honour to report that I have made an investigation of this matter and would report that the school has not been re-opened as the Indians have refused to send their children to school on account of the conduct of the children during the summer holidays. During the last year Miss Kinoshagmeg seem to conduct herself in an upright manner, and was a capable teacher, but it would appear that during the summer holidays she had been living with an Indian at Whitefish Lake in an immoral manner. She gave absolute denial to me of this accusation by the Indians, stating that it was false, but I knew that after the school closed for the summer holidays she did not return to her home in Tremikong. She was willing to return to the school but the Indians refused to send any of the children to school on account of her misconduct, but on questioning all the Indians regarding her conduct there did not seem to be any of them who would actually swear that she was living an immoral life, and I am led to believe that the Indians are more to blame than the teacher.\n\nI have now learned that Miss Kinoshagmeg has now been removed to the Indian women's hospital at Leech Lake against her will, and therefore, the appointment of a new teacher will be necessary without delay. I regret that this has come to my knowledge.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nWhitfish Lake,\nMackton, Ont.\nSept 30, 1937\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to inform you that I am not teaching here anymore although I was appointed to do so last spring. The Indian agent was very pleased with the way I was doing my work.\n\nThe Indians are ready to begin my work this year but I will not go to see them because I am not sure what they want me to do. They want me to teach them how to read and write. I have been doing this for many years and I believe I can help them.\n\nI have been working hard to get my salary paid. I have been working for many years and I believe I deserve my salary. Teachers who are deprived of their schools are entitled to their years' salary.\n\nI did my work well and the things that he accused me of\nwere just what someone who told me told him they are very personal and have no connection at all with my teaching.\n\nI had and still have some debts to pay from. I don't know what resources I'm going to use for this month and indeed it only as pay me off for what I've been doing quite a bit of money here preparing to open my school.\n\nShe did the best she could even tell you last year about how I had to buy practically everything for the school. She couldn't get me anything. I had to supply even such articles as pencils. Hope this will make you understand why I have spent that cheque paying for bills and also why I think I have a right to my salary.\n\nIf he had told me last spring that I was not to teach here again\nI might have gone to work and applied for some other school.\n\nI got married last week and now I am free for all work. I am trained to be a teacher and have no idea of housework and cooking so could not very well go out and work in that line.\n\nPlease consider this application and let me have an answer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary Kinschamay\n(Mrs. P.

In order that Miss Sullivan would not suffer undue hardship for the want of articles to cook her food, and a comfortable bed, I immediately made a purchase of the most necessary articles required and delivered them to the school which I hope will meet with the approval of the Department, the total cost being $55.47, and I enclose receipted vouchers in my favour for the above amount. On my return to Sudbury from the Reserve I had only thirty minutes to purchase these articles as all stores close at six o'clock so was forced to procure them where most convenient.\n\nAs the teacher is in need of the undermentioned articles for classroom use I would ask the Department to forward these articles to her address, Naughton, P.O. at an early date, if possible, and in the meantime a requisition will go forth to the Department for all articles she may find necessary for her classroom work,- 5 dz.

You agreed that if the school could be built without cost to the Department, it would be in order to go ahead.\n\nThe Indians are all employed at the Brunne Co. mill-site, a distance of approximately 20 miles from Whitefish Lake village and the old school. You will also recall that I told you that the old school is badly in need of repair, in fact, would need a new foundation and joice. Besides, there would not be one pupil to attend school there.\n\nI held a meeting of the Indians and it was unanimously agreed that Mr. Brunne would furnish the lumber and the Indians would supply the labour. It is expected that the school will be completed for October 1st and Miss Kelly has been informed of the change and has agreed to continue as teacher of the Lake Penache school.\n\nI visited Lake Penache with Mr. ArNeill, Inspector, and Dr. Faulkner yesterday. They will be able to give you any further details. Of course, the blackboards and seats will have to be moved to the new school. The building will remain intact. The Indians have all built new homes at Lake Penache, which is, I think, a very good thing. This should improve their health greatly, living in cleaner quarters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

A. Marley,\nSuperintendent\nSturgeon Falls Indian Agency.\n19-8-1\n\nOttawa, May 27, 1948.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO FILE:\n\nWHITEFISH LAKE (R.O.) INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nI was only able to visit this school on a Sunday and therefore it was not in operation.\n\nTEACHER\n\nMrs. Petahtagoose has a first class certificate and has had 5 years' experience. She seems a bright and capable enough teacher and is definitely interested in her pupils. She has a large family herself and at times seems more interested in her family than in the school. She has made her classroom attractive and is quite keen to learn of new methods and on the whole would seem to be satisfactory. She lives with her husband in a small house near the school.\n\nBUILDING\n\nThis is a temporary structure which is gradually being converted into a permanent one. It has now been covered with insul brick and is beginning to look attractive. The inside is covered with Ten Test and is in need of a coat of paint in order to help brighten the inside. Mr. Marleau is planning small teacher's quarters and cloak-room for the back of the building. As the structure has no basement or furnace it departs greatly from our standard plan. However, it will serve the needs of these Indians, particularly in view of the fact that the mill has now closed down. Therefore there is a possibility that some of these Indians or all of them may move away.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSUPT.
