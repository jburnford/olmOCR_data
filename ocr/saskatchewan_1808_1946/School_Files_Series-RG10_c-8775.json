You will note that this tumbler which we are quoting you on is equipped with its own motor and we would suggest placing it in the room next to the present washroom.\n\nWe have figured on steam heated Flatwork Ironer, having one roll 66\" long 14\" in diameter and operating in a concave steam heated chest. This machine will be driven by its own motor and can be placed either in the same room as the Drying Tumbler or in the one next to it.\n\nWe have also figured on the Boiler having 8 H.P., which we estimate would be sufficient to supply the steam required for our machines, dish washer and a coil for heating water in your storage tank.\nF.

PARKS & CO.\n\nPer..................................\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nDuring the last year I have called the attention of the various Department Inspectors who visited the school to the condition of the school laundry, and pointed out the unsatisfactory conditions under which the girls are doing the laundry work as well as the state of the present equipment, and its inadequacy for doing the work.\n\nI find that the gearing of the present washers is badly worn, and also of the extractor. There is no flatwork ironer provided, and all the ironing must be done by hand. The three stoves for heating the present laundry work are a fire hazard and also cannot be used to do satisfactory work. The flue drafts have never been successfully controlled so that the laundry is filled with smoke whenever the stoves are lighted, and this smoke spreads up to the upper floors causing considerable damage to the walls of the building.\n\nAs a number of our girls are under tubercular treatment only the stronger pupils can be given the laundry work, and it is imperative that the work be lightened for them as much as possible. At the present time about three days a week are used in completing the laundering. It is also necessary for sanitary reasons that the clothing be well washed\u2014which at present is practically impossible.\n\nSome time ago you suggested that I make an estimate of the cost of installing necessary machinery for the consideration of the Department. Accordingly I requested Mr Parks to make an estimate of the cost, which Mr Parks has already forwarded to you.\n\nI will esteem it a favour if you will take the matter up with the Department at your earliest convenience with a view to action in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the Quarterly Return for the Kootenay Indian Residential School for the quarter ended March 31, 1931, which I trust will be found in order.\n\nI also beg to enclose a letter from the Reverend Principal and quotations furnished by Messrs F. Parks & Company of Cranbrook of the cost of new equipment for the School laundry. These I would respectfully recommend for consideration by the Department.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S.

In reply I have to inform you it is regretted that there are no funds at the present time for this improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S.

EUGENE SCHOOL\n\nnear Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nby\n\nW. C. Warren.\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 4, 1931.\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 4, 1931.\n\nSir: Re - St.Eugene School (near Cranbrook)\nWater Supply.\n\nFollowing your instructions, investigations of a suitable supply for St.Eugene School were continued along the lines suggested in my report number 254, dated June 25, 1930.\n\nSYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS REPORT\n\nSt.Mary's river and St.Joseph's creek are the most readily available sources of supply. St.Joseph's creek, however, is very badly contaminated throughout the year.\n\nThe St.Mary's river water was found, after investigations extending over a year, to be contaminated for about one-half of the year, with the probability of an increase in the degree of pollution in the future. It was concluded that only in the event of failure to secure a suitable supply from underground sources should the St.Mary's be developed.\n\nSUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\nSince the submission of that report an underground supply has been located on the school property at an approximate distance of three-quarters of a mile from the school buildings. While it may have been possible to secure a similar supply in closer proximity to the school, the possibility of contamination through seepage from St.Joseph's creek had to be considered.\n\nC.F.Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\n759 Hastings Street, West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThis prospective source of supply provides a flow of approximately 25 g.p.m., sufficient for all domestic requirements. Tests of the water bacteriologically and chemically found it suitable in all respects for domestic use.\n\nThe springs rise at a lower elevation than where the school is situated and although it is possible to provide a gravity flow to within three hundred feet of the school, pumping would be necessary to service the school.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION\n\nThis source of supply can not readily be developed to provide for fire protection for the following reasons. The delivery from the springs is so small that storage to the extent of approximately 60,000 gallons would be necessary to provide for minimum requirements, which for such an institution should be a rate of flow of 500 gal. per minute for a period of 2 hours. Such a large amount of storage is not very desirable for domestic purposes, especially so as the average rate of use does not exceed 4000 gals. per day, and as all water in this area has a slight alkalinity, short storage periods are most desirable.\n\nIn view of the limited rate of flow of these springs investigations were extended to a consideration of procuring an additional supply for fire protection from either St. Joseph's creek by gravity, or from the St. Mary's river by an auxiliary pumping plant. The system to be adopted for this purpose will,\nto a large extent, control the design of the system for supplying domestic requirements.\n\nDEVELOPMENT FOR DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY\n\nNeglecting the problem of fire protection for the moment a suitable supply of water for domestic use may be developed by making use of the present plant at an estimated outlay of $5660.00.\n\nIn this development the water would be conveyed from the springs by pipe line to a storage reservoir of 5000 gals. capacity at point on the suction line of the present system from which it would be pumped as required. The cost of a new engine is included as the present one is worn out and is not of a type which may economically be rebuilt.\n\nThis system would work satisfactorily for some years, or until such time as the pneumatic tank or the suction line would have to be replaced. As these are buried at an average depth of 13 feet below ground surface, it is not possible to determine with any degree of accuracy their present condition. The least expenditure, however, would be incurred by adopting this system.\n\nEstimate of cost of proposed development is attached marked Appendix I. Plan of development and profile of pipe line are included under Appendix II.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF GRAVITY SUPPLY FROM ST. JOSEPH'S CREEK FOR FIRE PROTECTION\n\nThe cost of developing a gravity supply from St. Joseph's Creek for fire protection in conjunction with the system for domestic supply from the springs has been estimated at $27,527.00.\nThe present equipment consisting of pneumatic tanks, compressor, etc., would be made use of for the purpose of supplying domestic needs, the same system being adopted as is at present in use. Suitable housing, however, would be provided for this equipment.\n\nThe system for fire protection would consist of a reservoir in the creek bed of approximately 100,000 gal. capacity, and a pipe line slightly over a mile in length with a head of 135 feet, which would deliver 500 g.p.m. continuously at a hydrant pressure of 45 lbs.\n\nThe reservoir is necessary, although the flow of the creek does not fall below 500 g.p.m., the rate required for fire protection, to avoid possibility of interference with other users during the irrigation season.\n\nTwo standard two-way outside hydrants are provided with suitable shelters, hose and equipment, and in addition one inside hydrant with hose and hose rack would be installed on each floor of the school building.\n\nIncluded in this estimate is an amount of $1200.00 for development of power from the pipe line during the non-irrigation period. The purpose of the power installation is for pumping the domestic supply, and it would in addition provide for school lighting for the greater part of the year.\n\nThis power development could only be made possible by the adoption of the gravity system, as otherwise it would be uneconomical to install.\nPlan and profiles of pipe lines as well as detailed estimate of cost are attached hereto, marked Appendix II.\n\nThere is, however an impediment to the immediate development of this project owing to the existence of a record for the development of power. While there are also prior rights for irrigation purposes, these are all held by the school or for the benefit of the school.\n\nNegotiations have been instituted with the holder of this power record for the relinquishment to the school of prior rights to sufficient water to fill the requirements for fire protection. Should it not be possible to affect such an arrangement, the projected development would be undesirable.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF SUPPLY FROM ST.MARY'S RIVER FOR FIRE PROTECTION PURPOSES.\n\nThe cost of developing a system capable of providing for fire protection requirements from St.Mary's river together with the system for domestic use from the springs is estimated at $21,110.00.\n\nThis development would provide for the accumulation of 10,000 gals. of spring water at a low elevation to be pumped to a higher elevation for a gravity supply to the school. Storage at the reservoir would be about 15,000 gals., sufficient for daily requirements and a reserve available for emergency. To provide for fire protection an additional pump of 500 g.p.h. capacity would be installed with its intake in the St.Mary's river.\nThe present pump would be used for supplying domestic requirements. Duplicate pipe lines would be laid as far as the school to avoid the possibility of the domestic supply being contaminated by that from the St. Mary's river.\n\nThe pump house to shelter both sets of equipment would be located one-quarter mile from the school.\n\nPlan, profile and estimate of cost are attached, marked Appendix III.\n\nCOMPARISON OF SYSTEMS\n\nIn submitting these two proposals for consideration an attempt was made to maintain as nearly as possible, the same standard for each service.\n\nThis has been maintained in the domestic supply but in the case of the supply for fire protection, the service would not be quite on the same basis of comparison. Whereas the gravity supply could be maintained indefinitely at full capacity, the pressure is limited to 45 lbs. at the hydrant. The service is, however, available instantly and would fill all requirements for fire protection, except possibly in the case of a high wind.\n\nIn the case of the pumping plant, it is of necessity located at a considerable distance from the school. To offset this, however, storage has been arranged to provide for the time lost in placing the fire pump in operation. The pumping plant would have an equal rate of flow to that of the gravity system but would deliver at 60 lbs. hydrant pressure when in operation.\nIt will be noted that without considering capital cost and depreciation that the gravity system would show a saving of about $400.00 per year to the institution over the pumping plant installation, due to its ability to take care of the pumping and electric light load for from 8 to 9 months in the year.\n\nA comparative statement of carrying charges, depreciation and operating expenses is attached, marked Appendix IV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFor such an institution where adult assistance is limited, the absence of one individual required to operate a pump in the event of a fire would be a considerable handicap. In all, it is considered that the gravity system would prove the more suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. G.

This report is supplementary to the one dated June 25, 1930, sent you on July 4th last. From the report herewith you will note that a spring satisfactory for domestic supply has been discovered and that a system furnishing water from this spring for domestic purposes only can be constructed at an estimated outlay of $6,560. Additional water for fire protection may be obtained either from St. Joseph's Creek or from the St. Mary river. The former may be obtained by gravity and the estimated cost of developing a gravity supply from St. Joseph's Creek for fire protection in conjunction with the system for domestic supply from the springs is $27,527. The cost of constructing a system capable of providing for fire protection from St. Mary river together with the system for domestic from the springs is estimated at $21,110. This latter system involves pumping the water from the river.\n\nIt is to be noted that a small power development using a 3 kilowatt generator, is possible with the gravity supply, which may be operated when water is available during the non-irrigation period.\n\nThe development of the gravity supply for fire protection is contingent upon acquiring a satisfactory water right on St. Joseph's Creek for this purpose. A prior licence exists at the moment for power purposes on St. Joseph's Creek at the site of proposed dam but no development has been done. It is possible the power licensee may waive his power right at this point. Negotiations in regard to priority of water licence are proceeding.\n\nMr. Webb states that a copy of this report has been sent to Mr. Ditchburn, and I shall be glad to have your further instructions in regard to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Water supply for Cranbrook School.\n\nIn connection with the report of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau in regard to the installation of a domestic water system as well as one for fire fighting purposes for the Cranbrook School, which report no doubt you have perused by this time, I beg to say that a few days ago I had a visit from Reverend Father Patterson, the Principal of the School, and allowed him to read the report which takes into consideration the following proposals:\n\n1. Underground supply for domestic use only... $5,600.00\n\n2. Domestic supply together with a gravity system from St. Joseph's Creek................. 27,527.00\n\n3. Domestic supply together with a pumped supply from St. Mary's River for fire protection................................. 21,111.00\n\nAt the moment I was more favorably inclined to the third proposal, but in view of the fact that the Reverend Principal stated there was great need for other work being done on the school this year such as new fencing and painting, repairs to the barn and new laundry equipment which will run into a considerably large sum, I have now come to the opinion that for the time being the best thing to do would be to concentrate on obtaining a first-class domestic water supply at the estimated cost of $5,600.00 and while fire protection service is extremely important, in the interests of the health of the pupils, I realize it would be very difficult indeed for the Department to obtain sufficient money during the coming fiscal year to put in one of the more expensive water systems as well as giving attention to the needs of the exterior of the building and the laundry.\n\nThe Reverend Principal was to write me setting forth just what he had in view in connection with these extra works as well as giving me some idea of the estimated cost thereof, but I thought it advisable to write you at once dealing particularly with the proposal to install an adequate domestic water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B./KD.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5 part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Date   | DESCRIPTION                  | Folio | Credits | Debits | Total |\n|--------|------------------------------|-------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Feb. 28| 20 lights double glass 20 x 20 | 7887  |         | 24 00  |       |\n|        | 4 lights D.D.

A report as to other repairs necessary at the school will be forwarded shortly.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"F.S. Ryckman\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to my letter, addressed to the Department, dated March 26th ultimo, file 30/5/20658, in regard to the report of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, on the matter of a potable water supply for Kootenay Indian Residential School, at Cranbrook, B.C., and in this connection to transmit herewith copy of a letter received today from Mr. Indian Agent Ryckman, dated April 5th, file 11/426, by which the Department will note that the Reverend Principal and the Agent have agreed that the Department should consider the installation of a domestic supply only during the present year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLAUNDRY:\n\nClothes to be washed are at present boiled in containers. This is more or less of a homemade system. There are fires under each container. The smoke from these fires is supposed to be carried into an old furnace system. This system is defective, and as a result smoke makes its way right through the school.\n\nThe equipment of the laundry is obsolete. The two washing machines, driven by electric power, are now worn out. The replacement of the gears, now worn out, is not warranted by the condition of the rest of the plant.\n\nThe extractor has been in use for a number of years, and is now worn out.\n\nThere is no ironer for flat work. The ironing work is far too heavy for the number of children available. A number of the children at this school are in a very delicate state, and are quite unfit for this sort of work. This puts too great a strain on the few available.\n\nThe drier in use is a hot air homemade appliance. It is quite impossible to dry clothes with it.\n\nI wish to recommend that two washers, one extractor, one flat work ironer, one drying tumbler, and one vertical boiler for the necessary steam pressure be supplied to the school. A careful estimate has been prepared by F. Parks & Co of Cranbrook. This is now in the hands of the Indian Agent. This estimate calls for a total expenditure of $6107 with a $300 rebate on the present equipment, leaving a net cost estimated at $5807.\n\nThe laundry is in my opinion far too dark. Several new windows should be constructed.\nWater Supply:\n\nAt present the domestic supply of water is obtained from a small spring, which is liable to contamination. The bugs carry the water in buckets from this spring about 400 yards to the school. This water is used for drinking. St. Mary's River supplies the remainder of the domestic water. This is obtained through a pumping plant. The engine which works the pump requires renewal. It is quite worn out. There have been two break-downs in the last month.\n\nIt is vital that a proper supply of domestic water be supplied. I went into the whole question with the Indian Agent, and have read the Report prepared by Mr Warren on this matter. I personally examined the new springs, which have been located above the school. These have been cleared out a little more since Mr Warren's visit. He I think estimated the flow as 25 gallons per minute. I think that now that the main spring has been cleared the flow is nearer 50 gallons per minute. The water simply boils up in the spring from the rock to a height of about 8 feet through fine sand. If this water were piped down to below the school on the St Mary's River side, it could be pumped to the school through the existing pipe line. This pipe line is buried to a depth of seven or eight feet and I do not know what condition it is in.\n\nTo protect the school from a serious fire, it would be necessary to have a supply of water from some other source, and this has been fully dealt with in Mr Warren's Report. If I may be permitted to do so, I should like to say that the less expensive scheme of pumping the water from the St Mary River appears to me to be the better of the two plans. Though the question of fire protection is of course important, it is vital that the school be supplied at the earliest moment with an adequate domestic supply.\n\nLIGHT:\n\nThe electric light engine has been overhauled during the last year. It is a 15 H.P. Otto, and with the attached dynamo is now in good condition.\n\nThe light supplied to the school is poor. This is due to the fact that the batteries need to be renewed. They will not hold a charge. I wish to recommend that new batteries be supplied this summer. The old batteries are now in use for the past three years.\n\nHEATING:\n\nThis is by a hot water system. The system is working well. The fire brick in the furnace needs to be renewed, as the bricks are quite burned out.\n\nPAINTING:\n\nThe exterior woodwork of the school needs repainting. This of course would be a contract matter. If the funds now available for repairs at this school are low, I should think that the painting might be postponed for another year.\nOttawa, May 8, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn March, 1930, you supplied six Thermene fire extinguishers for the use of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. It will now be necessary to have these extinguishers recharged, and I have to request that you will arrange to forward, charges prepaid, addressed to Rev. J. M. Patterson, O.M.I., Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C., six chemical refills for these extinguishers.\n\nThese recharges should be supplied at the lowest price charged this Department, and your account, in duplicate, covering the cost F.O.B. Cranbrook, should be forwarded to P. S. Ryckman, Esq., Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C. He is being informed of the order placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the recharges, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Co. of Canada Ltd.,\n1197-1207 King St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, May 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to the six Thermene fire extinguishers which were supplied for the use of the Kootenay Indian Residential School in March, 1930, I have to inform you that it will be necessary to have these extinguishers refilled with new chemical charges. The Department is today placing an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd., Toronto, to forward, addressed to the Principal, Rev. J. M.

Cranbrook, B.C. When you are assured that they have been received, you should certify the account and send it promptly to the Department for payment.\n\nPlease inform the Principal of the order placed for these recharges, and he should see that they are placed in the extinguishers, and the extinguishers placed in condition, ready for immediate use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

April 29th, 1931\n\nMr. F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nSome time ago I drew the attention of the Department to the condition of the fencing on the farm property belonging to the school. I have made an estimate since, of the approximate amount of fencing as well as the cost required for the proper fencing of the livestock enclosures:\n\n- 300 rods Hog wiring .....4d cents per rod.....$138.00\n- 18 rolls Barbed wire $4.50 per roll.......$1.00\n- 3000 ft 1x12 lumber $29.00 per m. .......$7.00\n- 1000 ft dimension lumber for gates..............$1.00\n- 10 only gate hinges $1.25 pair.............$12.50\n\nTotal $349.50\n\nYou will note that the above estimate does not include any figures for the reconstruction of the garden and lawn fencing, as we would not be able to do the work this year, and we have not decided just what sort of fence we will put there. It does include, however, all fencing necessary to keep our stock properly inclosed and our fields protected from other stock. All work necessary is to be done by our regular farm staff.\n\nI will be glad to have you submit this estimate to the Department for their favorable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise the Department that Mr. Indian Agent Beckman of the Kootenay Agency, Cranbrook, B.C., has forwarded to me a letter received by him from the Reverend Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, dated April 29th, the same being transmitted herewith to the Department for consideration. The Principal asks that the sum of $349.50 be appropriated by the Department for the purchase of wire, lumber and hinges to be used for the purpose of fencing for the enclosure of livestock on the school property and will be self-explanatory as to details.\n\nIt is recommended that if possible the requisition be favorably considered by the Department and the purchase of the material authorized from the School Vote.\n\nIt will be noted that the Reverend Principal points out that if the material is provided all the necessary work is to be done by the regular farm staff, this being understood to mean that there will be no charge against the Department for labor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

An item will, however, be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year to provide for the cost of the fencing required at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Ryckman\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe recently made an inspection of the batteries just shipped to the Mission Industrial School and beg to report the following.\n\nThe batteries when shipped were improperly packed and the electrolyte has spilled over in every crate. It is a total loss and will have to be replaced.\n\nThe battery lugs were left projecting thru the top of crates and when the crates were stacked the jars in twenty six of the units were broken beyond repair.\n\nIn the broken jars the plates have already a coating of sulphate which will be difficult to remove.\n\nWe have not the prices immediately available to use in arriving at the cost of putting these batteries in shape. We sincerely believe that it would too expensive as the resulting batteries would be far from first class shape.\n\nWe also examined the bank of batteries now in use at the school, and find the following.\n\nThe electrolyte has a specific gravity of only 1050. It should be when charged 1280.\n\nThe plates are in very good condition although they have suffered a great deal of abuse.\n\nThe unit is not cleanly kept nor is it dry. This results in a leakage which accounts for the inability of the persons in charge to keep the batteries charged.\n\nThe electrolyte being so weak will not allow the batteries to attain their full voltage or amperage after being placed on charge. This means that the assembly is only working at about half capacity all the time and results in very unsatisfactory operation.\n\nWe respectfully advise that the electrolyte be changed in the batteries now in use and the same being brought up to full charge. This we feel confident would give the school a very fair set of batteries and would be better and cheaper than attempting to repair the damaged ones.\n\nThere is also some wiring to be replaced on the battery rack which is necessary to efficient operation of the plant.\n\nWe would be pleased to give you an estimate on this work and will give you it as soon as we receive prices on the required acid.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5 part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV.

The bread baking oven needs renewing. It smokes badly, and is really worn out, being 18 years old. The laundry too, requires an overhaul and some more modern machinery installed. There are only hand irons for use. This might be alright in an ordinary school, but in this case where so many of the children are sickly and not able to do heavy work, and with the additional extra care required as regards cleanliness, labour-saving machinery is necessary. The laundry also smokes badly, and the drying machine does not work. Temporary attempts have been made to rectify this, but so far, without success. I suggested the heightening of the chimney by a tall stack with a draft device be tried to see if this might rectify matters.\n\nThe drinking water supply and fire protection systems are, I understand, still under consideration. The Principal, and according to my knowledge I am inclined to agree with him, advocates the gravity system, from springs and St Joseph's Creek, instead of St Mary's River.\n\nGeo. S.

They were purchased from the Canadian West Electric Limited, Regina, and consisted of one complete EL3 Manchester Chloride Battery, consisting of 56 complete cells and Electrolyte, Hydrometer, Thermometer, Socket Wrenches and Weston Portable Voltmeter. This battery was in use at the above school until January, 1931. I enclose herewith the Way Bill covering shipment of this battery from Duck Lake.\n\nWhen you have ascertained the amount of damage to the battery, you should make claim against the Railway Company. For your information I may say that the Principal of the Duck Lake School was instructed to obtain the services of a competent man to assist the engineer at the School to properly prepare and pack the battery for shipment, and the Principal assured us that the packing and all the work was done properly and carefully.\n\nIn any event, whether the Railway Company makes good the damage or not, it will be necessary to place these batteries in good order for use at the Kootenay School, and I have to request that you will advise the Department as to what repairs are required and the approximate cost of same, when consideration will be given to authorizing having the work carried out, and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A cheque in payment will be forwarded, in due course, to the Pyrene Manufacturing Company, who supplied these refills.\n\nRegarding refills for any other extinguishers on hand, it is noted the Principal requests that these be supplied during the holidays, in order that they will be in good condition for the winter months.

If any further refills are required, the Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase of the necessary chemicals.

Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nMay 28, 1931.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: St. Mary's School, Mission,\nWater Supply.\n\nAn inspection was made of the reservoir of the above mentioned water system on the 24th of May. I found that repairs had been effected to the leak in the reservoir by the school authorities but that a leak was occurring through the creek bank above the reservoir which would not allow it to fill completely.\n\nAs I was unable to see the Principal of the school at the time of my visit, I interviewed Mr. M. Purcell who has charge of the system and under whose supervision repairs to the reservoir were carried out. He stated that the probable cause of the leak was the presence of poor ground at a point about two feet up from the bed of the reservoir and in close proximity to a large tree. This poor material as well as the tree root was removed and the locality refilled with good material and tamped down. Mr. Purcell informed me of another leak above the reservoir of which he stated he was aware and also that he expected to repair the leak shortly.\n\nSo long as there is sufficient water for the use of the school services no damage is likely to occur as a result of such leaks. The volume of water stored is not large and there is sufficient drainage to take care of such occurrences. The material in which the reservoir was excavated has held water successfully for over twenty years with very small loss, if any. It has been owing to the enlargement of the original pond and the breaking into new ground that resulted in uncovering the weak spots in the soil. Since these have been remedied as they have occurred, at very small cost, there is no reason to suppose that the reservoir will not hold water successfully.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.C.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe are presenting herewith our estimate on repairing\nthe damaged Batteries recently shipped to the Kootenay Residential\nSchool.\n\nWe would undertake to bring these batteries to Cranbrook\nreplace all broken jars, supply new electrolyte and new separators.\nThe batteries would be cleaned throughout and all warped plates\nstraightened.\n\nThe batteries would then be given a complete charge\nand tested both electrically and mechanically. All cells would\nbe brought to the same charge level and the units returned for\ninstallation.\n\nThe cost of this work would amount to Six Hundred and\nEighty Eight Dollars. ($688.00) This does not include the\ninstallation but only the required repairs.\n\nThe wiring from the switchboard to the batteries is in\nvery poor shape and requires renewing. Also the rack upon which\nthe present batteries rest may prove too small for the new\nbatteries. In this event a new rack would be required. We estimate\nthat the cost of properly installing the new batteries would\napproximate One Hundred and Twenty Eight Dollars including a new\nrack.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 824-5 part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 155-0-5 of June 2, 1931, and telegram dated June 6, 1931, with reference to the shipment of 28 crates of wet storage batteries from Duck Lake, Sask., to the Reverend Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, on May 5, 1931, and which reached the school in a badly damaged condition.\n\nA great deal of difficulty has been experienced in obtaining prices on glass jars to replace those broken, owing to the batteries having been purchased, or rather manufactured, in the United States. The size of the jars was different than any manufactured in Canada, and these had to be of the proper size and shape in order to accommodate the plates. The information contained in the Department's telegram of June 6th enabled Mr. Ward of the Modern Electric, Cranbrook, to eventually get quotations, and I am now in receipt of his estimate of the cost of repairs necessary to put the batteries in good working order. This I beg to enclose herewith.\n\nI would respectfully call the attention of the Department to Mr. Ward's estimate of the cost of installing the batteries. I have examined the wiring referred to and would strongly recommend that it be renewed. It is in very bad shape and is likely to cause short circuits.\n\nI beg to report that, acting on the Department's instructions, I have today made claim against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for the full amount of the cost of repairs to the batteries as submitted by Mr. Ward, viz., $688.00.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 11/615 of the 19th ultimo, with reference to the batteries for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. You may have Mr. Ward make the necessary repairs and put the batteries in good working condition. You may also have him properly install the new batteries, providing new wiring from the switch board and a new rack, if necessary. His estimates of $688 for the repairs and $128 for the installation should not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S.

In transit, there was considerable breakage, and the Department is making a claim against the transportation company for the cost of the repairs, viz.: $685. The batteries have been examined by J. A. Ward, electrical contractor, of Cranbrook, B.C. They will have to be repaired and properly installed.

I have tried with it, and the mechanics who repaired it last state that it is worn out and should be replaced.

Parks & Company, of Cranbrook, will furnish this office with a quotation within a few days and I will then forward it on to you.\"\n\nWhen writing to Mr. Ryckman on the 24th ultimo regarding this matter I pointed out to him that while I was much inclined to the opinion that funds would not be available this year to make the necessary purchase, still when he obtained a definite quotation for the oven and submitted it to me, I would take the matter up with you. I am glad to receive further communication from Agent Ryckman in which he encloses a quotation from Parks & Company, of Cranbrook, dated the 15th instant, quoting a price of $280.00 f.o.b. Cranbrook Bake Oven 6 x 3 feet, delivered as f.o.b. Cranbrook, freight, carriage and crating being extra. While no mention is made of the condition of this bake oven in the report of District School Inspector Barry, dated the 24th and 27th March last, apparently there is great need for the old oven being replaced by a new one, and if it is at all possible to provide funds for this purpose, I would strongly recommend that a new oven should be purchased and installed in the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 4)\nOttawa, September 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/5/22202 of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the bake oven at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.

S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nGranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your claim of 16th June, $689.00, account damage to shipment described as:\n\n- 20 crates wet storage batteries (Second Hand)\n- 1 box fittings\n\nMade by Indian School, Duck Lake, Sask., 5th May, consigned to Rev. J. M. Patterson, Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook.\n\nThere is no question as to the existence and extent of damage, as this has been confirmed by inspection made initially by our Cranbrook Agent, Mr. Noir, but subsequently by joint inspection by Mr. Noir and myself on the 11th July, on which date you were away from home.\n\nHowever, the position carriers must take is that the damage was not due to any act of commission or omission on their part.\n\nMy investigation reveals that the shipment was well braced in car at Duck Lake, and report of Salgar upon arrival, Calgary, indicates: \"Jars well braced - good job done,\" that bracing was intact, but that all crates were more or less leaking. On account of this condition this Company at first refused to accept shipment, but upon representation of Principal of Indian School at Duck Lake and his written request of Agent at that point that shipment be permitted to go forward at owner's risk, prepaid, we eventually accepted it and carried it to destination. On arrival at Cranbrook my information is that the car was well sealed and well braced, the bracing being intact and in its original position.\n\nAs you know, the jars were not equipped with tops, with the result that the acid would spash out from the ordinary oscillation of car, and the loss of acid from the jars would more readily permit the plates to strike and break jars.\n\nMy information, obtained from shippers who have handled this same style of jar, is that they would not think of shipping the jars and plates together, that is, the plates enclosed in jars, as in this case, but would ship the jars separate from the plates.\n\nFor all the above reasons I do not believe it can be consistently maintained that the damage was due to any rough or improper handling on the part of carriers, in view of which I must respectfully decline your claim.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"F. E. Clarke\"\n\nFreight Claim Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nDepartmental letter 185-6-5, June 2, 1931.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received today from F.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret very much that there has been a delay in the installation of our domestic supply of water, and that, on account of the lateness of the season the work may be delayed till spring.\n\nThe installation of a suitable sanitary supply of water is an absolute necessity in this school as the spring from which we have been carrying water daily is used by a number of people and the number is increasing every year. After every shower of rain the water cannot be used and a supply must be secured from the springs three-quarters of a mile distant. It is difficult for me to ask the people to send their children to the school as long as this condition lasts.\n\nI wish to point out too, that our pumping engine in present use is worn out, as was stated in Mr Webb's report, many small repairs had to be made to it last term and in all probability it will not last through the winter. If it breaks down through the winter a serious situation would arise, as our heating system as well as our water supply depends on the proper functioning of the water pumping engine. I would urge the Department to install a new engine without delay.\n\nTrusting that you will bring this matter to the attention of the Department at your earliest convenience, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, with reference to the domestic water supply for the school, and requesting that a new pumping engine be installed at an early date.\n\nI beg to submit that this matter was not reported on previously because it was thought the contract would be awarded this fall to install a new domestic water system, but as it is now too late to have the work done before the winter sets in, I would respectfully recommend that a new engine be installed in the very near future if funds are available for that purpose. As the Reverend Principal points out in his letter, the engine now in use is in very bad shape and is likely to break down at any time.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOct. 26, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to your letters of the 25th and 26th ultimo with reference to a pumping engine required for the St. Eugene Indian Residential School at Cranbrook. The Department has been advised that this engine should be installed as soon as possible, and I would therefore ask you to instruct Mr. Webb to have this engine installed immediately, same to be purchased from the firm recommended in his letter, that is the B. G. Equipment Co., at their tendered price of $455.00.\n\nTo date the necessary Order in Council has not been passed authorizing the installation of the new water system, but as soon as same is received you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nFor Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nOct. 28, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the domestic water supply at the St. Eugene Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Dominion Water Power Branch have today been instructed to purchase the new pumping engine and have same installed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. Le Maclean\nFOR SECRETARY.\n\nS. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nRe: Tenders for Water Supply at St. Eugene Indian School.\n\nWith reference to the tenders which were called in August last for the proposed water supply for the St. Eugene Indian school, Mr. Webb suggests that the deposit cheques of the firms which tendered, still held by him, should be returned.\n\nAs stated in my letter of the 14th instant, the DeWolfe and Ham Construction Company had asked for the return of their deposit of $550, which Mr. Webb has done. The other two tender are A. E. Jones and Sainsbury and Ryan, both of Cranbrook, their deposits amounting to $440. and $615 respectively.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 28th instant with reference to the pumping engine required for the St. Eugene Indian Residential School at Cranbrook, and have sent a copy to Mr. Webb with instructions to arrange for the purchase and installation of the Gilson engine to be supplied by the B. C. Equipment Company at their tender price of $456.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Webb's letter of September 17th that the cost of installation will be about $100 additional to the price of the engine, and I have asked Mr. Webb to advise me when an advance will be required on account of this order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Drain to boiler has been reduced to 1/2\" pipe, busted down from 1/2\" opening. That is a very poor arrangement.\n\nInspector...\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report submitted by Mr. J. B. Tait, Inspector of Boilers for B.C., voucher No. 735 for $10.00 in favour of the Chief Inspector of Boilers, Vancouver, and voucher No. 736 for $172.15 in favour of the Cranbrook Foundry & Machine Shops, Cranbrook, covering travelling expenses and Inspection fees and repairs to Boilers at Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to submit that before an Inspection could be made it was necessary to cut holes in the boilers, and these holes had to be repaired later. Mr. Inspector Tait recommended certain repairs, as mentioned in his report, and as it was necessary to have these made before any heat could be turned on in the school building, the Reverend Principal carried out the instructions and had the repairs made. I can find no authority in the office as to the Inspection of the school boilers, but the Reverend Principal has a letter dated April 29, 1927, file No. 1/1/5, addressed to the Reverend Father Lefine who was Principal of the School at that time, in connection with the matter.\n\nI am pleased to report that since the repairs were made the heating plant has been functioning much better than it has for several years, and the Reverend Principal informs me that it has resulted in a decided saving of fuel.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted and I trust will meet with approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Jones contract for water supply system for above school, made up of contract $1475.55 and extras $410.72.\n\nWith reference to this extra $410.72 I am informed by our engineer in charge, under date of November 23rd that the concrete reservoir was poured on November 21st and unfortunately a sudden change in the weather took place, the temperature dropping to ten degrees below zero that night and sub-zero temperature continued until November 25th, which condition destroyed the concrete.\n\nI quote hereunder from Mr. Archibald's letter of November 29th covering this work:\n\n\"On Saturday, Nov. 21st, concrete was poured for the reinforced reservoir. There was no apparent great change in weather conditions from the previous few days but during the night the temperature fell very suddenly to approximately ten degrees below zero, and sub-zero temperatures continued till Wednesday, Nov. 25th.\n\nOn that day I removed portions of the inner form of the reservoir and found that the frost had destroyed the set of the cement.\n\nOn Thursday I gave the contractor a work order to remove the frozen aggregate and as quickly as possible to prepare to reconstruct the reservoir. This work has been done and everything is in readiness for reconstruction when the weather permits.\n\nToday is considerably milder than for the past week, and as there is a report of rain in Alberta I am in hope that there will be a definite break in weather conditions here very soon. Enquiries have shown that such a sudden and severe cold snap at this time of year is almost without precedent, but what has happened proves that it unsafe to initiate a project in this description, in this district, later than October 15th.\"\n\nEnc.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom. Water Power & Hydro. Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nOur latest information is that this reservoir has now been poured under more favourable weather conditions. I sincerely hope that the job will now be satisfactorily completed.\n\nI would recommend, however, in future, that no concrete work be undertaken in the interior during the winter months as there is always the possibility of difficulty such as has arisen on this concrete job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) C. W. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the water supply system now being installed at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith copy of a letter, dated the 10th instant, received from Mr. Webb describing the work which is being carried on there, together with certificate in duplicate covering an interim payment of $1866.27 of which $1475.55 is part of the contract amounting to a total of $4400.00 and $410.72 being extras caused by severe weather destroying newly placed concrete.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

December 21st, 1931\n\nMr. F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am writing to ask the Department to make a small alteration to our ice-house. Besides the small storage room there is need for a small inner chamber constructed so as to be in direct contact with the ice. The construction of this room would cost $65.00 according to an estimate furnished by Mr. A.H. Jones of Cranbrook.\n\nTwo or three years ago, this difficulty of suitable refrigeration was pointed out to Mr. Fragnell, and the suggestion was made to install electric refrigeration. I think, however, that when this small change is made there would be ample refrigeration to protect our meats from spoiling during the school term.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter favorable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Reverend J. M.

I have examined the engine and must say it is a very rough job.\n\n(1) The piston is a very poor fit for the cylinder with a clearance of .015 fifteen thousand undersize which causes a very pronounced piston slap:\n\n(2) The cylinder is a very rough job in the bore far from having the proper finish.\n\n(3) The cylinder head has a small blowhole from the outside to the water jacket causing a small water leak:\n\n(4) The exhaust valve action is very noisy.\n\n(5) The connecting rod large end bearing has a flaw in it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.W. Draper.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nGranbrook, B.C. December 21st, 1931\n\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nGranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am enclosing the letter which I received from the machinist who installed our new water pumping engine. This letter is intended to show the defects of the engine as found by Mr Draper. Mr Draper is the mechanic employed by Mr Jones for the work.\n\nI believe that this engine will not stand the work very long and I am writing to furnish the Department with this information before settlement is made for it.\n\nOn Saturday last, December 19th, Mr Sadd of the B.C. Equipment Company made an inspection of the engine and I think his report will confirm that of Mr Draper.\n\nBesides the defects referred to, the magneto on this engine is wearing rapidly. The pushfinger contact will not stand the constant daily usage, and will necessitate frequent replacement.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nDecember 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential school, and copy of a letter from Mr. C. W. Draper, a mechanic employed by Mr. A. E. Jones, Contractor, with reference to the new Gilson engine recently installed at the school for pumping purposes.\n\nMr. Sadd of the B. C. Equipment Company made a thorough examination of the engine on December 19th, and his report in the matter will, no doubt, be in the hands of Mr. C. E. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Vancouver, shortly.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJan. 12, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letters which have been received from the Indian Agent at Cranbrook with reference to the engine recently installed at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I would ask you to kindly have Mr. Webb investigate and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 12th instant with enclosures with reference to the engine recently installed at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, copies of which have been sent to Mr. Webb.\n\nIn a letter received from Mr. Webb, dated December 11th, he mentioned that the unsatisfactory condition of this engine had been taken up with the B.C. Equipment Company which supplied the engine and that they had undertaken to have the necessary adjustments made.\n\nPayment for the engine is being withheld until it is established that the engine is working satisfactorily and likely to continue to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVancouver, B.

C.E.W.\nSir:\n\nAcknowledgment is made of your letter of the 15th instant, with enclosed correspondence as stated, with reference to the new Gilson engine recently installed in the Kootenay Indian Residential School in connection with the new water supply system.\n\nAs I have already informed you this matter has been under consideration since the report was received of the unsatisfactory condition of the Gilson engine as installed.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances and following consultation with Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn, I have decided not to accept the Gilson engine and have arranged with the B.C. Equipment Company, who supplied it, for its return. In its place the B.C. Equipment Company have kindly offered to furnish a latest type Petter Arnold Diesel 7 H.P. engine. This is a cold starting diesel engine of a new type which was not available when tenders were called for this project.\n\nI have arranged with the B.C. Equipment Company that they will remove the Gilson engine and ship it back to the factory. They will then install the new Petters at a total cost installed, to us, of $750. This work will be carried out at once. The new engine will require a larger exhaust pipe than at present installed. The cost of this item will be in the neighborhood of $30.00.\n\nI will therefore require a further $385. to cover the cost of the purchase and installation of the improved engine. You will of course appreciate that this engine is of a much higher grade than the Gilson engine which is being returned, and is of British manufacture.\n\nI am enclosing a statement showing my account with reference to the installation of engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom.

This step has been taken, as stated, with the approval of Mr. Ditchburn.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Webb asks for a further advance of $385. to cover the cost of the purchase and installation of the improved engine, and if this meets with your approval I shall be obliged if you will arrange for a cheque to be sent to this office for that amount for transmission to Mr. Webb.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the contract for the water supply system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School I am advised by Mr. Webb that he has received a letter, dated the 17th instant, from Mr. A. E. Jones, Contractor, in which he presses for payment of the amount now due to him on this contract.\n\nYou will recall that on the 1st instant I sent you certificate in duplicate signed by Mr. Webb authorizing payment to Mr. Jones of $2992.91. Mr. Webb again recommends that this payment should be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F.

Fire drill is carried out every two weeks and regular inspections of the building are made, the Reverend Principal always making the inspection at midnight.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has given very close attention to fire protection at Kootenay Residential School. I beg to point out, however, that while the school now has a supply of pure spring water for domestic purposes, it is not sufficient for fire protection. Water may be obtained for this purpose from Joseph Creek, as recommended by Mr. Engineer Warren, and I would respectfully recommend that this be done when funds are available for the purpose.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Jones, Cranbrook, B.C., for repairs and addition to ice house at Kootenay Residential School, January, 1932.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 155-0-5 dated January 7, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.S.

It should have accompanied the voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F. Maclean,\nSecretary.\n\nF.S.

E. Jones, Cranbrook, and his account for $65.00 submitted for payment on voucher No. 872.\n\nI beg to submit that there was no contract signed by Mr. Jones in connection with the work done. The Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, requested Mr. Jones to examine the school ice house and give an estimate of the cost of repairs and an addition. This estimate was given, verbally, and on receipt of the Reverend Principal's letter I wrote the Department on December 21, 1932, file 11/1012, requesting authority to have the work done and enclosed a copy of the Reverend Principal's letter. Authority was granted in Departmental letter dated January 7, 1932, file No. 155-0-5.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted and I trust will meet with approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the subject of a small generator for your battery charging which we discussed.\n\nI now have particulars of what we can offer for a complete installation to use with the PETTER Atomic engine you have.\n\nIn order to keep the cost of this within reasonable limits we have put in a used generator which though oversize would be most suitable for your load conditions. The drive would be the \"V\" belt type which we suggested to you, and this would enable you to make a very compact installation close to the engine and away from the possibility of damage by wet from the relief valve on the pump discharge. The items are set out below.\n\nOne-only used Canadian Westinghouse generator, shunt wound 1700 rpm, complete with rails and rheostat.\n\nOne-only \"V\" belt drive with sheaves approx 6\" and 16\" with 3 belts 21/32 x 7/16 on approx 20\" centres\n\nPrice complete delivered fob Cranbrook B.C. ....... $ 225.00\n\nThe bolt-on type of pulley we have quoted on would be easily fitted to the flywheel but it is quite possible that the ordinary type of pulley would be suitable as the three belts will only take up a small amount of room. This latter pulley would be even more easy to fit.\n\nWe can make delivery on this equipment within one week from date of receiving your instructions and hope we may receive your valued order. We would be glad if you will make clear what terms you are considering on this as from your conversation we appreciate that you would ask us to allow you some time to complete payment.\n\nThanking you and assuring you of our best services we are\n\nYours faithfully\n\nB.C.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing correspondence from the B.C. Equipment Co., giving cost of a small generator which I wish to have installed to our new Petter's engine.\n\nThe cost of lighting the school with fuel oil would be less than one half of the cost from gasoline as at present. It would mean a saving estimated at about $90.00 per quarter on our operation costs. The heavier work such as the laundry could be operated with the present engine, which is used for lighting purposes.\n\nDuring the present year it is particularly necessary to reduce operation expenses to a minimum. I would be glad indeed if you would submit this to the Department for their favorable consideration,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, also a letter from F. Russell Sadd of the B.C. Equipment Company, Limited, with reference to the proposed installation of a small generator to be used with the new Petters engine at the school.\n\nI beg to submit that since the Reverend Patterson has been Principal of Kootenay Residential School he has made a number of changes and improvements to the school and outbuildings and fields, changes that have been of great benefit to the school generally, and, as he points out in his letter, it is very necessary to keep down operating expenses, especially for another year or two, and I beg to submit the matter referred to for the earnest consideration of the Department.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

E. Jones, Cranbrook, covering repairs to the ice house at Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith voucher No. 872 and an itemized account submitted by Mr. Jones, which I trust will be found in order.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nApril 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st March, 1932, file No. 155-0-5, with reference to the installing of a small generator for use at Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to submit that the present electric light plant is operating quite satisfactorily, but the cost of operating the larger engine is excessive. By using a small generator a saving of at least $30.00 per month would be made, and I would respectfully submit that it would also result in a direct saving in repairs to the present engine sufficient to pay for the generator in a year or two at most. In addition, owing to the 10% reduction in the per capita grant for the school, it is very necessary that the Reverend Principal keep running expenses reduced to a minimum, and the installation of the small generator would assist greatly in doing so.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. March 24th, 1932\n\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit herewith a list of necessary improvements for our school property with a view to securing the aid of the Department. Many of these improvements can be carried out with school labor, thus it is not necessary for us to supply the labor cost but only the estimate of material required.\n\nSchool Building\n\nLaundry.\n\nAt the present time laundry work is done without adequate facilities. The present equipment is badly worn and entails much labor to handle the ordinary school washing. An estimate of proposed installations was given to the Department during the past year.\n\nFire protection.\n\nIt is recognized that the school now has satisfactory fire protection for the lives of the staff and children. Exits have been provided and sufficient chemicals to give protection, as well as careful patrolling. However the value of the property warrants a much greater system of fire protection. The present chemical system is entirely inadequate for the needs of the building.\n\nTwo alternate proposals for a suitable system have been outlined by the Waterpower and Hydrometric Branch and were submitted to the Department some time ago. One of these called for the securing of power rights on Joseph's Creek. Steps have recently been taken to secure all available power on this creek and we hope to have something definite on the subject during the year.\n\nPainting.\n\nThe exterior of the main school building is badly in need of\npaint. The approximate cost of doing this work is $375.00. There is considerable window and gable work and therefore it would not be advisable to have the work done by the school pupils. This estimate includes therefore, the cost of labor and materials.\n\nEntrance Repairs.\n\nAttention should be directed to the entrances to the basement and side doors on each end of the main building. The steps leading to the basement are constructed of cement and have no overhead protection from water or snow dropping or sliding from the roof. They are protected by guard rails only which are not sufficient, especially in the case of the younger children. Unless these entrances are watched continually while the children are in the recreation grounds there is danger of a serious accident as there is a drop over the guard rails of about ten feet to the cement steps below. The estimated cost of an iron bar guard of sufficient strength for the purpose is approximately $750.00 for both entrances installed. This includes a roof guard over the top to shed water and snow or ice.\n\nIn the winter both entrances to the basement in their present state cannot be used at all.\n\nPainting, Interior\n\nIn order to keep the interior of the building clean and to prevent depreciation it is necessary to do some painting and varnishing every year. Practically all of the basement walls except the dining room need resalting and this would take a supply of salamone estimated to cost approximately $75.00, the work to be done by the school instructors and students.\n\nSchool Desks.\n\nThe desks which are in present use in the junior room are of the double type and should be replaced by single desks for the more efficient handling of pupils. Approximately 40 desks are required.\nSchool Estimates (3)\n\nFarm buildings and grounds.\n\nBarn.\n\nConsiderable alterations and repair work are necessary to the barn as well as painting both the interior and exterior. An estimate of these proposed improvements was forwarded to the Department last year. However if the materials only were supplied I think that this work could now be carried out under the direction of the instructors with the aid of the senior boys. Approximately $500.00 worth of materials would be needed for the work.\n\nPoultry and piggery houses.\n\nThe present poultry house is large enough for only 50 birds. It is much desired to have a total of 200 birds for the use of the school. A much larger building would be necessary. We have no accommodation other than the barn for raising hogs, and housing hogs along with dairy stock is not a satisfactory proposition.\n\nIf sufficient lumber were supplied it would be possible to construct both of these buildings with the help of the school instructors. The estimated cost of the materials for both buildings would be $700.00\n\nFencing.\n\nAn estimate of $349.00 was submitted last year for fencing for hog pastures. In order to protect our farm crops it is necessary to provide suitable fencing.\n\nTo improve the appearance of the buildings, considerable fencing for the school grounds is necessary. It is estimated that the present fencing which has served its purpose and is badly dilapidated can be replaced at a cost of $700.00\n\nIn placing these estimates before you I realize that we can hardly hope to make all of these improvements this year. However I would suggest that all of these are necessary and should be carried out at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Residential School, in connection with necessary improvements to the school, grounds and outbuildings.\n\nI beg to respectfully recommend that in order to prevent deterioration, both the exterior and interior of the school should be painted. I beg to suggest that the painting and entrance repairs recommended are of first importance, and I trust that funds will be available to have this work done during the present fiscal year.\n\nThe fencing and repairs to the cow barn, piggery and poultry houses are also badly needed, and it will be of great assistance to the school if these repairs can be made. As pointed out by the Reverend Principal, the greater part of this work can be done by the instructors and the senior boys in the school.\n\nThe school laundry equipment is in very poor condition, but I feel that it is possible to get along as at present for another year and that other repairs are of more importance.\n\nIn the matter of providing adequate fire protection for the school, I regret that a certain amount of difficulty has been encountered in securing the power rights on Joseph creek, but when the necessary arrangements have been made I trust the Department will give this important matter their earnest consideration.\n\nI beg to submit that after having examined the entrances to the basement and side doors at the school Messrs Sainsbury & Ryan, Contractors, stated they were very dangerous in their present condition and that the repairs should be made before next winter.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 10/1464 of the 6th ultimo, with enclosure from the Reverend Principal, with reference to improvements necessary at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The needs may be recapitulated as follows:\n\n(a) Laundry equipment - $5,000.\n(b) Secondary water supply for fire protection - $27,500.\n(c) Painting main building - exterior - $375.7\n    interior - $75.7\n(d) Alteration to entrances - $750.\n(e) School desks - $350.\n(f) Barn repairs and painting materials only - $500.\n(g) Hogpen and henhouse materials - $700.\n(h) Fencing hog pasture grounds - $349.\n\nI may say that approximately $1,100 is available for improvements this year, and the Department considers that the painting of the building, at a total cost of $450, should be proceeded with. This leaves a balance of $650 for other improvements. Please discuss this with the Reverend Principal and let me have a recommendation as to how it should be expended. Do not proceed with the purchase of any paint and the engagement of any labour in this connection, until the Department has given further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nOttawa, May 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 11/1475 of the 7th ultimo, with reference to a small supplementary generator for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The Department has two or three generators surplus to present requirements at other institutions and is corresponding with them with a view to ascertaining if suitable equipment can be transferred. You will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryekman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nMay 5, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD\n\nFunds are available for urgent painting of the exterior of the Kootenay Indian Residential School at Cranbrook, in the federal district of Kootenay East. Will you please let me know what firms should be asked to quote on the paint and provide what expert labour is necessary.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 6, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of yesterday's date, with reference to the installing of a small supplementary generator for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I have to say that we have surplus to requirements at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, near St. Thomas, Ont., a Fairbanks-Morse shunt wound generator, 30 - 42 volt, 3\u00bd K.W. I have to request that you will inform the Department whether this generator would meet the requirements at the Kootenay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGranbrook, B.C.\nPrices for the paint for the exterior of the Kootenay Indian Residential School at Cranbrook, B.C., may be obtained from the following:\n\nCollier and Sinkler .... Cranbrook\nParks and Company ....... Cranbrook\n\nMr. F. H. Dezall of Cranbrook, should be consulted as to the labour required.\n\nActing D.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, May 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your 10/1464 of the 6th ultimo and the Department's reply thereto of the 5th instant, regarding the painting required to the exterior and interior of the main building at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I have to say that you may obtain prices for the supplying of the paint from the following:\n\nCollier & Sinkler ... Cranbrook,\nParks & Company ... \" \"\n\nYou should make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price, and you should see that a good grade of paint is supplied.\n\nRegarding the labour in carrying out the painting, you should consult Mr. F. H. Dezall, of Cranbrook, as to any expert labour that may be required. It is to be understood that the school authorities will give as much assistance as possible in the performing of the work.\n\nThe total expenditure that can be incurred in the painting, including material and labour, must not exceed the sum of $450. The Principal or yourself should see that a satisfactory job is completed. The purchase of the paint and carrying out of the work should receive your early attention.\n\nWhen the work has been finished, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint, etc., and time sheets, in duplicate, properly filled in and signed by the individual labourers employed and certified by yourself, should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of May 5th and 6th, 1932, file No. 155-0-5, with reference to the small supplementary generator applied for by the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret to report that the 30 - 42 volt generator mentioned in your letter of the 6th instant could not be used in connection with the lighting system at Kootenay Residential School. It will be necessary to have a 110 volt generator, for the whole system would have to be changed if the 30 - 42 volt generator was installed. I sincerely trust that one of the 110 volt type may be found among the department's surplus stock of generators for I am sure it will prove of great benefit to the school.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, informing the Department that the generator mentioned in official letter of the 6th instant as being surplus to requirements will not be satisfactory in connection with the lighting system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has no other generator available, and, as our funds are limited, will not be able to purchase a generator at the present time. It is hoped that it will be possible for the school to carry on for a few months under the present arrangements, when you could again draw the matter to the attention of the Department and favourable consideration would be given to supplying the small supplementary generator required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSir:\n\nDepartmental letter No. 155-0-5, May 9, 1932.\n\nI beg to report that I have gone carefully into the matter of the purchase of materials and the painting of the exterior of Kootenay Indian Residential School, as directed in the above Departmental letter, and, acting on the advice of Mr. F. H. Dezall, quotations have been obtained from Mr. Jas. Norgrove, Cranbrook, which I beg to enclose herewith, offering to supply all materials and do the work of painting the exterior of the school for the sum of $475.00. Mr. Dezall also advised that the paint be purchased from Mr. Norgrove.\n\nI beg to submit that the estimate supplied by Mr. Norgrove about a year ago to do this work was for $450, and this, he states, was for the materials only, but after making a careful examination of the school building, Mr. Norgrove stated that it would be too dangerous to use any other than skilled labour in doing the work. The greater part of the work must be done from swinging platforms at a distance of about forty feet from the ground, and although the total cost of painting the exterior and supplying paint for the interior will be about $550.00, $100.00 more than was anticipated, I would respectfully recommend that it be done as suggested by Mr. Norgrove. This, I beg to submit, meets with the approval of both the Reverend Principal and Mr. Dezall.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your II/1655 of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the painting of the exterior of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. You may accept the offer of Mr. J. Norgrove to do the necessary work at a price of $475, as detailed in his estimates of May 25th and 30th. These are enclosed for your guidance, but they should be returned to the Department when you are submitting a properly certified account, in triplicate, after the work has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

I should suggest a jacket heater being installed between the kitchen and dining room. They are cheap and work well with a little coal fuel.

Pragnell, on his inspection (No. 7) of the Kootenay Indian Agency.\n\nThe agent might be asked to estimate the cost of the jacket heater recommended on page 2 of the Inspector's report, likewise the installation of a hot water tank.\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner, B.C.\nOttawa, August 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Pragnell, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which was forwarded to the Department through the office of the Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, B.C., states that a hot water tank is badly needed for kitchen purposes. He recommends that a jacket heater be installed between the kitchen and dining-room, also the supplying and installing of a hot water tank.\n\nI would request that you furnish the Department with an estimate of the cost of a jacket heater and hot water tank, and the installing of same. When this is received, consideration will be given as to whether the necessary funds can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have secured from the Cranbrook Sash and Door Co., Ltd., an estimate covering the cost of a permanent poultry house suitable for our school. The estimated cost is $250.00 for a building 16' x 32' substantially constructed with cement flooring. This is for material only, the work to be done by our school employees with the assistance of the older boys.\n\nThis building is a great necessity for our school. We have a very good flock of laying birds but very poor winter accommodation for them. Such a building would provide us with eggs all winter for staff and children, which would add greatly to the health of our children.\n\nAs the Indian Department has already been asked to grant this request, I feel sure that it will meet with favorable consideration. I will be glad if you will make this recommendation for me.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. August 6th, 1932\n\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I applied for a small generator to be attached to our Diesel oil-pumping engine for lighting purposes. I wish to apply again for this engine as its installation will materially reduce expenses for lighting this winter. Since making application the price of gasoline has increased. The cost of lighting fuel is one of our expense items which is very large and which can be cut only by installing fuel oil burning equipment. The engine is already installed and is giving entire satisfaction. It only remains to install this small generator in order to make this reduction.\n\nTrusting that this matter will receive favorable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letters received from the Reverend J.

Authority has already been granted for the painting of the exterior of the school building, at a price of $475, leaving a balance of $625 for further improvements.\n\nIt is noted that, after discussing the matter of repairs with the Rev. Principal, the generator and materials for a poultry house are most urgently required. The Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase of a small generator, to be attached to the Diesel oil pump, for engine for lighting purposes, at a cost of approximately $225; and for the purchase of the lumber and other material required in the erection of the poultry house, at a cost of $250. The purchase of the above equipment should be from a firm on the list to receive consideration. The Department notes that the labour in the construction of the poultry house will be performed by the school employees, with the assistance of the older boys. You should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the generator, and itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of lumber and other materials for the poultry house. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S.

Father Patterson of the Kootenay Indian Residential School at Cranbrook, for merchandise that this firm has supplied to him for the pupils of this school. The account is not a personal one, and I am enclosing a copy of our statement to give you an idea how long this matter has been outstanding, and I can assure you, sir, that I can ill afford to wait this great length of time for monies which are due to this firm. I have written letters crouched in the friendliest of terms, I have rendered statements for many months, I have registered letters to him in connection with this account but have had no reply. Some three weeks ago in despair I went up to see one of the officials of the Indian Dept. here in Calgary who strongly advised me to write to the Oblate Fathers in Edmonton, and in their reply they mentioned that no Catholic Indian Mission in B.C. came under their jurisdiction and they advised me to write to the Provincial Bursar, St. Patrick's College, Ottawa, which I did and have received a reply very similar to the Oblate Fathers at Edmonton that this is outside their jurisdiction. Surely, sir, something can be done about this matter, and I would earnestly ask you to use your efforts in this seemingly distasteful matter and plead with you now that you assist me to get my account cleaned up.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCMH:M\n\nREMEMBER OUR DANCE NOVELTIES\n\nEVERYTHING FOR YOUR CARNIVAL - BLANKETS, DOLLS, SPANISH HATS, MIRRORS, GAMES, ETC.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 30, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding an outstanding account incurred by the Reverend Father Patterson, of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my letter of May 25th in which I quoted the sum of $652.00 for materials and labor to cover two coats of paint on all outside woodwork, etc., and cleaning the metal roof on the north side of Kootenay Indian Residential School, I may say that one coat of creosote stain on the eaves of the building would last almost as long as two coats of paint on the more exposed parts, and this would reduce the estimated cost by $127.00. I also included in the estimate the cost of cleaning the north side of the metal roof, which certainly should be done, and if this is left until another year it would further reduce the estimate by $50.00.\n\nI would therefore undertake to supply all necessary materials and do the work as outlined in my letter of May 25th, using one coat of creosote stain instead of two and leaving out the cleaning of the roof, for the sum of $475.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJ.

December 6th, 1932\n\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn examining the plumbing and drainage system of our school recently I found that there is considerable repair and cleaning work to be done, some of which will require the services of a plumber.\n\nThe lowest estimate I could get for a good job is $80.00. This amount includes about $32.00 for labor and the remainder is for materials.\n\nAs this work is best done during the winter months when the system is in operation and defects can be seen, I would like you to ask the Department for an allowance for this work.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your favorable attention, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. December 7th, 1932\n\nMr. F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn examining our cream separator a few days ago, I find that many parts need replacing. The machine is an old one and a new one would cost about $98.00. To put the separator in good condition would cost $45.00 for repair parts. I am therefore requesting the Department to make us an allowance of $45.00 for these repairs.\n\nTrusting that you will give this your favorable attention, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, C.M.I. Principal\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. December 6th, 1932\n\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the inspection trip of Inspector G.S. Pragnell in June last we called his attention to the necessity of a heating system such as a jacket heater would provide for our kitchen, which he agreed upon.\n\nHowever since that time I thought it would be better to have a coil run from our present tank to our furnace fires and an asbestos lining placed about the tank itself. I talked this matter over with Mr Pragnell later in Kamloops and he approved of the plan.\n\nThe later plan has the advantage that our present heater can be used and it will provide sufficient hot water at all times. By eliminating the necessity of installing a jacket heater the fire hazard is also reduced.\n\nThe estimated cost of this installation is $75.00, while the lowest estimate for a jacket heater is $100.00. I would therefore request the Department to make an allowance of $75.00 to cover the cost of this much needed installation.\n\nThanking you in advance for your early attention to this matter, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.L. Patterson, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith three letters received from the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, in which he requests authority to have a heating system installed in the kitchen, repairs to the cream separator and general repairs to the school plumbing, the total cost to be approximately $200.00.\n\nI beg to submit that of the $1100.00 set aside for repairs to the school, as authorized in Departmental letter of August 12, 1932, file No. 155-0-5, the following has all ready been used:\n\nVoucher # 1105, painting exterior of school, $475.00\nVoucher # 1126, lumber for poultry house, $249.44\nVoucher # 1137, small generator, $225.00\n\nTotal, $949.44\n\nleaving a balance of $150.56.\n\nThe repairs applied for by the Reverend Principal are very necessary and I trust the Department may see their way clear to grant his requests in the full amount of $200.00.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Approval is also granted for an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $50 in having the repairs required carried out to the plumbing and drainage system at the school. It is considered that the school authorities, themselves, should be responsible for the cost of the repairs required to the cream separator from their per capita allowance or other receipts of the school.\n\nAfter the above authorized work has been completed, please furnish accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for any material supplied and for the labour.

J. M. Patterson, Cranbrook, B.C., for installing heating system in kitchen, Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 155-0-5 dated December 23, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nIn the kitchen I noticed that the floor was very much worn. This is a very bad state of things in a school like this where there are several diseases prevalent, and everything must be kept in a perfectly sanitary condition. I would strongly recommend that a new floor of about 30 feet by 14 feet be laid down in the kitchen. The Department will best know the type of flooring which is giving the best results in the most modern schools.\n\nThe sinks in the kitchen are not in good condition, being much worn with the glaze off in many places. To save money, these might last for another year or two, but they should be replaced by modern sanitary sinks at the first opportunity. FOR HEALTH REASONS I wish to strongly recommend a cooks or kitchen table with a METAL TOP for this school. This table should be about 10 feet by 3 feet. My own opinion, which is not shared by the school authorities, is that a new table (Kitchen) with a sheet of galvanized metal neatly fixed to the top and bent over the edges to be nailed on the under-side of the table top, would cost less and be quite as sanitary as some expensive hospital pattern of table with an enamelled top.\n\nLaundry:\n\nThis was reported on at length in my last report on this school. The girls spend three half days a week in the laundry. This laundry room is TOO DARK & NOT WELL VENTILATED, and I have no hesitation in saying that work in the laundry is very bad for children who are not strong, or with any signs of lung or eye trouble. In fact, it is very bad for anyone and urgently calls for change. A new small building will be required to take the following new laundry machinery, which most certainly is now required at this school:\n\n2 washing machines; 1 extractor; 1 drier (steam) and 1 flat ironer. All the machinery here is now far too old and worn; but something would be allowed for it by a firm supplying new machines. The Indian Agent went into this matter with me with great care, and will forward estimates when necessary to the Department. I asked that the laundry be kept in a more tidy state than that in which I found it.\nOttawa, March 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, in a report on his last inspection of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the need of laundry equipment. He states the following new laundry machinery is required:\n\n- 2 washing machines,\n- 1 extractor,\n- 1 drier (steam),\n- 1 flat ironer.\n\nHe states, further, that some arrangement should be made to provide better light and ventilation in the present laundry room.\n\nThe Department will have certain funds, not exceeding the sum of approximately $1,400, to provide laundry equipment. I would request that you take this matter up with the Principal and make a definite recommendation as to the laundry equipment most urgently required, not to exceed in cost the amount mentioned. Full particulars should be given as to the power utilized in the operation of this equipment.\n\nI may add, further, that the above is the full amount that has been provided for this school during the fiscal year 1933-34, and it will not be possible to incur any other expenditure. If the Principal has more urgent requests than the laundry equipment, full details should be given of the requirements, with a close estimate of the cost. When we have the above information, consideration will be given to the equipment, etc., that can be provided, keeping in view the funds available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. June 1st, 1933.\n\nIr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish you to request the Department to grant a replacement of the cream separator at our school.\n\nWe have been making repairs to our cream separator for a long while and we find it is entirely worn out and that it cannot be repaired to give satisfactory service.\n\nI would be very glad if you would forward this request at your earliest opportunity as it is necessary for us to make our butter supplies for the school to a great extent during the summer months.\n\nOn enquiry I find that a satisfactory machine, the DeLaval Cream Separator will cost $132.00 f.o.b. Cranbrook,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I., Principal\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School requesting authority to purchase a new cream separator for the school.\n\nI beg to submit that I have examined the cream separator now at the school and it is beyond repair.

If it is urgent that this equipment be obtained, the school authorities will have to provide the cost of same from per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S.

Strong winds fanned the flames and sparks flew long distances, and for two days not very little hope was entertained of saving the buildings. Almost every able bodied Indian on St Mary's Reserve and the school staff worked day and night until the danger was over, and I am pleased to report that the only damage to property was the loss of the fence on one side of the farm owned by the Oblate Fathers and operated by the Reverend Principal of the school.\n\nTwo lengths of fire hose were borrowed from the City of Cranbrook, but although we telephoned as far as Fernie, B.C., no more hose could be procured. As sparks were falling constantly near the school cow barn and other outbuildings and the hose would not reach near enough to the danger spots, I took the liberty of purchasing 100 feet of hose from Messrs F. Parks & Co. and this, together with the borrowed hose, enabled the Indians standing by to keep a stream of water on the roofs of the buildings and to quench the sparks as they fell. We were also very short of fire fighting tools, and as the Forestry Department were using all their equipment at this and other fires in the district I also purchased six shovels, two mattocks and 1 pick for the use of the Indian fire fighters. The only other cost to the department was a small quantity of food supplied to six Indians who remained for two days and nights at some distance from their homes to prevent the fire jumping the St Mary's River and destroying the reserve timber. The account for food, amounting to $4.47, is included in the account for relief submitted by the Cranbrook Trading Company and forwarded on Voucher No. 1447 under separate cover. I beg to enclose the accounts submitted by Messrs F. Parks & Company, amounting to $34.00 and $12.89 herewith.\n\nI trust the action taken in making these purchases will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

The Department is pleased to learn that there was no loss to the school. The action taken by you in the purchase of one hundred feet of fire hose for use at the school is approved. The account which you submitted, in favour of F. Parks & Company, to the amount of $54.00, will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook,\nB. C.\nUse Your Regular Washing Formula\n\nIt makes no difference whether you are using the standard multiple-suds formula or your own pet washing formula\u2014continue on as you always have been doing\u2014\n\nand Add the PERCHLORON BLEACH to the LAST SUDS . . . . . using not more than 3 pints of 1% PERCHLORON SOLUTION to each 100 lbs. of dry clothes\n\nTest this scientific, new method of improved bleaching. See for yourself how PERCHLORON eliminates overbleaching and tendering\u2014see how it helps produce quality work\u2014a beautiful blue-white wash regardless of season or conditions.\n\nCHANGE TO PERCHLORON TODAY\nPerchloron\n\nEliminates Guesswork and Guarantees Positive \u2014 Uniform Bleaching Solutions\n\nPERCHLORON is a new, scientific bleaching and disinfecting agent prepared especially for laundry use. It is in powdered form, containing over 70% available chlorine and of unusual stability. PERCHLORON offers the surest, most convenient and economical way of preparing efficient, uniform bleaching solutions. No special equipment is necessary for preparing bleaching solutions with PERCHLORON; any washer can quickly prepare it by following the simple directions on the container. To be assured of obtaining the same positive results from solution to solution, one can of PERCHLORON produces 24 gallons of bleaching solution containing 1\u00bd available chlorine.\n\nCHANGE TO PERCHLORON TODAY\n\nAn Old Reliable Bleaching Agent in a New Form\n\nFOR YEARS Chlorine has been the recognized bleaching and disinfecting agent in laundries. The early users were forced to generate the chlorine gas at the point of application, an inconvenient and hazardous procedure. This led to the development of chlorine carriers in the form of hypochlorite preparations that could be transported in one container and mixed together. These satisfied the consumers' demand for convenience. Many of these products, however, varied greatly in strength and were unstable and unpredictable, the laundroman could never be sure there would not be inefficient underbleaching or dangerous over-bleaching.\n\nWith the growing appreciation of the usefulness of chlorine as a bleaching and disinfecting there was an obvious need for convenient means of supplying a stable, high concentration of available chlorine. Thus the development of PERCHLORON brings chlorine to you in an entirely new and advanced form. PERCHLORON is the newest hypochlorite \u2014 a stable, dry, free-flowing powder containing over 70% of available chlorine.\n\nPERCHLORON will not vary in available chlorine content more than 1\u00bd during usual storage.\n\nAn Efficient Bleaching Solution . . . Easily and Quickly Prepared\n\nPERCHLORON used in preparing sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite solutions gives up its available chlorine content into solution quickly and completely with a minimum amount of waste or residue. The bleaching solution can be siphoned off within a short time after mixing, although it should be allowed to stand for five minutes so that the solution be allowed to stand over night (twenty-four hours). Then siphon off the clear solution into glass or otherware containers which may be stored and used at any time.\n\nPERCHLORON supplies every laundry, large or small, with the easiest and most dependable method of preparing the bleaching fluid they now find their customers demand \u2014 PERCHLORON eliminates guesswork in preparing bleaching solutions and assures dependable results in whitening and tendering . . . reduces net destruction and harm to tensile strength of fabrics . . . eliminates underbleaching and cloudy gray-white garments . . . insures a dependable, uniform bleaching solution that gives the same dependable results regardless of season or weather.\n\nDirections for Preparing Sodium Hypochlorite Solutions with PERCHLORON\n\nFirst\u2014Add 3\u00bd lbs. of straight 58% soda ash to 4 gallons of lukewarm water and stir for two or three minutes.\n\nSecond\u2014Add the contents of one can of PERCHLORON gradually and continue stirring for another two or three minutes.\n\nThird\u2014Add sufficient water to give the solution a total volume of 24 gallons. Stir for a minute or two and allow to settle.\n\nNote: If modified soda is used in place of soda ash, use 6 lbs. of the modified soda ash in lukewarm water instead of 3\u00bd lbs. of soda ash. This solution will be slightly weaker than the solution shown in the following tables.\n\nCalcium Hypochlorite Solutions\n\nFirst\u2014Add the contents of one can of PERCHLORON gradually to 4 gallons of cold water with continuous stirring. When all the material has been added, stir for two or three minutes.\n\nSecond\u2014Add sufficient water to give the solution a total volume of 24 gallons. Stir for a minute or two and allow to settle.\n\nThe following table shows the amount of solution of various strengths (parts per million) which can be obtained by using the full contents of one can of PERCHLORON for either sodium or calcium hypochlorite.\n\n| Available Chlorine Content | Total Gallons |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| 0.01%                     | 60           |\n| 0.75%                     | 32           |\n| 1.00%                     | 24           |\n| 1.50%                     | 16           |\n| 3.00%                     | 8            |\n\nThus to secure a 1\u00bd solution, use enough water to make a total volume of 24 gallons of solution. To make a solution of lower concentration than indicated in the above table, make up first a stock solution using the full contents of one can of PERCHLORON and then add portions of this stock solution as required. PERCHLORON solutions will not readily show a loss of available chlorine.\nSTATEMENT\n\nWINNIPEG Sept.1st. 1933\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTo STANLEY BROCK LIMITED Dr.\n\nTo Account Rendered\n\nAug.23 May 27 To Mde.

This plant consists of:\n\nTwo return tubular boilers, 54\" diameter and 10 ft. long, having 60 4\" x 10' tubes, rated at 74 H.P. each. Longitudinal joint, double rivetted lap, built in 1913, making them now 20 years old. They are adapted to supply hot water heat to the school and numbered 1869 and 1870 B.C.\n\nThe lighting plant consists of one 7 H.P. Petter Gasoline engine, direct connected to a 4 K.W. 125 V., 55 Amp. D.C. Generator.\n\nPower for the laundry is supplied by a 15 H.P. Otto Gasoline engine, direct connected to a 10 K.W. 125 V., 60 Amp. Canadian Westinghouse generator.\n\nThe water service is supplied by a 5\" x 6\" Gould Triplex Pump, operated by a Fairbanks-Morse Z Type Gasoline Engine of 7 H.P.\n\nThere is also a Fairbanks-Morse direct connected to Air Compressor No. 3.\n\nBOILERS NO. 1869 & 1870 B.C.\n\nI gave these boilers a hammer test and external and internal inspection and found that they were in good condition. Very little corrosion was showing and all joints, rivets, appeared quite tight.\n\nThe 6\" return pipes from the system have been renewed and are now in first class condition.\n\nThere is a black deposit showing on internal parts of the boilers, but it does not appear to be doing any harm, but will need watching and again reported on next year.\n\nThe whole brickwork is in good condition and will need no repairs. Some of the firebars are starting to buckle, but as a whole are very fair.\n\nAll the auxiliary machinery is apparently in good condition, but next inspection these pistons should be drawn and inspected.\nThe laundry machinery is not in very good condition and should be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nThe whole of this plant is in a very fair condition with the exception of the laundry.\n\nI have issued a Certificate for the boilers as in good condition.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nP.J.

Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDue to the necessity of securing new estimates on our proposed laundry equipment, I have been delayed unavoidably in replying to your Departmental letter No. 155-0-5, of March 30th, 1933.\n\nThe equipment which is lacking in our present laundry and which is necessary, together with the cost follows:\n\n1-8 H.P. Steam boiler with installation charges... $475.00\nInstallation charges, piping, etc... $250.00\n1 Canadian Junior Drying Tumbler.............. $550.00\n1 Canadian No. 1 Handy Flatwork Ironer......... $250.00\n\nTotal cost.................. $3,225.00\n\nThe two washing machines and the Extractor, though worn, can be made to do service for awhile longer. With a further expenditure of $75.00 the lighting and ventilating arrangements can be improved greatly, as the walls which are now dark in color can be whitened a lighter color. If the new installation is made, suitable ventilation can be made through the present chimney which will not be needed then.\n\nIt is proposed to operate this machinery with our present 15 H.P. Otto engine which will give us ample power.\n\nHowever as the amount of available funds for our school this year is not sufficient to cover the cost of this installation and there are other wants which are just as urgent, I am giving you a list of these other requirements together with the estimated cost as follows:\n\nCream Separator equipped with motor....... $194.85 (For heavy operation the motor is necessary).\nRepairs to barn............................. $250.00\nNecessary fence repairs this year............ $175.00\nInside varnishing and painting............... $75.00\n\nTotal.................. $644.85\n\nI am proposing to the Department that the funds for the above improvements be granted the school this year, and that the balance of our funds available for this school be devoted to the installation of the Steam boiler, and connecting it with our washers. If this were done it would be a great help. I would request further that the estimates for the Drying Tumbler and the Flatwork Ironer, as quoted above be placed in the estimates for next year.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter their favorable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Residential School, with reference to Laundry equipment and repairs needed at the school.\n\nI beg to submit that the sum of $3535.00 has been placed in the estimates for this Agency for the fiscal year 1934-1935 to cover the cost of the laundry equipment which is badly needed at the school. Will the Department please advise me if the balance of the $1400.00 provided for the school in the present fiscal year may be used next year in the purchase of this equipment.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the Cream Separator, repairs to barn, fence repairs and varnish and paint for the interior of the school be authorized out of the funds available. The prices quoted are for materials only, the labour to be done by the school staff.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S.

E. R. No. 996 is enclosed as your authority for this purchase.\n\nYou may, also, authorize the following repairs:-\n\n| Repairs to barn | $250.00 |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Fence repairs   | $175.00 |\n| Inside varnishing & painting | $75.00 |\n\nTotal - $500.00\n\nI enclose E.

The question of providing the laundry equipment will receive consideration next year but, at the present time, the Department is not in a position to state whether or not funds will be available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

November 20th, 1933.\n\nMr F.J. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to request of the Department the purchase of 350 feet of rubber hose to reach from our pumping engine to our barn.\n\nThis summer, when there was a bush fire close to the school the Department purchased 100 feet for emergency use about the buildings. This however, is not enough for the purpose as it will not reach to the barn. During the winter months we have almost all of our stock and hay, which is valuable, in the barn and we should have at least emergency protection. The rubber hose mentioned above would help a great deal. The estimated cost of 350 feet is $119.00.\n\nI wish also to request of the Department a supply of refills for our fire extinguishers for the school as it is nearly a year since they were filled.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\nKootenay Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nNovember 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, in which he requests permission to purchase fire hose to the value of $119.00, and also a supply of refills for the fire extinguishers in the school.\n\nI beg to submit that the fire hose is badly needed, for if a fire should start in the barn, manual training building or other outbuilding the only means of handling it at present would be by carrying water in pails from the school or from Joseph Creek, and as these outbuildings represent a considerable outlay of capital I would respectfully submit that the cost of the hose is quite low. When forest fires threatened the school last summer several lengths of hose were borrowed from the City of Cranbrook, but these have, of course, been returned and would not be available in an emergency.\n\nThe fire extinguishers in the school should also be refilled shortly.\n\nI trust the Department will authorize these expenditures.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 27th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn your letter of the 20th instant in which you request authority to purchase fire hose, you also state that the fire extinguishers in the school should be refilled shortly.\n\nWould you be good enough to advise the Department as to what quantity of refills will be necessary. You should also state what size of fire hose you have in mind in order that arrangements may be made for the purchase of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S.

When the refills are received, the Principal should see that they are installed in the extinguishers and that the extinguishers are placed in good condition, ready for immediate use.\n\nPlease obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the fire hose and the refills for the extinguishers.

Chief Adams advises that rubber lined cotton wrapped fire hose of one inch inside diameter should be supplied, and that this hose will give much better satisfaction and last much longer than the unlined hose.

This is for supplies used in their laundry and we are unable to get any satisfaction from the Rev. Father Patterson as to when he intends to pay it. We are wondering if there is any procedure which we should take in connection with Indian Schools under the Department in order to secure prompt payment of these bills.\n\nWe never seem to be able to get paid for anything we sell to this particular school within a reasonable time and it costs us money to carry the account for so long.

The black deposit on the tubes and boiler shell is very much more pronounced than last year, although there is no noticeable effect on the metallic surfaces. I have a sample of it with me which I will analyze and again report at a later date.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBOILER No. 1870.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a similar inspection and found it in very good condition as No. 1869. New relief valves should be installed on two branches of the mains. The positions I pointed out to the attendant also two new gauges are required.\n\nThe brickwork and firebars are in very fair condition and will need no repairs.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nAUXILIARY MACHINERY.\n\nThe auxiliary machinery is in a very good condition. The whole plant is very much improved over last year's inspection and I must compliment the attendant in charge for cooperation and the interest he takes in his duties.\nIn my last report I stated that the Laundry Machinery was not in the best of condition. It is much improved but a new high pressure steam boiler is very badly required as the means for drying the clothes is very meagre, and if a high pressure boiler is installed and a rotary steam dryer is installed a very considerable difference would be obtained. This is absolutely necessary, as all the clothes must be properly sterilized and with the present methods it is utterly impossible to do so.\n\nI thought at one time that for the interests of economy that one of the high pressure boilers from one of the other schools could be installed, but upon further consideration I would recommend a boiler of a submerged tube type as the only fuel available is wood and the short length required for a vertical boiler would be quite expensive and uneconomical, whereas with a submerged type longer lengths could be used.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. J. Amall,\nEngineer.\n\nTJA/TH\nOttawa, Sept. 22, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of the Engineer, Department of Public Works, Victoria, B. C., on his inspection of the boilers at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. He reports as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 1369 - Found in good condition. The black deposit on the tubes and boiler shell is very much more pronounced than last year, although there is no noticeable effect on the metallic surfaces.\n\nBoiler No. 1370 - Found in good condition. New relief valves should be installed on two branches of the mains. The positions were pointed out to the attendant. Two new gauges are also required.\n\nAuxiliary Machinery - Reported in very good condition. The Engineer states the whole plant is very much improved over last year's inspection, and he compliments the attendant in charge for cooperation and the interest he takes in his duties.\n\nThe Principal should arrange to carry out the recommendations of the Engineer, regarding Boiler No. 1370. We understand that the certificates of inspection of the boilers have been forwarded to the Principal. He should arrange to see that they are posted in a conspicuous place in the boiler room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKootenay, B.

I have again put in $1225.00 for a threshing machine for the school, my reason being that it would not only be of great benefit to the school but also to the Indians of St. Mary's Reserve, for those Indians could then haul at least a load or two of grain to the school farm and have their threshing done for little or nothing. The Reverend Principal has helped the St. Mary's Indians in many ways in the past, and any improvements made to the school farm will be of real benefit to the Indians.

This is not a matter that directly concerns the Department as the account is owing by the Kootenay Residential School and should be paid by them.\n\nAs you know these schools are maintained by a per capita grant to cover the operating cost. Nevertheless, \"as a rule\" the public does not make any fine distinction between the Missionary Societies running schools and the Department itself, and for this reason we dislike matters of this kind to be outstanding.\n\nWe have already had some correspondence in connection with delayed payment of accounts on the part of this school. I shall have the matter looked up and give you a further report. In the meantime we shall take steps to have the matter brought to the attention of the Reverend Principal of the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMiss A.

J. M. Patterson, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. You replied by telegram, dated February 12th, and stated that steps were being taken to have long outstanding obligations at the Kootenay Indian Residential School met very shortly.\n\nSince that time, communications have been received from two firms, regarding outstanding accounts for goods purchased by Rev. Father Patterson in 1932. Recently, the Textile Products Company, 710 Bloor St. West, Toronto, took this matter up with the Right Honourable the Prime Minister. They state they have accounts against the school, amounting to $674.49, for goods shipped in 1932. Father Patterson has been written several times, with reference to the payment of outstanding accounts, but no reply has been received from him.\n\nThis is a matter that reflects, not only on the management of the school, but also on the Department, as the public does not make any fine distinction between the authorities running the schools and the Department itself, and, for this reason, we dislike matters of this kind to be outstanding.\n\nFather Patterson has been forwarded two advances, to the amount of $2,000, on the current quarter's earnings of the school, and there seems no reason why he should not settle all his outstanding accounts. I am bringing this matter again to your attention, in the hope that you may be able to have all outstanding indebtedness incurred by the Principal satisfactorily adjusted.\n\nA copy of your report, in reply to this letter, will be forwarded for the information of the Right Honourable the Prime Minister.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was stated in our letter that \"this is a matter that reflects, not only on the management of the school, but also on the Department, as the public does not make any fine distinction between the authorities running the schools and the Department, itself, and, for this reason, we dislike matters of this kind to be outstanding\".\n\nNo reply was received to this letter, and, yesterday, a telegram was forwarded to Father Gillan. A reply has been received today, in which he suggests that, if the Provincial of the Order, Reverend Scannell, O.M.I., Ottawa, approves, payment of all outstanding indebtedness be settled by the Department and the amount deducted from the quarterly per capita grants for the school.\n\nI may add that Reverend Father Scannell arrived in Ottawa last week, having been appointed Provincial of the Order. Father Gillan states in his telegram that he is asking Father Scannell to visit the Department.\n\nI may say that we have not on file the outstanding accounts against this school. The matter will be taken up with the new Provincial of the Order, with a view to early settlement.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 6, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

He assured me that immediate steps would be taken to have the outstanding obligations paid.

J. M. Patterson, O.M.I. This cheque is dated December 14, 1934, and was returned by the bank, marked \"Not sufficient funds\". This is the firm that took up the matter with the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, some time ago. The amount due the firm is $674.49.\n\nI should be pleased to be informed what steps you have taken to have the Principal settle all outstanding indebtedness in the school accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Murphy, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, has requested that repairs be made to the roof of the engine room at the school. Recently Messrs Sainsbury & Ryan, Cranbrook, examined the roof and informed me that the exhaust pipe from the engine is very likely to set the building on fire unless repaired at once, also that temporary repairs should be made to the roof. They state that it is impossible in this weather to put on a new roof; that it can only be done in warm weather. The total cost of these repairs will be between eighty-five and one hundred dollars. I beg to submit that I have already requested Messrs Sainsbury & Ryan to repair the exhaust pipe at once owing to the danger of fire.\n\nWill the Department please grant authority to have this work done, the cost not to exceed the sum of one hundred dollars.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

It is possible that funds for this purpose could be secured at the present time, and I would, therefore, request you to report fully regarding the laundry machinery at present in this school, stating why a new tumbler is required.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan visited this school last June, he informed both you and the Principal that an amount of $400 was available in this year's appropriation for miscellaneous repairs at the Kootenay School. It was understood that you would write the Department following his visit, stating the exact manner in which you consider this amount should be expended. As yet, you have not done so, and the Department would appreciate hearing from you in this regard at as early a date as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S.

It expanded with the heat, the joints opened, and in addition to filling the engine room with fumes set the roof on fire and burned out a piece about six feet in diameter before it was discovered. It was then decided that a much heavier pipe of rolled steel must be put in, and this, of course, brought the cost much higher than was anticipated. As the pipe weighed about 400 pounds it was necessary to put in supports in order to take the weight off the engine, which also added to the cost. However, the work has been well and thoroughly done and has resulted in eliminating danger of fire from the exhaust, and although the total cost is $43.70 more than the authority granted in Departmental letter of November 14, 1935, file No. 155-0-5, I trust that under the circumstances the Department will pass it for payment.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

We have experienced a good deal of difficulty in getting in touch with dealers who handle the type of plant needed and it is but recently that I have found their names through Mr. C. H. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Vancouver. I have written for quotations, and when these have been received I will discuss the matter with the Reverend Principal and then report to the Department. As it is very necessary to have a good electric lighting plant in the school I felt that it would be best not to make any recommendation regarding laundry equipment until the matter of lights is definitely settled. Both the Reverend Principal and myself believe that the lighting plant is of first importance, and I trust that it will meet with approval if I report more fully regarding the equipment needed later on.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal in which he requests permission to expend the sum of $250.00 on painting and other necessary repairs to the school and outbuildings.

Ryckman, in which was enclosed a communication from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, requesting authority to incur an expenditure, to the amount of $250, in carrying out painting and other necessary repairs to the school and outbuildings.\n\nIn this connection you may inform the Principal that he may arrange for the purchase, from the best available source of supply, of the materials required, as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost |\n|-------------------------------|------|\n| Paint                         | $50.00 |\n| Alabastine                    | $50.00 |\n| Cement - making manhole and repair dairy, etc. | $50.00 |\n| Glass, electric fixtures, piping | $50.00 |\n| Sundries                      | $50.00 |\n\n$250.00\n\nItemized accounts, in triplicate, should be obtained from the firms from whom the purchase is made. These accounts, the Principal should hand to you, to be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded to the Department for payment. It is understood that, if the above supplies are furnished, the school authorities will perform the labour, without expense to the Department.\n\nThe late Agent stated that he had written for quotations on the supplying of a lighting plant, as this equipment is more urgent than laundry machinery. He stated it was very necessary to have a good electric lighting plant in the school and that he felt it would be best not to make any recommendation regarding laundry equipment until the matter of lighting was definitely settled and also that the Principal considered the lighting plant to be of first importance. If you receive the quotations, please discuss the matter with the school Principal and forward the quotations to the Department, with a recommendation. You should state definitely whether a new set of batteries, only, is required for the present plant or if an entirely new lighting plant is necessary. Full particulars should be given as to type, etc., of a new lighting plant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRobert Howe, Esq.,\nIn charge, Indian Agency,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nMR. HOUZ,\nAGENT\nDEPT. INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nCRANBROOK B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you we examined the generator and battery equipment at the KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL. We also made an examination of the wiring throughout the building and beg to report as follows:\n\nThe present battery equipment has outlived its useful life. They are in such condition that the cost of repairing them would be far greater than the cost of a new and more efficient unit. They are of old style construction and even when in the best of condition they would not compare with the improved type now available. We strongly recommend the installation of the newer IRON OXIDE battery which carries a SEVEN YEAR GUARANTEE. This battery when properly installed and maintained gives exceptional trouble free service.\n\nThe generating equipment is in quite fair condition. It requires considerable cleaning and a few minor adjustments but is otherwise capable of giving excellent service. The switchboard and control panel has been tampered with to some extent and requires attention. Many of the connections are loose and improperly made. Some of the contacts are in poor shape and the complete switching arrangement needs a good going over. The transfer arrangement to the auxiliary generator is incorrect and requires a separate field rheostat and reverse current relay. The wiring from the switchboard to the batteries is badly corroded and very poorly insulated. It is in fact in a dangerous condition. The battery room is poorly ventilated and the gases arising from the cells while they are charging is highly explosive. Should a short circuit occur during the charging operation it might easily have disastrous results. This condition has been caused by the fact that the batteries now in use are the old open jar type and during charging electrolyte vapors are released into the air. As these vapors are highly corrosive they attack the terminal connections and wiring and deteriorate them very rapidly. This condition is not met with when the new closed in type battery is used.\n\nThe large OTTO gas engine used to drive the generator is in fair shape. The great drawback with this unit is its high cost of operation. When compared to the new diesel engines now available it becomes very expensive indeed. In fact the engine room layout could be altered with the installation of a diesel which would effect a dual saving well worth considering. We outline our suggestion below.\n\nAt the present time a seven horse power diesel is used to pump water and operate the small auxiliary generator. The large gas engine must be used to effectively charge the batteries. The combined operating cost of these two units are quite high. We would advise the installation of a sixteen or eighteen horse power diesel to be connected to the large generator. On this diesel there is a power take off which could be belted to the pump through a small line shaft. All pumping and generating could then be done from the one power source and at a cost of ONE THIRD LESS THAN THE COST OF OPERATING THE GENERATOR ALONE. The saving thus effected would soon pay for the cost of the unit. In addition it would leave the auxiliary equipment instantly available in case of emergency.\n\nWith regards to the wiring within the building we wish to mention that several switches and extensions have been added to the original installation in a manner contrary to the CANADIAN ELECTRICAL CODE. These additions have been wired in with cotton lamp cord which is nailed to the wooden casings. We would recommend that these be either removed or wired in properly as they present a real fire hazard.\n\nTrusting this report supplies the information that you require we remain,\n\nYOURS TRULY\n\n[Signature]\n\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 9 1935\n\nRobert Howe, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to the late Mr. Ryckman's letter of November 27th regarding lighting plant at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, we have just had a conversation with one of our engineers who installed the Petter Engine in the school in 1932. He knows the layout there very well and considers it a most economical plant.\n\nAs suggested in the above referred to letter, our engineer agrees that it would be quite the proper thing to replace the present batteries with new ones. Then it would be a most satisfactory and economically operated plant. We are therefore quoting you on the following batteries, any one of which would be satisfactory:\n\nOne - 56 cell Battery, each cell consisting of 13 plates, 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" x 13\", having a 240 Amp hour intermittent rating and 160 Amp hour 8 hour rating\nPrice - f.o.b. Cranbrook - $828.27\nWeight - 385 pounds.\n\nAs an alternative to the above:\n\nOne - 56 cell Battery, 11 plates 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" x 13\", having a capacity of 200 Amp hour intermittent rating and 140 Amp hour 8 hour rating\nPrice - f.o.b.

ALL AGREEMENTS ARE CONTINGENT UPON STRIKE, ACCIDENTS, DELAYS OF CARRIERS AND OTHER UNAVOIDABLE CAUSES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.\nAs another alternative:\n\nOne - 56 cell Battery, having 11 plates\n6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" x 11\", having a capacity\nof 186 Amp hour intermittent rating\nand 119 Amp hour 8 hour rating\nPrice - f.o.b. Cranbrook - - - - - - - $646.08\nWeight 3200 pounds.\n\nThe above batteries would be manufactured by the Coyle Batteries Limited and are covered\nby a four year guarantee. During the last few years\na large number of these batteries have been supplied\nto the public buildings and schools, etc., for lighting\npurposes. They are manufactured in Vancouver so that\nin case of repairs or adjustments being required, it\nwould be much easier to obtain them than from an\nEastern manufacturer.\n\nWe believe it would be possible\nfor these cells to be accommodated on the same trays\nthat contain the present cells. If you would give\nus the dimensions of the trays you have we could\ncheck these to make sure that they would contain these\nbatteries. The batteries would be fully charged before\nthey left Vancouver and the installation would be a\nvery simple matter by the man who at present takes\ncare of the batteries in the school.\n\nIf upon further consideration, you\nwould like us to quote you on a small automatic Diesel\nlighting plant, we would be very pleased to do so. We\nhandle the Petter Engines. We do not recommend, however,\nthe use of very small Diesel engines. Those under 5 HP\nare liable to give trouble. Such minute quantities of\nfuel are ejected through the nozzles that a slight\namount of dirt in the oil will plug them and cause\ntrouble. With sizes from 5 HP up very little trouble\noccurs.\n\nWe would be very pleased to go into\nthis matter with you further and be of any assistance\nwe can.

However, I should be pleased to have a report from you, stating the urgency for the supplying of the new batteries or if the present lighting equipment would not be satisfactory for a further period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant No. 155-0-5 requesting a report for the urgency of supplying new batteries for the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I wish to advise you that the Rev. Principal and myself are agreed that the batteries should be purchased and installed without delay. The lighting system in its present condition is very poor, the battery cells and plates are badly corroded and in state of collapse. It is necessary to run the big engine for six hours in order to charge the present batteries, whereas with new batteries half an hour would be sufficient, this of course greatly increases the cost of running the plant.\n\nI wish also to draw to your attention that when the plant is running at its best the lights are very dim and the strain is effecting the eyes of the pupils and staff, and being winter time the lights are in demand for approximately sixteen hours out of twenty four. I therefore beg to report the present lighting equipment would not be satisfactory for a further period and recommend that new batteries be installed as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert Howe\n(Acting Indian Agent)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nREMOVAL NOTICE\n\nSTANLEY BROCK Limited\n\nwill now be located at\n\n523-8th Avenue West\n\nCALGARY\n\nTelephone M 3950\n\nDec. 16th, 1935\nFebruary 7th, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: KOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nWe received a letter from you under date of April 14th, 1935, file #155-0-5, in which you advised us at that time that no decision had been made as to whether Laundry Equipment requested by the above school would be supplying during that fiscal year.\n\nWe are wondering if there is any likelihood of action being taken toward the purchase of this equipment very soon, and would appreciate it if you would advise us on this point.\n\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nManager.\n\nWESTERN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CANADIAN LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO.

The total cost would be approximately $860.\n\nI submit, for your reconsideration, that you be pleased to authorize the expenditure and advise the names of the firms who should be asked to quote. In this connection I would refer to my memorandum of the 6th ultimo, above mentioned.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. J.

Attached also are copies of Certificate of Inspection covering these boilers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the Kootenay Indian Residential School on October 22, 1936 - Original on File 155-0-6.\n\nWhile inspecting the sewing room, the Sister in charge showed me that of the five Singer machines, three are very old and one quite useless. The Sisters were very anxious to have two new machines. I would recommend that one tailor machine and one ordinary Singer machine be supplied. The Sisters have a very heavy programme in front of them in bringing this school up to the standard of the other Residential Schools in British Columbia, from which it appears to have fallen away greatly since my last inspection.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThe school has two fire escapes located one at each end of the building. Fire Drills are held regularly, but I would ask the Department to satisfy itself that instruction is given in the use of the FIRE ESCAPES FROM THE DORMITORIES. I held a Drill when the children were in school, but this was only possible from the various classrooms, as the children do not appear to have been instructed lately in making use of the escapes from the dormitories. Instruction should be given in this at a time other than that of inspection. The drill was well conducted and the school cleared in under one minute FROM THE CLASSROOMS.\n\nI went over the whole school with the Principal. Toilets Wash Rooms, Kitchens and Boiler Room, etc., were perfectly clean. It appears to me that during the period following my inspection of last year, and previous to the new arrangement under which the Sisters of Charity from Halifax took charge, the school was allowed to fall below its previous high standard. The Sisters are working hard to have everything up to standard. The Kitchen is dark, the floor even more broken than last year, and the whole place full of flies. I asked that some effort be made to keep these flies out or to destroy them. Were screens to be put over the kitchen windows there would not be sufficient light. I would ask that some money be spent on the kitchen in renewing the floor tiles, replacement of old wash tubs for washing plates, etc. At present the kitchen does not appear to me to be in a sanitary\n\n(over)\ncondition, though the Sisters tell me they are doing all in their power to keep it clean, and that the particular Sister in charge of this part of the school is heartbroken with conditions in the Basement Kitchen. I feel certain that the Department will do something about remedying the poor conditions complained of in this part of the school.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**November 6th 1936**\n\n**SHIP TO:** Rev.

The surface of the stove is 9 feet by 3 feet, over three ovens and a single fire box (2'6\" x 1' x 1') at one end. Only one oven, the one next to the chimney, gives fairly good results. The other two cannot be sufficiently heated to roast meat or to bake. Besides there is a very limited space on the top of the stove that can be made hot enough to boil potatoes and to prepare half a dozen other necessary things for meals. Under these adverse conditions, the cook and her aids have an almost impossible task to prepare properly and to serve on time twice daily, meals for a hundred hungry persons.\n\nSomething must be done either to remodel this present stove to improve its efficiency or to install an entirely new one guaranteed to give satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMichael Murphy.\nPrincipal.\nKootenay Indian Residential School\nCranbrook, B.C.\nDecember 11, 1935.\n\nAndrew Irwin Esq.\nIndian Agent\nKootenay Agency.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince my arrival here in September, I have been confronted with many trying difficulties in the kitchen department. It is impossible to contend with these, unless help can be obtained from you.\n\nYou may ask what these difficulties entail. The greatest and most important is with regard to the stove used for preparing the meals. When one has a number close to one hundred to feed, does it not seem impossible to do so without the necessary equipment, namely a good, serviceable stove? The present one does not give sufficient heat on the top of the stove and ovens, due to the fact that there is but one fire box to supply heat for three ovens.\n\nI feel certain that you will consider this appeal and do what you can to help me.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary Theresa\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter No. 155-0-5 of November 6th, I beg to enclose herewith copies of letters received from Rev. Michael Murphy, Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School and Sister Mary Dorina, who is the dietician at the institution. I need hardly say that the kitchen at this school is in a deplorable condition and requires decorating and renovating from top to bottom. The floor will need considerable repairing and the sinks are not fit for further service. The walls are cracked in places and have not been painted for a great number of years, and it has been suggested by Father Murphy that, if the Department would supply the paint, the school staff would undertake to do the work. I have, therefore, secured an estimate covering the various items in connection with the work that should be done in this kitchen from Frank Parks and Company, Cranbrook, which I enclose herewith and would recommend to the Department the necessity of going as far as possible towards meeting the wishes of the Principal and the staff of this school to carry out the recommendations suggested by Inspector Barry on the occasion of his visit to the school in October last.\n\nKindly advise at your convenience and oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 18, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery to the Kootenay Indian Residential School of the paint mentioned in your letter, at an approximate cost of $45.00.\n\nRegarding the stove requested by the Principal, it will be necessary for you to give more definite information regarding the style of stove that is required. You should state whether wood or coal is used. If at all possible, you should give the catalogue number of one of the manufacturers of kitchen stoves. On receipt of this information, the Principal's request will receive immediate consideration.\n\nWith reference to the sinks, the Department will have no funds available for this purpose between now and the end of the fiscal year. You might write again early in April, stating exactly what style of sink you consider would be most suitable for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

The price is reasonable and the expenditure, if at all possible, should be approved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

If the Department now provides a new sink, it will mean that some of the articles referred to above cannot be supplied this year. You should discuss this phase of the situation with the Principal, and, if he prefers the sink, arrangements will be made for its purchase.\n\nYou may expend $35.00 for material and labour in repairing the kitchen floor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nAndrew Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nSt Eugene Mission Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the date of my visit, the 21st of April, there were 89 children in the school. Only a few being still on the T.B. list and kept segregated. This is from the health point of view, a great improvement over a number of years ago, and the main credit for this must be given to the late principal and Dr. Green.\n\nI found the fire fighting apparatus in good order, extinguishers filled, fire escapes easy of access. Fire axes need to be placed at partitions. The dormitories were clean and in good order, as were the class rooms.\n\nThe children had had for breakfast Cereal, bread, honey, coffee.\nDinner: Beef stew, spinach, potatoes.\nSupper: Macaroni-cheese, bread and jam.\nWith milk three times a day.\n\nSince my last visit, a number of Sisters had been placed in the school, and everything was much cleaner, and tidier than for many years. They have certainly pulled things together, though for various reasons, working under a great handicap, as will be shown later in this report. It is time, therefore, and only fair to them that these matters be given consideration.\n\nFirstly: The floors throughout the dormitories are a disgrace, worn out through age, and impossible, with the best will in the world to keep clean and sanitary. The floor in the kitchen, laid in small ceramic tiles, is constantly coming to pieces. It should be relaid in cemented linoleum tile, or crushed or polished marble terrazine, I think it is called. In addition, this is a small and dark kitchen, with unsanitary walls. They should be white tiled anyway half way up for cleanliness and light. Sinks for washing up dishes, etc are totally inadequate. Two more sinks for this purpose should be placed in the dining room (no room elsewhere). This is important too, in that there are still some T.B. cases. A wheeled serving table should also be supplied as at other schools. The kitchen stove wants repairs. The hot water supply is quite inadequate, both for washing up and the laundry. A steam boiler for this purpose should be installed. Further, as regards the laundry, the clothes drying closet is out of order and not in use for want of steam to heat same. New steam pipes should be installed at the same time as the boiler. Further, there is no form of refrigeration in this school and in the summer, or winter for that matter, food is apt to go bad. An electric refrigerator should be installed. However, this is impossible, as the present electrical power is inadequate for the needs right now. The engine is old, worn out, and costly to run. I should suggest a 12 H.P. Deisel engine.\nIn fact the whole school wants repairs, replacements, and improvements if it is to be continued as a Residential school. A thorough survey by an architect or competent person should be undertaken. Personally, I think, four day schools would be more satisfactory, except perhaps for the prevalence of T.B. in this agency.\n\nLavatories on the Girls' side of the school were clean and well looked after. On the boys' side they were a disgrace. Excreta caked hard on many of the seats. I must say in most of the schools I find the boys' toilets more or less unsatisfactory. It would seem as though the class of men placed in charge were insufficiently trained in cleanliness, or careless in the matter.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 18th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is an extract from Inspector Pragnell's report regarding his inspection of the Kootenay Indian Residential School on May 10th:\n\n\"The floors throughout the dormitories are a disgrace, worn out through age, and impossible, with the best will in the world, to keep clean and sanitary.

Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nOfficial\nOfficial letter of April 1st authorized repairs to the stove at a cost of $65.00 and our letter of April 27th authorized $35.00 for material and labour in repairing the kitchen floor. Apparently, these repairs were not carried out at the time of the Inspector's visit.\n\nThe following amounts were provided in our current year's appropriation for the Kootenay Residential School:\n\n- Laundry equipment - $870.00\n- Grain binder - $230.00\n- General repairs - $300.00\n\nTotal - $1,400.00\n\nWe have already authorized expenditures during the current fiscal year of $100.00, and this leaves a balance of $1,300.00.\n\nThe Department does not require the balance spent in the exact way it has been provided, if there are other repairs or improvements that the Principal and yourself consider more necessary. You should consult him at once and advise the Department at the earliest possible date regarding the repairs and replacements which you consider advisable, giving an estimate of the cost in each case.

The Inspector's report is entirely accurate, so much so that in my opinion, substantial appropriations for general repairs will be required for several years if the school and school premises are to be kept in a reasonably fair state of preservation.\n\nWith reference to the second page of your letter which states that official letters of April 1 and April 27 respectively, authorize repairs to the stove at a cost of $35, and $35 for material and labor. In repairing the kitchen floor, as you surmised these repairs were not carried out at the time of the Inspector's visit, in deference to a request from the dietician that the work be delayed until the holiday season. The Sister in charge of this work explained that it would be most difficult for her to carry on with her task of preparing meals for so many people in the kitchen were busy overhauling the floor and making repairs to the stove. The holiday season, however, has now arrived and the repairs referred to have been completed.\n\nThe principal and the dietician in charge are particularly anxious to have a new sink, as referred to in my previous letter, installed during the month of July; price quoted as submitted to the Department recently was $475. I kindly advise if this purchase may be made very soon in order that the new sink, so urgently needed, may be installed during the present month. It is understood that laundry equipment will not be purchased this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

The Inspector's impressions regarding progress during the year made by the school in general, due to the constant efforts of a well trained and highly efficient teaching staff, will doubtless be noted in his report. Also improvements in the building, the new Monelmet sinks in the kitchen, repairs to tile floors, kitchen stove etc., the moving of a partition between the storeroom and kitchen burlap in the hall, painting and enamelling kitchen and storeroom. A new floor should be laid in the boys' dormitory and more painting throughout the school is urgently needed.\n\nThe Inspector stressed the necessity of more frequent Fire Drill as a safeguard against the danger of a general stampede should a fire occur in the school.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nMar. 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs noted in the estimates for 1938-39 I beg to make application herewith in triplicate for roofing material to repair the roof of the Kootenay Indian Residential School at a price not to exceed $25.00.\n\nThe work of spreading the roofing material will be done by a member of the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAI/EF\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nMar. 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs noted in the estimates for 1938-39 I have to make application herewith in triplicate for roofing material to repair the roof of the Kootenay Indian Residential School at a price not to exceed $25.00.\n\nThe work of spreading the roofing material will be done by a member of the staff.\n\n[Signature]\nAndrew J.

A. Hope,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nVictoria Public Building,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nFebruary 11th, 1938.\n\nMr. C. F. Dawson,\nDist. Res. Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Engine at St. Eugene Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nIn answer to letter from Major D. M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., dated February 8th, 1938, I beg to report as follows. On looking at my records of the above school, I find that the following machinery is in operation:\n\nSchool Lighting Plant.\n\nThis plant consists of a 7 H.P. Fetter Horizontal Gasoline Engine directly connected to a 4 K.W. 125V. 32A.D.C. Generator. The current from this floats through the batteries.\n\nLaundry\n\nThe Laundry Machinery is operated by a Motor and the power is supplied by a 15 H.P. Otto Gasoline Engine directly connected to a 10 K.W. 125V. 80A. D.C. Canadian Westinghouse Generator.\n\nWater Service\n\nThe water service is supplied by a Gould 5\" x 6\" Triplex Pump, belt connected to a 7 H.P. Z type Canadian Fairbanks Morse Gasoline Engine, also a No. 3 Canadian Fairbanks Morse air compressor used to provide air pressure in the storage tank for the fresh water system.\n\nFrom the above it is somewhat difficult to judge which engine is partly out of commission, and unless the Z type engine has a special fuel pump installed, the fuel feed is generally supplied by suction from a small tank. In either case the fuel pump plunge or piston is only from 3/8\" to 1/2\" in diameter and about 4\" long. Possibly the difficulty in taking it out is caused by the piston being somewhat worn and having a ridge inside the gland.\n\nI would ...\nI would suggest that the Engineer take the whole Engine down and take off the fuel pump casting and take it to a Garage or Machine Shop and have it reground or renewed. In either case the cost should not exceed $10.00. While the engine is down the valves should be reground and the piston rings and other internal parts thoroughly cleaned out.\n\nWhen I visit the school next summer I will make an inspection of this engine and report on same.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n\"T. J. Arnall.\"\n\nTJA/LT\n\nEngineer, D.P.W.\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-the diesel motor at the St. Eugene Mission, as I understand this motor is at the time of writing not in operation it would not inconvenience your operations to have it brought into the shop.\n\nOn this basis that it be brought in here where we have every facility for dismantling and reassembling such units, we will make the following quotation:\n\nTo stripping engine, examining all running gear and reporting work necessary and reassembling motor ........................................... $30.00\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCranbrook Foundry and Machine Shops.\n\nPer C. E. MacKinnon.\nDear Sir: Re Kootenay (St. Eugene) Indian Residential School.\n\nI enclose copy of a report by Mr. T. J. Arnall, Engineer for the Department of Public Works, with reference to the condition of a Petter Diesel engine at the Kootenay Indian Residential School near Cranbrook. As you will see from the contents, it is necessary that this engine be repaired immediately.\n\nIn the meanwhile, an attempt was made by Indian Agent Irwin to obtain an estimate as to the cost of repair of this engine. The Cranbrook Foundry and Shop company, however, stated in a letter to the Indian Agent, copy of which is enclosed, that they could make no estimate without dismantling the machine. Their argument seemed a good one and we then asked them for an estimate of dismantling and then reassembling the motor, if necessary. They estimate the cost as $50.00. I enclose a copy of this estimate. While this is a fair charge for the dismantling and reassembling of a machine, it would seem out of proportion to the probable cost of repairs required according to Mr. Arnall\u2014see his letter enclosed. However, if you consider it necessary for a definite estimate to be first made before authorizing the repair, this seems the only way out of it. If, therefore, you concur in this, I shall be much obliged if you will authorize me to allow Indian Agent Irwin to incur this expenditure.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo, you may authorize an expenditure not exceeding $20.00 in repairing the Petter Diesel engine at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter No. 155-0-5 of the 7th instant, in which you authorize an expenditure not exceeding $30.00 in repairing the Petter Diesel engine at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIf you will kindly read my letter No. 23/3562 of the 30th ultimo again, you will find that this $30.00 is asked for the purpose of dismantling the machine in order to find out what is wrong. A full explanation is also given for the reason why this expenditure has to be incurred in this way.\n\nI shall be much obliged, therefore, if you will alter the wording of your authorization to \"dismantling\" instead of \"repairing.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the Petter Diesel engine at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nOn reviewing your letter of May 30 it is found that it was stated that $30.00 would be required for dismantling and re-assembling this machine. Authority is hereby given for this expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 28th, File No. 155-0-5 with reference to Laundry equipment, Tubular boiler and Refrigerator for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I can only say that I regret the delay in supplying this information for you but enclose herewith a letter from Mr. H. S. Barnes, General Manager for Parks & Company, which explains itself.\n\nMr. Barnes visited the Kootenay Indian Residential School with me early in May and found, on investigation, that a suitable tubular boiler of sufficient size called for by the Reverend Michael Murphy, O.M.I., Principal of the School, would be wholly inadequate to do the work required and, if installed, would later have to be replaced by a more powerful steam boiler such as described in his letter of July 4th.\n\nMr. Barnes, therefore, decided to take no move in the matter before consulting a Mechanical Engineer with respect to the type of boiler required to supply sufficient steam for the Laundry equipment and domestic hot water for the School.\n\nMr. Stanley B. Jamieson, Mechanical Engineer of Metals Limited, Calgary, arrived in Cranbrook on Saturday, July 2nd, and in company with Mr. Barnes, Reverend Michael Murphy and myself made a thorough investigation of the heating requirements of the School and his report, which deals minutely and in much detail with the above, I herewith enclose.\n\nI also enclose a catalogue showing the Kelvinator system of Refrigeration together with a letter of evaluation regarding details in connection with this system, also prices and cost of installation. With this information before us I feel that if it is not possible to meet the suggested expenditure this year it might be well to defer the purchase until 1930 rather than to install less expensive systems which would not give the same satisfactory results. A boiler for instance which, according to expert advice, would not be capable of supplying sufficient hot water to meet the requirements of the School.\n\nAside regretting the unavoidable delay in replying to your letter, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Huchcroft, at \"KOOTENAY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\" - St. Eugene Mission, near Cranbrook, B.C., for services in December 1912 and Feb. 1913, Department of INDIAN AFFAIRS? If so, who received payment of it?\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn examining old files the undersigned is reminded of non-receipt of payment cheques for services rendered the Department of INDIAN AFFAIRS during the month of December 1912 and February 1913, as Inspector of Construction at KOOTENAY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, St. Eugene Mission, near Cranbrook, B.C., a matter upon which an explanation had been received from another official, who was not responsible for such matters, to the effect that the payments would be eventually made but that it might take some time and that interest at six percent would be allowed.\n\nThat assurance was given me when being called upon for extra services months later, by the engineer who placed me in charge at the outset, and who was asked about the delayed payments at completion of the inspection services previously rendered but no final report having been acknowledged as received and the inspector relieved from duty. Resting upon that assurance the time has lapsed and the matter overlooked till recently.\n\nMay this matter have your scrutiny and, in event of paycheques having been issued and endorsed as paid by the Bank, the name or names of endorsers be reported to me as the proper party to acknowledge such payments? Should no payments be ascertained as having been made may a report be received as to what adjustment may be expected and when?\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am Sir,\n\nSincerely Yours\n\nJ.F. Huchcroft,\n\nJ.F.H.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Payments to J.F. Hutchcroft\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from J.F. Hutchcroft of Cranbrook, B.C., in connection with services at Kootenay Industrial School in the year 1912-13 for your attention.\n\nIn the Auditor General's Report of 1912-13, Vol. I, Page H-72, a payment of $2,064.42 to J.H. Hutchford is shown for salary and various other expenses.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nMines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 9, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo in further reference to vouchers forwarded for accounts claimed to be due to you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the account for the four day's services as inspector in July, 1911, apparently did not reach the Department, although you state that it was mailed in October, 1911. It seems rather strange to the Department that when you did not receive payment of this voucher you delayed drawing its attention to the matter until this late date. It has been decided, however, to pay you.\n\nThe cheque No. 2570 of February 17th, last, was payment for your services as inspector during the month of December. The stating of January on the cheque was a clerical error and you are aware that your services as inspector ceased on December 31st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. F. Huchcroft, Esq.,\nCranbrook, B.

In this connection I would refer you to official letter of June 9, 1913.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. McCookin,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. F. Huchcroft, Esq.,\nP.O.

May I suggest that the Petter Diesel engine at the Kootenay Indian Residential School cannot be used again until the necessary repairs have been made and, for your information, I wish to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. G.E. MacKinnon, Manager of the Cranbrook Foundry and Machine Shops of Cranbrook which gives the details in connection with the repairs required and the price involved.\n\nKindly advise at your convenience if authority is granted to have these very necessary repairs made, in time to have the engine installed before the beginning of the new School year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Andrew Irwin\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.

I doubt however, if the outlay can be avoided as I understand the firm submitting the quotation is the only one in Cranbrook qualified to do the work required. Moreover, the engine should be repaired and in position for operation when the school term begins on September 1st.\n\nI may say that I am somewhat reluctant to recommend this expenditure, but under the circumstances it cannot well be avoided. I should appreciate being advised at an early date of the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

McGOOKIN, Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your file No. 155-0-5, your letter of 4th Inst., refers me to official letter of June 9th, 1913, of which a copy is not available owing to same having been destroyed by fire some years ago.\n\nThe figures quoted from Vol. I, Page H-72, Auditor General's report for 1912-3, appear to show that ten salary payments must have been paid, while only nine were received and endorsed by me.\n\nServices as Inspector were intended to have terminated at the end of 1912, as you state from information on your files, but during January and a few days in February 1913, release from duty had not been effected until final report of Feb. 4th, 1913, which does not appear to have been followed by any further correspondence, excepting the official letter of June 9, 1913, of which I must rely upon memory for guidance.\n\nIt appears to me that one monthly salary cheque has not been received by me and this may be ascertained by examination of the returned paid cheques.\n\nIt also appears, from Memo. at hand, that a cheque for January, 1913, had been received but none for December, 1912, nor the portion of early February, 1913; that matter being probably what was covered by official letter of June 9, 1913, a copy of which might inform me.\n\nIn order to reduce the problem to a minimum may I trouble you to have a copy of that official letter of June 9, 1913; also to have you examine the paid cheques for months of Dec. & Jan., year 1912-13 and the signatures of payee compared in case there may have been one for each of those months.\n\nOwing to no data to show how the amount $2,064.42 is made up, but at my disposal because of not having a copy of the Auditor General's report for that year may I ask you to send me a Memo of the items?\n\nThanking you for the trouble you have gone to in the matter and in anticipation of your obliging me by the further search of vouchers and examination of cheques and a copy of the latter mentioned, I am hoping that such may clear up what is to me a problem of importance and a bother to you.\n\nSincerely Yours\n\nJ.F.H.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJ.

Price ..................$2,452.00\"\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent in which he states that Parks & Co. supplied a separate quotation of $620.00 for the domestic hot water steam heater and that consequently the following words should not have been included in your purchase order -- \"including new boiler vertical type, 42 inches\".\n\nPlease review the quotations which you received from this Company on the equipment for the Kootenay School and advise me as soon as possible whether or not the domestic hot water steam heater was included in the price of $2452.00. If you advise that it was not included this Branch will consider whether or not funds can be provided for supplying this heater at the present time.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPenticton, B.C.\n\nNovember 13, 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am returning herewith a letter from Indian Agent Irwin, No.2-10 dated October 25th 1938 and a copy of a report made by Fire Chief Adams of Cranbrook which was forwarded to you by Mr. Irwin.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions the circumstances under which the Fire Chief made his investigation were inquired into, and the various recommendations made in his report of October 25th were checked with great care while I carried out my own inspection of the Kootenay Indian Residential School on November 9th and 10th. With Indian Agent Irwin I called on Mr. Adams at the Cranbrook Fire Hall, and there discussed his report with the Fire Chief.\n\nThe inspection made by Fire Chief Adams at the Kootenay Indian Residential School on October 14th last was made at the request of the Indian Agent and the Reverend Principal of the school, but as far as I could learn the Indian Agent asked Mr. Adams to visit the Residential School and report on what he found there with regard to fire hazards and equipment etc. This was in connection with Fire Prevention Week.\n\nMr. Adams is Fire Chief of Cranbrook, and as such an Assistant Fire Marshal for B.C. He admitted to me that he had no jurisdiction over Dominion Government Buildings even in Cranbrook. He had visited the Kootenay Indian School on former occasions. The Cranbrook Fire Department had responded to fire calls from the school on three occasions, the last time being over eight years ago as they have not been there since my appointment as Inspector of Indian Schools in February 1931. If asked to inspect a building he has jurisdiction, but not over Government Buildings. On this occasion he was requested to visit the school by the Indian Agent.\n\nThere is some plaster off a few walls and ceilings as stated by the Fire Chief. In my opinion this is not any worse here than in many other Indian schools in B.C. The Principal stated to me that he would make an effort to have necessary repairs made by the school staff and boys.\n\nAs mentioned in my report on the school it would be well to have the electric light wiring examined by experts and replaced when found in poor condition, the necessary insulation being supplied when missing. The wiring is not in good repair, but I did not see any great danger hazard.\n\nThe stove pipes in laundry and drying room are old and might well be replaced by rivetted lengths properly supported by wires. This would not cost much. In the Bakery I have recommended in my report that a piece of zincor tin plate be placed under the ovens so that the floor under the fire boxes and in front of the same be protected. The bricks suggested by the Fire Chief would be an added protection but are not in my opinion absolutely necessary.\nI am in agreement with the statements of the Fire Chief with regard to the necessity for an adequate Fire Alarm System. I have recommended the provision of six 10 inch Fire Gongs. There should be two of these gongs on each floor including the basement, one being at each end of the school. Seven break-the-glass alarm boxes will be required one near each gong, and one in the main hall near the front door. There would also be of course a switch in the Principal's office for drill purposes. The whole of the wiring system in connection with the proposed new gongs needs replacement.\n\nThe question of PANIC BOLTS was discussed with the Fire Chief and I understand that these are being placed on all exits in public buildings in B.C. They cost from $10.00 up per door. I suggest that this question be looked into by the Department with a view of having these modern safety bolts on all doors opening to Fire Escapes in our Indian Residential Schools. If the Department agree with me that such bolts should take the place of all locks and other means of securing exits to Fire Escapes arrangements could no doubt be made through Indian Agents to have this work done in all our Indian Residential Schools and the same approved pattern of panic bolts used throughout our schools. Electric alarms could be attached when desired by school authorities.\n\nThe oil mentioned on the floor of the engine room was caused by the defect in the diesel engine previously reported by me and now rectified.\n\nThe openings in the ceiling of the Battery Room can be made by the Manual Training Class by boring a few holes. That is all that is necessary to take the gas if any away. It should be noted however that the gas chlorine is a heavy gas and holes should also be made in the lower part of the doors of the room. This is not important.\n\nThe gasolene pump should be in the open. The windows between the Garage and the Bakery should be filled in.\n\nI do not agree with the Fire Chief in regard to the provision of standard or any other sort of stand pipes or the provision of any hose for the protection of the outbuildings. The Department is well aware that the system of DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY recommended in one of my reports five or six years ago has been chosen as against a more expensive alternative system. The present domestic water system is giving excellent service. It is quite inadequate in the case of fire fighting for which it was never intended. Stand pipes and hose will only be required when the Department has funds enough to install a new fire fighting water system the plans of which are on file with the Department. I can not recommend that this be done at the present time.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that in much that the Fire Chief has reported there is an element of what I may call exaggeration. Conditions are not as poor as he makes out. Two items not mentioned by him are of much greater importance than many that are mentioned. I have mentioned them in my report on the school. They are the need for having the soda type extinguisher inspected and if necessary refilled each year and such work certified on tags attached to each extinguisher; and the very urgent need that the children be practised in fire drill down the escapes before winter weather makes this impossible. All snow should be kept off the escapes by cleaning these after each fall. The wisdom of having outside inspectors inspect our schools without Departmental authority is open to doubt.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Berry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a special report by School Inspector Barry upon the fire protection question at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. You will note this question arose through a report made by the District Fire Marshall, Mr. Adams, of Cranbrook.\n\nIn connection with this report I would like to recommend that the matter of the electric wiring throughout the school should be thoroughly examined and reported upon by experts so that whatever happens to be of doubtful safety can be rectified.\n\nSecondly, the stove pipes in the laundry and drying-room should be immediately attended to, as they are a danger of fire.\n\nThe installation of a proper fire alarm system with gongs is necessary here. This should be along the line of the same installation as has been made in other schools.\n\nThe floor of the bakery should be attended to by having sheet iron put down on top of the wood floor,\u2014an easy matter, though it is possible that a cement floor would be the safer and better in the long run.\n\nWith reference to the matter of panic bolts, this is a new question to ourselves, though apparently now being installed in other public buildings. The cost, too, is probably high, as it would mean installation in all other Residential Schools. Of course, as suggested, we might start with the Kootenay Residential School, but if they are of real necessity there, it would appear to me as though they were of possibly equal necessity in the other schools.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI ......\nI sometimes think that a set of fire protection regulations should be drawn up and issued to the Principal of every Residential School. By so doing, it would, I should think, obviate some protection measures not being missed out,\u2014for instance, the locking of any fire escape doors or windows at any time unless the key were suspended handy in a glass case, the proper testing yearly of the fire extinguishers, and hose, etc. I mention this because on inspections it is so easy for some little point to be missed out, as it is also easy for the School Principal or Indian Agent to forget something; whereas if they have a properly drawn up set of rules, their administration would at least be uniform.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

These improvements, in my opinion, are urgently needed in order to facilitate rapid and safe movement of the staff and children in the event of a fire. As stated in the Inspector's report, the present water supply would be quite inadequate to fight a fire which means that, in the event of so great a disaster under present conditions, it would be little short of a miracle if the buildings could be saved. In view of these facts protection of human lives, protection of the property investment would indicate the necessity of further efforts to secure a water supply adequate to reduce to a minimum, the ever present risk and danger of fire and the consequent loss in property, if not in human lives, that would be sure to follow.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReporting on his inspection of the Kootenay Indian Residential School Inspector Barry reports that the door to the fire escape was locked. In this regard I would direct your attention to the first paragraph of circular letter of February 10, 1938, which was issued to all Indian Agents and Principals of Residential Schools. The Department expects Principals to carry out the instructions contained in this circular. If the fire extinguishers in the school have not been recharged within the past year you should forward a request for the recharges that are necessary giving full particulars of the size of the fire extinguishers for which the recharges are required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The stove pipes in the laundry and drying room may be replaced.\n\nYou may arrange for an examination of the electric wiring throughout the school and supply me with an estimate of the cost of putting the wiring in good condition. I am doubtful that funds for the purpose can be provided in the current year's appropriation. However, definite decision in this regard will not be made until your reply is received. In connection with the last paragraph of your letter I would refer you to Paragraph 1 of circular letter of February 10, 1938, in which it is distinctly stated that the doors leading to fire escapes must be kept unlocked.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your No. 155/0/5 of December 14th, with reference to a report from Inspector Barry in connection with his inspectorial visit to the Kootenay Indian Residential School, in which he stated that a door to a fire escape was locked. It is indeed a fact that a situation of this kind is extremely serious and when it was mentioned to the Principal he stated that he had not the faintest idea as to how it happened to be locked at the time or who could have been responsible. Reverend Father Collins, I am sure, has thoroughly familiarized himself with the instructions laid down in the Circular letter of February 10, 1938 and, in my opinion, is doing his utmost to see that they are strictly adhered to.\n\nI am assured by the Reverend Principal that the fire extinguishers in the School have been recharged within the year and are always kept in a fit condition to meet an emergency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAI/EF\nRe File No. 155-0-5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 15th, with reference to a domestic hot water heating system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I may say that it is not expected that this should be supplied at this time. My letter of the 14th ultimo was written merely for the purpose of pointing out that, while a domestic hot water system appeared to be expected in the purchase order of August 6th, No. 6691, it was not included in the amount of the original tender.\n\nThe Department, in my opinion, have been very generous in their expenditures for the School last year. It is hoped, however, that it may be possible to supply and install a domestic hot water heating system in 1939. It is needless to say that the same is urgently needed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAI/EF\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nElectrical Merchandise and Contracting\n\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nJANUARY TWENTY 1939\n\nINDIAN AGENT\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe take pleasure in enclosing herewith our report and estimate on the cost of installing a FIRE ALARM SYSTEM and making repairs to existing wiring in the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nWe have made a very careful survey of the wiring system in this school. Accurate tests were made of all the circuit on each floor to determine the condition of the wires in the concealed raceways. Tests were also made on every circuit and feeder wire for shorts and grounds.\n\nCertain hazardous conditions exist which have been largely caused by additions and extensions to the present system. These defective extensions consist for the most part of outlets wired in cotton lamp cord strictly against the code requirements. We have itemized these defective parts and quoted on the cost of placing all wiring in first class shape.\n\nPerhaps the greatest cause for inefficiency of this system lies in the method of current distribution at the main panel or switchboard. At the time of installation the demands were fairly light and ample battery and generator capacities were available. The system was connected as a straight battery charging system and the bulk of the load was handled by batteries alone after the plant was shut down. Also the large gasoline driven generator could easily handle the battery charging load and the complete house load if necessity arose. To this end the batteries were connected for charging through a switching arrangement that allowed them to be charged in parallel. This means that the battery unit consisting of fifty-six cells of two volts each would be connected in two groups of twenty-eight cells for charging and would be charged back to one unit of fifty-six cells for discharging or operating the system. For stability a limiting resistor was introduced in the battery circuit for charging. If lights were required when the batteries were on charge they were obtained directly from the generator.\n\nAs noted above this was fairly satisfactory when the load was comparatively small. With the introduction a few months ago of electrical refrigeration and the normal increased use of appliances the overall load is considerably higher. To further aggravate the condition a diesel driven generator of only half the capacity of the original job is used to charge the batteries. With the hook up already described the charging load and house load far exceeds the capacity of the diesel generator and many times the equipment is working far below its normal voltage output.\n\nWe would strongly recommend that this entire set up be reconnected so that at peaks the batteries would aid the generator and at minimum demands sufficient current would be introduced into the batteries to keep them fully charged.\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nElectrical Merchandise and Contracting\n\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nThe manner in which a changeover is made from the gasoline generator to the diesel generator is very poor and does not comply with the electrical code in any respect. The wiring from the diesel generator to the switchboard is ensnared in ordinary water pipe and the wiring is dripping with fuel oil. No terminal fittings of any sort are provided. The generator itself is thoroughly soaked in fuel oil and badly needs cleaning.\n\nCertain new wiring is badly needed and we have listed this separately. This consists of lights in the garage, toilet, and engine room etc.\n\nWe thank you for this opportunity of quoting and trust that the information supplied is that which you require. Please call upon us if any further data is required.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMODERN ELECTRIC\nREPORT AND ESTIMATE ON WIRING AT KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nTHIRD FLOOR\n\nWiring from panel distributed in four circuits. Tests show no grounds and normal voltage drop. Three defective conditions were noted as follows:\n(1) An underfloor outlet wired to bedroom with cotton lamp cord partly enclosed in water pipe. No boxes or fittings installed.\n(2) A surface extension wired in cotton lamp cord stapled to ceiling.\n(3) Two defective floor plugs and one socket.\n\nEstimated cost of executing above work to code requirements-\nMaterial $5.91 Labor $4.25 TOTAL $10.16\n\nSECOND FLOOR\n\nWiring from panel distributed in eight circuits. Tests show no grounds normal voltage drop and good distribution. Hazardous conditions exist as follows:\n(1) Outside light and switch wired in cotton lamp cord stapled direct to woodwork with no other insulation.\n(2) Long length of cotton cord in bedroom stapled to woodwork.\n(3) Outlet box covers missing and several untaped joints left exposed in ceiling boxes.\n(4) Convenience outlet in surgery and offices all wired with lamp cord in dangerous condition.\n(5) 6 volt bell system connected to 112 volt house current through a small resistor lamp. Very dangerous.\n(6) Several cords used as switch legs and some defective and loose fixtures.\n\nEstimated cost on eliminating above and bring same to code requirements-\nMaterial $19.20 Labor $17.75 Total $36.95\n\nFirst Floor\n\nWiring from panel in six circuits. No Grounds indicated. Normal voltage drop.\n\nHazardous conditions exist as follows:\n(1) Broken receptacles in lavatory\n(2) Conduit in laundry loose from ceiling. All drops equipped with brass sockets instead of porcelain. No wall switches provided.\n(3) Poor wiring in kitchen controlled by obsolete open knife switch enclosed in rough wooden box. Very dangerous. No porcelain fittings on conduit from starter or motor.\n(4) Defective fixtures in dining room.\n(5) Separator motor in bad condition and wiring thereto improperly done.\n(6) Several broken fittings require replacing\n\nEstimated cost-\nMaterial $27.26 Labor $20.50 TOTAL $47.76\nBoiler Room\n\nEntrance to this room from both in the building and outside is by steps down; this room is dark at all times and entrance must be made to this room in darkness. Switches controlling the lights from either entrances are code requirements and badly needed. Other wiring is in poor condition and requires repairs to bring up to standard.\n\nEstimated cost for this work-\n\nMaterial $17.50 Labor $8.50 Total $26.00\n\nEngine Room\n\nThis requires a complete going over to obtain maximum efficiency. Switchboard wiring is badly mixed up and reverse current relay requires repairing to place it in operating condition. Wiring from diesel generator to the switchboard is extremely dangerous and should be replaced. The small generator requires dismantling and cleaning and adjusting.\n\nEstimated cost of this work-\n\nMaterial $25.84 Labor $24.00 Total $49.84\n\nBarn\n\nThe barn requires replacing of several switches and fittings, also the renewing of the wire to the cellar. The main switch box is badly damaged and requires renewing.\n\nCost of this work to put barn wiring in good condition-\n\nMaterial $12.20 Labor $5.60 Total $17.80\n\nFIRE ALARM SYSTEM\n\nThis includes complete wiring for standard fire alarm system enclosed in surface metal raceway to code requirements.\n\nWiring is designed to accommodate two sets of batteries in parallel to reduce the resistance of the rear or long switch arrangement. An outlet for a test switch is also incorporated in the system. The price does not include bells, batteries, break glasses or test switch. It provides for all wiring and boxes necessary to mount all units in a neat and proper manner. It provides for all labor including installation of items to be supplied by the department. The cost of this system complete would be $71.40.\n\nThis provides for placing of bells at the ends of each corridor on all floors.\n\nUnits used for testing calculations were as follows:\n\nBells EDWARDS #7 ECONOMY 669 volts.\nBreak Glasses EDWARDS #77\nTest Switch Standard Key rotary switch\nBatteries 2 Eveready #1562\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nElectrical Merchandise and Contracting\n\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nFEBRUARY FOURTH 1939\n\nINDIAN AGENT,\nCITY\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to quote on the following items necessary for the completion of the proposed FIRE ALARM SYSTEM at the KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n6 only NO. 17 EDWARDS 6-8 volt 10\" BELLS $95.70\n6 only NO. 77 EDWARDS Break Glass Switches 18.30\n1 only KEY test switch .95\n2 Batteries NO. 1562 TOTAL $120.85\n\nThe above items in addition to the cost of the work itemized in our report would reach a total of $380.76.

Recently a letter was received from Indian Agent Irwin in which he stated that a new domestic hot water system is a great necessity and that the estimated cost of installing this would be $620.00. As the funds in the 1939-40 appropriation will not be available before April 1 you might make further inquiries with a view to ascertaining and advising me whether the new hot water system or the new electric wiring is more necessary. In view of the amount provided in our next year's appropriation it will not be possible to provide funds for both items.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

The proper supply of hot water is a necessity in any large school, and I would recommend that it take precedence over the fire alarm system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

The existing fire alarm system should, with the exercise of reasonable care and precaution, be made do for another year. I would therefore recommend that a new domestic water supply system be provided from the $700.00 set aside for this school.

Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast Fall we submitted to you to be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs our estimates for the Kootenay Residential School for the year 1939-1940. Of the various items listed, one has already been granted, namely, the installation of domestic hot water; for which we are extremely grateful. At the present moment, work on this project is going forward.\n\nOf the other items requested, we have heard nothing. We feel that all are necessary for the upkeep of the building. The revision of the electric wiring and the installation of the fire-alarm system cannot be left for another year. The floors of the dormitories are in a disgraceful conditions due to twenty eight years of hard usage, and are sadly in need of replacement. Perhaps the greatest need of all is the necessary material to fix up our two fine attics into suitable Preventoriums for the school children who are to be segregated. Since the latest examination by the T.B. travelling clinic, six additional children have been placed upon the segregation list. If we are to continue to fight T.B. among the children, we should be given the means to do so. Segregation is one of the main weapons and the two well-lighted attics, if properly built up, will supply two fine dormitories for the boys and girls on the segregation list.\n\nWe trust that the Department will grant us the necessary material very soon in order that we may have the opportunity of doing the necessary work on the dormitories and preventoriums during the Summer vacation in preparation for the return of the school children in September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nJune 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend P.J. Collins, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which explains itself.\n\nAn itemized statement covering quantities and costs of materials required to transform the attics referred to by the Principal into first class segregation dormitories or Preventoriums for the boys and girls who require this special accommodation is shown in the Kootenay Agency Estimates for 1939-40. Also other requirements for the School including 2 Monmetal sinks.\n\nKindly refer to my letter of August 26, 1928, File 1-10, for fuller details in connection with these requirements and advise if under these serious circumstances with 6 additional children placed on the segregation list and no accommodation to keep them segregated if the urgently needed expenditures applied for in the estimates may be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 3rd., 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School with reference to changing the attics into dormitories.\n\nWhen preparing the appropriation for the current fiscal year, we found it possible to include an amount of $700.00 only for repairs and improvements at this school. The amount of $532.00 has already been used in purchasing a hot-water heater. This leaves a balance available of $168.00. Owing to the present set-up of our appropriation, it will not be possible to exceed the amount specifically provided.\n\nWith special reference to the Principal's suggestion with the attics be transformed into rooms suitable for segregation of T.B. children, I may say that at the present time the Department is not prepared to give any decision in view of the fact that Dr. P.E. Moore, of the Medical Branch expects to visit B.C. sometime this summer, in order to investigate the whole T.B. problem as it effects the schools of that province.\n\nIn the meantime if there are any repairs or improvements required which would not involve a larger expenditure than $168.00, the Department is prepared to favourably consider any recommendation that you may make.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nAndrew Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n11th August 1939\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn August 3rd, I wrote you with regard to next year's estimates, and, through you, asked the Department for a new Diesel power unit which is urgently needed at our School. The cost would be $2,100.00. Since then, I have received an offer from the East Kootenay Power Company of Fernie, B.C. to supply the School with power at a very reasonable rate. However, the Company feels that the School should carry the full cost of transformer and approximately two and a half miles of line with associated equipment to connect to our present system. The whole installation can be safely made for the sum of $8,300.00.\n\nThis seems a very large sum to ask from the Department, but it is not so; when one considers that the School requires a new power plant immediately at a cost of $2,100.00, and in the very near future, a new set of batteries, costing $5,000.00. These will have to be replaced again in seven years as this period of time represents the life time of a set of batteries. A power line to the school is a permanent job. A Diesel engine and batteries after a year or two in service give only grief and trouble.\n\nTrusting that the Department will see its way to providing for this very necessary expense for the School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\n3rd August 1939\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince I was named principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I have found that the lighting system is very poor. A short time ago I had an expert make a complete check-up of all the electric devices and lights used at the school and connected to the plant, with the following findings.\n\nMaximum light load possible Winter conditions: 12KW.\nMaximum day load covering Laundry, Kelvinator: 7KW.\nPotential Load maximum that could be imposed on the plant: 19KW.\n\nTo carry this load the school has a plant equipped with two generators if the following specifications:\n\n(1) Crossman Generator:\nOutput ........... 4 KW.\nVoltage .......... 125\nAmperage ......... 32\n\nThis unit is equipped with a 7 HP Petter Diesel engine and is quite economical in operation but is heavily overloaded.\n\n(2) Westinghouse Generator:\nOutput ........... 10 KW.\nVoltage .......... 125\nAmperage ......... 30\n\nThis unit is operated by a very old Fairbanks Morse 15 HP, single cylinder engine, in extremely poor shape and consequently wasteful in both lubricating oil and fuel (Gasoline), which renders it useless for economical generation of electrical energy.\n\nThe plant is also equipped with a set of storage batteries of 250 ampere hour rating. These are acid batteries, however, and are limited to a discharge of 10 amperes or a load of 1.12 K.W. which they will carry for a period of 25 hours.\nInspection shows that these batteries are in rather poor shape with considerable sediment collected in the bottoms of the jars and the plates badly warped from overload conditions. It is very doubtful if these batteries will last another season. From experience at the plant, it has been noticed that a sixty watt lamp operated from the batteries gives very little light and over a period of two hours reduces itself to a red glow, the only other device in use at the same time being the refrigeration plant.\n\nUnder present conditions at the school, the procedure is to use the 4 KW. motor generator set for all normal operations as it can be operated most economically. This is hardly a fair procedure as this machine is too small to meet with the requirements even with the help of the storage batteries. The result is that this unit and the batteries are heavily overloaded, especially during the Winter months.\n\nOriginally this plant consisted of the 10 KW. plant only and it is quite apparent that this was installed to take care of definite load conditions. These loads have been increased considerably in the past few years, but no arrangements have been made to take care of them; in fact, the capacity of the plant has been reduced to where a 4 KW. plant and battery set are expected to carry the load that was previously carried by a 10 KW. plant and the same set of batteries.\n\nSuggestions for the improvement of the power plant.\n\nThat a new Diesel power unit be purchased of 15 to 20 HP., and installed to operate the two generators. This power plant could also be connected to a line shaft so that it could be used for pumping water also, thereby serving a dual purpose. The unit recommended is illustrated in cuts attached. Caterpillar Tractor. This power plant can be operated at approximately $0.15 per hour for fuel, and under existing load conditions should give service without more than minor adjustments for from five to seven years. The cost of this unit FOB Cranbrook, Sales Tax included, would be $1520.00. Installations costs would amount to $75.00\n\nFor this installation a speed reduction unit would also be required, and this could be supplied for $225.00\n\nInstallations of proposed line shafts to transmit power to other devices, pumps, etc., could be carried out complete with belts and pulleys for $275.00\n\nTrusting that you will submit the above in your estimates to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[C.J.

The total cost of materials including heating and plumbing will run around $350.00. This is a very large sum for this school considering that it is carrying seventeen extra children for whom it is receiving no support from the Department.\n\nThere is a balance of $168.00 credited to this school from the year's estimates, I believe.

I may say, however, that in previous correspondence the Principal has stated that a new lighting plant was very necessary and also a certain amount of new flooring. If the Department attempts to provide these it will not be possible to also have funds for the fire alarm system due to the fact that our appropriations will likely be reduced and only the most necessary improvements can be made.\n\nYou might discuss the whole situation at Kootenay Residential School with the Principal and write to me again about May 1 at which time I hope to be in a better position to advise you what amount can be expended at Kootenay Residential School during the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have given consideration to a letter 2-10 dated April 20th 1940 from the Indian Agent at Cranbrook, and have examined the estimate from the Parks Hardware Co., of Cranbrook in regard to the provision of an iron fire escape at the rear of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe provision of a fire escape to take care of the children in the new T.B. dormitory and the proposed T.B. dormitory on the boys' side, these rooms being located on the attic floor of the school, was recommended on Page 5 and in the covering letter of my report on this school dated February 28th 1940.\n\nI am very anxious that the Department should not be put to any avoidable expenditure, particularly during the continuation of the present war, but I at the same time am anxious that the children have all possible protection in case of a fire at the school.\n\nThe estimated cost of the iron escape would appear to be quite a large sum. Under the circumstances might it not be possible to provide facilities for the escape of the children from the new dormitories by the provision of a wooden fire escape in place of one made of iron. At least as a temporary measure I am prepared to suggest such a wooden escape, provided it is so constructed that the platform at the top extends to each of the new T.B. rooms and there is some facility for the escape of the Reverend Sisters and others on the main dormitory floor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith tenders for the construction of a fire escape at Kootenay Indian Residential School, received from the Indian Agent, showing the cost of an iron structure to be $1,050.00 and a wooden one to be $469.00. Both these tenders are from the Parks Hardware, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nI am also enclosing a memorandum on this matter dated April 29th, 1940, by Mr. Inspector Barry.\n\nI would recommend the application for consideration, if funds for this purpose are available during the current fiscal year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nFer D.

Consequently when preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year an amount of $1800.00 was included for lighting equipment and $500.00 for flooring.\n\nBefore considering the erection of the fire escape mentioned in your letter the Department would appreciate being advised if the two items mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this letter are required. If they are, it is considered that they should receive first consideration.\n\nIn the event of your ascertaining that lighting equipment and flooring are needed detailed information should be supplied in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

In that event you should, of course, supply the information requested in the last paragraph of my letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOctober 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 155-0-5.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letters of August 19th and September 5th regarding certain improvements at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, for which a sum of $2,500 is available.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Irwin has now reported that the most urgent needs of the school are the provision of a new lighting plant and new floors for the dormitories.\n\nThe Reverend Principal considers that the Mark 6-M Ruston, single cylinder, horizontal, semi-diesel, hot bulb engine rated at 25 horse power and 269 revolutions is the most suitable for the school's requirements. The price of this engine, f.o.b. Vancouver, is given at $1,100. The batteries required with such a unit would in all probability cost approximately $600.\n\nBefore making a recommendation in this matter I am securing from the Vivian Engine Works Ltd. a price on a unit that would be suitable for the Kootenay School. The Ruston engine being offered is new but has been in stock a considerable time and I doubt if the Department would be well advised to buy an engine of a type that may now be out of date and for which parts might be very difficult to obtain.\n\nWe have had the greatest satisfaction from the Vivian engines purchased, one of which is operating the electric lighting plant at Kuper Island Residential School. No difficulty has been experienced in securing parts and the manufacturers have always been ready to advise and assist in connection with their engines when called upon.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 8, 1940.\n\nNew flooring for the dormitories should be provided and Mr. Irwin is being requested to secure quotations for the materials required from local firms on the approved list.\n\nThe fire escape suggested for the school in previous correspondence is not now considered necessary as the children have been moved from the attic to the dormitories which are provided with fire escapes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/GR\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 19th, I beg to advise that the estimated cost of the new flooring required for the dormitories of the Kootenay Indian Residential School is $466.00. This quotation was supplied by the Cranbrook Sash & Door Co. Ltd., the only available source of supply in the town of Cranbrook.\n\nThe question of the lighting plant was dealt with in my letter of October 16th, which has no doubt reached the Department.\n\nI should appreciate your instructions with respect to the purchase of the flooring.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 155-0-5.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 19th and in continuation of my letter of October 8th, I beg to forward herewith tenders received on a diesel engine for the lighting plant at the Kootenay Indian Residential School as follows:\n\n1. Vivian Engine Works Limited\n\nONE, 2 cylinder, 5\u00bd\" bore by 8\" stroke, 4 cycle, cold starting, hand cranked VIVIAN stationary diesel engine with necessary pulleys for the main engine and generator, belt, and a complete set of 56 cell VA1 Coyle lighting plant batteries, 150 ampere hour capacity at the 8 hour rate, for the net sum of $1,754.00 f.o.b. Vancouver, B.C., exclusive of Sales Tax, and all other charges.\n\nIf VA15 battery set is supplied, $161.00 extra, a total of $1,915.00\n\nThe estimated cost of mechanics time to fully install the engine is $50.00, together with transportation costs from Vancouver to Cranbrook and return.\n\n2.

It would, of course, be better to\nsupply the VA15 battery instead of one of lower ampere hour capacity. As intimated in my letter of October 8th, the Department would be well advised to put a Vivian engine in the Kootenay Indian Residential School for the reasons stated. The manufacturer of these engines is always available to advise and assist when necessary in connection with their products and there is no difficulty whatever in securing parts when needed. Our experience so far has been that this is not the case with respect to engines manufactured outside this country.\n\nThe question of flooring for the dormitories will be dealt with in a separate communication.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Davidson,\nPurchasing Agent,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your telegram requesting specifications necessary to complete our tender on the diesel and battery equipment to be supplied the KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL near Cranbrook.\n\nThese specifications were unfortunately omitted when the tender was mailed. They are included herewith.\n\nFor several years we have supplied equipment to and serviced the electrical plant at this institution. We have quoted on equipment that experience with this load indicated to be best. We would refer you to a report made by us for the DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS about February, 1939. In this report the present inefficient manner of battery charging is fully covered and it is pointed out how this could be considerably improved. Since this has a large bearing on our selection of satisfactory we are mentioning it now with the sincere wish that it may be of service.\n\nThe present operator at the school feels that he should have a large engine to keep his batteries charged. This is not in accordance with best practices as a sixteen horse power engine will more than handle the generator it is intended to drive. The peak demands of this building are still lower than the capacity of the generator plus the battery reserve, consequently the use of a larger engine would result only in greater initial cost, greater operating cost and greater maintenance, with no material benefit gained. The major part of the time the engine is used as a straight battery charger with the generator delivering thirty six amperes at one hundred twenty volts. This load of thirty six hundred watts converted to horse power is barely five horse power. This still leaves a full ten horse power reserve for peak demands when required.\n\nPlease accept our thanks in holding your tenders for the arrival of our specifications and we hope the bit of information contained herein will be of some slight value to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Ward, Proprietor, Modern Electric, Cranbrook, B.C., in January, 1936.\n\nIn writing to Indian Agent Irwin in a letter dated August 3, 1939, requesting inclusion in the estimates for 1940-41 of sufficient funds for the purchase of new batteries the Principal, Rev. P.J. Collins, O.M.I., wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"The plant is also equipped with a set of storage batteries of 250 ampere hour rating. These are acid batteries, however, and are limited to a discharge of 10 amperes or a load of 1.12 K.W. which they will carry for a period of 25 hours. Inspection shows that these batteries are in rather poor shape with considerable sediment collected in the bottoms of the jars and the plates badly warped from overload conditions. It is very doubtful if these batteries will last another season. From experience at the plant, it has been noticed that a sixty watt lamp operated from the batteries gives very little light and over a period of two hours reduces itself to a red glow, the only other device in use at the same time being the refrigeration plant.\"\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nYou will note from the above that there was a seven-year guarantee on the batteries that are at present in use at the school. Has the Principal at any time brought to the attention of the Modern Electric Co. that the present set of batteries have become practically useless? Is the present condition of the batteries due to careless supervision? If so, what guarantee has this Branch that a new set of batteries will receive better attention? I think you will agree with me that four years is a rather short life for a set of batteries guaranteed to last seven years.\n\nYou will also note from the last part of the quotation from the Principal's letter that apparently the operation of the refrigeration plant is a drain on the batteries. Instructions have been issued on many occasions to all Principals of Indian residential schools that the batteries should only be used for lighting purposes. Our experience shows that when other equipment is operated from the batteries the life of the latter is greatly shortened.\n\nI should appreciate receiving your comments in connection with the above at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It was subsequently decided, however, to expend the money available on a domestic hot water system at the school, as this was considered more necessary than electric wiring.\n\nNow that consideration is being given to the establishment of a new lighting plant at the school, it has occurred to me that if at all possible provision should be made to have the electric wiring done at the same time.\n\nPrices on materials have increased since the outbreak of the war and it would, therefore, be necessary to secure new quotations once a decision is reached to proceed with the work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 155-0-5.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of October 29th regarding the set of batteries at present in use at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is observed that these batteries were supplied in 1936 and carry a seven-year guarantee. There is no record here of this transaction and it would appear that purchase was made by the Department through the local Indian Agent without reference to this office.\n\nI should say that it is fairly obvious from Principal Collins' report of August 3, 1939, to Mr. Indian Agent Irwin that the present condition of the batteries was brought about by excessive load and lack of necessary attention. The presence of sediment in the jars and warped plates would certainly suggest these as the main causes, and under the circumstances, the Modern Electric Company could not reasonably be held responsible for replacement under their guarantee.\n\nIf the batteries were charged regularly and overcharging avoided, and distilled water added when required, the extra load necessary to carry the type of refrigerator in use at the Kootenay Residential School should not have lessened to any material extent the life of the batteries. However, if the above mentioned precautions were not taken, the batteries would, of course, rapidly deteriorate. The red glow referred to by Principal Collins could be caused by short circuits created through a lumpy, uneven surface of sediment deposit in the jars.\n\nThe Principal, under whose direct control the school is operated, has a very definite responsibility in seeing to it that those of his staff entrusted with the care and operation of the lighting plant and its various divisions carry out their duties efficiently. The Indian Agent is also\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nin a position to check on such matters but it is mostly on\nthe Principal we are obliged to rely for the necessary pro-\ntection of such units as he is constantly at the school and\nthe members of the subordinate staff are employed and dis-\ncharged by him.\n\nThe load on any battery should, of course, not be\nin excess of that which the unit was intended to carry but\nwith proper care and attention, batteries of the capacity\ninstalled at the Kootenay school should give satisfaction\nfor the full period of the covering guarantee.\n\nTo give satisfactory service and allow for emer-\ngencies, the lighting plant at the Kootenay school should\nnot, in my opinion, be equipped with a less powerful unit\nthan a VAL5 battery which has 210 ampere hour capacity at\nthe 8 hour rate.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

H. Tupper.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\n19th November 1940\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received from the Department a copy of a letter sent to you by Mr. R. A. Hoey, with regard to certain batteries which were installed in this school, January, 1936.\n\nThese batteries are now almost five years old. They may last another year, perhaps two; then again they may give out at any time. The former engineer was in the employ of the school for eleven and a half years. He was under me for a year and a half. I accepted his resignation last April when he quit due to my being unable to raise his wages at a time when my grant was just cut. Possibly he may have been careless in his supervision of the batteries. On the other hand, as I wrote before, the batteries were overloaded, and the constant drain has helped considerably to reduce the life of the said batteries.\n\nI have been principal for just a little over two years. The batteries, as well as the refrigeration plant, were installed during the term of the former principal. I have received no instructions from the Department that the lighting plant only be operated from the batteries. It had been my hope, should the Department see fit to install new batteries at the school, to repair the old set of batteries from time to time in order to take care of the Laundry and Refrigeration plant.\n\nI believe I have been successful in engaging a competent engineer. He has been with me since August, and I am convinced that he is quite capable of giving the proper attention to the new power unit and batteries which the Department may wish to install.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nElectrical Merchandise and Contracting\n\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nNOVEMBER TWENTY THIRD 1940\n\nMR. IRWIN,\nAGENT,\nDEPT. INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe beg to report as follows on the condition of the lighting batteries at the KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nAll batteries show a fairly heavy precipitation of active materials to the bottoms of the jars. Sixteen of the cells are full to the bottoms of the plates. The remaining forty cells are to within a quarter inch of the plates.\n\nThe specific gravity reading of the electrolyte shows an abnormal variation - minimum of 1150 to a maximum of 1215. This indicates a need of an equalizing charge or possibly a dilution of some cells. Also the group has been discharged on several occasions and reversed in polarity due to mixed up charging connections.\n\nThe group voltage is 120 volts and individual cells from 1.9 volts to 2.1 volts.

In this connection it is regretted, due to unavoidable time spent on the Reserves, that your letter has not been answered sooner.\n\nI enclose herewith letters received from the Reverend Principal of the school and Mr. John A. Ward, of the Modern Electric, Cranbrook, B.C., which would appear to cover the information required.\n\nRegarding the qualifications of Mr. Townsend, the former engineer employed at the school for more than eleven years, I can only say that his ability as an engineer has been highly praised by the Dominion Government Boiler Inspector, Mr. T. J. Arnall, S.P.P. Engineer D.R.W., each time he has inspected the boiler at the school. He is also highly spoken of by Mr. Eric McKinnon, Master Mechanic at Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nThe successor to Mr. Townsend also appears to be a competent engineer although he has only been at the school since August of this year. A new lighting system and more powerful batteries are undoubtedly most urgently needed.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin\nIndian Agent\n\nR. A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: File 15/5/9485\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 24th regarding power supply to the Kootenay Indian Residential School near Cranbrook.\n\nFirst I must tell you something of the history of the building of the Wasa line. This line and the substation supplying it was built for the Department of Transport at their expense and they retain the ownership of the line and equipment supplying it. We have just completed the line and got it into operation.\n\nThe transformer in the substation is of sufficient capacity to supply the Indian Mission as well as the airport providing your Department can make satisfactory arrangements with the Department of Transport. Unfortunately the location of the substation is further from the Mission than it would have been if built to supply the Mission only. Therefore, three and a half miles of transmission line is required to supply the School.\n\nAssuming that the School requires a single phase service, which I believe will be satisfactory, the cost of building this line which would have to be built and owned by yourselves would be $6,200.00 according to our estimate.\n\nThis estimate is higher than we expected due (1) to increased cost of material; and (2) to the fact that we discovered very difficult digging conditions when building the Wasa line. Although it is only gravel digging, this gravel is cemented together by lime making some of the hardest digging we have ever encountered. The route followed by the line to the Mission is through identical country as that followed by the Wasa line to the airport.\n\nI would advise you that in this connection I have also received a similar enquiry from Mr. Walker, Supervising Engineer in Banff and will forward a copy of this letter to him.\nRegarding an arrangement between your Department and the Department of Transport, I would advise you that the rate you actually pay for power will depend largely on the Department of Transport officials as they will expect to include in the rate some rental for their equipment that is necessarily used to supply you.\n\nWe have been able to make an agreement whereby the Town of Cowley is able to get a small amount of power through the Department's equipment supply the Cowley Airport and I, therefore, see no reason why you should not be in a better position to make a similar arrangement with another Department of the Government.\n\nShould you require three phase power, which I believe is unnecessary at the present time, I can give you the cost on a three phase line at a future date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEast Kootenay Power Co. Ltd.,\n\nG.E. Elkington,\nGeneral Manager.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to my letters of November 8th and December 17, 1940, regarding electric light at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. There were two proposals in this connection, one being to connect the school with the transmission line of the East Kootenay Power & Light Company, the other to supply a new engine and batteries at a cost of approximately $2,000. I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 30th ultimo received from the East Kootenay Power & Light Company from which it will be observed that the cost of connection with the extension owned by the Dominion Department of Transport to their airport in this locality is estimated to be $8,200. In addition to this there would probably be a comparatively small expenditure for connecting the electricity to the existing distribution panel in the school.\n\nUndoubtedly the supply of electrical energy by the Company would prove much more economical than generating same with our own plant. Using our own equipment, we have a heavy expenditure in depreciation, repairs, battery replacement, fire risk and possible expensive breakdowns, apart from the fact that the type of engineers employed by Residential Schools are frequently not sufficiently skilled to operate these plants in the most economical manner, particularly where storage batteries are required.\n\nHowever, there is a difference in cost of some $4,000 and as the amount provided for in the current estimates amounts to only $1,595.00 for a new engine and installation, in addition to which new batteries are necessary, I do not see\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nhow the cost of connection with the Power Company's line could be undertaken during the present fiscal year and, if such is the case, there is no alternative but to recommend approval of purchase of the Vivian Engine and batteries recommended in my letter of October 16, 1940, at a cost of $1754.00, or preferably with heavy duty batteries, at a cost of $1,915.00 plus installation cost, estimated at $50, and return transportation for the mechanic from Vancouver to Cranbrook.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

They are included herewith.\n\nFor several years we have supplied equipment to and serviced the electrical plant at this institution. We have quoted on equipment that experience with this load indicated to be best. We would refer you to a report made by us for the DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS about February, 1939. In this report the present inefficient manner of battery charging is fully covered and it is pointed out how this could be considerably improved. Since this has a large bearing on our selection of satisfactory we are mentioning it now with the sincere wish that it may be of service.\n\nThe present operator at the school feels that he should have a large engine to keep his batteries charged. This is not in accordance with best practices as a sixteen horse power engine will more than handle the generator it is intended to drive. The peak demands of this building are still lower than the capacity of the generator plus the battery reserve, consequently the use of a larger engine would result only in greater initial cost, greater operating cost and greater maintenance, with no material benefit gained. The major part of the time the engine is used as a straight battery charger with the generator delivering thirty amperes at one hundred twenty volts. This load of thirty six hundred watts converted to horse power is barely five horse power. This still leaves a full ten horse power reserve for peak demands when required.\n\nPlease accept our thanks in holding your tenders for the arrival of our specifications and we hope the bit of information contained herein will be of some slight value to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

When your letter of the 9th ultimo was received it was noted that the cost of obtaining power from the East Kootenay Power & Light Company was prohibitive and consequently the Purchasing Agent was requested to proceed with the purchase. The matter was carefully considered by the Surveys & Engineering Branch who drew out specifications on which a number of firms were asked to quote prices. Among these was the Vivian Engine Works and on the specification prepared by the Surveys & Engineering Branch they quoted a price of approximately $2900.00 which, as you will note, is considerably more than the price quoted by Modern Electric. It is hoped that this installation will prove satisfactory to the management of the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nDue to the critical times through which we are passing, and the difficulty in obtaining funds for the maintenance and repairs of our residential schools, it would be advisable to point out to the Principal that every possible care should be exercised in handling this machinery as well as all the other machinery in the school.

Accurate tests were made of all the circuit on each floor to determine the condition of the wires in the concealed raceways. Tests were also made on every circuit and feeder wire for shorts and grounds.\n\nCertain hazardous conditions exist which have been largely caused by additions and extensions to the present system. These defective extensions consist for the most part of outlets wired in cotton lamp cord strictly against the code requirements. We have itemized these defective parts and quoted on the cost of placing all wiring in first class shape.\n\nPerhaps the greatest cause for inefficiency of this system lies in the method of current distribution at the main panel or switchboard. At the time of installation the demands were fairly light and ample battery and generator capacities were available. The system was connected as a straight battery charging system and the bulk of the load was handled by batteries alone after the plant was shut down. Also the large gasoline driven generator could easily handle the battery charging load and the complete house load if necessity arose. To this end the batteries were connected for charging through a switching arrangement that allowed them to be charged in parallel. This means that the battery unit consisting of fifty six cells of two volts each would be connected in two groups of twenty eight cells for charging and would be changed back to one unit of fifty six cells for discharging or operating the system. For stability a limiting resistor was introduced in the battery circuit for charging. If lights were required when the batteries were on charge they were obtained directly from the generator.\n\nAs noted above this was fairly satisfactory when the load was comparatively small. With the introduction a few months ago of electrical refrigeration and the normal increased use of appliances the overall load is considerably higher. To further aggravate the condition a diesel driven generator of only half the capacity of the original job is used to charge the batteries. With the hook up already described the charging load and house load far exceeds the capacity of the diesel generator and many times the equipment is working far below its normal voltage output.\n\nWe would strongly recommend that this entire set up be reconnected so that at peaks the batteries would aid the generator and at minimum demands sufficient current would be introduced into the batteries to keep them fully charged.\nThe manner in which a changeover is made from the gasoline generator to the diesel generator is very poor and does not comply with the electrical code in any respect. The wiring from the diesel generator to the switchboard is encased in ordinary water pipe and the wiring is dripping with fuel oil. No terminal fittings of any sort are provided. The generator itself is thoroughly soaked in fuel oil and badly needs cleaning.\n\nCertain new wiring is badly needed and we have listed this separately. This consists of lights in the garage toilet and engine room etc.\n\nWe thank you for this opportunity of quoting and trust that the information supplied is that which you require. Please call upon us if any further data is required.\n\nYours Truly\n\n\"John A.

A short time ago I had an expert make a complete check-up of all the electric devices and lights used at the school and connected to the plant, with the following findings:\n\nMaximum light load possible winter conditions: 12KW\n\nMaximum day load covering Laundry, Kelvinator: 7KW\n\nPotential load maximum that could be imposed on plant: 19KW\n\nTo carry this load the school has a plant equipped with two generators if the following specifications:\n\n(1) Crossman generator:\nOutput: ............. 4KW\nVoltage: ........... 125\nAmperage: .......... 32\n\nThis unit is equipped with a 7 HP Petter Diesel engine and is quite economical in operation but is heavily overloaded.\n\n(2) Westinghouse Generator:\nOutput: ............. 10KW\nVoltage: ........... 125\nAmperage: .......... 80\n\nThis unit is operated by a very old Fairbanks Morse 15 HP single cylinder engine, in extremely poor shape and consequently wasteful in both lubricating oil and\nfuel (gasoline), which renders it useless for economical generation of electrical energy.\n\nThe plant is also equipped with a set of storage batteries of 250 ampere hour rating. These are acid batteries however, and are limited to a discharge of 10 amperes or a load of 1.12 K.W., which they will carry for a period of 25 hours. Inspection shows that these batteries are in rather poor shape with considerable sediment collected in the bottoms of the jars and the plates badly warped from overload conditions. It is very doubtful if these batteries will last another season. From experience at the plant, it has been noticed that a sixty watt lamp operated from the batteries gives very little light and over a period of two hours reduces itself to a red glow the only other device in use at the same time being the refrigeration plant.\n\nUnder present conditions at the school the procedure is to use the 4 KW motor generator set for all normal operations as it can be operated most economically. This is hardly a fair procedure as this machine is too small to meet with the requirements even with the help of the storage batteries. The result is that this unit and the batteries are heavily overloaded, especially during the winter months.\n\nOriginally this plant consisted of the 10KW plant only and it is quite apparent that this was installed to take care of definite load conditions. These loads have been increased considerably in the past few years, but no arrangements have been made to take care of them. In fact, the capacity of the plant has been reduced to where a 4 KW plant and battery set are expected to carry the load that was previously carried by a 10KW plant and the same set of batteries.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE POWER PLANT\n\nThat a new Diesel power unit is purchased of 15 to 20 HP., and installed to operate the two generators. This power plant could also be connected to a line shaft so that it could be used for pumping water also, thereby serving a dual purpose. The unit recommended is illustrated in cuts attached.

He wished to have power supplied from a power line but, in my presence, Mr Phelan told the Very Revd. Father Scannell that the cost, approximately $6000.00 was prohibitive. As a second choice, Father Collins wished to have another make of engine less costly than the Lister but, in his opinion, more efficient. What his objections to the Lister engine were, I do not know. In several letters to Officials of the Department, he explained them. The only objection which I would have had is that we had one at the Kakawis School and I was told that repair parts are very hard to get as they are said to come from England. I mentioned this to Mr Philip Phelan, when I was in Ottawa recently and he replied that the Prairie Schools appeared to have no difficulty in getting parts.\n\nAfter talking the matter over with Father Collins, we spoke to the gentleman who has the contract to install the Lister engine and asked him to install it. I do not know whether this engine or the one Father Collins wanted installed is better but I do know that we need an engine in a hurry and I suggested that we take the Lister so as to avoid the delay which would occur were the engine not installed before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nUnfortunately, it does not seem to have been pointed out to the Department that the engine was required for pumping water as well as for supplying light. However, the man who is installing the engine is having a pulley made at his expense and this pulley can, I understand, be so fitted up that water can be pumped.\n\nI have not seen the contract but hope that it calls for the removal of the present engine.\n\nPower supplied by the power line would have been better and cheaper in the long run but that is out of the question now.\n\nTrusting that I have fully answered your question,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nG. Forbes,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. Mr Ward brought a man out on Saturday to take measurements. This man did a little preparatory work here yesterday.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nMarch 19th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe File No. 15-5-790\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th, with reference to installing new lighting equipment at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is regretted that after five days absence on Reserves, followed by three days in bed, that this Report has been so long delayed.\n\nPrincipal Collins, as you know, is no longer at the School, having been succeeded by Reverend Principal Forbes, whose Report in duplicate regarding the new engine, I herewith enclose, also a copy of a Report submitted by Rev.

I quote.\n\n\"The Floors are in a very poor condition; broken, and with nails appearing, which are a danger to the feet of Children. If the Department would provide the material, and this would come to something under $500.00 the Manual Training Class would lay the Floors.\"\n\nThe Inspector goes on to say that the Floors in the Main Dormitories require, for sanitary reasons if no other, to be replaced with as little loss of time as possible.\n\nLet me again stress the danger of serious damage to the feet of Children, should they have occasion to leave their cots in the night.\n\nYour letter of March 16th, 1940 cited the possibility of a new Lighting Plant which is urgently needed, and as an alternative to New Flooring, and suggested the likelihood of appropriations being reduced, in which case it was stated that, either Flooring or the installing of a Lighting Plant would have to be postponed, until more funds were available, and if, at this date it has been decided that a new Lighting System cannot be installed before the end of the fiscal year, may we still hope for the Flooring?\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\nThe amount required is as previously submitted:\n\n6000 Ft.B.M.No.1.

I was going to write to you at that time but was informed that the Department was supplying us with flooring for the dormitories. This flooring has just been unloaded here and I wish to thank you and the Department for the engines and flooring. Both were very much needed and they are really appreciated.\n\nWe intend to start laying the flooring on Monday and that is just the right time as our friend Mr. Berry tells me that he & Mr. Maclean will be here on the 25th. They will see the boys at work on the floor. All the boys will not be employed at this work as I shall have to detail a few to look after Barry's affairs so that the Department will not have to pay, as it was once requested to pay, for 1/2 an hour of workers.\n\nI have found a letter here, dated August 1st, 1939, from the Fred M. Beatty Co. of Vancouver, which seems to indicate that the following matter was brought to the attention of the department at about that time. Some four or five years ago, there was a severe earthquake...\nMarch 16th morning or less one that evening. As a result, the foundation (cement) of the barn is severely damaged and there are several cracks in the building. It is possible that no serious damage was done but I would suggest that a survey of both buildings be made. According to the letter, a survey was at least prepared for the Spring of 1940. So far as I know nothing was done\u2014no great deal of cold & draught came in through these cracks & though the poorly fitting windows, the letter mentioned a survey of the cracks & windows also suggested how the condition might be remedied. Only a rough survey was made at the time. The real survey was to have been made in the Spring. I am finding no further correspondence on the matter.\n\nIn my annual report, I stressed the fact that there was practically no fire alarm system here. There are a few ordinary door bells which, when they ring, might easily be mistaken for the telephone or door bell. The Department, if I understand a letter on file, had Mr. Ward (Modern Electric Co., Brandon) quote them make a report & submit estimates for a real fire alarm & proper wiring of the building. The wiring system is far from proper wiring of the building. The wiring may have been exaggerated but I am told that the wiring is not in good condition. I believe that the Department, like myself, would feel more at ease if they knew just what danger there is or there is not here.\n\nThere is a house, owned by the Oblate here, which has been partly torn down. I am trying to get permission...\nTo use the rest of the lumber to build a blacksmith shop & a jigging. We have to scrape & save here to make ends meet.\n\nEven the Indians are rationed up at present.\n\nThis allowing the Indians to enlist is not to their real advantage if, what I believe, is true. Their drinking propensities seem to increase. It is a bad thing to take the husbands away from their wives at least in some instances. The money paid to the wives and dependents is not beneficially used. Of course, there may be exceptions to these new objections.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nI remain Yours Truly,\nG. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nApril 23, 1941.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant I am glad to know that the flooring has reached the Kootenay School. In connection with the electric wiring and fire alarm system Indian Commissioner MacKay was authorized in official letter of the 5th instant to proceed with this work.\n\nThe expenditures that have now been incurred will exhaust the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Kootenay Residential School. Under these circumstances I regret that there will be no further funds available during the current fiscal year for carrying out the other suggestion made in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Forbes,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI know that the budget has not been brought down yet but some people are clamouring for their bills paid and so I would greatly appreciate it if you would send me whatever part of the grant you can.\n\nSome of the bills are rather ancient.\n\nWe expect Inspector Barry today for his second visit in two months\u2014some of the things which I am going to call to his attention are:\n\n1. Cracks in the walls of the main building and in the foundation of the barn\u2014these, I am told, are due to an earthquake.\n\n2. The curling up of the shingles on the roof of the barn\u2014this is due to lack of paint (there is likely a spot missing here on the barn).\n\n3. This may have been reported to the Department as I have found an estimate on the cost of repairs ($115) \u2014a hole (gradually growing larger) \"in return of hot water heating system in left boiler.\"\n\n4. The alleged dangerous condition of the wiring.\n\nThe inadequacy of the fire alarm system.\n\nI mention all these things not to add to your worries or grief but because I believe that you wish to know.\n\nApril 27th\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nin what condition the school is.\n\nThe new boiler engine seems to be working well but\nthis said to be hard on oil - I will see the man who\ninstalled it.\n\nYou will recall that I stated that I did not think\nthat Indians enlisting was in their best interests - half, one\nof them has just been buried. The story, as I heard it, is that\nhe & others, with two Indian women, were out for riding. He\nwas driving - he was killed in a crash-up. I have not had\ntime to check upon the story yet but I am told that he\nhad been drinking.\n\nI request that action be taken, if possible, to pre-\nvent enlisted Indians from being supplied with drink\n- or, I had better put it this way, that it be ascertained\nwhether these apparently truthful stories that they get\ndrunk are true & that, if they are true, serious attention\nbe given the matter.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was at the funeral of an Indian\n(a returned man) who was run over by a train while he\nwas drunk. There was a large crowd of Indians & fearing\na riot, the dead man's brother asked me if he had met\na man, the fellowman to \"lighten up\" on the boat -\nbetter ask the fellowman to \"lighten up\" on the boat -\nleggers while all more Indians were present. I asked him\nwhat he meant & he told me (truthfully) that \"my\npoliceman used his own discretion. Another person told me\nthat the policeman was under the impression that Indians,\nwho were returned men, had the right to drink - Now, all\nthis may not have been true but, in the interests of the\nIndians, it would be well to find out what is what.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

The Cranbrook fire department was summoned but they could not control it either.\n\nThe damage is estimated at about $3,000. The buildings were the property of the department of Indian affairs, who have made no decision about rebuilding yet.\nOttawa,\nMay 12, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInformation has just reached the Department that the carpenter and blacksmith shop at the Kootenay Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on April 29. I have also received today a clipping from the Lethbridge Herald dated May 3 in which the newspaper states that the damage done by the fire is estimated at $5000.00.\n\nNo report of this fire has been received from your office. It is difficult to understand why any Indian Agent should not report immediately any damage caused to any of the Departmental buildings in his Agency either by fire or any other cause.\n\nI will expect to receive a complete report regarding this fire from you by return mail and at the same time you should explain fully why you have delayed forwarding this information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nExtract from letter written to Mr. Doucet by Rev. G. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may have heard that on the Tuesday night following your visit our carpenter and blacksmith shops were entirely destroyed by fire. At great risk to themselves, Fr. Murray, the carpenter and an Indian saved quite a few of the carpenter tools but none of those in the blacksmith shop. Bro. Cullen looked after those in the school building, and I looked after the older boys. All we could do was to stop the fire from spreading. We and the Indian Agent tried to have the Fire Dept. come but they would not. The Agent got two policemen to come with two extinguishers but they came too late to do any good. Finally one fireman and a fire truck came but this was much too late. One good hose with sufficient pressure would have saved at least the carpenter shop together with the tools and the 4800' of flooring all lost. To save as many of the school tools as possible, Fr. Murray and Reiferscheid made no attempt to save the tools owned by the Oblates and Mr. Reiferscheid.\n\nAbout 20 people came from Cranbrook to see the sight but not one offered to help us. Perhaps they felt that it was useless. The police and the lone fireman did what they could.\n\nWhat pleased me was that there was no panic -- discipline was perfect and the boys did just as they were told. They wanted to go into the burning building to save tools and lumber and they could have saved some of each but I told them to stay out of the building as I did not want any casualties.\n\nOn the whole, we were very fortunate. The wind blew the flames and sparks away from the barn. Fire started on an old play hall but it was put out. Had the wind blown from the opposite direction, there would have been a general clean-up.\nI do not know how the fire started. It started in the blacksmith shop. One of the men used the forge, I am told, earlier in the day and two boys told me, during the fire, that they had seen a fire in the blacksmith shop in the afternoon. Against this story is the fact that Bro. Cullen went to the blacksmith shop between 5 and 5:30 p.m. and saw or smelt no fire. He noticed the fire while making his rounds at 10:30. The blacksmith shop had been used as a sort of storeroom. I found cardboard boxes, papers and rags there but had them removed and burned a couple of days after I came here. I had a pile of rubbish, on the other side of the carpenter shop, burned several days before the fire.\n\nI hope that my next letter will carry better news. Anything you can do to get us new shops, to have the lost tools replaced and flooring sent in place of that which was destroyed will be greatly appreciated. The boys would build the shops and lay the dormitory floors as part of their training.\nApril 30th, 1941\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware, fire completely destroyed our blacksmith and carpenter shops last night. All the contents of the blacksmith shop were destroyed or badly damaged as it was impossible to get into the building. The only thing we could do was to try to save the carpenter shop and its contents. We failed to save the building and about 5000' of flooring, just received from the Department, but we did save some of the tools. A detailed list of the tools lost is being prepared. If any were saved, it was due to what I must call the heroic efforts of Father Murray, Mr. Reifferscheid (the carpenter) and Toby Morigeau. Mr. Townsend, the engineer, worked frantically to save the carpenter shop. Jerome Joseph also rendered valuable assistance. The Chief and other Indians came too late to help. About 20 White people came but did not offer to help. The two policemen and the one fireman rendered what assistance they could but they did not arrive on time.\n\nMay I suggest that you request that the Indian Department show its appreciation for the work done by the two Indians, Toby Morigeau (who went into the building several times, with Father Murray and Reifferscheid, and saved many tools although the building was in flames) and Jerome Joseph who did not spare himself?\n\nWhile making his rounds at 10.30, Brother Cullen noticed the fire and immediately notified me after awaking an employee (Mullins, whose hard work I forgot to mention) and the senior boys. I asked him to telephone to you and to the Fire Department and he did so while I took a look at the fire and decided not to awaken the girls or the smaller boys as the fire was at a distance and the wind was not blowing towards the main building. Brother Cullen turned on all lights in the building, notified the Sisters and took charge of all in the school. He did this without causing any excitement.\n\nWith the older boys, I took what fire extinguishers had been left by the men who were already fighting the fire and we did what we could. I am pleased to say that there was perfect discipline, that the boys did exactly what they were told and remained cool. While they might have saved more from the carpenter shop, had they gone in, I ordered them to remain outside.\n\nWe soon saw that the buildings could not be saved and, so, we tried to prevent the fire from spreading. The water just dribbled out of our garden hose and so the boys carried pails and pails of water. Fortunately, the wind was in our favor. It did start fires on the roof of the root cellar and on an outside playhall as well as on fences and trees but Mr. Townsend worked as he had done on the other buildings but, this time, he was successful. Had the wind been in the opposite direction, it would have been impossible to save the barn, pig pen (such as it is), ice house, chicken coops, horses, cows, pigs, chickens, etc. There would also have been serious danger to the school building particularly on account of a reason I shall give later.\n\nAnd a real fire hose with plenty of pressure would have saved everything!\nWith regard to the origin of the fire, I cannot as yet make a definite statement. An immediate investigation would likely produce no results. I have reason to believe that, if a boy started the fire, the truth will come out later. At present, I do not believe that it was deliberately started. It may have been. I am told that a man used the forge and, although he is careful, he may not have entirely extinguished the fire.\n\nSeveral hours later, a boy was sent to the blacksmith shop (where the fire originated) and was slow returning. If there was fire in the forge (and this is doubtful) he may have fanned the flame. A young boy (truthfully or to make himself important?) told me that he had seen the fire in the afternoon. If this is true, why did I, several employees and the boys not see it as we were within sight of the building until 8 or 9 p.m.? Surely by that time the fire would have been noticeable. I am told that the fire started on the floor and not in the forge. Of course, fanning the flame might have made sparks fall on the floor. I expect that more will come out later.\n\nWhen I came here, I found that cardboard boxes were stored in the blacksmith shop and I had them removed and burned.\n\nI know of no reason for which anyone would seek to burn down the blacksmith shop (except myself in the hopes of getting a better one). I have not been harsh with the children. I have not cut down on their food; they all seem contented. Sometimes, pupils set fire to a school so that there will be no school and, consequently, they will have to go home. The burning of the blacksmith shop, situated as it is far from the school building, would not accomplish that object. However, if that boy really saw the fire and did not report it, certain things may be possible. But the efforts that they made, the more efforts which they wished to make to save the buildings and contents... Nothing adds up!\n\nIt is not necessary to make suggestions. Both you and I saw the lack of fire equipment here and we did what we could to have this remedied. This is not a criticism of \"Ottawa\". Money is scarce. But you, I and Ottawa would not like to read the Papers with all the publicity they would give us if there were a holocaust here. I was through a $40,000 fire in a college and I am afraid of fire in an Indian School.\n\nSufficient protection can be had but it will cost money. If that money is not spent and if there is a fire here, we shall all of us regret not having spent the money.\n\nIn addition to the suggestions I made in my recent report to the Department, I now suggest that the gasoline tank, which is now immediately adjacent to the school building, be removed to a safe distance. This is an underground tank but, if the fire had spread to the barn and nearby buildings, the heat might have expanded the gasoline so that it would have risen through the pipes and... goodbye all of us. A second suggestion is that the Department come to an agreement with the Cranbrook Fire Dept., so that they come when needed. I know part of the efforts you made (and suspect the rest) to have them come here last night. They just refused to come until you insisted and insisted and they finally sent one man (who really worked) and a fire engine that, due to their unwillingness, arrived too late. If it did cost money... well an M.P., a friend of mine, had me give certain details on another case to the Minister and Mr Creara appreciated it. I do not want to\nflatter the Department, to tell them that the Indians are the apples of their eyes, etc., but I do know that they take an interest in the Indians and that they are afraid of a fire and the possible resultant holocaust. They would be heartless and fools if they were not afraid.\n\nI have tried not to say anything of what you did for us last night but I assure you that what you did to try to have the fire department come, to have the policemen with their fire extinguishers come, your coming here and offering all possible assistance are duly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. Forbes\nBetween 10.30 and 11 P.M. on the night of April 29th, a phone call was received at the Agency, from Brother Gullen of the Kootenay Indian School, informing me that the School Blacksmith and Carpenter Shops were on fire, and that such protection as they had, was of little or no account to cope with the growing flames. The Fire and Police Departments were immediately notified, but before they could reach the scene of the fire, the Buildings were completely enveloped and could not be saved.\n\nThe Boys of the School were well disciplined, and did excellent work with a few Fire Extinguishers and many Buckets. The Reverend Principal, the Rev. Missionary, Mr. Murray the Carpenter- Mr. Reifferscheid Mr. Townsend- the Engineer, and two of the Indians- Jerome Joseph, and Toby Moriceau, all gave a very fine account of themselves in their efforts to save as many of the tools of the Carpenter shop as possible.\n\nIncluded in the contents burnt was about 5000 feet Flooring recently provided by the Department to cover the floors of the Boys' and Girls' Dormitories, also quite a number of Tools. When the list has been completed by the Principal, I shall forward the same to the Department.\n\nBy great good fortune the wind was in our favour, otherwise the Barn, and all other out-buildings would have been destroyed;\n\nI enclose herewith a most descriptive and very accurate account of the fire, but the Rev. Principal Forbes, which stresses among other things, the well known fact that a fire at the Kootenay Indian Residential School is something far beyond our power and ability to deal with successfully with such hopelessly inadequate protective equipment as we now possess. A fire once started, would be almost certain to result in a Building burned.\n\nI trust, therefore, that the Report submitted by the Principal for the reasons given, at whatever the cost, may receive the most careful and serious consideration.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

This lumber was recently purchased (see purchase order No. 6619).\n\nThe Indian Agent in his report states:\n\n\"The boys of the school were well disciplined and did excellent work with a few fire extinguishers and many buckets.

Later, a detailed accounting in triplicate, of all Tools Lumber etc., lost in the fire as well as those that were saved, was forwarded to the Indian Commissioner, Major D.M. Mackay.\n\nI felt that the Reverend Principal's Report which was attached to mine, gave the Department a very full and complete account of the fire, apart from detail in respect of losses in Tools which could not be accurately estimated until later.\n\nWhen, and after your letter arrived, I was absent on the Reserves for two days, and hence could not answer immediately.\n\nI am sure the Department have long since realized the dire necessity of providing more adequate and dependable fire protection at the School, and the longer it is delayed, the longer the School must continue a constant dread.\n\nWhat actually caused the fire I do not know; the Principal does not know, although it is stated in his Report that the Forge in the Blacksmith Shop had been used in the afternoon of that day, and that the fire might not have been entirely extinguished. He also states that a Boy was sent to the Blacksmith Shop several hours later where the fire originated, and was slow returning. Inferring that, if the fire was still alive he might have fanned the flames, causing sparks to fall on the floor which, later, might have started the outbreak. It is all conjecture; no one actually knows, but what we do know is this, had there been proper fire protection at the School, the buildings could easily have been saved.\nIn this respect, as in others, the Principal's statement is correct, when he insists that a REAL FIRE HOSE WITH PLENTY OF PRESSURE would have saved everything.\n\nMay I quote from a statement issued by the Acting Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Brigade to his Worship the Mayor, and Members of the City Council, with respect to this fire. He states:\n\nA very serious fire hazard exists at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The School itself, a large two storey building is without Fire Escapes, and exposed to danger from several frame out-buildings such as Barns etc., which are quite near. There is practically no fire protection whatever. The pressure is so low in the domestic water supply, that it is of no use for fighting fire. The situation is very dangerous, and should have the attention of those in authority.\"\n\nSo has written the Acting Fire Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Department.\n\nThere is not a soul in the Cranbrook district familiar with the School who fails to realize the ever lurking danger of a holocaust. There is grave responsibility somewhere in the event of a serious fire, for the protection of the Children and the Staff, and yet, in the words of the Acting Chief, a very serious fire hazard exists, and needless to say, will continue to exist until there is sufficient equipment and water power to fight a fire.\n\nThe Cranbrook Fire Department sent one man and a Fire Engine. They were not too easily pressed into service, but did good work when they got there. The Provincial Police also turned out with Fire Extinguishers and did their best, which simply was not good enough to make any impression; without a water supply the Buildings just had to go.\n\nIf we are to have any protection at all against a recurrence of what happened the other night, I would most respectfully suggest that\nan agreement should be arrived at with the Cranbrook Fire Department to respond immediately when called, otherwise we would not have a chance, and even with the fullest co-operation from the Fire Department there can be no guarantee of security or safety from the worst that easily could happen unless dependable pressure to make the best use of fire fighting equipment is supplied.\n\nI enclose herewith itemized statements from the Cranbrook Sash & Door Co., quoting on the materials required to re-build the Carpenter and Blacksmith Shops at respective costs of $523.59 and $151.80.\n\nIn addition to this, I would point out as shown in previous reports, about 5000 feet Flooring lost, that had recently been purchased to re-floor the Dormitories. This also is urgently needed.\n\nThe enclosed statements of cost in respect of all materials required to replace Buildings burned, are furnished only in the hope that they may be helpful to the Department as a means of supplying accurate information as to the cost of re-building, should they decide to do so.\n\nI/L\n\nR.A.

He quotes as follows from a letter received from the Acting Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Brigade:\n\n\"A very serious fire hazard exists at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The school itself, a large two storey building, is without fire escapes and exposed to danger from several frame out-buildings such as barns etc. which are quite near. There is practically no fire protection whatever. The pressure is so low in the domestic water supply that it is of no use for fighting fire. The situation is very dangerous and should have the attention of those in authority.\"\n\nI have reviewed our file but we do not appear to have any definite statement regarding the cost of providing what might be considered adequate fire protection. As you are aware, our funds are very limited but the matter is so important that I feel either you or Inspector Coleman should visit this school in the very near future and submit a detailed report on what is required and at the same time give an estimate of its cost.\n\nFor your information I might say that the Indian Agent has suggested that arrangements might be made with the Cranbrook Fire Department to\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nrespond immediately if called. This suggestion might also be considered by whoever visits the school and we should be advised what the Cranbrook Fire Department would charge for their services.\n\nFrom our experience the supplying of hose is no guarantee that there will be adequate fire protection in case of a fire. In many cases when hose was supplied it was hung up on the wall and when a fire occurred the hose was practically useless.\n\nI trust that, as stated above, either you or Mr. Coleman will have an opportunity of visiting this school in the near future and submitting a complete report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th instant enclosing a report from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School in connection with the fire, also a letter received from Indian Agent Irwin with regard to the same matter, it is desired that you arrange for the purchase of the material required for the re-erection of the carpenter shop. From the attached list you will note that either the Agent or the Principal secured a quotation from the Cranbrook Sash & Door Company. The total of this is $523.59. It is quite possible that in purchasing the material shown on the attached list you will buy from more than one firm in which case separate purchase orders should accompany the accounts when you submit them for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant enclosing complete reports regarding the fire at the Kootenay Residential School on April 29, also detailed information regarding tools etc. that were lost, I may say that Indian Commissioner MacKay is being authorized to purchase the material required for the re-erection of the carpenter shop. It is understood that the labour will be done by the school staff and the older boys without cost to the Department. The site of this building should be very carefully chosen and it should be placed as far away as possible from the other buildings in order to minimize the danger from fire.\n\nCommissioner MacKay is also being requested to either visit the Kootenay School or have Inspector Coleman go to the school with a view to making a full investigation of the suggestion for additional fire protection. A letter from the Principal suggests that to provide additional fire protection will involve a very heavy expenditure. In this case it is doubtful if the Department can provide the funds. However, a final decision will not be made until either of the officers mentioned above submits his report.\n\nIt is evident from the Principal's letters that considerable could be done to minimize fire hazards at this school and it would be advisable for you to inspect the whole building thoroughly with the Principal and arrange to have the necessary action taken along these lines.\n\nWe are re-ordering the lumber for the floors to replace that which was lost in the fire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nINSPECTION OF THE ST. MARY'S INDIAN SCHOOL\nMISSION, CHANBROOK, B. C.\n\nOctober 25, 1938.\n\nPLASTER OFF WALLS AND CEILINGS.\n\nThe plaster is in very bad condition in many places in the School, particularly in the entrances or exits of both boys and girls basement sides. Also sewing room, main dining room, and hall-ways. This in itself is a very bad fire hazard, and should fire break out it would be drawn up through the walls and ceilings through the places where plaster is missing, and run under the floors all over the building before anyone would be aware.\n\nELECTRIC WIRING.\n\nThe electric wiring throughout the school is very old and quite out of date, and has apparently been repaired or altered at different times by persons other than electricians.\n\nSockets missing in several places and the live wires not taped, ordinary drop cord wiring running through holes in walls and partitions without any protection whatever in the way of insulation of any kind. Floor sockets installed in a poor manner, loose and dangerous. Most of the drop cord wiring is so old that it has perished, the insulation being all cracked.\n\nSTOVES, STOVE-PIPES AND OVENS.\n\nThe stove pipes in the laundry and drying room are very old and a very bad hazard. The pipes should all be renewed and on account of the length of some, would suggest that they be rivetted so that there will be no danger of coming apart.\n\nIn the bakery room there is no protection between the fire boxes of the ovens and the wooden floor. Would suggest that two layers of brick, layed flat be placed the full length and width of the ovens, with a four inch space left at front and sides running clear through the top layer of bricks for ventilating purposes, also that some sheet iron or tin be placed on floor in front of fire box doors. At the present time the hot ashes fall out onto the wooden floor.\n\nFIRE ALARM GONGS.\n\nThere are several small two inch bells scattered about the building, most of which not even working, and therefore in case of fire of no use whatever.\n\nThere certainly should be an up to date fire alarm system installed immediately, as at the present time the lives of the Staff and the children are at stake.\nThe British Columbia Fire Marshal Act, under which we work are not satisfied with fire gongs or bells less than 10\" in diameter, and where buildings are more than two stories in height, there must be a gong on each floor with a break-the-glass station at each gong.\n\nAttached also is an ordinary electric switch in the principal's office for testing purposes, and also used when holding fire drills. This saves breaking the glass or removing same when testing gongs.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES.\n\nPanic bolts should be placed on all exit doors, so that in case of fire there will be no chance of the doors being either locked or hard to open. This matter is also compulsory under the British Columbia Fire Marshal Act.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion of Reverend Father Collins that a partition and door be placed on first landing of staircase, women's side, might say that if a panic bolt is installed on the door it would pass any inspection, as it would act as a temporary fire stop should a fire break out on the first floor or basement. With this panic bolt, no person could go upstairs at night and yet at the same time would act as a very good escape from fire should it break out upstairs. Door could be left wide open in daytime.\n\nHOUSEKEEPING CONDITIONS.\n\nHousekeeping conditions are excellent and cannot be improved.\n\nENGINE ROOM.\n\nCould be kept a little cleaner, too much oil around the floor. Engine apparently pumping some oil.\n\nWould suggest all oil cans with exception of those absolutely necessary be kept elsewhere.\n\nBATTERY ROOM.\n\nSuggest an opening be made in ceiling of the battery room, as I noticed quite a strong amount of gas generated from the batteries.\n\nGARAGE.\n\nThe windows of the garage between that building and the bakery room should be covered with sheet iron or some metal of some kind. This building also used as the gasoline pump room creates a bad fire hazard and I would suggest the gasoline pump be installed at some safer place.\n\nBARN AND OUTBUILDINGS.\n\nThere are some very fine and valuable outbuildings including the large barn and stables, but absolutely no fire protection. Would suggest that standard stand-pipes be\ninstalled someplace near the main pumping machinery and enough fire hose be purchased and attached to stand-pipes to reach these outbuildings.\n\nThere is no doubt whatever should a fire break out at the present time not only would the buildings burn, but all the stock would be in danger.\n\nMight say in conclusion, I feel too much cannot be said about some of the items mentioned in this report, especially with regard to the Fire Gongs, Fire Escapes and the Electric wiring, as each one is a very bad fire hazard in itself, and now knowing the layout of the building I feel that should a fire break out, it might be with terrible consequences.\n\nINSPECTION MADE ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14th 1938, BY P. ADAMS, FIRE CHIEF, CHANEROCK, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., concerning my report of the Tools and Building Materials that were saved, as well as those that were lost in the recent fire at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI had not thought of requisitions when writing that report; but only of complying with the request as expressed in your letter of the 5th for a full and completely detailed statement in triplicate, of the loss sustained.\n\nThe report submitted by the Reverend Principal, enclosed with my monthly report was, I feel, so full and complete in every detail of what actually happened at the fire, that nothing more accurate could be written, apart from the credit paid to myself. What actually caused the fire I do not know; the Principal doesn't know, although it is stated in his report that the Forge in the Blacksmith shop had been used in the afternoon of that day, and that the fire might not have been entirely extinguished. He also states, that a boy was sent to the Blacksmith shop several hours later, where the fire originated, and was slow returning. Inferring that, if the fire was still alive, he might have fanned the flames causing sparks to fall on the floor, which, later, might have started the outbreak. It is all conjecture; no one actually knows, but what we do know is this, had there been proper fire protection at the School, the Buildings could easily have been saved.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith report, dated the 17th instant, of Mr. Indian Agent Irwin, regarding the loss by fire of outbuildings and equipment of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which occurred on the 29th ultimo. The report is not very satisfactory, in that it must be read in conjunction with that of the Reverend Principal of the School, dated the 30th ultimo.\n\nIt is observed that both the Indian Agent and the Principal place the responsibility for the loss on the lack of hose and fire-fighting equipment, the Principal stating that both of them have seen this lack and did what they could to have it remedied. In this connection, I would advise that the matter of fire protection for this institution has been the subject of discussion over the past three years, the Agent having the Cranbrook Fire Chief, Mr. P. Adams, make an inspection of the premises on October 14, 1936, a copy of this report being enclosed herewith, most of the recommendations having been carried out, except the installation of panic bolts on exits in the main building, fire door, and placing of standpipes and a supply of hose near the outbuildings.\n\nThe latter item is of interest in regard to this particular fire and is dealt with on page 2 of Inspector Barry's report of November 13, 1936, as follows:\n\n\"I do not agree with the Fire Chief in regard to the provision of standard or any other sort of standpipes or the provision of any hose for the protection of the outbuildings. The Department is well aware that the system of domestic water supply recommended in one of my reports five or six years ago has been chosen as against a most expensive alternative system. The present domestic water system is giving excellent service. It is quite inadequate in the case of fire fighting for which it was never intended. Standpipes and hose will only be required when the Department has funds enough to install a new fire-fighting water system the plans of which are on file with the Department. I can not recommend that this be done at the present time.\"\n\nIt should also be noted in the Agent's report that he quotes the Acting Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Brigade as stating that \"The pressure is so low in the domestic water supply that it is of no use for fighting fire\", from which it would appear that this source of supply would have been of little value at the time the fire was discovered. There is no evidence on my files of application having been received from the Indian Agent or Principal for hose and stand pipe equipment. Evidently the primary cause of the outbreak was the\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nneglect of the school employees in not making certain that the forge fire was completely extinguished at the end of the day's operations.\n\nThe question of water for fire protection for this school is covered by the Dominion Water and Power Bureau's report of March 4, 1931, where three proposals were submitted, two of which involved a cost of $27,000 and $21,111.00 respectively, the third being for a domestic supply only, which was subsequently installed at a cost of about $6,000.00. Whether or not a satisfactory fire pump could be installed in the nearby St. Mary's River at a moderate cost, I am unable to say, without an investigation. The problem would, in part, involve the quick operation of an engine during the very low temperatures prevalent in this locality.\n\nMeanwhile, consideration might be given to installation of a fire door, equipped with panic bolts, on the main stairway between the ground floor and first floor to delay spread of fire to the dormitories at night, also stand pipes and hose on the domestic water system near the present outbuildings, but they would be of use only if the fire was discovered on its immediate outbreak. Mr. Inspector Barry is of the opinion that an additional fire escape should be provided at the rear of the building for which estimates could be secured if funds are available for the purpose.\n\nRegarding the replacement of the buildings, I enclose herewith quotation by the Cranbrook Sash and Door Company of Cranbrook for $525.50 for the carpenter shop and $151.50 for the blacksmith shop, a total of $675.00. Construction would be undertaken without cost for labor as manual training projects. If there is any likelihood that funds can be found for this purpose, competitive tenders for the material would be called for.\n\nIt is noted that 5,000 feet of the flooring recently supplied was lost in this fire. This cost the Department $40 (?) per thousand feet, or a total of $200 (?) for the quantity destroyed. Whether this can be replaced is also a matter of funds available.\n\nPresumably we will receive, in due course, a requisition for replacement of essential tools destroyed.\n\nI would recommend that when Mr. Warren of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau is carrying out irrigation work provided for on the adjoining St. Mary's Reserve that he be asked to report on the possibility of the installation of an engine and pump on St. Mary's River, 1/8 mile distant from the school, to provide water for fire protection. It is contemplated that this might occupy the same site as that shown by a dotted line and marked \"Section Line Existing System\" on the plan accompanying his \"Report on Water Supply for St. Eugene School\" dated March 4, 1931.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

MARY'S INDIAN SCHOOL\nMISSION, CRANBROOK, B. C.\n\nOctober 25, 1938.\n\nPLASTER OFF WALLS AND CEILINGS.\n\nThe plaster is in very bad condition in many places in the School, particularly in the entrances or exits of both boys and girls basement sides. Also sewing rooms, main dining room, and hall-ways. This in itself is a very bad fire hazard, and should fire break out it would be drawn up through the walls and ceilings through the places where plaster is missing, and run under the floors all over the building before anyone would be aware.\n\nELECTRIC WIRING.\n\nThe electric wiring throughout the school is very old and quite out of date, and has apparently been repaired or altered at different times by persons other than electricians.\n\nSockets missing in several places and the live wires not taped, ordinary drop cord wiring running through holes in walls and partitions without any protection whatever in the way of insulation of any kind. Floor sockets installed in a poor manner, loose and dangerous. Most of the drop cord wiring is so old that it has perished, the insulation being all cracked.\n\nSTOVES, STOVE-PIPES AND OVENS.\n\nThe stove pipes in the laundry and drying room are very old and a very bad hazard. The pipes should all be renewed and on account of the length of some, would suggest that they be rivetted so that there will be no danger of coming apart.\n\nIn the bakery room there is no protection between the fire boxes of the ovens and the wooden floor. Would suggest that two layers of brick, layed flat be placed the full length and width of the ovens, with a four inch space left at front and sides running clear through the top layer of brick for ventilating purposes, also that some sheet iron or tin be placed on floor in front of fire box doors. At the present time the hot ashes fall out onto the wooden floor.\n\nFIRE ALARM GONGS.\n\nThere are several small two inch bells scattered about the building, most of which not even working, and therefore in case of fire of no use whatever.\n\nThere certainly should be an up to date fire alarm system installed immediately, as at the present time the lives of the Staff and the children are at stake.\nThe British Columbia Fire Marshal Act, under which we work are not satisfied with fire gongs or bells less than 10\" in diameter, and where buildings are more than two stories in height, there must be a gong on each floor with a break-the-glass station at each gong.\n\nAttached also is an ordinary electric switch in the Principal's office for the testing purposes, and also used when holding fire drills. This saves breaking the glass or removing same when testing gongs.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES.\n\nPanic bolts should be placed on all exit doors, so that in case of fire there will be no chance of the doors being either locked or hard to open. This matter is also compulsory under the British Columbia Fire Marshal Act.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion of Reverend Father Collins that a partition and door be placed on first landing of stairway, women's side, might say that if a panic bolt is installed on the door it would pass any inspection, as it would act as a temporary fire stop should a fire break out on the first floor or basement. With this panic bolt, no person could go upstairs at night and yet at the same time would act as a very good escape from fire should it break out upstairs. Door could be left wide open in daytime.\n\nHOUSEKEEPING CONDITIONS.\n\nHousekeeping conditions are excellent and cannot be improved.\n\nENGINE ROOM.\n\nCould be kept a little cleaner, too much oil around the floor. Engine apparently pumping some oil.\n\nWould suggest all oil cans with exception of those absolutely necessary be kept elsewhere.\n\nBATTERY ROOM.\n\nSuggest an opening be made in ceiling of the battery room, as I noticed quite a strong amount of gas generated from the batteries.\n\nGARAGE.\n\nThe windows of the garage between that building and the Bakery room should be covered with sheet iron or some metal of some kind. This building also used as the gasolene pump room creates a bad fire hazard and I would suggest the gasolene pump be installed at some safer place.\n\nBARNs AND OUTBUILDINGS.\n\nThere are some very fine and valuable outbuildings including the large barn and stables, but absolutely no fire protection. Would suggest that standard stand-pipes be\ninstalled someplace near the main pumping machinery and enough fire hose be purchased and attached to stand-pipes to reach these outbuildings.\n\nThere is no doubt whatever should a fire break out at the present time not only would the buildings burn, but all the stock would be in danger.\n\nMight say in conclusion, I feel too much cannot be said about some of the items mentioned in this report, especially with regard to the Fire Gongs, Fire Escapes and the Electric wiring, as each one is a very bad fire hazard in itself, and now knowing the layout of the building I feel that should a fire break out, it might be with terrible consequences.\n\nINSPECTION MADE ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14th 1938, BY P. ADAMS, FIRE CHIEF, CRANBROOK, B.C.\nfrom the Fire Department there can be no guarantee of security or safety from the worst that easily could happen, unless dependable pressure to make the best use of fire fighting equipment is supplied.\n\nI enclose herewith itemized statements from the Cranbrook Sash & Door Co. quoting on the materials required to re-build the Carpenter and Blacksmith Shops, at respective costs of $523.59 and $151.50.\n\nIn addition to this I would point out, as shown in previous reports, about 5000 feet flooring lost, that had recently been purchased to re-floor the Dormitories; this also, is urgently needed.\n\nThe enclosed statements of cost in respect of all materials required to replace buildings burned, are furnished only in the hope that they may be helpful to the Department as a means of supplying accurate information as to the cost of re-building, should they decide to do so.\n\nI/L\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., concerning my report of the Tools and Building Materials that were saved, as well as those that were lost in the recent fire at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI had not thought of requisitions when writing that report; but only of complying with the request as expressed in your letter of the 5th for a full and completely detailed statement in triplicate, of the loss sustained.\n\nThe report submitted by the Reverend Principal, enclosed with my monthly report was, I felt, so full and complete in every detail of what actually happened at the fire, that nothing more accurate could be written, apart from the credit paid to myself. What actually caused the fire I do not know; the Principal doesn't know, although it is stated in his report that the Forge in the Blacksmith shop had been used in the afternoon of that day, and that the fire might not have been entirely extinguished. He also states, that a boy was sent to the Blacksmith shop several hours later, where the fire originated, and was slow returning. Inferring that, if the fire was still alive, he might have fanned the flames causing sparks to fall on the floor, which, later, might have started the outbreak. It is all conjecture; no one actually knows, but what we do know is this, had there been proper fire protection at the School, the Buildings could easily have been saved. In this respect, as in others, the Principal's statement is correct, when he insists that a REAL FIRE HOSE WITH PLENTY OF PRESSURE would have saved everything.\n\nMay I quote from a statement issued by the Acting Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Brigade, to his Worship the Mayor, and members of the City Council. With respect to this fire he states:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\"A very serious fire hazard exists at the Kootenay Indian Residential School; the School itself, a large two storey building, is without adequate Fire Escapes, and exposed to danger from several out-buildings such as barns etc., which are quite near. There is practically no fire protection whatever. The pressure is so low in the Domestic water supply that it is of no use for fighting fire. The situation is very dangerous and should have the attention of those in authority.\"\n\nSo has written the Acting Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Department.\n\nThere is not a soul in the Cranbrook district familiar with the School who fails to realize the ever lurking danger of a holocaust. There is grave responsibility somewhere, in the event of a serious fire, for the protection of the Children and the Staff, and yet, in the words of the Acting Chief, a very serious fire hazard exists, and needless to say will continue to exist, until there is sufficient equipment and water power to fight a fire.\n\nThe Cranbrook Fire Department sent one man and a Fire Engine. They were not too easily pressed into service, but did good work when they got there. The Provincial Police also turned out with Fire Extinguishers and did their best, which was simply not good enough to make any impression; without a water supply the buildings just had to go.\n\nIf we are to have any protection at all against a recurrence of what happened the other night, I would most respectfully suggest that an agreement should be arrived at with the Cranbrook Fire Department to respond immediately when called, otherwise we would not have a chance, and even with the fullest measure of cooperation...\"\nfrom the Fire Department there can be no guarantee of security or safety from the worst that easily could happen, unless dependable pressure to make the best use of fire fighting equipment is supplied.\n\nI enclose herewith itemized statements from the Cranbrook Sash & Door Co. quoting on the materials required to re-build the Carpenter and Blacksmith Shops, at respective costs of $523.59 and $151.50.\n\nIn addition to this I would point out, as shown in previous reports, about 5000 feet flooring lost, that had recently been purchased to re-floor the Dormitories; this also, is urgently needed.\n\nThe enclosed statements of cost in respect of all materials required to replace buildings burned, are furnished only in the hope that they may be helpful to the Department as a means of supplying accurate information as to the cost of re-building, should they decide to do so.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith report, dated the 17th instant, of Mr. Indian Agent Irwin, regarding the loss by fire of outbuildings and equipment of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which occurred on the 29th ultimo. The report is not very satisfactory, in that it must be read in conjunction with that of the Reverend Principal of the School, dated the 30th ultimo.\n\nIt is observed that both the Indian Agent and the Principal place the responsibility for the loss on the lack of hose and fire-fighting equipment, the Principal stating that both of them had seen this lack and did what they could to have it remedied. In this connection, I would advise that the matter of fire protection for this institution has been the subject of discussion over the past three years, the Agent having the Cranbrook Fire Chief, Mr. P. Adams, make an inspection of the premises on October 14, 1938, a copy of this report being enclosed herewith, most of the recommendations having been carried out, except the installation of panic bolts on exits in the main building, fire door, and placing of standpipes and a supply of hose near the outbuildings.\n\nThe latter item is of interest in regard to this particular fire and is dealt with on page 2 of Inspector Barry's report of November 13, 1938, as follows:\n\n\"I do not agree with the Fire Chief in regard to the provision of standard or any other sort of stand pipes or the provision of any hose for the protection of the outbuildings. The Department is well aware that the system of DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY recommended in one of my reports five or six years ago has been chosen as against a most expensive alternative system. The present domestic water system is giving excellent service. It is quite inadequate in the case of fire fighting for which it was never intended. Stand pipes and hose will only be required when the Department has funds enough to install a new fire fighting water system the plans of which are on file with the Department. I can not recommend that this be done at the present time.\"\n\nIt should also be noted in the Agent's report that he quotes the Acting Chief of the Cranbrook Fire Brigade as stating that \"The pressure is so low in the domestic water supply that it is of no use for fighting fire\", from which it would appear that this source of supply would have been of little value at the time the fire was discovered. There is no evidence on my files of application having been received from the Indian Agent or Principal for hose and stand pipe equipment. Evidently the primary cause of the outbreak was the\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nneglect of the school employees in not making certain that the forge fire was completely extinguished at the end of the day's operations.\n\nThe question of water for fire protection for this school is covered by the Dominion Water and Power Bureau's report of March 4, 1931, where three proposals were submitted, two of which involved a cost of $27,527.00 and $21,111.00 respectively, the third being for a domestic supply only, which was subsequently installed at a cost of about $6,000.00. Whether or not a satisfactory fire pump could be installed in the nearby St. Mary's River at a moderate cost, I am unable to say, without an investigation. The problem would, in part, involve the quick operation of an engine during the very low temperatures prevalent in this locality.\n\nMeanwhile, consideration might be given to installation of a fire door, equipped with panic bolts, on the main stairway between the ground floor and first floor to delay spread of fire to the dormitories at night, also stand pipes and hose on the domestic water system near the present outbuildings, but they would be of use only if the fire was discovered on its immediate outbreak. Mr. Inspector Barry is of the opinion that an additional fire escape should be provided at the rear of the building for which estimates could be secured if funds are available for the purpose.\n\nRegarding the replacement of the buildings, I enclose herewith quotation by the Cranbrook Sash and Door Company of Cranbrook for $523.50 for the carpenter shop and $151.50 for the blacksmith shop, a total of $675.00. Construction would be undertaken without cost for labor as manual training projects. If there is any likelihood that funds can be found for this purpose, competitive tenders for the material would be called for.\n\nIt is noted that 5,000 feet of the flooring recently supplied was lost in this fire. This cost the Department $40 (?) per thousand feet, or a total of $200 (?) for the quantity destroyed. Whether this can be replaced is also a matter of funds available.\n\nPresumably we will receive, in due course, a requisition for replacement of essential tools destroyed.\n\nI would recommend that when Mr. Warren of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau is carrying out irrigation work provided for on the adjoining St. Mary's Reserve that he be asked to report on the possibility of the installation of an engine and pump on St. Mary's River, with a pipeline to the school, to provide water for fire protection. It is contemplated that this might occupy the same site as that shown by a dotted line and marked \"Suction Line Existing System\" on the plan accompanying his \"Report on Water Supply for St. Eugene School\" dated March 4, 1931.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st instant with reference to fire protection for Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would advise that I wrote you in this connection on the 21st instant. No doubt you have now received this report.\n\nAs stated, the report covering a water system for fire protection is covered by the Dominion Water & Power Bureau's report of March 4, 1931. However, this deals with gravity systems that are quite costly. A similar need for fire protection was required for the old Alberni Residential School under very similar conditions as exist at Kootenay. A survey was made by the Bureau and covered by their report of December 5, 1935. It will be apparent that their recommendation and cost (approximately $3,600) would approximate those required at the Kootenay School, subject, of course, to survey.\n\nIn regard to entering into an agreement with the Cranbrook Fire Department in order to make their services available to the school, I would point out that the school is about six miles from Cranbrook; that the domestic water supply would not permit them to employ effective fire fighting by hose without pumping from St. Mary's River, which, in my opinion, is too distant for their equipment; and it would probably be found that fire insurance companies would not permit them to leave the town unprotected.\n\nThis is the fourth fire that has occurred at this institution, but it is obvious that there is not a great deal more that can be done to protect the property, other than first aid equipment. If the Dominion Water & Power Bureau's Engineer\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nis requested to survey the situation when he is in the locality in the near future, as suggested in my letter of the 21st instant, he could no doubt make a report on the desirability of installing some stand pipes and hose equipment on the existing domestic supply for this purpose, and the cost of same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

I have carefully noted the second paragraph of your letter of the 23rd instant and in view of the limited amount available in the current year's appropriation it will not be possible to proceed with the project that you mention. I have also noted that you do not recommend making an endeavour to enter into an agreement with the Cranbrook Fire Department.\n\nYou should, however, arrange for the immediate installation of a fire door equipped with panic bolts.\n\nI also trust that, as requested in my letter of the 21st instant, either yourself or Mr. Coleman will find it possible to visit the Kootenay Residential School at an early date. At that time you should confer with the Agent and the Principal with a view to minimizing as much as possible any fire hazard at the school. When you visit the school you may consider it advisable to secure some additional fire extinguishers. If so, you may arrange for their purchase.\n\nYou have already been authorized to purchase the material required for the re-erection of the carpenter shop. The Purchasing Branch here\n\nMajor D.M.

F. Dawson,\nResident Architect, D.F.W.,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Engines in Power Plant\nIndian Residential School, Cranbrook, B. C.\n\nThe Gasoline Engine which was used to operate the lighting generator has been disconnected and a new Lister Diesel Engine installed in its place. This new engine is Lister - Size C.E. 24/17 - Serial 363580 - 16 H. P. at 1200 R.P.M. It is now in operation but will require much further work before the installation is complete.\n\nThe Petter Engine which was used to drive the Triplex pumps which supplied the School with fresh water and incidentally the fire service is out of commission and at present the pump is operated from the new Lister Engine by means of a counter shaft. This arrangement would be fairly satisfactory if it was properly installed but the shaft now in operation is made out of a piece of pipe and is very much out of line and when in operation constitutes a bad danger hazard.\n\nI would suggest the following for consideration if the present type of installation is to be continued. Install proper steel shaft and cast-iron bearings and hanger brackets or, better still, send the Petter engine to a reliable firm either at the Coast or Calgary, Alberta for a complete overhaul and reinstall it in its present position and keep the Lister for the Light Generator.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

Small\nS.P.P. Engineer, D.P.W.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Mr. T. J. Arnall's reports on his inspection on 21st July, 1941, of the heating unit and power plant at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B. C., together with copies of Certificates covering Boilers No. 1869 No.1 Left Hand; No. 1870 No. 2 Right Hand, and No. 44850, at the above School.\n\nWith special reference to Mr. Arnall's observations, as contained in his letter of August 22nd (a copy of which is attached) on the engines comprising the power plant, I would draw the Department's attention to the contents of the Report on \"Proposed Fire Protection and Repairs to Domestic Water Supply, St. Eugene Indian School, Kootenay Agency\" by Mr. W. C. Warren, under date of June 29th, 1941, a copy of which has no doubt been supplied to the Department by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nIt would appear that, whatever work may be contemplated later, it is evident that a proper\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\noverhead shaft with attachments should be installed in order that the existing domestic water pump may be successfully operated by the new Lister engine supplied by the Department for the operation of the electric lighting plant. The operation of the pump through the present temporary shafting is not only inefficient but is likely to cause undue wear on the new engine.\n\nThe Petter engine to which Mr. Arnall refers was supplied some time ago to operate the pumping plant. It was overhauled at considerable expense by the Cranbrook Foundry & Machine Shops (Mr. C. E. MacKinnon), Cranbrook, B. C. (see your letter No. 155-0-5 of August 24th, 1938, in this respect). The operation of this engine has not been satisfactory and, as it is not possible to use it in its present condition, I would recommend that this particular engine be examined and overhauled by a firm in this City having the necessary qualified mechanics and proper facilities for such work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 1, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing Mr. Arnall's reports with reference to the boilers at the Kootenay Residential School. You may arrange for the immediate installation of a proper steel shaft and cast-iron bearings and hanger brackets. This will permit the water pump being operated by the new Lister engine.\n\nIf the Petter engine can be placed in working condition at a reasonable cost you may make the necessary arrangements. Incidentally we were recently informed that the engineer at the Kootenay School had expressed the opinion that he could put this engine in running condition if supplied with a few parts. If this information is correct, it might be possible to save considerable expenditure.\n\nI note you refer to Mr. Warren's report on proposed fire protection and repairs to the domestic water supply at the Kootenay School. The cost of the proposals made by Mr. Warren varies from $5,300.00 to $12,200.00. There are no funds available at the present time for carrying out any of Mr. Warren's proposals.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 15, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water Supply, Kootenay Indian Residential School, (St. Eugene), Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nIn reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of May 29th last regarding the possibility of providing fire protection at this school, attached hereto are two copies of Mr. Warren's report together with copies of Mr. Webb's explanatory letter of the 30th ultimo.\n\nIt will be noted that the present source of supply (springs) is not adequate for fire protection without storage and that Mr. Warren has advanced several proposals:\n\n(1) To build a pump house near St. Mary's river, install in it a new fire pump and engine, together with the pump now installed in the school and supply water for fire protection and domestic use through separate mains at an estimated cost of $8,500.00.\n\n(2) When the present suction pipe and pressure tank require replacing, to eliminate the pressure tank, increase the pumping capacity to 100 gallons per minute and erect a 25,000 gallons high level storage tank, the pump to be installed in the building as at present, at an estimated cost of $8,700.00.\n\n(3) To increase the present pumping capacity to 50 gallons per minute and install inside hydrant stacks, base, etc., to afford a degree of fire protection at an estimated cost of $1,200.00.\n\nProposal No.1 would provide 500 g.p.m. and the supply would be positive as the pump would not be affected by a fire in the school building. This is the most desirable of the proposals submitted and should be undertaken as soon as sufficient funds can be provided. If this is found to be impracticable at present, then consideration should be given to Proposal No.3, in which all expenditures, except the new oil engine, are common to all proposals.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.

Warren, dated June 29th, there are several points I would like to clarify.\n\nIt is stated in the second paragraph on page 4 that a pumping plant from the St. Mary's river for fire protection purposes is estimated to cost $8800. This pumping plant would include two sets of equipment, a pump for fire protection purposes having as a source the St. Mary's river, and a pump for domestic supply from the springs, the existing pumping equipment being moved from its present location to a new pump house to be constructed. This will explain the statement on page 6 of the report \"the cost of the pumping plant would be reduced by a like amount ($1200) if the work is done now\". The $1200 being about $700 for a new engine and $500 for fire equipment and installation, both items being included in the estimate of fire pump cost.\n\nI would call your attention to an error in the penultimate paragraph on Page 6 - $3600 in the last line of paragraph should read $4600.\n\nI would ask you to kindly pass this information on to persons in receipt of a copy of this report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.E.

WARREN\n\nCranbrook, B.C.\nJune 29, 1941.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCranbrook, B.C.\nJune 29, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of June 7th I today made an inspection of the domestic water system at St. Eugene Indian School with a view to providing additional water for fire protection. In this connection I wish to report as follows:\n\nPRESENT SYSTEM\n\nThe existing system comprises a Fairbanks-Morse 5\" x 5\" triplex displacement pump driven from a line shaft by belt connection to a 16-H.P. Lister oil engine, which alternately drives the generator of the electric lighting plant. The probable capacity of the pumping plant at present is 20 to 25 gallons per minute.\n\nThe pumping plant is located in a room adjoining the boiler room, about 14 feet below ground level. A pneumatic tank, 4-1/2 feet in diameter and said to be 30 feet long, buried 14 feet in the ground outside the pump house, provides for distribution throughout the school building. The estimated available water from the pneumatic tank based on the above measurements is 1600 to 2000 gallons. The 3-inch suction pipe of the pump extends about 1200 feet, to a tank of 5000 gallons capacity near St. Mary's river, where water collects by way of a 4-inch pipeline about 3000 feet long from springs which provide a varying flow of 25 to\n50 gallons per minute.\n\nNo outlets are available on the distribution line in the school for fire hose connections.\n\nHISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere is little information to be obtained locally on the initiation and development of the present system prior to 1923. Sometime previous to 1923 St. Joseph's creek was abandoned as a source of supply due to contamination by sewage from the town of Cranbrook about seven miles distant, in favour of the St. Mary's river. In 1923 a new intake well and inlet from St. Mary's river was constructed.\n\nIn 1932 St. Mary's river was abandoned as a source of supply due to contamination by sewage from Kimberley and the present source (springs) was developed. At that time also a new pumping engine (now out of service) was installed. The present hook-up of engine and pump was apparently made a year or more ago and is not an efficient arrangement.\n\nMost of the equipment although 20 years old or more appears to be serviceable. Pressure tests up to 130 lbs. within the past year indicate no weakness in the pneumatic tank, pump and connections, except the relief valve and water level indicator which do not function according to the school mechanic.\n\nFIRE HAZARD\n\nThe value of the buildings on the school premises is probably not in excess of $110,000 of which the school alone represents more than 90%.\n\nThe principal outbuilding, a frame barn, is almost certain to be a total loss in the event of a fire within it. There are a number of other\nsmall frame structures closer to the school building but of comparatively small value.\n\nThe school is a concrete-block building 30 years old. Danger of fire would be entirely within the building provided all unnecessary hazards were removed from the immediate vicinity.\n\nIt is very likely that the building would be a total loss if an inside fire could not be extinguished within one hour.\n\nThere are four male members of the staff ordinarily resident at or near the school who would be available in the event of a fire. An Indian rancheria at a distance of about one-quarter mile could provide some assistance and the Cranbrook fire department, I am informed by the school principal, will, and have on occasion, lent assistance.\n\nWATER FOR FIRE PROTECTION\n\nThere are only two possible sources which will provide water in sufficient quantity for fire protection purposes without large capacity storage. These sources are St. Joseph's creek and St. Mary's river. Both streams are contaminated by sewage and a supply for fire protection purposes secured from either would require facilities independent of the works existing for domestic service.\n\nA gravity supply from St. Joseph's creek through a pipeline about one mile in length, would provide sufficient water at 45-lbs. hydrant pressure for fire protection. Such an installation although meeting certain requirements better than any other, probably cannot be considered on account of the high cost, estimated to be $16,275.00 with complete fire equipment.\nAlthough St. Joseph's creek passes close to the school it would not be a desirable source for a pumped supply. There would be difficulties of an assured supply during the irrigation season and probably during the winter months.\n\nA supply obtained from the St. Mary's river by pumping would cost approximately $8800. A suitable installation would provide water under 65 lbs. hydrant pressure at a rate of 500 gallons per minute.\n\nPUMPING PLANT FOR FIRE PROTECTION\n\nThe high cost of a pumping plant is due to the particular conditions which must be met in obtaining water from the St. Mary's river for fire purposes. Such a plant must operate instantly under all adverse conditions, otherwise the investment is wasted.\n\nIn order to provide the greatest efficiency in operation a pumping plant should be located as near the source of supply as practical. Although it would be possible to install a fire pump in the present engine room of the school I do not believe it would be desirable and the cost would not be lessened.\n\nPossibly the best and most convenient site for a pumping plant is near the site of the old intake, where the depth of water at low stage is about 2\u00bd feet at a distance into the stream of 60 feet, from the well. This depth is barely sufficient for protection during winter when temperature is likely to drop as low as -40\u00b0 F. Ice jams are likely to occur at any point along the river for a mile or more.\n\nA pump house requires to be sufficiently below ground level to provide protection for the machinery in an operating condition when the temperature is low and at the same time be above highwater stage.\nThe range between low and high stages is about 7\u00bd feet. Such a site necessitates long intake and suction pipelines, as well as a screen chamber. The old intake well would probably be a source of trouble if used as a screen chamber as it is built on the gravel and has no bottom. I believe it would cost less to construct a new one rather than try to make the old one serviceable.\n\nRecords indicate that winter temperatures as low as -40\u00b0F may be expected and that low temperatures are likely to prevail for lengthy periods. Consequently pipelines should have a depth of cover of about 7 feet and hydrants 8 feet, as well as being suitably housed.\n\nThe present pumping plant is free from frost difficulties due to its proximity to the school heating plant. An auxiliary heating plant for a detached pump house becomes a necessity even if operated only a few times during the winter.\n\nALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION\n\nIt should be realized that the present water works equipment has been in service about 20 years and may require complete renewal within the next 5 or 10 years.\n\nUnder the most favourable conditions the supply from the existing plant is limited to about 50 G.P.M. and there are no means of making use of the plant capacity for fire service.\n\nRegardless of whether a pumping plant for fire protection purposes only is to be installed now or in the future, I would recommend that the domestic plant be overhauled to make it function to its full capacity and that hydrants be installed within the school.\nbuilding, to make available, in the event of a fire, a supply of 50 gallons per minute. This is estimated to cost $1200.00. The cost of the pumping plant would be reduced by a like amount if this work is done now.\n\nAs an alternative to the fire pump installation I would suggest that when renewal of the pressure tank and suction pipe is indicated that a high level tank of 25,000 gallons capacity be substituted for the present pneumatic tank and the domestic pumping equipment be stepped up to 100 gallons per minute capacity, equipment to be housed as at present, and outside hydrants provided. Such an installation would assure a supply of 500 gallons per minute for a period of one hour and would meet the requirements of a situation the school staff are likely to be able to deal with successfully.\n\nThe cost of this suggested installation is estimated at $8700 exclusive of the cost of inside hydrants, hose and new engine. Assuming that all of the old plant will require renewal shortly at an estimated cost of $4100 the net investment for the degree of fire protection afforded would be about $6600.\n\nWhile preparing this report I have not had an opportunity of making new plans to accompany it. However, all of the essential information is contained in the plans accompanying my report of March 4, 1931. Should it be necessary, detailed plans can be prepared of any or all of the proposals advanced.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Instead of 2-inch hose, it is intended to provide 1\u00bd-inch standard linen hose for use inside the school, and 2\u00bd-inch cotton rubber-lined hose for use outside, the latter being the same size as is used by the city of Cranbrook.\n\nMr. Warren's report discusses three possible schemes. In order to make a fair comparison of the cost of these schemes, they have been analyzed from the point of view of the capital expenditure that would be necessary in each case within the next five or ten years. Briefly, the schemes are as follows:\n\n1. To build a pump house near the St. Mary's River, install in it a new fire pump and 60 H.P. engine together with another new 7 H.P. engine and the pump now installed in the school and supply water for fire protection from the river and for domestic use from springs, as at present, through separate mains.\n\nThis scheme would provide 500 gallons of water per minute for fire protection purposes for an indefinite period. Its cost would be -\n\nFor fire protection (immediate outlay) $8,900.\nFor renewal of existing installation (outlay in 5 or 10 years) $3,400.\n\nTotal $12,200.\n2. When the present suction pipe and pressure tank require replacing, to eliminate the pressure tank, increase the pumping capacity to 100 gallons per minute from the present source of supply, springs, and erect a 25,000 gallon high level storage tank, the pump to be installed in the building as at present. Its cost would be -\n\nFor fire protection and domestic water supply (outlay in 5 or 10 years) $8,700.\nFor additional inside fire protection equipment 500.\nTotal $9,200.\n\nThis scheme does not contemplate any fire protection until the pressure tank needs renewal at some future time. If installed, it would provide 500 gallons of water per minute for about one hour only.\n\n3. To increase the present pumping capacity to 50 gallons per minute, and to install inside hydrant stacks, hose, etc. This would make use of the present source of supply, springs. Its cost would be -\n\nFor fire protection and domestic water supply (immediate outlay) $1,200.\nFor renewal of existing installation (outlay in 5 or 10 years) $4,100.\nTotal $5,300.\n\nIf installed, this scheme would provide 50 gallons per minute, for possibly several hours.\n\nScheme No. 1 is recommended if funds can be made available. Its advantages are, that it provides a comparatively large supply of water for fire protection purposes for an indefinite period, and that the engines and pumps are in a separate building, not subject to destruction by a fire in the school building.\nScheme No. 2 is not recommended. It is comparatively expensive, would provide the same amount of water for fire protection as Scheme No. 1 - but for one hour only, and the engine and pump would be in the school building as at present, an additional fire hazard.\n\nScheme No. 3 is recommended only if funds for Scheme No. 1 cannot be made available in the near future. It has the advantage of immediate and total low cost, but will provide only 50 gallons per minute for possibly several hours. The engine and pumps would remain in the school building as at present, an additional fire hazard.\n\nWould you please advise me of your wishes in this matter.\n\nJ.M.

However, as stated above, this is contingent on obtaining funds and due to uncertain conditions at the present time it is impossible for me to give any forecast regarding the date on which we can put into effect the plans that we may make.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

The Principal states that he has had to have it repaired twice. The last repair job was only completed on the 9th instant, after the school had been without lights for over a week. He further advises that this latter repair job does not appear to have remedied the trouble.\n\nI was very much concerned at receiving this report. The equipment that was installed should operate in good order for many years. It was supplied by the Modern Electric, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nHas this firm done the repair work to which the Principal refers in his letter? Have you interviewed them and ascertained why this installation is not operating satisfactorily? I would like to have a complete report from them regarding the installation and the reason for its failing to function in the proper manner. I presume that the engineer at the school is fully qualified to handle the equipment that the Department has supplied.\n\nI should appreciate an early reply to this letter, a copy of which is being sent to the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Engine Cranbrook School.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions our Diesel mechanic has made an inspection of the above Engine and we enclose herewith a copy of his report.\n\nWhen we first received inquiries regarding this Engine it was suggested that a new crankshaft be supplied, but as this old engine has operated for many years we do not think the expense of a new crankshaft would be justified and it would be difficult to get, and we expect to make satisfactory repair by re-grinding this shaft and refitting the bearings to suit. We give below an estimate of this work, and after re-fitting the engine should continue to give you satisfactory service for a considerable time as this overhaul will cover all the main working parts.\n\nThis size of engine is no longer made and the nearest we have in stock at the present time is a 10 H. P. Engine which sells for $592.00, and at time of writing we have only one on hand. We quote as follows:\n\nRepairs on 7 H. P. Automic Engine, including:\n\n- Regrind crankshaft\n- Rebores Cylinder\n- Make and fit oversize piston with pin, bushing, and rings\n- Reabbitt main bearings and connecting rod bearing\n- Re-fit fuel pump with new plunger and sleeve\n- Overhaul and repair fuel atomizer\n- Weld cylinder head which is cracked on the outside\n- Supply Gaskets, new gauge glass and sundry bolts\n\nPrice F. O. B., Vancouver, $259.00\nWe do not provide in the above for any parts which are found to be missing.\n\nHoping this meets with your approval, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\nB. C. EQUIPMENT COMPANY, LTD.\n\nWJRoach:JM Per:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer to your letter of October 1st last, file 155-0-5, regarding proposed repairs to the Petter engine at Kootenay Indian Residential School, and to advise that after considerable correspondence with the Indian Agent, it was decided that the only method of securing a satisfactory estimate of the repairs needed was to have this engine shipped down to the Vancouver agents for same, which has been done. I enclose herewith the B.C. Equipment Company's report of the 20th instant, advising that the repairs to the engine will cost $239.00, subject to there being no parts missing from the engine, which I would consider unlikely.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would advise me by air mail if funds can be provided for the repair of this engine, which it is intended to use as a stand-by for pumping purposes for the school.\n\nI am arranging for the supply of the steel shaft and hangers for the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to proposed repairs to the Petter engine at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I note that the cost of the repairs and missing parts will amount to upwards of $259.00. This appears a large amount to spend and possibly it would put the engine in proper condition to operate for some years. It has, therefore, been decided to leave the matter to your judgment as to whether you should proceed with the repairs. In the event of your deciding to do so, a voucher, to which you should attach your purchase order, should be issued prior to March 31.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M.

Indian Affairs,\nCity.\n\nMr. A. Irwin, Agent.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are presenting herewith a report on the Diesel equipment purchased from us last year. This unit was a 16 H.P. Lister Diesel and was belt coupled to your generator at the Kootenay Residential School. It was placed in service on March 27/41.\n\nAt the time of installation everything was done to make a first class job. The units were placed on an exceptionally solid foundation, properly secured and neatly finished and painted. The engine operated excellently and handled the total load with ease. We had a representative of our supplier (Bruce Robinson Electric, Calgary) call and check the installation in order to be sure that no detail had been overlooked. He expressed himself as well satisfied with the job and cautioned that the correct type of oil be used at all times. To cover this we had Bruce Robinson Electric write the principal of the school on April 17/41 advising him of the type and grade of oil that would guarantee continued performance.\n\nSome three months after completing the installation the operator complained of a leaky head gasket and fuel line. We immediately obtained these parts for him and when we delivered them we noticed the engine covered with dirt and oil and the whole installation showed every sign of lack of attention. We took it upon ourselves to send a workman down to the school and completely clean the job over again. We also asked the operator to keep the engine in proper condition. The oil filter was extremely dirty and we ordered two replacements by long distance phone in order that this important detail could be attended to at once. These replacement filters were received and delivered within twenty-four hours.\n\nWe heard no more from the job until October. The operator called at our shop and mentioned that he was going to have a diesel mechanic look at the engine as there was a 'knock' in it. We were immediately concerned and very surprised that a complaint was not made to us at once. We went at once to the school with a first class mechanic to investigate. We found that a connecting rod bearing had completely burned out and that the other bearings were quite loose. The cause of the bearing failure we found the engine sumps were so filled with heavy slimy sludge that the oil pump intake was completely blocked.\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nElectrical Merchandise and Contracting\n\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nThe oil filter was completely saturated with filth and incapable of performing its function. A new replacement filter was lying unopened on the shelf.\n\nThis sludge could not possibly have formed to this extent short of several weeks. Had ever reasonable care been given this engine its presence would have been detected and crank case would have been cleaned long before any damage could result. Further if sludge was consistently forming we should have been notified and an investigation would have been promptly made.\n\nWe checked at once on the oil used and a sample was taken. Our supplier informs us that it is of a type entirely unsuitable for this work. It emulsifies due to a slight condensation formed in the crank case on cold starting and forms a sludge. We cannot understand why an incorrect oil was used despite our having a special letter sent to the school recommending the proper type. (We might say in passing that since the repairs were made and the correct oil used there is not a trace of sludge to be found.)\n\nWe obtained a new set of connecting rod shell bearings by phone but were unable to obtain any other parts from the same source. As the school needed the engine at once we had the mechanic install the new connecting rod shells only. He was unable to make a first class job of this as the operator had at some time previous to this experienced trouble and had filed the connecting rod cap in an effort to lighten the burned bearing. This was admitted to the mechanic by the operator after that it was apparent that it could not be concealed. The new precision shells could not be held in place by a cap that had been filed out of shape. We wish to point out at this time that it is unreasonable to assume that an operator of an engine would go to the great trouble of removing and filing a bearing cap if he had a just reason to complain about an engine under guarantee.\n\nWe obtained and kept in stock for many weeks the parts necessary to put this engine in good condition. We did not receive however an order from the school to have this work done.\n\nWhen it was necessary to overhaul the engine properly a short time ago we removed the crankshaft and had the crank throw bearings precision ground to a standard size. This was necessary as the throw bearings had been scored by the burned bearing shells. Without this consistent trouble would have been the result.\n\nThe engine is now in good shape and operating properly. It will not continue to operate unless it is given proper attention. An operating instruction book was supplied at the time of the installation. If this is followed the engine will perform excellently as several others of the same design are doing in this district. The engine must be kept clean at all times above all else.\nMODERN ELECTRIC\nElectrical Merchandise and Contracting\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nThe filthy conditions under which this engine has been operated in the past will only cause further failure. We will at any time do anything possible to help this unit give service and satisfaction. We cannot however be responsible for failure when instructions are ignored.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nModern Electric,\nCopy sent to Mr. Irwin\n\nOttawa,\nApril 15, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a report made by the Modern Electric Company regarding their inspection of the Diesel electric equipment supplied to the Kootenay Residential School last year. This was expensive equipment and, unless it receives proper attention, will soon deteriorate. Under present circumstances it is especially difficult for the Department to overlook neglect of equipment because this is not only expensive but difficult to obtain.\n\nI feel certain that you will personally see that this equipment receives, in future, the care it deserves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

According to the latest report, the costly breakdown was due to the carelessness and lack of cleanliness of the operator and, ultimately, to the oil used\u2014according to the report on which you based your covering letter, a representative of the suppliers had O.K.'d the installation of the fault was all ours\u2014\n\nI went into his office but did not get far\u2014I wrote to the suppliers & asked what qualifications his representatives had to examine the installation & declare it excellent. That was several weeks ago\u2014so far, no supplier has not replied\u2014That makes me suspicious\u2014In another School, a \"representative\" called to check upon our boiler plant. It turned out that he was only a sales agent & knew nothing of the boiler plant\u2014I had similar experience here with the partial rewiring of the School\u2014\n\nIt is possible that the representative who called in really competent but, to date, his company has not be\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nStalled the engine (a really competent man), the Indian agent, the operator himself. The meeting was to have been held on Monday. The operator & I were here but no one came. After two days later, the gentleman who mistook the agent came and the operator was absent.\n\nAt the meeting, Mr. Ward, who installed the engine, repeated that he faulted Warden to the oil and it's to the incompetence or negligence of the operator. It would take a long letter to go into all the details. If you wish to know them, you can get in touch with me by phoning St. Joseph's Rotary, Ottawa, on June 1st as I shall be there.\n\nAs the trouble is said the line to be oil used (in spite of a better bent line but never received), I asked the local union oil agent to get facts on the oil (Diesel type, more especially for Diesels) from a competent authority in his Company. The reply he received bears out the statement of our operator; the fault was not with the oil but with the faulty gasket in the cylinder head which let water into diesel.\n\nI knew nothing of Diesels but I do know that it is hard to get at the bottom of this matter. Statements alleged have been made by others, some are denied by those who are said to have made them.\n\nJean tell you more if you wish to see me.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nG. J.

Res. School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nExtract from letter from Rev. G. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C., dated October 22, 1942.\n\nOriginal on 155-0-1\n\nI am asking the local Indian agent to apply for a refund of about $90.00. I know that we have been very definitely told that we have no right to have work done without authority from the Department and then to expect the Department to meet the bill. The case was urgent - about a week before school opened I was informed that many toilets and some sinks were completely out of order or working only because of makeshift arrangements. There was no time to get permission and have the work done before school opened and so I had the work done. From a sanitary point of view it was very urgent.\nOttawa, October 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that an expenditure of approximately $90.00 has been incurred in repairing the toilets and sinks at the Kootenay Residential School. You may forward a voucher for this amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nCRANBROOK, B.C., Oct. 15, 1942\n\nRECEIVED from Kaslo Industrial School THE SUM OF\nNinety Two and 35/100 DOLLARS $92.35\n\nFOR\n\nPATMORE BROS.\n\nPer\n\nKINDLY RETAIN THIS RECEIPT\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing receipts (5) and an itemized bill recently received from Patmore Bros. I would greatly appreciate it if the Department would refund this money.\n\nWould you please mention to the Department that I am fully aware that they insist that a Principal should have no work done, unless he pays for it, until he has received permission from the Department. In the present case, the state of the Pupils' Toilets (and two others) of some pipes and sinks, was called to my attention less than a week before the opening of school, and there was no time to write to Ottawa and get a reply before school opened. Several Toilets could not be used, and others were used only through make-shift arrangements. Patmore Bros sent out a good man\u2014for the work he did, I expected that his bill would be higher than it is.\n\nI have written to Dr. MacQuarrie as you suggested, about the Travelling Clinic, and I have taken the occasion to give him a health report on the school, which is favorable.\n\nI regret to have to report that Patrick Moses met with an accident just before supper. He and other boys had just brought in a load of hay. Mr. Townsend was by the load of hay outside the barn, and had just had it pulled up. As Patrick is the boy he trusts most, he sent Patrick up to the loft to see that all went well. As the Carrier was taking the hay to the back of the loft Patrick appears to have decided to take a ride by holding on to the cable. He fell, or jumped, missed the hay and hit the floor. I fear that he has a badly broken leg or ankle. He was immediately taken to the hospital after the hospital and Doctor has been asked to meet him on his arrival. I have notified his Father.\n\nfor admission forms\n\nI enclose Application forms for Thomas White, and Francis Frank. Mr. Angus Wilson of Bonners Ferry had a local Doctor examine Thomas and sign the form. Dr. Brown examined the boy when he got here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned. G. Forbes, O.M.F.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which explains itself, also copy of an account submitted to the Principal by Patmore Bros of Cranbrook, for work done at the School, together with a receipt acknowledging payment in full.\n\nIf, under the circumstances noted in the Principal's letter, the Department would care to assume payment of this account by a refund to the Principal of the amount involved, it would be appreciated very much. A Credit Voucher could then be put through to cover the account.\n\nI/L\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nenclosure.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing account in connection with work done at the Kootenay School. As stated in my letter of the 31st ultimo, we are prepared to consider payment of this account. However, the last item reads -- \"Labour and car expense - $45.25\". This amount will have to be itemized showing the number of hours and the rate per hour, also the exact dates on which the work was done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nHeavy rains have made me again thankful the Dept. recently had a roof over our furnaces and engines renewed. If that had not been done, our engine room would have been flooded.\n\nYours very truly,\nG.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may expend an amount of $23.00 for repairing the motors of the refrigeration unit at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDecr.5th. Kooty.Ind.School\n1942 Cranbrook.B.C.\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin.\nIndian Agent.\nCranbrook.B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnless I am mistaken, there is still in Ottawa some of the grant made for repairs at this School. I would recommend that this money be used for the following purposes:\n\n(1) Certain rooms, such as the Disciplinarian's, the Sisters', the Chapel, some halls, etc., are very cold owing chiefly to poorly fitting windows and doors. In some of these rooms, water freezes. After an experiment I would suggest that all windows and doors be fitted with weather-strip. \"Ladore\" weather-strip has proved the best and most lasting. It will take a little less than 4000' and will cost 4 cents per foot less a small reduction which will more than pay for tacks. It would cost less if it could be bought wholesale, but this is impossible at present. McLennan, McFeeley & Prior of Vancouver inform me that they have had it on order for a long time, but have been unable to get any and they do not know if or when they will be able to get any. On account of danger to health (colds, pneumonia which may result from the cold and drafts coming through the doors and windows) I have taken it upon myself to buy up as much of Ladore weather-strip as possible (about 1000' feet to date) locally, and to ask the local Hardware stores (Parks, Hewre, Coy, McBrides) to try to pick up the balance. Prior to doing so, I asked McLennan McFeeley & Prior for a quotation so as to submit it to the Department. When they replied that they had none and had been unable to get any and could neither quote on it or guarantee to supply any, I bought up as much as I could and trust that the Department will approve of my action and pay for the weather-strip out of the money on hand.\n\n(2) There will not be sufficient money to make all the repairs needed on the barn\u2014reshingling, repainting, renewing half of the floor, replacing practically all the storm windows etc. (Some or all of these things were seen to be necessary by the Commissioner, Mr. Doucet and Captain Barry individually or collectively.) There will not be enough money for all of this but I would suggest doors for the Barn. The two large doors in the Hay-loft (about 16' by 14') have been missing for years. They are, and must be sliding doors and it is for them that most of the Hardware mentioned below is required. Some small doors are also missing in the Hay-loft, and two large double doors as well as two smaller doors (about 7' x 3\u00bd') require a little repair work in the barn proper.\n\nAt no expense to the Department, I have had nearly 100 panes of glass put into the windows of the barn, but even with this and with work done on the doors of the barn, it is very cold in the barn. This is no good either for the boys who milk early in the morning, or for the cows. I would submit, that even if it did take $50.00 or $100.00 more that remains of the appropriation, this money would be well spent; there would be more milk (all of which is used here) and the boys milking would not have to go...\nfrom their beds into a cold barn. This Barn by the way is Government property. All work, of course, would be done by the School.\n\nWith regard to the costs:\n\n(1) The Ledore weather-strip will cost approximately 4 cents per foot, or a very little less. I got 250' at 3 cents.\n\n(2) The doors:\n   Lumber and nails, $25.00 The School will pay anything above this amount (to be bought locally from Sash & Door Coy.)\n\nHardware (chiefly for two sets of large double doors) as quoted by McLennan, McFeely & Prior, Vancouver.\n   2 only, #351-12 Pulleys $2.85 each.\n   2 \" \" -11 \" 2.30 \" (4 needed)\n   42\" #50 Track and screws 6.87 all.\n   (8 needed) 4 only, Stanley Canada Roller bearing hangers; $17.00 per dozen, prs.\n   6 \" \" #214 x 2\u00bd long eye bolts. .17 each.\n   3 dozn. prs. #1481P hinges $2.70 per dozn. prs.\n\nThis last item will require A.I.J. priority rating.

During the past two years, Mr. Commissioner,\nMr. Inspector Barry, Mr. James & yourself agreed with me that reshingling & repainting were necessary as well as some other repairs. Other repairs were more urgent as was the finishing of the Carpenter shop. Now, however, if you will kindly get authority from the De-\npartment, I think we can start in on the barn.\n\nThe reshingling & repainting would be done at no cost for labour by J. Anthony and his boys. I need not point out that J. Anthony is a first class Carpenter. The other repair work would be done by the Manual Trainee and his boys.\n\n1. The doors etc. will be started soon. Owing to war restrictions, it was only today that I learned that certain supplies were on the way. This has held us up.\n\n2.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. Principal Forbes of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which explains itself: Having in mind conversations with the Departmental Officials during his recent visit to Ottawa, Principal Forbes is of the opinion that authority may be had at this time to make long overdue repairs to the School Barn, which would entail the following expenditures:\n\n- Shingles, 90 Squares as shown on the Principal's letter: $518.00\n- Lumber for scaffolding: $26.50\n- Shingle Nails: $27.00\n- 60 gals. Shingle Paint: $167.40\n- 5 \" Marshall Wells Best White Paint: $22.30\n- 3 \" Best Raw Linseed Oil: $4.50\n\nTotal: $764.70\n\nThe work would be done without any cost to the Department by the Rev. Father Anthony; the Manual Training Instructor, and a number of the older boys.\n\nIf the expenditures involved have the approval of the Department, kindly advise, and the necessary quotations from the firms mentioned in the Principal's letter will be sent forward.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1943.\n\nMr. A. Irwin, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School with reference to materials required for repairs to the barn and other buildings.\n\nThe Principal should by this time be fully conversant with our purchasing regulations and I am, therefore, surprised that he has proceeded with a very heavy purchase without submitting the matter definitely to us so that it could be handled in the required manner. While it is true we discussed with Father Forbes the amount available for this school, no authority was given him to purchase material.\n\nI note that the account for the shingles and lumber amounts to $543.50. You may arrange with him to forward this account to Indian Commissioner MacKay who is being written about the matter. It will not be possible for us to allow more than $500.00 of this amount.\n\nThe other quotations which the Principal has received should also be forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay for his consideration. He is being written about these matters also.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRev. Father Forbes, Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, recently visited the Department and at that time we informed him that there was an amount of $1000.00 available for repairs and improvements to the barn and other buildings at the Kootenay Residential School. Without any authority Father Forbes went home and purchased the following shingles and lumber:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 40 M #1 extra shingles|          | $5.20      | $208.00 |\n| 50 Squares #1 XXXXX\"  |          | $6.20      | $310.00 |\n| 18 Pcs. #1 spruce 2 x 10 - 16 | | | $16.80 |\n| 24 \" \" \" \" \" \" 2 x 4 - 16 | | | $8.70 |\n\n$543.50\n\nAs an explanation of his action he has forwarded a letter through Indian Agent Irwin's office which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Reshingling: I enclose quotation (with correction) from the Sash & Door Co. of Cranbrook. As no other shingles appear available and as what the Sash & Door Co. have on hand are all they will have until some time after the war, I have thought it better to follow their advice (marked with red arrow and underlined in red) as given in their letter of March 20th and I have ordered these shingles. As it turned out, I did this none too soon.\"\nWhile Father Forbes has not followed our purchasing regulations, it has been decided that, as the material is necessary and no doubt is scarce, we will allow an amount of $500.00 toward its cost. I am requesting the Indian Agent to forward the account to you for your consideration and it would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order for $500.00 and forward the account to this office.\n\nIn addition to the above, shingle nails, 60 gallons shingle paint, 5 gallons white paint and 3 gallons linseed oil are required. The Principal is obtaining quotations for these and I am directing Indian Agent Irwin to forward them to your office for consideration. You should award the business to whatever firm quotes you the best price and when forwarding the accounts you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nR.A.

The whole interior is kept spotlessly clean. Boys' and Girls' Dormitories, Class rooms, Sewing rooms, Kitchen, Dining room etc., present a clean and healthful appearance that can hardly be improved upon until funds are available to make a small investment in Kalsomine, Enamel and Paint.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. GEORGE FORBES, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Kootenay Indian Residential School,\nKOOTENAY, CRANBROOK, B. C., dated April 6, 1943.\n\nI sent the local Indian Agent Parks' Hardware's quotation on roof paint. Please do not order this paint or, if it has been ordered, please cancel the order, if possible, as I can get a paint that will cost practically nothing. Our carpenter, Father Anthony, (who draws no salary, by the way), got some oil free and made paint with which he did a good job on the carpenter shop,- roof & walls. He has about 20 gals. of oil left & believe he can get more - with this oil and with ingredients, for which he will have to pay only a few dollars. He can do a good job both on the walls and the roof of the barn. Some white paint will have to be bought for the trimmings.\nOttawa, April 26, 1943.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.

I am not going to exaggerate this, but I can say that, in the main girls' dormitory, there is a competent man who can assure us that the plaster may fall on anyone at any time. It will fall in this or another dormitory at any time but not on people. Remembering your request, I made inquiries through the local council. I made inquiries through the local council. It is a metal roof in Cranbrook that has been removed. His verdict was that a \"Crest Architect,\" Mr. Murray, had nothing to do with the fall of the plaster and designed the building and that he did not want the job because he could not guarantee success. He went back with his Indian agent friend as I did not want to take the responsibility of having a man do a job which he would not guarantee. (By the way, my job of accompanying the boys over the engineering was good.)\nTo the man who put the log on the School\u2014a Mr. Lundy. He removed this day less than a quarter of an inch. The cost of it, I understand, about $100. It looks like it will come. I have let Mr. Drivin do what he can. I shall be glad to hear from you.\n\nAbout a month ago, the Inspector of Indian Affairs, Mr. Coleman, was here. I spoke to him & Mr. Drivin about the roof, & they looked over it. Mr. Coleman suggested that I get in touch with the French people who own the roofs, free of charge, I understand, and exact nothing more although they would like to humour me. I wrote to these people and mentioned Mr. Coleman's name. They got in touch with him & came last night\u2014I know what a report they will send, although it may be more clever than I expect. Besides, the leak of which I spoke (due to faulty architecture,\u2014a valley which back up water), they found (& I know that it is true) some rust. The cost of repairs will be heavy, but you have a big investment here. Moreover, but this is a minor point, which I have mentioned before, several years ago, an earthquake made certain cracks in the building & damaged the entrance step.\n\nI am not exactly rolling in wealth, but if you will supply milk & about five gallons of whale oil for the barn, I'll have the barn painted, without cost to you. Also, if you will have the roof of the school (including Lundy's portion) done\u2014Mr. Drivin, Ed. Johnson.\nJuly 13, 1943.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I.\nPrincipal, Kootenay Indian Res. School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the condition of the roof of the Kootenay Indian School.\n\nI am sorry to learn that the roof of the engine room is not satisfactory. In a letter received from you in Nov. 1942 you stated that this roof was working properly.\n\nAs you were previously advised the amount of $1000.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements for the Kootenay School.\n\nIn a letter of April 14, 1943 Indian Agent Irwin was instructed to forward to Indian Commissioner MacKay an account covering the cost of shingles and lumber which you purchased. We promised at that time that we would allow $500.00 towards the amount which you expended. As this account has not been submitted for payment apparently the Indian Agent has neglected to submit it to the Commissioner.\n\nI note from your letter that we will likely hear from the Indian Commissioner's office regarding the roof. When this report is received it will receive careful attention. Possibly the condition of the roof is due to bad architecture. At the same time it must be realized that this building was built several years ago and in the meantime our records do not disclose any heavy expenditure on the roof.\n\nKind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCRANBROOK, B.

Equipment Company Limited of Vancouver now have a second hand head on hand that could be put into service by welding at a cost of $30.00 but naturally can give no guarantee on this part although they consider it would stand up until such time as a new head can be secured.

It would be appreciated if you would discuss this matter with the Principal and let me have an estimate of the cost of the work that is required. We do not seem to have any definite information in this regard.\n\nWhile we have now received the account for $499.40 for the shingles for repairing the barn, the Principal states in his letter that there is still a great deal of work to be done but he does not state if he requires more Departmental assistance in this particular regard. You should let me know if he does and, if so, the approximate amount.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1943.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, in further reference to the repairs at the Kootenay School. The Indian Agent was written yesterday and instructed to confer with you regarding the additional repairs that are required to the roof and to the barn. We have already received the account amounting to approximately $500.00 for the shingles and a cheque is being issued.\n\nIf you consider it advisable, the Department will approve the re-admission of the two children from the Okanagan Agency. In the event of your accepting them, you should forward me a special account covering the cost of their transportation and refund will be made to you.\n\nI note the special course that you have been providing for some of the girls and think this is a very worth-while procedure.\n\nI also note your remarks regarding Andy Paul.

The flat roof over the boiler room is about 30 feet below the overhanging eave of the main roof on which icicles form in the winter and fall on to the boiler room roof with considerable force. An attempt has been made to overcome this by roofing this portion of the roof with metal but it has not been entirely successful as the pounding has broken the joints of the metal. Also, the felt on the rest of this roof has buckled pretty badly and needs attention. The cost of this particular job would amount to $260.00. It is also proposed to lay a wooden walk on the portion bombarded by icicles but this could be carried out by the school staff.\n\nVarious repairs to the chapel roof would amount to $98.00 and a similar amount for the repairs to the flat deck on the main roof, including flashing and painting. The main roof was constructed with deep valleys at both ends of the building and these accumulate snow that causes water to back up above the flashings and penetrate the building with considerable damage to the plaster, and will, no doubt, in time rot the roof rafters and trusses. Various attempts have been made to correct this trouble without success and apparently the only remedy is to reduce the angle of the valleys by making a false bottom. The cost of this work would amount to $655.00, or a total of $1,111.00 for the entire job which would be carried out by Messrs.\nPatmore Brothers of Cranbrook under the supervision of Messrs. Fred. M. Beatty (Tremco Western) Limited, who are experts on roofing problems. I enclose herewith Messrs. Patmore Brothers' quotation and would request advice as to whether funds are likely to become available during the coming year for these repairs in whole or in part.\n\nFor D.M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Repairs, Kootenay Residential School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 3 and also copy of a tender for repairs at the above-noted school, received by the Indian Agent from Patmore Bros. of Cranbrook, sent forward therewith.\n\nWe have today received the approval of the Minister for the acceptance of this tender. It is noted that the cost of these repairs will amount to $1,111.00. It is our hope that you can make arrangements to have this work undertaken at the earliest possible date. I am returning herewith the original tender.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSept. 7th, 1943\n\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nMr. Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAlthough you know all the facts, I believe that the Department will appreciate it if I repeat the whole story.\n\n1-The barn (Government-owned). When I came here over two years ago, I noted that the barn needed re-shingling, that the large doors in the loft were missing, that the window frames and panes were in bad shape and that the whole barn needed repainting. The Commissioner, the Inspector, Mr. Doucet and you agreed with me, unless I am greatly mistaken, that these things needed immediate attention as could be given them.\n\nThe roof has been reshingled and painted and the doors for the loft have been made here. New window panes have been put in but I have not had the money to attend to the window frames.\n\nFather Anthony, a competent carpenter, did the above work with the help of some older boys as part of their manual training. He finds that the walls need to be repainted.\n\nAs the next item is of major importance, I think that we can do the rest of the work on the barn without financial assistance from the Department except perhaps for the paint which will cost about $200.00. It is quite possible that no assistance will be required in purchasing the paint (for the walls; the roof has been painted at no cost to the Department) but I am not absolutely sure of this. There is no charge for Father Anthony's work.\n\n2-The School building.\n\nA/The furnace, boiler and engine room. This is an addition to the original school building\u2014a deep basement behind the school with a roof about 8' above the ground. It is no exaggeration to say that this roof leaked like a sieve last year, so that during a rain storm, water poured on the engines, etc. At my request, the Department had this roof repaired a little over a year ago at a cost of a little over $200.00. By Spring (1943) that roof was practically in as bad condition as it was before Mr. Lundy repaired it.\n\nI showed the roof to Mr. Inspector Coleman and he suggested that I get in touch with the Tremco Co. as they are experts in roofs and as they examine roofs and offer their suggestions free of charge\u2014although, of course, they appreciate being given the work. I mentioned the roof of the main building to Mr. Coleman but, evidently, I did not speak clearly and he appears to have been and to be under the impression that I was speaking only of the boiler room roof.\n\nB/While in Ottawa, in the Spring, I called upon some of the members of the Indian Department and, in reply to a question about the condition of the School building, I mentioned\u2014\n\nThe roof of the main building. I drew such a picture of this leaky roof and of the damage being done to the plaster in the dormitories (and likely to the rafters, etc.) that, if I understood the gentleman to whom I was talking, he said that this was a matter to which immediate attention should be given. As we could not plaster the dormitories while the pupils are here and...\nas the roof is steep enough to shed rain, I decided to do nothing until the holidays.\n\nA local man looked at the roof but was not interested. He said that the roof was constructed for the Coast and that, although he could put sheet metal in the valleys, he could not guarantee that this would stop the leaks.\n\nThe trouble is this. There are two main and four secondary valleys in which the snow lodges because they are deep. When the heat under the roof melts this snow, the water runs to the edge of the roof where the first of it freezes and forms a wall of ice from one to two feet thick over the edge of the roof. This is because the roof projects for two or three beyond the walls and the cold air under this projection freezes the melted snow. When another thaw occurs, the water runs towards the edge of the roof but cannot run off because it is blocked by the wall of ice. It, therefore, backs up under the metal shingles and runs down into the dormitories, wetting the plaster ceiling and walls and, also, I presume, rotting the rafters, etc.\n\nAs stated, Mr. Coleman appears not to have understood me when I mentioned this matter and believed that I was talking only about the boiler-room roof. However, thanks to him, the Tremco people sent two really good men who, with myself, went up to the roof where they spent between one and two hours examining the whole roof. They appeared to know their business because they suggested a solution: The cause of the trouble is that the valleys are too deep; the solution is to build these valleys up. To put sheet metal in the valleys would do no good because it would not prevent the wall of ice at the edge of the roof.\n\nThey found that the metal sheeting, used in place of metal shingles on two raised parts of the roof, had almost rusted through and needed renewing. They said that this was not extraordinary and was due to the age of the sheeting. They said that these new sheets should be painted with a special paint. (In fact, they said that the whole roof should be painted with this paint but added that this could be put off for a year and go into next year's estimates).\n\nThey found that the leak over the Junior girls' dormitory could easily be repaired but I forget the details. I believe that it is just a case of the wearing-away of shingles around one of the ventilators.\n\nI saw nothing concerning this matter in the short itemized bill but they said that they would drive in the nails which have worked up (as nails do in such roofs) on the roof and that a new ridge board, on the top of the roof should be put in. (I forget who it was but someone told me that part of the trouble was that the nails originally used were too short. There may be some truth in that if we judge by the way in which the builders skimped on material in other parts of the building. However, I have seen nails drawn out of such roofs by the weather as, for instance, in the Cariboo School.)\n\nAnd now, the same building but another roof. Ice formed on the chapel roof, this Spring, (that is along the edges), forced the melted snow back under the metal shingles and this melted snow ran down inside the walls. We have not opened the walls to see what damage was done to the wood inside the walls but part of this water escaped through the window casings into the chapel.\n\nEither the Commissioner or the Inspector asked me to state which of these repair jobs I considered the most urgent and I replied that, if\nwe wish to save the wooden frame work or rather the rafters, beams, wood inside the walls, every item is urgent in so far as the roof on the main building is concerned. It is evident that it is urgent to keep a real, steady shower of rain off the furnaces, Lister and Otto engines, etc. (As stated, the main roof does not leak from rain, as the rain runs off, but the practically flat boiler-room does leak in the rain).\n\nThese two roofs need attention before the snow falls. The engines should be protected (boiler-room roof) and the children should be protected from a piece of plaster; a big piece of plaster, which may fall on them in their beds if more melted snow gets in and loosens these pieces more than they are loosened now. For the protection of the pupils and the engines, these two jobs are very urgent.\n\nThe chapel roof is urgent only in the sense that the wood work is being damaged. There is no danger to the children as the leaks are along or inside the walls. However, as this forms only a slight part of the bill, it might pay to have it done when the men are here.\n\nThe quotation given me:\n\n1-Roof over engine room --------------------- $260.00\n2-Roof of main building-\nTwo #1 (large) valleys and four #2 (lesser) valleys --------------------- $665.00\nSheeting and painting flat decks (i.e., raised parts of this roof) --------------------- $98.00\n\n3-Chapel roof --------------------- $98.00\n\nWhen the Tremco people figured out the cost, while they were here, I said that, if the work were done, as I asked, during the holidays, I would furnish board and room for two or three men. That would help cut down costs. As the pupils are now back, it may be impossible to furnish rooms but I might be able to let these men sleep in a recreation hall, all in the one hall. This may not be necessary as the Tremco people appear to have arranged with a local firm to do the work under the control of the Tremco Co.\n\nWhy was this not done sooner? I do not know. During my first winter here, there was little cold or snow and no leakage reported to me. A certain amount of leakage seems to have been expected. Last winter, my second, I noticed the considerable leakage and began asking for advice and costs.\n\nI think that that is all except that it is not only the water from the snow in the valleys on the main roof which causes trouble but also the melted snow from other parts of the roof which drains into these valleys.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.S. I have not asked for a quote on plastering party of the dormitories (2). This should not be very expensive and it should be done during the holidays. If the department wanted it done immediately, I could move our dormitory at a time into a recreation hall.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. R.

Lister Engine at Cranbrook Indian Residential School, which has been giving the institution considerable trouble and has been out of action for nearly a year with a cracked cylinder head, which could not be replaced, I am now informed by the B.C. Equipment Company Ltd., of Vancouver, that for some two years the parts question relating to British engines has been a very difficult one, but Ottawa recently issued certificates covering the importation of a considerable shipment of these parts, and while they cannot give any definite delivery date, they hope that they will arrive in Vancouver within the next few weeks. The price on a new head for this engine would be $90.00 f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly authorize the purchase of a new head, and if it is found possible to weld the old Cylinder head this be done and kept as a spare part.\n\nFor: D.

You will recall that on receipt of this voucher we wrote to you on July 20 for a copy of your purchase order, which you forwarded to us under cover of your letter of July 28. As the voucher was issued in favour of the company just mentioned, cheque 7135 for $499.40 was sent to them on August 9. It was deposited to the credit of the company in the Royal Bank of Canada, Cranbrook, B.C., on August 16. I am now advised by the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School that this payment should have been made to him, as he had previously paid the company for these shingles. It is rather difficult to understand why the company did not refund the amount to the Principal when our payment was received. It would be appreciated if you would take up this matter with the company and arrange for a refund to Father Forbes.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. Philip Nelson,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Nelson:\n\nThanks to your letting me know that the Department had paid the Cash & Door Co. for the Shingles for which the School had paid (that was the only way we could get the Shingles), I drew the matter to the Indian Agent's attention and, yesterday, the Cash & Door Co. refunded the money to the School.\n\nSome time ago, I pointed out to the Indian agent that we had been waiting for a part for the Lister engine since last November and that we had been using the old discarded engine after having it patched up. As it will be necessary to keep this old engine for emergencies, even though we get the part for the Lister, and perhaps to use it as our main engine, I have, after advising the Indian agent, ordered what appears essential and sufficient to put the old engine in good condition. The Cost will be almost $400.00 but we cannot depend on the \"New\" engine.\nespecially as it appears impossible to get parts for it. Shortly before I came here, a diesel agent advised against my getting a diesel engine for a boat at Kakawin. He told me, as I have found out here, that it is impossible to get repair parts. Had we not patched up the old Otto engine, we would have had no water, power or light here for the last year.\n\nThis engine is at present very expensive to operate as new parts are needed. I put off ordering them in the hope that the Commissioner's real efforts would get us better parts.\n\nAll is well as present. While examining the pipes, Mr. Green pointed your Tournament to be urgently needed. The operation has been successfully performed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 16th, 1943.\n\nRev.

Barrie cut us a good deal of lumber I had bought for flumes, but his lumber proved useless. I have nothing else on hand, and have no funds to buy more.\n\nThe lumber required is:\n- 2000 ft 1 x 4 -16 No. 1 Com. $34.00\n- 400 ft 2 x 4 -14 $57.00\n\nI believe that that means 2000 ft at $34.00 per 1000, etc. The quotation is from the Sash & Door.\n\nThe object of the Catwalk is to save the roof in case we have to walk on it and shovel snow and also I believe, to save it from the blocks of ice falling onto it from the main roof. It seems to me that, as some of these blocks of ice weigh seven hundred tons, the 1 inch boards hit would be broken. The roof, however, would be spared from a direct hit. The catwalk would extend over the entire roof (of the furnace room) and only those boards lying within about 10 ft of the wall would be hit by falling ice.\n\nMr. Leigh will recommend several repair jobs being urgently needed. He took pictures of some of them and will show the pictures to the Commissioner.\n\nWould you please ask the Commissioner for authority to purchase the lumber for the Catwalk?\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned G.

This roof has now been put in shape and if funds can be provided for the material it would be economical to have the work carried out by the school. It will be noted that there is no provision for labour. Consequently, it is understood that this will be provided by the school staff.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThere has recently been considerable correspondence regarding the power plant at the Kootenay Indian Residential School and as matters now stand the Lister engine has been out of order for some time awaiting repair parts from England. The Petter engine does not appear to give satisfactory service, and the load is being carried entirely by the old Otto engine which is very sturdy and has stood a lot of abuse from inexperienced engineers.\n\nHowever this Otto engine is urgently in need of repairs at the present time and Father Forbes has secured a quotation from the J. Schneider Engineering Works, of Philadelphia, Pa., who are the sole manufacturers and distributors of Otto engine parts. The total cost of the repair parts required, including duty, sales tax and freight, will amount to approximately $375.00, and Mr. Indian Agent Irwin and Father Forbes have requested authority to make this expenditure.\n\nAs it does not appear likely that repair parts for the Lister engine can be secured in the near future and, in view of the fact that complete breakdown of the Otto engine would mean the closing down of the School, I would recommend that favourable consideration be given to this expenditure if funds are available.\n\nD.

Over the very strong protests of my predecessor, the Dept. decided to install a Diesel engine\u2014asked for my opinion, I stated that I knew nothing of the best practices but that I would advise against a Diesel engine because a Diesel agent had told me, at Kootenay, not to buy a Diesel because it would be practically impossible to get parts from England after the war. It was pointed out to me that Diesels were gaining popularity in other Schools & that apparently these Schools were finding no difficulties in getting parts. I, therefore, advised Mr. Collins to accept the Diesel because such was the wish of the Department (which preferred to use an engine which it knew better) and because,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nShould what he foresaw occur, we could explain to the Department that this engine was installed at their risk.\n\nFrom the beginning there was trouble with the diesel engine. I need not go into details - the company which installed it blamed the trouble ultimately on the fact that we had used the oil in their instruction book. That is true; we did not use that oil until after the first breakdown. We used it after that because had breakdown after breakdown over (sic).\n\nShould not read the instruction book but I did ask the Union Oil agent what oil to use - we used what he specified - after the first breakdown (at what he specified). I got in touch with the Union Oil agent who wrote to his oil expert. This expert went so far as to order the local agent to supply no other oil than the one he had specified even at the risk of losing our business - which is impossible.\n\nA year ago, after some appeals, I got permission to have an independent, competent man examine the engine - he found the cylinder head cracked. It was sent to Vancouver our garage received no replacement parts. What was told is true: you cannot expect diesel parts until after the War.\nWithout light, power & water, no school can run - at no cost to the Department, I had some minor repairs made to the Condemned Otto engine. (In opinion, which I believe, is that, had not a certain Company wished to make a sale, the old Otto would have been repaired instead of the Sept's having to pay plenty for a useless engine). The old engine has done quite well; we still have the school open. However, it desperately needed parts and, or without them the engine might fail at any moment. The old one was also ordered new parts. With the latter (about $121.00), the cost is just under $400.00.\n\nThe latter boiler was installed after the very strong protests of the Principal - as he stated full function. (For other reasons, I have no confidence in the judgment of the Modern Electric Co. of Canada. I believe that they wanted to make a sale break. I believe that they wanted to make a sale break. I believe, as others do, that the Dept. is lazy and believed, as others do, that the Dept. is lazy and perhaps - I may be wrong but I doubt it.)\nBefore ordering the repairs, I should have consulted the Department\u2014Poveshell. But when you have so many Indians some of whom have no where to go, you cannot risk having to close the School at moments' notice. I had to get the parts you want now and none too soon. The lights are terribly low, as I wrote, water pressure isn't what it should be, & the girls have had to do the laundry by hand.\n\nI have asked Mr. Draper to help install the new parts. I know (no one else) can do it in a day\u2014I had bring up this Mr. Draper is the independent man whom we agreed to call in. He has been out here several times but hasn't received even transportation money. The fault I feel must lie with him because, so far as I know, he has not presented his bill.\n\nYou know the situation\u2014Would you please explain to the Department what our needs are, how unless the Council has been paid more to pay for the parts which I have ordered and received?\n\nThe Calgary Company which sold me these sent an \"expert\" here\u2014I have met him before, so I wrote to Calgary asking whether the man was an expert or a poseur\u2014no answer. The man (over 2 years ago) said that his manager had been called to Edmonton but would, upon his return, assure me that the \"expert\" was competent. Evidently the manager has been detained in Edmonton for over two years as he has not replied.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCumberland, B.C. 6567/43\n\nMr. R.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYou will recall that a Lister Diesel engine was installed in the Kootenay Residential School in February, 1941, at a cost of approximately $1500.00. A review of the correspondence indicates that the Principal at that time, Father Collins, did not want this type of machine, but about that time Father Forbes was placed in charge of the school and he accepted it. You will also remember that ever since it was installed we have had correspondence indicating that it was not satisfactory and quite recently we authorized an amount of $375.00 for repairs to the Otto engine.\n\nFather Forbes is in Ottawa this week and Mr. Phelan interviewed him this morning and he again brought up the question of this engine. May I also quote from a letter recently received from Father Forbes:\n\n\"From the beginning there was trouble with the Diesel engine. I need not go into details. The company which installed it blamed the trouble ultimately on the fact that we had not used the oil ordered in their instruction book. That is true. We did not use that oil until after the first breakdown. We used it after that and have had breakdown after breakdown ever since. A year ago, after some appeals, I got permission to have an independent, competent man examine the engine. He found the cylinder had cracked. It was sent to Vancouver one year ago and we have received no replacement since. What I was told is true; you cannot expect Diesel parts until after the war.\"\nIt is difficult for the Department to understand why this machine has not worked properly. Possibly it is due to faulty installation or, on the other hand, it may be the fault of the school engineer. However, I feel that the matter should not be allowed to go on in the manner it has in the past two years. You should have a competent man examine this machine thoroughly and let us know exactly where the fault lies. Possibly Mr. Arnall could do this, but, if not, you may be able to arrange for someone else. Of course, the point to keep in mind is that it should be a person thoroughly familiar with this type of engine. We have had Lister Diesel engines installed at other schools and have had practically no trouble with them and in addition the cost of their operation is much less than that of engines operated by gasoline. I feel too that this is an opportunity for us to obtain definite information on the operation of this type of engine and consequently would appreciate your arranging to have a very complete report forwarded, so that we would have explicit information available in the event of this type of engine causing trouble at any other school.\n\nR.A.

I note from your letter that the only fire-fighting equipment you have is fire extinguishers. Are these in good condition or do you need refills? Do you consider you have sufficient of them?\n\nRegarding the second part of your letter, Mr. Warren's report of September 26, 1941, offered three suggestions varying in cost from $5,300.00 to $12,200.00. Funds at our disposal at that time and at the present do not permit our considering any one of these proposals. What would be the cost of the suggestion which you make; namely, \"A dam in the creek or an installation near the river, a forestry pump and hose would be of great service\"?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Now, however, that we are opening into February the St. Mary's Indians are preparing to deliver 600 cords of stove and furnace wood to the Kootenay Indian Residential School, for which the necessary permits are being issued.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. H. A. Haey,\nSept. 87 Welfare Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Haey: I owe you an apology\u2014I have just noticed that I have not yet replied to your letter (87 Jan. 4th, I believe) in which you asked if we had sufficient fire extinguishers here & refills on hand. Another half dozen Cylone extinguishers (either large or small) would give us a greater sense of security\u2014Some time ago, I requested the Indian agent for a few refills & expect to receive them soon. The refills we had on hand were used after some extinguishers had been used successfully to put out a small fire. I neglected writing to you as, when your letter came, Mr Inspector of agencies Coleman was expected & I was too late to get into the matter of fire prevention until last week, and will convey my suggestions to the Department. Briefly they are that even pump can be improved.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nmore than feed a 1\" hose. There is always sufficient water in the tank for the beginning of a fire. The pumps could be started and a steady stream assured. Pipes will be required and quite a lot of hose. Mr. Coleman will report the matter fully.\n\nI think that, after a great deal of work, he has now made a complete Census of the local Reserve. I spent many a night verifying dates of birth, marriage, etc., back to 1878. The Indians were not of much help\u2014none assured me that he had been married just before or just after New Year's day, 1913. I found that the year was 1907. That is not an isolated case.\n\nOur boys are doing well in hockey. They lost 10-4, to a much bigger faster team in Kimberley but won all other games against \"white\" teams in Cranbrook.\n\nHealth is good\u2014no flu or other epidemic this year so far. I had to let one boy go home for a rest but the others seem well\u2014we have a case of chickenpox at present.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Irwin has just told me that his department has a large supply of seed worth\u2014asserted $300.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

Haey,\nSup't of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mrs. Haey:\n\nI wish to thank the Department for the extra grant which I have just received from Mr. Justice S. Cannell.\n\nI regret to state that, yesterday (11/4), four young girls (aged 9, 10, 11) deliberately tried to set the school on fire. Their only explanation is that they wanted to burn the school down. Great credit is due to two young pupils (Anthony Jacobs and Monica Nicholas) who, seeing the fire, immediately reported it. I had the big school bell rung and that brought three Indians (Pat and Melchior Barnaby and Philip Cassim) as well as the employees who were off duty at the noon hour. These men, the local Oblate, and the older boys did good, intelligent work and the\nfire was prevented from spreading to the main building through a door from the woodshed which, with the wood in it, was fire.\n\nIt was a good fire drill and showed that the fire extinguishers on hand are inadequate to put out a fire that has a good start. We were able to use the hose (used for flooding the river) and this hose prevented serious damage.\n\nThe actual loss is about $75.00. For a time it looked as if we could not keep the fire building but we really hard & courageous work done by the staff, 3 Indians (older boys) saved the day.\n\nStaff, 3 Indians (older boys) saved the day.\n\nUnless it is not customary to do so, I would suggest that the department might express its appreciation to pupils Anthony Jacobs and Monica Francis for immediately reporting the fire.\n\nA word praising the good work of the Indians would not be amiss.\n\nCollective letter would do - They fought that fire.\n\nIn his recent report on the School, I believe that the Inspector of Schools has recommended a \"long\" bare t-shirt for the Indians.\n\nOur \"hose\" was sufficient distance because pipes & couplings - Our \"hose\" was sufficient distance because the fire was noticed on time and because the extinguishers proved a real \"first aid\" test that is all.\n\nDiscipline was good. Those who actually engaged in fighting the fire remained at a safe distance. These young boys, fasting their battle, just on their drawers & got out of the building - The weather was very warm. I have been here 3 years and 2 days - For 3 yrs some day School was the strap.\n\nYours Truly, P. FOWLER\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant and I am pleased to know about the good work done when the school was threatened with fire.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would express to Anthony Jacobs and Monica Francis our recognition of their alertness in promptly reporting the fire. We are also glad to learn that several of the Indians, as well as the older boys, did everything possible to restrict the blaze.\n\nWe are ordering additional fire extinguishers but we do not seem to have on file definite information regarding the 1\" hose which you state the Agent recommends. If you let me know the exact length of this and also the number and size of the couplings required, an order will be placed for same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nRev. G.

In reply to my questioning Mr. Townsend stated that he was not the only person handling the boilers and if he was absent working on the school farm, which constitutes the bulk of his work, some other person was just as likely to start a fire in the vertical high pressure boiler, possibly after he had drained it, creating a serious explosion hazard.\n\n(over)\nI am informed that regulations do not permit of paying a fourth class engineer less than 50\u00a2 an hour.

In the event of loss of life due to the operation of this plant and lack of minimum Provincial requirements on the part of the operator the Department might incur considerable criticism. I am reporting separately on the school as a whole.\n\nThe recommendations in this connection are obvious and do not require summarizing.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nGranbrook B.C.\nFebruary 16th 1944\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\n\nHave been called in to inspect the Diesel equipment and other engines room installations being used to take care of the power requirements of this institution and report on their mechanical condition.\n\nThe two cylinder 15 H.P. four stroke cycle Lister Diesel engine which has been set up to drive the main load (10 KW Westinghouse generator) is out of order. This engine requires a cylinder head which I understand has been on order for 13 months. The true condition of this engine can only be determined by dismantling for inspection, but from interviewing the operator and talking with the mechanic who has been in close touch with this piece of equipment since delivery, I gather it has been idle awaiting repairs a great deal more than it has been working. Judging from the usual service these engines give under normal operating conditions together with the impression I have received from the appearance of the engine room and engines, I would offer to suggest that most of this trouble can be attributed to faulty maintenance either due to lack of time or knowledge and interest in this type of equipment. The results have been costly.\n\nIn order to put this engine back to work, it would be necessary to install the new head with all necessary gaskets and seals, check the condition of the fuel injection equipment for:\n\na. Proper fuel injection pressure.\nb. Proper fuel injection timing for output of maximum H.P.\nc. Check fuel filter system also proper handling of the fuel oil.\n\nThe entire engine should be thoroughly cleaned out, the main and connecting rod bearings checked for clearance. The proper lubricating oil should be put on the job and a periodical check made on the servicing of this engine by someone who understands how important it is to carry out instructions of maintenance laid down by the manufacturer.\n\nA 7 H.P. Petters full Diesel is used to drive a water pump which is used to pump water from the river into a pressure storage tank for house use. A 4 KW generator is set up near this engine so it may be used in case of emergency. I understand considerable work has been done on this engine but at the present, the fuel injection valve seems to be cracked thus allowing considerable fuel to leak onto the surface of the cylinder head and run down on the floor. Considerable lubricating oil appears to be leaking by the main bearings and adding to the grease and oil on the floor. This engine is not used a great deal but would be in very good repair if cleaned up and the two items mentioned were fixed.\nVancouver, B.C.\nFebruary 26, 1944.\n\nMemorandum For-\nD. H. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Engines Cranbrook Residential School.\n\nIn accordance with your request I made a careful examination of the engine and boiler room situation at Cranbrook Indian Residential School and concluded that practically all of the complaints received from the Reverend Principal are due to inadequate maintenance and faulty operation, and also pointed out to the Indian Agent, Principal and Engineer that the poor housekeeping in this Department created a serious fire hazard.\n\nThe equipment is as follows:\n\nBoiler Room:\n1-No. 1869, Left hand-60 H.P. wood burning hand fed.\n1-No. 1870, Right hand-60 H.P. wood burning hand fed.\n1-No. 44850, 25.3 H.P.

Fortunately, Mr. Coleman was able to arrange with Mr. A. G.

Mr. Bayes' report is enclosed herewith, together with a memorandum from Mr. Coleman on his own examination of the engines and boiler room.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Coleman maintains that practically all the complaints received from the Reverend Principal are due to inadequate maintenance and faulty operation of the equipment. The other points brought out by the Inspector may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Poor housekeeping in the engine room has created a serious fire hazard.\n2. Absence of proper arrangements for the care of tools, these being scattered over the engine room.\n3. A new line shaft and hangers supplied two years ago at the request of the Principal have not yet been installed.\n4. Engine room badly in need of painting.\n5. Floor of engine room oil soaked.\n\nMr. Coleman attributes much of the trouble to lack (over)\nof qualifications on the part of the engineer and the fact that he does not spend more than one hour per day looking after the engines and boilers, being employed at various chores around the barn and buildings which take up the rest of his time.

The Department felt that this machine should work properly and we believed that the trouble was either due to faulty installation or, on the other hand, the fault of the school engineer. We further believed that the time had arrived when a thorough examination should be made of the machine and a decision reached regarding what the real trouble was. Accordingly we instructed Indian Commissioner MacKay to have this machine examined by a competent man and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his report. This report may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Poor housekeeping in the engine room has created a serious fire hazard.\n\n2. Absence of proper arrangements for the care of tools, these being scattered over the engine room.\n\n3. A new line shaft and hangers supplied two years ago at the request of the Principal have not yet been installed.\n\n4. Engine room badly in need of painting.\n\n5. Floor of engine room oil soaked.\n\nI feel certain that you will co-operate with the Department by correcting the conditions which quite evidently have interfered with the proper operation of the Diesel engine.\n\nRev.

These are the two boilers for which Mr. Arnall stated he would be responsible.\n\nRegarding Boiler No. 44850 (25.3 H.P.), this is a high pressure steam boiler and it is necessary to have an Engineer in charge of this particular boiler.\n\nYour Engineer informed Mr. Arnall he was studying for his certificate a year or so ago and Mr. Arnall informed him he would be responsible during that year he was studying. Surely, by this time he has obtained his certificate, even if it is only a \"Special Heating Certificate\".\n\nThis office cannot be responsible for anything which happens to these boilers if there is no Engineer in charge.\n\n(Sgd.)

While not feeling that the operator is entirely free from blame, I am still of the opinion that he is not the sole or main source of the trouble.\n\nYou were kind enough to summarize Mr Bayes' report. I will make a few comments on the points you mentioned as the facts do not seem to have been given completely or clearly to Mr Bayes or to the Inspector of Indian Agencies. That, of course, was no fault of theirs. (A glaring example but a very unimportant point! Mr B. appears to have been told that the water is pumped from the river).\n\nIn the first part, I will deal more especially with the Lister diesel engine although some points refer to both engines.\n\n1. Poor housekeeping.... The operator is certainly untidy but I do not think that that is the main cause of the fire hazard.\n\n2. Tools scattered over the engine room.... or more correctly on, under and adjacent to a work bench. These two points will be attended to when the operator returns.\n\n3. A new line shaft, etc supplied two years ago.... have not yet been installed. The facts are that the shaft did not come until several months after the hangers and, as we could not wait for the shaft, a temporary shaft with hangers was installed and used until it was recently taken down. Rightly or wrongly, I decided not to install the new shaft until the cylinder head, requested over a year ago, came. My plan was to have an outside man install the head and the shaft at the same time. Mr Bayes seemed to agree with me that it would be well to have a qualified man install the new shaft so that it would be perfectly in line. (What he said had nothing to do with the delay as I spoke to him only a few weeks ago).\n\n4. Engine room badly in need of painting. That is perfectly true. This room and the furnace room are two deep holes in the ground with very little light or ventilation. While they will always be holes, a good paint job would improve them in so far as light is concerned as painting has greatly brightened the poorly-lighted laundry.\n\n5. Floor of engine room soaked with oil. THAT is the real fire hazard in my opinion but it belongs to the next point.\nThe Petters engine was out of use when I came, and some time later, it was repaired in Vancouver thanks to the Department. Certain changes appear to have been made in Vancouver. Whether it is due to these changes or not, I cannot say but immediately after we got the engine back, the operator complained that this engine no longer had its former power and that it spewed oil on the floor. It is this oil which seems to be the cause of the fire hazard.\n\nThe information given to Mr Inspector Coleman is not entirely exact. While it is true that, from early April on to the Fall, Mr Townsend's main concern is with the farm, this is not true during the late Fall, Winter and early spring, that is during the time when the engines are most used. During the whole school year, he attends to the engines and boiler on Mondays (laundry) and Saturdays (both days). It is true that another person started a fire or had fuel added in the boiler, which was very dangerous and which was done without authorization. I do not think that it was done (and it will not be done again) after I spoke to that person.\n\nI have asked the operator to take out papers and I believe that he could do so easily but he is very diffident and has a habit of putting things off.... I might mention that I have tried and am trying to get another man so that the operator can give more time to other work.\n\nThe Commissioner and the Inspector of Agencies have done their best to get parts required for the Lister engine, to have the Petters engine properly repaired, etc., but the Vancouver Company does not seem to have the parts or the proper staff.\n\nI would suggest that Mr Bayes' suggestions be followed. The cost of repair parts for the old Otto engine was so high that I did not include the magneto, etc., as suggested by Mr Bayes.\n\nWhen Mr Townsend returns from his mother's funeral, I will ask him to give me the names, sizes, etc., of pipe needed for fire-fighting equipment.\n\nI have just re-read Mr B's report and note his explanation of the cause of the Petter's engine ejecting oil. He evidently knows his work but I find it strange that the operator and the really competent mechanic, whom I had come here to examine the engine when it returned from Vancouver and before it ran, did not find this. This mechanic (the manager of a large Cranbrook garage) was given authority to inspect the Lister engine but never completed his inspection. The reason appears to be that, after having the cylinder head sent to Vancouver, he was awaiting its return. While he is considered perhaps the best mechanic in Cranbrook he is not a Diesel man and any work should, I feel, be given to Mr Bayes as I understand that he is a diesel man. His suggestions co-incide, in many ways, with those of Mr Bayes.... As I see it, the real problem is to find a tidier and more interested man than the present operator. What I can do, I will do.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nApril 6, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMajor D.M.

Principal Forbes from Mr. J.T. Leigh, c/o Fred M. Beatty, Tremoo-Western Ltd., 1575 5th Ave. West, Vancouver, B.C., and for the 60 gals. Red Barn Paint $120. and 5\" White $140.\n\nThe quotation was received from the Parks Hardware Company of Cranbrook.\n\nIf the above materials are supplied, the painting will be done entirely by the School Staff.\n\nRegret the delay of this reply, am extremely busy.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1944.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nOn the Inspector's report file for the Kootenay Agency there is a lengthy report from Inspector Coleman regarding the Kootenay Indian Residential School. This report was forwarded to the Department under cover of Indian Commissioner MacKay's letter of April 28. In commenting on Inspector Coleman's report regarding the Kootenay School, Indian Commissioner MacKay wrote as follows:\n\n\"Fire Protection: The question of fire protection has already been reported on by the Surveys and Engineering Branch and any move to provide a service in this respect should be referred to them for attention.\n\n\"Kitchen: The three oven range referred to should be overhauled and repaired or replaced if the cost of repair and overhaul is excessive.\n\n\"Electric Wiring: Improvements to the electric wiring and fire alarm system at the school were carried out under Departmental authority 155-0-5 dated April 5, 1941, at a cost of $449.13. The work on completion was inspected by Mr. MacDonald, local Assistant Fire Marshal, and reported by him as satisfactory. The Agent will be requested to advise regarding the parts of the system referred to by Mr. Coleman which constitute a fire hazard.\n\n\"It would appear that the total cost of the various improvements listed as necessary at this school by the Inspector would run into a formidable sum and if we are to consider as well the cost of installing an adequate water supply for fire fighting purposes which the Surveys and Engineering Branch has estimated at $16,275.00 for a gravity system from St. Joseph's Creek, it might be well\nbefore any great expenditure is incurred to survey the educational set-up in the Kootenay and Okanagan Agencies to determine whether the Residential School should be closed and replaced by Day Schools in the areas from which the Residential School pupils are drawn. The Residential School might be used to advantage by the Medical Division of the Department.\"\nOttawa,\nMay 13, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of\nthe 28th ultimo, enclosing Inspector Coleman's\nreport on the Kootenay Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nYou may arrange for the necessary\nrepairs to the range. If this cannot be\nrepaired, or the cost of doing so is excessive,\nyou might let me have an estimate of the cost\nof a new range. In the meantime we are making\ninquiries here with a view to ascertaining if\nwe could secure one from the Salvage Officer,\nif a new range is needed.\n\nIt is noted that you have instructed\nthe Agent to make further inquiries regarding\nthe electric wiring, especially that part of\nthe system which Mr. Coleman considers con-\nstitutes a fire hazard. As soon as you have\na report in this regard I presume you will\nforward it for our consideration.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKootenay Indian School\nGranbrook, B.C.\n\nMay 9th, 1944\n\nMr. Philip Shelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Shelan: If the per capita grant cheque has not already been sent, I would appreciate it if you would have about $2000.00 sent here as soon as possible to pay the April bills and the Porter's salary for the March quarter.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Irwin has kindly given you my reply to a letter in which he stated that pupil 0766, Edna Gould, is already 16 and should be discharged in June. The answer is that there was a mistake in her age as she and her sister, Margaret, were born in January/November of the same year. The girl was 15 and not 16 in January.\n\nIn reply to a telephoned query, I told Mr. Irwin that he could assure the Department that we would do our parting here. That, however,\ndoes not include the painting of the school roof if that is done as suggested by Mr. Kepp of the Trusco Co. It would be too risky to put boys on the metal roof of the school.\n\nYou may recall that I was informed, in Ottawa, that, if I could get the bills to Ottawa before the end of the fiscal year, the Department would likely supply me with some paint (or the year ending last March). The whole thing seems bogged down in Vancouver. I wrote to him from Ottawa on Dec. 12th and again towards the end of the month. I wrote two or three letters to officials of the Department, and a night letter but all to no avail.\n\n\u2014 at least, the paint hasn't come.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nG. J. Mees Oud.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1944.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, the requisition for paint for the Kootenay School was dated March 15 and arrived here March 24. As the requisition showed prices for all paint requested it was necessary to ascertain from the Agent from whom those prices were obtained. Recently the Agent was forwarded purchase orders 24111 and 24112, which show exactly which paint has been purchased.\n\nOur letter to Indian Agent Irwin of March 24 read in part as follows:\n\n\"Is it understood that the painting will be done by the school staff or will it be necessary to hire painters? If the latter procedure is to be followed, please let me know the approximate cost of the labour.\"\n\nCheque 93573 in payment of the March quarter earnings of the Kootenay Residential School was forwarded to you on May 6 and it is hoped that it has reached you by this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

On the occasion of my last visit, the children under the direction of the Rev. Principal Forbes were busy planting a large number of raspberry and a few currant bushes, about 700 in all. These operations will be followed shortly by the planting of a School garden which will consist of illustration plots of vegetables and grasses. The seeding and developing of this garden is made possible by the action of the Department in supplying the necessary seeds, fertilizers etc. The seeding and developing of the plots will be carried on by the children under the supervision of the Agricultural Representative Mr. James Allan. The Rev. Principal Forbes and the Indian Agent.\n\nThe interior of this school is always kept very clean. The meals served are well prepared, composed of wholesome appetizing food. The children too in keeping with the general environment appear to be happily and certainly very clean.\n\nThe laundry rooms, never as bright as they ought to have been for lack of proper lighting, have been kalsomined a clean and cheery white which has the effect, despite poor lighting, of making them appear very bright.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n**Fre M.

The Department's file will show that practically nothing was spent on the roof until last year and what was spent then was out of a special grant. As you are aware, the contractor did only the most essential work and both he and I were under the impression that the balance of the work would be done this year. As very little money, if any, was spent on the roof, until last year, and as the remaining repairs are urgently needed (the wind loosened and nearly blew the ridge board off recently), I would suggest that the job be completed and that it be paid for out of a special grant. The cost is high but, as the building deteriorates, it will become higher.... This applies to the roof and other repairs on the building and is listed under #1.\n\n1- Everything listed on enclosed \"Requisition for Supplies,\" March 10th, 1944, page 1, #1- under the heading \"Exterior.\"\n\n2- Repairs to furnaces\u2014estimated cost, under $80.00 including wages of competent men. (Patmore Brothers, Cranbrook, could do the work, and should be asked for an itemized quotation on the job. A new door for one of the furnaces is needed and several large tin or sheet metal pipes must be renewed as they are nearly burned out and will soon become a fire hazard).... Would you please instruct the Indian Agent to have Patmore's (or anyone else) inspect these furnaces? ... In view of what Mr. Warren said in report, two or three years ago, it might be advisable to have Patmore's check the plumbing. Mr. Warren's report states that the plumbing is old and will have to be renewed in the near future. At present it is giving only minor trouble but that may be just the beginning. I believe that Patmore's will be able to suggest an inexpensive way of installing fire-hoses in the building with no more water than we actually have. This solution is not ideal and, in the case of a serious fire, would depend on our being able to get to and start our water pump. This could be easily done provided that the fire was not in the engine or furnace room. The idea is Mr. Townsend's and I think that he explained it to Mr. Coleman. Until the water pump was started we would have only whatever water was in the storage tank.\n\n3-Refrigerator\u2014In a letter written yesterday, I suggested that you have Mr. Ward, Modern Electric, Cranbrook, report to you on this matter. I understood Mr. Ward to say that the refrigerator is so large and most unnecessarily so that our own engine, the Lister or the big Otto, would have to run 16 out of 24 hours a day to safeguard the batteries. This refrigerator is ruining the batteries and making it impossible for us to have adequate light. Mr. Ward should be asked for suggestions and the cost of alterations.\n\n4-Radiators, necessary pipes, elbows, etc., needed, (second hand ones in good condition would do), for the two disciplinarians' rooms (about 4' radiators) and (one 12' or 10') for the Sisters' dormitory are needed. Two or three 10 to 12' radiators would be required for the attic if, as Mr. Inspector Coleman suggested when he was here, this be turned into a boys' dormitory. I can get no radiators or quotations here. There is a rumour that there are some radiators not needed at the Indian School at Lytton. (Hot water radiators.)\n\nover.\n5- Kitchen range FOR WOOD. On account of the way the kitchen is built and the chimney placed, there is no room for a stove over 10' long. It could be from 3 to 3\u00bd' in depth i.e., from front to back.\n\nWhile here and in his report to the Department, Mr. School Inspector Fredrickson strongly urged that a small stove similar to one that an Indian family would have, be bought so that the girls learn how to use such a stove and to prepare meals for a few people. The Department will likely approve of this and take the money out of the special B.C. grant.\n\n6- Until the roof was repaired, it leaked and severely damaged the plaster in parts of the dormitories. In one dormitory, the condition of part of the ceiling is dangerous. There are also several places where the plaster has fallen from the walls or ceiling. Would you please instruct the Indian Agent to have a plasterer inspect this and submit a quotation?\n\n7- Lumber, nails, etc. for ordinary repairs (to be done as part of the boys' manual training), $125.00.\n\n8- Material for Manual Training shop,- $100.00.\n\n9- The Department expressed its surprise at Mr. Inspector Fredrickson's stating that we had not sufficient tools for the manual training shop. He did this, I believe, because he found that the public schools which he visits are much better supplied than we are. However, Mr. Inspector Coleman thoroughly inspected our shop and tools and I think that he will bear me out when I say that the tools requested on the enclosed list are needed.\n\n10- I have some used lumber here with which I wish to build a blacksmith's shop.- We have none. A grant of from $100.00 to $200.00 would be appreciated for shingles, windows, nails, etc.\n\n11- We have pigs but no piggery. About $800.00 would be required to build one.\n\nPlease note that, as part of their training, the boys would do the building, etc., in all cases mentioned above. They could not do the work on the roof or the plastering.\n\n12- As the Inspectors have likely reported and as Mr. Leigh, of Tremoo, did, the foundations under the steps leading to the front entrance have collapsed or rotted away. The impression on visitors is bad (as is also the impression made by the long cement walks to these steps,- the cement is broken, the walks are uneven, etc.) Please see Mr. Leigh's report for details and the cost of repairs.\n\n13- This, I believe, should be given special attention. We have an exceptionally well qualified and devoted nurse in the person of Sister Marion Clare. She has saved the Department a good deal of money not only by filling prescriptions (for which the Department used to pay the druggists) and by treating what should have been isolation or hospital cases here and by preventing epidemics (-a few months ago she treated two measles cases here and prevented them from spreading) but also in various other ways. She started a class of home nursing among the girls and drew favourable comments from outsiders. In order to improve on her classes of home nursing, she requested (as I believe the Inspectors requested for her) the necessary medical books. I regret to have to say that, except for a few words which cost nothing, the Department showed little lack of appreciation for her extra work whereas a tangible act of recognition and of encouragement was the least that she could expect. She is absent at present and I cannot find the list of books which she needs but Mr. Inspector Coleman may have the list as she gave a copy of the list to him... I need not point out that she gives her services not only to the pupils...\nalso to the other Indians and is at their beck and call at all hours. It seems to me that the Department has cause for shame: she has done and is doing so much for the Department and it will not thank or encourage her with a few books. As they will be used chiefly for her class, they could be paid for out of the special B.C.grant. A book on pre-natal care would be of service in case expectant Indian mothers wish to avail themselves of her offer to advise them.\n\n14- On the enclosed list, Mr Leigh has given quotations near end of page two - on paint for other rooms. As there will likely be no money available, I do not mention or request this paint EXCEPT for the kitchen. The cost is $61.50. Most of the kitchen is underground and surrounding walls make it very dark. It is nearly as dark as the laundry was. Thanks to paint, the laundry is now light and cheerful.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd. G. Forbes,O.M.I.)\n\nP.S. The gentleman whom Mr. Coleman brought here to inspect the engines, stated (see his report) that the engine room should be painted.(It has been cleaned). Tremco's quotation on this paint; Engine room: Tramlux white,-$59.25; Dodo enamel -$23.00 (all paint is less freight, I believe).\n\nG.F.\n\nPlease return enclosed \"Requisition\" form. G.F.\n\nRec'd.Commr's.Office,\nJuly 31-1944.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter dated July 29th received from Reverend G. Forbes, C.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, with reference to repairs required at the School, and will deal with the items in the order listed. The following are the items listed on the Requisition for Supplies referred to:\n\n(1) EXTERIOR:\n\nPainting Metal Roof of Main Building, Chapel, and two Corridors\n\n60 gals. \"Chromated\" metal primer, 1 coat 4.95 $297.00\n50 \" \"Duratrem\" for metal, L. red, 1 coat 3.45 172.50\n\nCaulking Windows and Doors, Earthquake Walls Cracks, etc.\n\n12 gals.

Brown \"Duratrem\" (for frame) 2 coats. 3.68 11.04\n2 \" Red Chromated metal primer, 1 coat, (roof) 5.10 10.20\n2 \" L. Red \"Duratrem\" for iron, 1 coat (roof) 3.60 7.20\n\nPediments 2 East and West Wings\n\n1 gal. #142 Primer 4.90 4.90\n5 \" #101 Mastic damp-proofing 3.10 15.50\n\nDamp-proofing of Stone Pediment basis, Statue Stone lintels over Windows and Canopy, etc. 2 coats.\n\n5 gals. #145 Transparent damp-proofing 3.30 16.50\n\nIt will be noted that materials listed are required for the exterior of the building, and for the roof in particular and Father Forbes apparently considers these improvements the most urgent of all re-\n(2) Mr. Indian Agent Irwin was instructed on July 10th to secure an estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs to the furnace and plumbing, and I am today requesting him to hasten submission of his report.\n\n(3) Mr. Irwin is being instructed to have Mr. Ward of the Modern Electric Company at Cranbrook inspect the refrigerator and submit a report.\n\n(4) A request is being directed to the Indian Residential School at Lytton to ascertain if they have radiators in good condition surplus to their requirements.\n\n(5) The question of a new wood burning kitchen range is being dealt with and I enclose herewith, for your information, copy of a quotation from Gordon & Belyea Ltd., of this City, on the various styles and sizes of the ranges available. I am today writing Father Forbes to ask if a two-oven range would be large enough for their requirements, as it would appear that a three-oven range will not fit in the space available.\n\nWith reference to the Provincial School Inspector's recommendation regarding the supply of a small cook stove, I am of the opinion that this would be desirable. The cost of same, amounting to approximately $80.00, could be met from the B. C. Special Vote - Technical Education Division.\n\n(6) Mr. Indian Agent Irwin has already been instructed to have an inspection of the plastered walls and ceilings made and to submit an estimate of the cost of repairs.\n\n(7) Although the materials requested under this item are stated to be used as part of the boys' manual training, it would appear that they should more properly be charged against maintenance of the school building. I am requesting Mr. Irwin to secure a detailed list of what is needed.\n\n(8) Material for the manual training shop will be provided from the Technical Education Division of the B. C. Special Vote.\n\n(9) It will be noted that Father Forbes refers to items required on a list enclosed. The Reverend Principal omitted to enclose the list, and I am writing him in this connection.\nItems 10, 11, 12 and 14, and also painting of engine room should, in my opinion, be left in abeyance for the present as there will certainly not be funds available for them this year if the preceding works are carried out.\n\nItem 13 will be discussed with Mr. Coleman following his return from vacation.\n\nA total of $931.00 only was provided in the current Estimates for repairs to this School and, as $347.46 has already been spent this year for paint, very few of the repairs requested by the Principal could be undertaken from the balance. It would, therefore, be appreciated if the Department would advise the total amount of funds now available for repairs at the Kootenay School this year, exclusive of the cost of a new kitchen range.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nAugust 22, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to repairs required at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nReferring to the numbered paragraphs in your letter the following expenditures are authorized:\n\nParagraph 1 - Painting and repairing the exterior of the school as listed in your letter at an approximate cost of $674 for materials.\n\nParagraph 5 - Purchase of a new wood burning kitchen range. We are not certain from your letter or from the quotation from Gordon & Belyea exactly what range you consider most suitable, but the decision regarding this will be left to you. We also approve the purchase of a small cook stove at a cost of $80. A separate voucher should be issued for this, as the cost of it will be paid from the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nParagraph 8 - Purchase of material for the manual training shop on the understanding that a separate voucher will be issued and payment made from the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nWhile you do not specifically recommend Item 14 in the Principal's letter, it is noted that the material would only cost $61.50 and, as it would appear advisable to redecorate the rooms mentioned, this expenditure is also authorized.\nI am also interested in Paragraph 12 of the Principal's letter. If the work mentioned can be done at a reasonable cost I am inclined to feel that this should receive attention this year. I presume I will hear further from you about this matter, as you state in Paragraph 9 of your letter that you have written to the Reverend Principal for the list which he neglected to forward to you.\n\nThe other paragraphs in your letter do not require any action at the present time.\n\nR.A.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nSt. Eugene Residential School.\n\nAs meetings of the St. Mary's Band were held in this building and an enquiry was made into the engine situation there was an opportunity of making a few observations in connection with the institution that may be of interest.\n\nBUILDING:\n\nThe structure is of cement block into which evidently went some very poor construction and thereafter, until recently, very little intelligent maintenance, with the result that a great deal of work will have to be undertaken to restore it to reasonable repair. The building was reportedly shaken by an earthquake some time ago causing vertical cracks to appear in several parts of the walls which have never been pointed up.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION:\n\nProbably the primary need of this institution is a fire protection system. This has been surveyed at various times and estimated to cost from $1200.00 to $3,800.00. It will probably be some time before these funds can be provided, but meanwhile something might be done by way of a \"first aid\" scheme that would bring an incipient fire under control that might otherwise get out of hand.\n\nThe school \"engineer\" had a scheme whereby 1\" or 1\u00bd\" pipes would be installed at both ends of the building with an outlet and fifty feet of 1\" hose at two stations on the ground floor or sub-basement, main floor, dormitory floor and attic. This should prove to be a fairly inexpensive installation, probably much less than $500.00 including hose. With an outside coupling it would give some protection to the outbuildings. It appears probably that it would deliver a stream of water for a few minutes while the pump was being started up to ensure a steady supply. A Forestry pump would be useful for the barn, manual training shop and outbuildings.\n\nPLUMBING:\n\nIt is hard to say what is the more urgent of the numerous necessary jobs in this building. The Reverend Principal considers that plumbing should be surveyed by a competent man. This was a more extensive undertaking than I had time for. I would, however, suggest that more baths could be installed, the present three in the boys wash room appearing inadequate. I did not examine the girls room.\n\nHEATING:\n\nThe Principal complained, with apparently good reason, of the shortage of radiators, particularly in the disciplinarians room and the Sister's dormitory. I understand that there is a surplus of radiator units at St. George's School (Lytton) and it is possible that this might be transferred to advantage and no cost other than freight.\n\nPLASTERING:\n\nWith the continual leaking of the roof, which was recently repaired, the plaster in the dormitories was seriously damaged. Some of it can no doubt be repaired by patching the cracks, but other parts, such as in the ceiling of the senior girls dormitory, will have to be cut out and replastered or filled in with plasterboard, as the ceiling is fairly high and sooner or later the loose area will fall.\n\nThe plaster of this school is on expanded metal \"lath\" similar to St. George's school construction, except that the studding here appears to be on more standard center to center measurement. It has the common failure of this lath in offering\nlittle resistance to the rough usage of a school with the result that some holes are in evidence. If a fire got into the wall space (possibly from small boys and matches) the staff would have a real problem on their hands. The remedy is patching holes as soon as they appear, with wood or wall board wainscoting on the lower part of the wall.\n\nBASEMENT FLOOR:\n\nIt was stated that shortly after the school was built it was found necessary to cover the \"concrete\" floor with a wood floor as the pupils buried themselves digging it up with spoons. This floor is pretty weak in spots and when funds become available it would be advisable to take it up and cover the so-called concrete with a covering of strong fine cement and a surfacing.\n\nI called the Rev. Principal's attention to a large electric motor in the laundry insufficiently protected.\n\nROOF:\n\nThe roof of this building is of metal. Owing to faulty design snow piled up in the valleys and melting and freezing worked up under the inadequate flashings seriously damaging the plaster in the dormitories etc. Considerable work was done on this in the early winter of 1943 and it is hoped that it is now leak proof. However, much of the metal roofing is rusting where bends fractured the galvanizing and to protect these points the entire roof over the main building, chapel and corridors requires painting with a metal roof paint.\n\nThe roof of the boiler house was in recent years covered with a felt roofing either poorly laid or in unsuitable weather and the buckles were taken out of this and protection was given to where it was subject to damage by falling icicles.\n\nDAMP PROOFING:\n\nTo protect the stonework base of pediments, stone lintels over windows and canopy etc., from the inroads of frost and moisture, consideration should be given some time to damp proof treatment.\n\nMAIN ENTRANCE:\n\nThe wide stone steps to the main entrance must have been laid on a poor foundation and they have sagged considerably in the center. They will eventually have to be taken up and re-set on a firmer support. There are eight treads 11\" X 1'8\" risers.\n\nKITCHEN:\n\nThis is a three oven range, the fire box having burnt through into the first oven and I understand that the other two ovens do not function. The surfact of the range does not heat except over the firebox. The condition of this range is a serious matter with the number of pupils and staff to provide for and there is no doubt but that it should be overhauled and repaired at the earliest opportunity. The school \"engineer\" is an ingenious individual that can make a broken down engine run a little longer but whose tinkering can, in my opinion, upset the operation of an efficient machine, and I rather suspect that his operations on the draft of this range accounts for its failure to operate with the result that the kitchen staff have tried to force matters with a very hot fire and the aforementioned burn-out.\n\nInterior Decoration:\n\nThe kitchen, childrens dining room, laundry, boys and girls recreation rooms, wash rooms on both sides and basement halls all need repainting badly, the latter also needing some plaster repairs, or better, replacement by plasterboard. The hall floors\nthe main floor and stairways are in need of an application of \"Penetrem\" or similar hard wearing varnish both for appearance and protection. This does not exhaust the interior decoration but covers the more urgent needs.\n\nCAULKING:\n\nIt will be a matter of economy to have the window and door frames caulked with one of the modern compounds as this is a cold country in the winter and the cost will soon be saved in fuel\u2014or added comfort. It is possible to see through some of these frames at present. Window frames and sash require repainting.\n\nPREVENTORIUM:\n\nOn both the boys and girls sides there are separate porches opening out of the dormitories, each capable of holding four or five beds, that could possibly be utilized for the incipients if the existing window openings, which are now only screened with wire, were fitted with windows of the casement variety that could be opened wide in seasonable weather. Apart from this they would make a valuable sleeping space addition. There are ten window openings in these two porches (five in each).\n\nENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS:\n\nI have reported separately on the necessity of these two rooms being painted, particularly the engine room, to improve the lighting and enable the staff to give better attention to the valuable equipment therein. There is also a need for changing the set up of the engines and installation of an overhead shaft that was supplied two years ago.\n\nThere are no openings in either the boiler or engine rooms to permit entry of machinery, the doors being ordinary 2'6\" affairs, or less. Provision should be made some day for improvement of this access.\n\nI noticed that some one had cut out one of the concrete supporting piers of the chapel that is at the end of the engine room in order to make room for the Peters Engine. If the engines are placed in line this supporting column should be repaired if it is possible to do so.\n\nSome time ago the school removed the coal grates from the heating boilers to adapt them to wood burning to help out the Indians in the winter by purchase of wood, which is now regretted as the school has the greatest difficulty in securing its needs. The Agency residence and office has had to secure its fuel from whites.\n\nELECTRIC WIRING:\n\nLike most of these residential schools that I have seen, there is a great need for checking over the electric wiring as in spots it was a considerable fire hazard.\n\nGENERAL REPAIRS:\n\nThe Principal advised that a grant of about $125.00 for lumber and nails for general repairs would be very helpful, but I am unable to give details.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING SHOP:\n\nUnder the direction and work of Father Anthony an excellent Manual Training Shop has been constructed over an old concrete floor. The old part of the floor is in good shape but the mixture or material in the new floor was very poor and can be scraped up quite easily. This portion should be repaired with a strong surface finish of sand and cement and the whole floor...\ncovered with \"Mulsomatic\" or some similar concrete floor treatment to abate the dust nuisance. The floor area is 1150 square feet.\n\nIt would improve working conditions, light and appearance if the wood walls and ceiling were painted with a light coloured paint, as well as assist in preservation of the material. The outside also should be painted against the weather and to reduce fire hazard. Presumably these costs could be a charge against the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nThere is only one children's bench in this building, two others being adult size and too high altogether for the children, for whom it is obvious they were never intended. At least three benches of regulations size and construction should be provided for the children. There is also a need for proper tool cabinets (which could be constructed on the job by the older pupils) and some blackboard.\n\nThe housekeeping in this room is pretty well along the lines of the engine room and a great deal of space is taken up with what appeared to be pure junk that should be cleared out into some outside storage. More will be said of this later under \"Instruction\".\n\nPIGGERY:\n\nThe Principal spoke of the necessity of a piggery, the present accommodation being rough hovels. I would be more inclined to discuss the necessity if I were more certain that the agricultural training at this school was an organized endeavour.\n\nBARN:\n\nThe school has a very large barn which has recently been re-roofed by Father Anthony with the help of the older pupils and they appear to have done a thoroughly good job, painting the roof with used engine oil (regarding which I hold no opinion). The interior of the building was fairly clean for winter, but a spray of whitewash would improve the appearance and hygiene of the dairy section. A track was installed in the building for a little carrier but has apparently been out of use for some years. In the interests of health I would like to see it put into use again with a properly protected manure pit away from the barn. Apart from the health question, it is poor training to pile it up outside and the losses by this method would soon pay for a proper ply.\n\nThe record of production of the cows was not very impressive. I did not inspect the animals but from the record sheets it would appear that a weed, breed and feed policy with all that it implies, could well be put in effect as the dairy is probably in the red if the feed etc., were charged against the milk and cream.\n\nCEMENT WALK:\n\nFrom the main gate to the main entrance is a very \"Jerry-built\" affair, broken up near the main entrance and quite dangerous. Should be repaired.\n\nPROVISION FOR ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATION:\n\nThere is ample room in the attic on the boys side for a dormitory for possibly 20 beds which could be inexpensively developed by use of plasterboard. If this is done some insulation should be used, particularly on the ceiling. At one time fire escapes were in place at the rear of the building on both boys and girls sides. If the attic is developed for a dormitory either they should be replaced or a fire door installed on the stair well as was done on the girls side in recent years, otherwise the children could be trapped by a fire or hot air coming up the stair well. The part of the attic on the girls side is used as a Sisters' dormitory. A fire door equipped with \"Corbin\" panic bolts...\non the women's side of the door could be put in the separating wall so as to give access down the girls fire escape in case of necessity.\n\nGENERAL REBUILDING:\n\nThe foregoing covers only the more obvious items needing attention. A careful and detailed examination of the structure would doubtless indicate a great deal more that needs attention.\n\nThe need in most of the Residential Schools visited, including this one, is for the Indian Agent to make a careful detailed examination of the buildings once a year, before compiling his estimates, and budget for the carrying out of essential maintenance. If this were done consistently the Department would be saved a considerable sum by the spasmodic hit and miss method of lean years with the occasional splurge. Agents generally, do not appear to appreciate their responsibility in connection with the government owned structures.\n\nOPERATION:\n\nThe care of the children appeared to be excellent in every respect and probably on a higher physical level than in most of our schools. The children are happy and, in my opinion, well fed with a well balanced diet. They were able to stand up to hard and continuous exercise without undue exhaustion. The female staff are the Sisters of Charity of Halifax and are an exceptionally fine type of women. They are much more efficient, enthusiastic and hard working than the male staff.\n\nACADEMIC:\n\nAs this was covered by Inspector Frederickson's inspection I made no attempt to explore the teaching ability of the Reverend Sisters, but I have considerable confidence in his ability to evaluate the quality of their work and offer valuable suggestions for improvement. Being a Catholic he is entirely sympathetic with the objects of the institution and very anxious to elevate its work to a standard comparable with the best white institutions in his inspectorate.\n\nThe class rooms are in operation for the mornings only and I doubt whether the work of the afternoons is organized to the extent it should be and keyed to an actual educational programme. Some of the Sisters complained that half a day in the classroom did not give them much opportunity to push the class room work as much as should be done. The class rooms were clean and appeared to be well organized.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING:\n\nThe Manual training instructor is Mr. Barre, apparently a French Canadian. His work in this capacity is practically valueless, and the Reverend Principal did not appear very satisfied with him. He apparently takes the boys four at a time in the afternoon. When I saw them the four receiving instruction were working at one small bench, very much littered up, attempting to lay out a small cut out figure for some project or the other. I doubt very much whether the boys are getting a progressive course of study on the handling and care of ordinary tools and performance of basic operations.\n\nIf the course and work charts were followed making sure that the pupils understood each item there should be no difficulty in their acquiring a reasonable degree of skill by the time they graduate out. I doubt whether this is being done.\nI questioned the Instructor regarding the time actually spent on manual training by him and he gave this as four hours a day (I believe 2\u00bd hours would be more accurate) and that the rest of his time was spent in maintenance work around the school (no doubt at the expense of the B.C. Special Vote).\n\nIf a competent Instructor was employed I would like to see the training include such metal work as would be involved in repair of farm machinery.\n\nAttached is an inventory of tools on hand and a list of additional tools that the Reverend Principal considers should be supplied. It will be noticed on the inventory that they have an excessive number of some items such as Jack Planes and \u00bc\" wood chisels. Some of the items on the \"tools required\" list are obviously an effort to charge general maintenance to the B.C. Special Vote. These I have marked, and apart from the items commented on the list is quite a reasonable one.\n\nAGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION:\n\nIt is my opinion that all residential schools with farms, such as this, in this Province are passing up a real opportunity of service to the Indians by their failure to give the pupils something along the lines of agricultural instruction. Mostly they are regarded as so much free help around the place to help with the chores, pitching hay etc., which would do no harm if it was part of a definite organized training with special consideration of the problems and type of farming incidental to the section of the province from which pupilage is drawn, or need this be confined to the boys. Such a plan should include class room work, weed and plant collections etc. It is anticipated that many of the pupils would leave school anxious to operate their lands rather than fight shy of them as at present. Standards could be set up by stock judging competitions, affiliation with \"Boys and Girls Clubs\" etc.\n\nI endeavoured to lay a small foundation for work of this nature in trying to induce the Agent and Reverend Principal to operate a small \"Illustration Station\" on the school grounds for the benefit of St. Mary's Reserve and the pupils, to be operated under the direction of the local Provincial Agriculturist, who was quite keen on the idea.\n\nMEDICAL:\n\nThe health of the pupils is well taken care of by Sister Marion Clair, R.N., a graduate nurse, and Doctor Greene of Cranbrook. Sister Clair also attempted to conduct classes among the girl pupils on First Aid and Home Nursing, stating that her application for a copy of the Canadian Red Cross book on \"Home Nursing\" was refused by the Department, which is not understood as it is most inexpensive, and these classes would have assisted in reducing hospitalization when the girls graduated. However, I am securing for her a copy personally. Considering the small cost of 25\u00a2 per copy, I am of the opinion it would be a good investment to supply each girl in the class with one for personal use. The Reverend Sister would also like to be furnished with a \"Chase\" Model doll (baby model). She has a set of baby scales. These items should be a legitimate charge against the B.C. Special Vote, as the training would be, at least, as valuable as the routine academic work. No doubt Doctor Greene would be pleased to examine the classes at the close of the terms. The final classed could not doubt be examined and certificated under the auspices of St. John's or the Red Cross.\nMedical Cont'd:\n\nThe nurse also asked if the Department would provide a few essential reference books for the use of herself or her successors, listing these as follows:\n\nElesson, \"First Aid in Emergencies\"\nEmerson, \"Essentials of Medicine\"\nJeans & Road, Essentials of Pediatrics\"\nPillebury, \"Nursing Care of Communicable Diseases\" (McGraw-Hill Publishers, Toronto)\nWoodward, \"Obstetrical Management and Nursing\".\n\nPresumably the two \"Essentials\" are nurses publications and not the medical students quiz books.\n\nTo these I would add a good text on essentials of every day diet and Lipencott's \"Quick Reference for Nurses\" (Montreal).\n\nNone of the above texts except Lipencott's are familiar and they may be those in use in the Nurses School in the Massachusetts General. Presumably equivalent Canadian Texts would be acceptable.\n\nWhile this may be a departure from the Department's usual practice, I would point out that during the past two years this nurse has given considerable nursing care on the Reserve outside of the school and the gesture of forwarding all or some of these publications with the Department's appreciation would yield good dividends, as there is a feeling in the institution that the Department has been somewhat indifferent to the extra institutional activities of the nurse and staff in the medical field.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nExcellent work is being done with some pupils in pianoforte by the Reverend Sister Henry, in addition to her other duties. She is desirous of taking two or three to Nelson for the Conservatory of Music examinations, and asked if the Department would agree to defray the travelling costs of herself and the pupils and examination fees for this as she thought it would be helpful to the school to secure these credits. If I remember rightly it was a matter of a total of about $25.00 or $35.00. The school finances does not permit the expenditure.\n\nART:\n\nThis is handled mostly by Sister Superior Mary Louis. It is good in the orthodox school manner but the pupils are capable of much better work given a lead in the direction of originality. I attempted to give some advice and demonstration intended to be helpful, but this very fine Sister is a trifle too old fashioned to make any drastic departure from the methods of some years ago.\n\nSEWING:\n\nThe girls appear to be well instructed in sewing and allied arts by Sister Catherine Mary. The children are better clothed than at some of the residential schools in the Province.\n\nThe remaining Sisters not mentioned are Sister Bernice, who takes the grade 4 to 6 class room; Sister Cephas, Kitchen and Diet and Sister John Anthony, Laundry. The Reverend Principal is, of course, Father Forbes, O.M.I., assisted by Father Anthony, excellent both as a carpenter and an individual, also the young missionaries. The lay staff are the \"engineer\" ranch hand and jack of all trades, Mr. Townsend and Mr. Barre, the Manual Training Instructor.\nFINANCIAL:\n\nPast audits and that about to be made will show that the school is being carried by the Oblates, cost of operation apparently being in the red to the extent of two or three thousand dollars annually. I have not taken the time to make more than a cursory examination of the school's finances as the Department's audit will show this clearly, but the position appears to be that the pupilage is out of all proportion to the staff necessary to handle an institution of this size in the matter of square feet floor space. The grant earning pupilage of 83 is no more than some of our two room day schools. With some utilization of space available, at the cost of small expenditure, the pupilage could undoubtedly be increased to the 110 pupils the Reverend Principal considers necessary to pay cost of operation.\n\nThe school has taken in almost every available pupil in the Agency and some from the Okanagan. The Okanagan quota could no doubt be increased from those reserves without day schools such as Westbank and the Similkameen Reserves. The trouble, of course, is that a residential school was built in an area with only small day school populations and the institution's attempts to make ends meet by paring operation expenses has actually made the Department spend more money on some items, such as the engines, than fully paid efficient labour would have received.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nThe needs of this school can be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) Increased pupilage to improve finances and general administration.\n\n(2) Overtaking of arrears in maintenance.\n\n(3) Improved fire protection.\n\n(4) Improved manual training and adoption of an organized agricultural training.\n\n(5) A little brush up by the teaching sisters in modern methods.\n\n(6) These would make it an outstanding school.\n\nOn the credit side might be mentioned among other things:\n\n(1) The prevailing high tone among the pupils and staff and their relations with each other. It is a happy school.\n\n(2) Excellent care by way of food, clothing & health of the pupils.\n\n(3) Apparent lack of exploitation of the pupils' labour despite the financial problems.\n\nJ. Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith inspection report submitted by Inspector Coleman of a partial inspection of the Kootenay Indian Agency carried out during the period January 26th to February 28th 1944. In forwarding this report I should like to make the following observations on various matters referred to by the Inspector:\n\n**St Eugene Res. School**\n\n**Fire Protection:** The question of fire protection has already been reported on by the Surveys and Engineering Branch and any move to provide a service in this respect should be referred to them for attention.\n\n**Kitchen:** The three oven range referred to should be overhauled and repaired or replaced if the cost of repair and overhaul is excessive.\n\n**Electric Wiring:** Improvements to the electric wiring and fire alarm system at the school were carried out under Departmental authority 155-0-5 dated April 5, 1941, at the cost of $449.13. The work on completion was inspected by Mr. MacDonald, local Assistant Fire Marshal, and reported by him as satisfactory. The Agency will be requested to advise regarding the parts of the system referred to by Mr. Coleman which constitute a fire hazard.\n\nIt would appear that the total cost of the various improvements listed as necessary at this school by the Inspector would run into a formidable sum and if we are to consider as well the cost of installing an adequate water supply for fire fighting purposes which the Surveys and Engineering Branch has estimated at $16,275.00 for a gravity system from St. Joseph's Creek, it might be well before any great expenditure is incurred to survey the educational set-up in the Kootenay and Okanagan agencies to determine whether the Residential School should be closed and replaced by Day Schools in the areas from which the Residential School pupils are drawn. The Residential School might be used to advantage by the Medical Division of the Department.\n\nD.M.

The new stove can be placed further to the left of the hot water tank. The new stove (for wood only) will be at the height (as in the old stove), according to pictures in folder, the chimney pipe would be to the left of the firebox and stove.\n\nThis would be about 15' from the real chimney. So 15' (+ about 7' for upright stone pipe) would be required unless the upright stone pipe (10\") entered the present pipe to the chimney.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: File No. 215-5-3510.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the cooking range at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. This stove has been carefully inspected and found to be in need of many repairs. As part of it is set in the chimney, part of the chimney would have to be taken down as well as the stove in order to make the necessary repairs. This would entail quite a lot of work. Of the three ovens only one is in use. The whole set up in connection with this stove is such that the Sister's despair of its ever being made to give satisfaction.\n\nThe cost of repairs could not be arrived at until the stove can be taken down, and Principal Forbes advises that this will have to be done during the holidays. The Sisters, however, do not favour the experiment of trying to fix it up again. The School Inspector, Mr. Fredericksen, you will note in his recent report is of the same opinion, he stresses the immediate need of a new kitchen range. With which opinion I also agree, provided a wood burner can be secured, a coal stove would be useless as only wood is burned. If a new stove can be arranged for, or, as you suggest, one secured from the salvage branch, would be preferable to the continued risk of trouble and expense in the continuous patching and repairing of the old stove at present in use.\n\n(Sgd.) Andrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRec'd, June 29,\nCommr's Office.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 155-0-5.\n\nReferring to your letter of May 13th, 1944, with reference to the kitchen range at Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would advise that I took this matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Irwin and enclose his letters of June 26th and 27th, 1944, and copy of a note from the Reverend Principal with sketches of the present installation.\n\nAs it did not appear that repairs could be carried out economically I secured a quotation on a new range of suitable size from Messrs. Gordon & Belyea Limited, Vancouver, copy of which is enclosed herewith, the price being $347.55 f.o.b. Vancouver, for a 3 Oven Malahat Junior Hotel Range. If a similar range in reasonably good condition cannot be secured from the Salvage Officer, I would recommend that purchase of this range for the school be authorized, together with sufficient stove pipe.\n\nIt will be observed from the Reverend Principal's sketch that the outlet of the canopy over the present range is connected with the range flue, and this alone would no doubt have accounted for the draft in the present range being interfered with, a condition that was aggravated by the small brick chimney at the end of the range. Mr. Indian Agent Irwin has been instructed that any new installation must be placed as close as possible to the main flue in the kitchen and the pipe from the canopy not cut into this flue but carried outside the building in a fireproof pipe.\n\nD.

Bond of Cranbrook, wherein he quotes a price of $104.00 for labour and material required to repair the plastered walls and ceilings in the dormitories.\n\nThis School was visited by Inspector Coleman during his inspection of the Kootenay Agency early this year and he advises that, due to the extreme height of the ceilings, falling plaster would constitute a danger to the pupils, and the condition of the plastered walls in some places would be extremely hazardous in the case of fire.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that, if funds are available, authority be granted for an expenditure of $104.00 for the required repairs in accordance with Mr. Bond's tender.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, September 12, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Repairs, Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 6th instant and also a tender relating to certain repairs at the Kootenay Residential School, sent forward therewith.\n\nIt seems highly desirable that this work should be undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date. It will be satisfactory to the Department, therefore, if you take the steps necessary to have Mr. Bond's tender accepted. It is noted that the cost will not exceed $104.00.\n\nR. A.

School at the Mission, Cranbrook, B. C. and replacing with new Ridge Roll, including the necessary Wood filling and Roll.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPatmore Bros.\n\nPer G.W.P.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nFurther to my letter of September 12th, regarding requirements of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a quotation in the amount of $78.00 covering removal and replacement of the ridge roll on top of the main building at the School. Father Forbes' letter of July 29th (a copy of which has been forwarded) mentioned that the wind loosened and nearly blew the ridge board off recently, in view of which it is considered advisable that the roof be made weatherproof to prevent any further injury to the plaster in the building. I would recommend that, if funds are available, authority be granted to Patmore Brothers to proceed with the work.\n\nI am also enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Irwin's letter of September 8th and quotation from the Cranbrook Sash and Door Co. Ltd. for the materials required for the construction of a blacksmith shop at the School and for general repairs. Item 10 of my letter above referred to covers the construction of a blacksmith shop but, pending receipt of details of other repairs and alterations more urgently required, I would recommend that this matter be left in abeyance for the present.\n\nD.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo the Dept. of Indian Affairs, Federal Government\n\nHaving been asked by Mr. A. Irwin, Indian Agent, for a report on the Sanitary conditions in regards to the Plumbing, etc., at the Kootenay Residential School, St. Eugene Mission, we hereby make the following report:\n\nPractically all Plumbing Fixtures date 1912. There are Fifteen J.L.Mott Toilets, Suspendo type, with Flushometer and Tank action. Also Nine Mott Compacto floor type with same flush action. While the porcelain pans or Bowls are mostly in good shape the Flushometers on all the Toilets are due for replacement, also it would be necessary to replace many seats that are broken and patched up, as the Toilets are flushed by seat action.\n\nThere were originally 36 Basins in boys and girls Dormitories and wash room. Any that have been broken have been taken out or left on wall without any replacement.\n\nThe Waste pipes for all these Basins, four batteries of nine each, are in the outside concrete wall. Iron Pipes with Lead Stubs through plaster and wainscoting. The traps soldered on to the lead. No Cleanouts available. Numbers of these Lead Stubs are leaking behind the wall and running on the floor. To repair would mean (and in many places have already been done leaving an unsightly appearance) cutting out wainscoting and plaster and cement. Would advise accessible wastes with proper Cleanouts.\n\nNine Urinals are in filthy condition, often plugged, (as I found them all at time of writing) making cleaning difficult.\n\nBathing facilities are three five ft Leg Tubs, no partitions, in each of Boys and Girls Dormitories, to serve approx. 45 Boys and 45 Girls.\n\nThree Showers in each of Boys and Girls Basements have been out of commission for years and are obsolete. Mostly gone. If put in condition would greatly add to bathing facilities.\n\nYou have a report by Mr. Warren on the Domestic Water supply, three years ago. This water not being Automatic the pressure varies from nothing up to 100 lbs. The Toilets of the Flushometer type need a good pressure for flushing. Consequently when pressure gets down the toilets being used and not flushing properly, leave a very unsanitary condition.\nIn this regard, Self Closing Taps should be used, or installed on all Wash Basins used by Pupils, as when water pressure is down the Pupils leave the taps open and when the water pressure is pumped up again it causes numerous floods from Basins overflowing. Installing the above Taps would save a great deal of pumping. All these old taps with the exception of a couple pair, are over Thirty years old and due for replacement.\n\nIn the Laundry all new Taps are needed and some repairs and replacements to Traps.\n\nThe Domestic Water Supply is very hard water and they have tried most of the known water softeners on the market without success. Soap will absolutely not lather. The best they can get white Sheets and under clothing is a very dirty grey, with a very bad odor. There is a soft water line from St. Joseph's Creek (Typhoid Water) which used to be in use for the Washers only but this being an old 3\" wooden pipe needs renewing. Alternative would be to pump water from St. Mary's River, both being equal distance, approx. 600 ft.\n\nThere are numerous Toilets, Basins, and baths needing new Brass Parts which are available, also Toilets of type that can be replaced by Canadian Goods. While all the Moot Toilets being American, parts are not available.\n\nThe Domestic water is heated by a steam Jacket in Summer, Steam being supplied by a high pressure boiler which is used for Laundry purposes. This means that unless high pressure Boiler is in use there is no hot water. This steam Jacket has been in a number of years and was badly Alkilled, but by the use of Acid we have managed to clean it good enough for the coming year, when a replacement or other means will be necessary for Domestic Hot water.\n\nThere is a Two inch Coil in one Hot water Boiler which heats the water during the firing season. This coil will need renewing shortly.\n\nIn Summary, the Plumbing is in very poor condition. Any inspection by Government Official will find this not to be an exaggerated report.\n\nWe have not touched on the Heating. The Expansion Tank in attic does need relining. Smoke Pipes need attention. It is far from a good heating System.\n\nYours Respectfully\n\nPatmore Bros.\n\nper. A. C.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from Patmore Bros. on the general condition of the plumbing system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Mr. Patmore, while detailing the work to be done, omitted to quote on the cost. He is working with only one experienced plumber and one plumber's helper and is totally unable to keep abreast of the work that he has on hand. He seems to feel that when there is so much to be done, the Commissioner might wish to have an engineer sent out from Vancouver to inspect the system rather than accept an estimate on the basis of the letter herewith attached. In short Mr. Patmore is very busy and would prefer not to bid on the job unless advised that there is no other means of getting the work done, in which case he would, if the necessary parts can be obtained, agree to work by the day or the hour for whatever number of days may be necessary to put the system in working order for the remainder of the present school year, after which, as stated in his letter, many new replacements must be made.\n\nIn view of the conditions stressed in the attached report and the position taken by Mr. Patmore due to shortage of labour to keep up with the work he has in hand your further direction in the matter would be appreciated.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Irwin's letter of September 7th and report, in duplicate, from Patmore Bros., of Cranbrook, on the plumbing system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would appear from this report that a considerable expenditure would be required to properly repair the plumbing system, in view of which I would suggest that it might be advisable to have Mr. Warren, of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, examine the system during his next visit to Cranbrook.\n\nD.

It would be appreciated if you could arrange to have one of your officials visit the school and submit a report as soon as possible. Funds for any emergency work could be provided from the current year's appropriation. Funds for any extensive alterations will have to be provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46.

This matter was overlooked in the rush of other business.\n\nThe hallway extension and the minor repairs to existing hazardous electrical fittings would be twenty-three dollars and thirty cents.\n\nRegarding the refrigerator changes it must be borne in mind that ample power must be available at all times if this is to work satisfactorily on an automatic pressure control. At the present time this equipment is turned on manually and apparently only when the batteries are well charged. Cutting the box down in size will allow good refrigeration with no more increase in current consumption than is being used by the manual method. We cannot however assume any responsibility for successful operation if trouble occurs due to erratic power supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn A. Ward.\nMR. A IRWIN,\nAGENT\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe quote as follows on repairs to the lighting system at the KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nInstall eight drop lights in dining room complete with metal shades and pull chain sockets to replace existing unsatisfactory fixtures.\nInstall two additional lights complete with shades in classroom also duplex convenience outlet.\nReplace hazardous wiring in upper hallway with metal raceway complete with drop light.\nInstall bracket light in bathroom in metal raceway and seal off open conduit ends.\nRepair defective hall light fixture.\nExtend wiring in attic over to store room complete with drop.\n\nThe cost of the above electrical work including labor and materials would be Eighty seven dollars and thirty six cents (87.36)\n\nI have examined the refrigeration equipment at the KOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL in an effort to devise some means of reducing the running costs. I wish to report as follows:\n\nThe capacity of the condensing unit is such that it must operate a total of sixteen hours out of each twenty four in order to produce a temperature of 36-37 degrees in the cooler. This is a quite satisfactory running time and will give a closely regulated fixture temperature. The unit will require however something in excess of ten kilowatts per day for normal operation.\n\nIf, in order to conserve current, the running time was decreased the case temperature would rise. Also this temperature would fluctuate considerably between the on and off cycles of the machine. Either or both of these conditions would be very detrimental to proper food storage and would defeat the purpose for which the equipment is intended.\n\nThe size of the cooler could be reduced one third and effect about twenty five percent saving in current consumption. If however this was done it would be imperative that foodstuffs placed in the cooler be so arranged as to provide adequate air circulation around them. If this is not done stagnation will produce food spoilage regardless of the case temperature. The cost of building in a six inch insulated partition, installing tapered door opening, and fitting refrigerator door and hardware to the new partition would be Ninety three dollars. (93.00)\n\nIf the reduced cooler space would still be adequate for the school requirements, and, the current savings warrant the expense then the move would be a good one, otherwise it should not be considered. The cooler in its present size is engineered by the manufacturer to give maximum results.\nAt the present time this equipment is not always operating automatically. The unit is quite often shut down in order to build up the battery charge. If the size of the cooler is reduced (as above) the closer confinement of the food would make it imperative that the unit be left connected at all times, and, that adequate current be available to handle the refrigeration load.\n\nThe motor now on this unit is not operating properly. The shunt field is apparently open and the motor is racing as a series type motor. It is erratic in speed and the brushes are arcing badly and the commutator pitted. The service switch blades are burned beyond repair and the entire switch needs replacing. The wiring associated with the condensing unit motor, automatic controls and service switch is in a very dilapidated condition and should be completely renewed.\n\nThe refrigerant charge in the system should be adjusted, the automatic expansion valve set for proper superheat and the automatic controls reset to maintain a proper temperature in the cooler. This latter work should be done regardless of whether or not the size of the cooler is altered. The cost of this overhaul work would be $73.25 (Seventy Three Dollars and Twenty Five Cents).\n\nYours Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nMODERN ELECTRIC\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: File No. 215-5-5697\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo with reference to minor electric wiring changes required at the Kootenay Indian Residential School as well as to the system of refrigeration.\n\nThe enclosed, from Mr. J. A. Ward, explains itself. The alterations and repairs to the lighting system at this school are very urgently needed. Regarding the refrigeration system, the Rev. Principal Forbes is satisfied that if reduced in size as recommended in the report of the Modern Electric there would still be sufficient space to accommodate the requirements of the school. Under existing conditions the greater part of the refrigerant is lost so that fresh vegetables, meats, butter, cream etc. cannot be kept for any length of time, thus nullifying the purpose for which the system was installed.\n\nI need hardly say that Mr. Ward has the reputation of being a very dependable workman, but as his letter states, he is not prepared to assume responsibility for failure should his proposal fail to give satisfaction due to any trouble that might arise from an erratic power supply, which, during the past two years has resulted in a great deal of trouble at the above named school.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Irwin's letter of October 7th and reports from the Modern Electric in Cranbrook covering additional repairs required to the wiring at the Kootenay School and alterations and repairs to their refrigerator. The Company's report dated October 6th covers repairs to the wiring which are considered absolutely necessary and I would recommend that authority be granted for an expenditure of $23.30 for this purpose.\n\nThe alterations and improvements to the wiring outlined in their report of August 30th are not essential and should be left in abeyance for the present.\n\nIt would appear advisable to reduce the size of the refrigerator and make the necessary repairs at a total cost of $166.25, and I would recommend that authority be granted to have this work done.\n\nD.M.

Irwin, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, in connection with the water supply and I enclose an extract from his letter marked \"No. 1.\" I also enclose two other reports regarding the water system at this school, one of which was made in 1931 and the other in 1941 by officials of the Surveys & Engineering Branch. The Department would appreciate your giving this matter some study and possibly you could confer with Father Forbes and let us have a report. We are under the impression from Father Forbes' letter that no change is necessary in the drinking water supply. However, it can be inferred from Father Forbes' letter that replacement of the pipe about which he speaks would give an adequate supply of water for washing and fire protection and the expenditure in this regard would probably not be extremely heavy. However, the suggestions made by the Surveys & Engineering Branch, both in 1931 and 1941, apparently involve a very heavy expenditure. There is also the question raised in their reports that taking water from the river would affect certain people who secure water from the same source for irrigation purposes. I wish you would clear up this particular point as well as any other facts in connection with the water supply that you would like to bring to our attention. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract from Mr. W.C. Warren's report, dated June 29, 1941, on Proposed Fire Protection and Repairs to Domestic Water Supply at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nWATER FOR FIRE PROTECTION\n\nThere are only two possible sources which will provide water in sufficient quantity for fire protection purposes without large capacity storage. These sources are St. Joseph's creek and St. Mary's river. Both streams are contaminated by sewage and a supply for fire protection purposes secured from either would require facilities independent of the works existing for domestic service.\n\nA gravity supply from St. Joseph's creek through a pipeline about one mile in length, would provide sufficient water at 45-lbs. hydrant pressure for fire protection. Such an installation although meeting certain requirements better than any other, probably cannot be considered on account of the high cost, estimated to be $16,275.00 with complete fire equipment.\n\nAlthough St. Joseph's creek passes close to the school it would not be a desirable source for a pumped supply. There would be difficulties of an assured supply during the irrigation season and probably during the winter months.\n\nA supply obtained from the St. Mary's river by pumping would cost approximately $8000. A suitable installation would provide water under 65 lbs. hydrant pressure at a rate of 500 gallons per minute.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSept. W. Ward & Co.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOur school supplies for the current year have not yet arrived, and we are out of several items. We are doomed to blame. I asked the Sister Superior, who does the ordering, to send in the requisition at the end of the year but failed to tell her that I referred to Dec. 31st, not to the end of the school year.\n\nAs you advised me, Mr. Nelson came and examined the plumbing. There seems to have been some confusion in the matter as, a couple of weeks before, a local plumber did the same. Mr. Murray & I believe, submitted his report. As Mr. Warren foresaw, when he made his report, a little more than three years ago, there is a great deal more than three years ago, there is a great deal to be done and, while certain things might be done now, the only time to do the main part...\nOf the work will be when the pupils are on their holidays in July & August. I presume that the report will mention that (why, Heaven only knows) a certain amount of the plumbing was imbedded in or below cement floors or in cement walls. I hope that the report will strongly recommend that the boys' shower baths & rooms be repaired. They and the girls' shower baths have not been used for years. There are only 3 baths for all our boys. I would not recommend that the girls' shower baths be repaired. The Sisters & the Indians do not favour girls taking shower baths.\n\nI hope that the following point will be stressed. The water from the Creek is unfit for drinking (it contains sewage) and, therefore, the Department installed a new water system some years ago. While the new water supply gives good drinking water, it is so hard that it is practically useless for washing purposes \u2014 no matter how much soap, etc., we use, we cannot get the clothes clean. We have, therefore, piped this new Creek water (unfit for drinking) directly into the washing machines. Unfortunately, the pipe, which brings this water from the Creek, is a very old wooden pipe and it has burst grated in places on many occasions.\nOceans - It is now beyond repair and a new pipeline is needed. I do not wish to exaggerate; this pipeline is, at the moment, supplying us with the water we absolutely need for our laundry (and barn). The horses readily drink the water without evil effects) but it has been patched & cemented etc. So often that it may become useless at any time - last winter, it broke twice and could not repair it until the spring - as a result, the road was flooded twice and dangerous - In a word: please renew this pipe-line as the water is really needed for our laundry.\n\nI am very pleased to be able to report that, as usual, our relations with the Indians depart well. The Indians are excellent. The \"spirit\" of the pupils is good - in more than 3\u00bd years, I have never seen them once, \u2014 and it was deserved. It was when the same pupil tried & incited 3 others to try to burn the school down.\n\nWe have just erected an honour roll. Although this agency has few Indians, there are about 40 names on the roll, \u2014 names of those who volunteered for active service. Of these, two have been killed in action & several have been wounded. One was in a serious accident. Two women, a white man (who got a jail term) & drunk were found in barracks.\nI encourage the pupils to write to the wounded & their mothers appreciate the letters.\n\nThe pupils' health is good.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 29, 1944.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 18th instant and have noted with interest the information contained therein.\n\nMr. Phelan has already written the Indian Agent with the object of securing an expression of opinion from him regarding certain repairs suggested by you in your communication. With the reports that are likely to be submitted from the Surveys and Engineering Branch on the plumbing system and the recommendations that should reach us in due course from the Agent, we will be in a position to undertake the most urgent repairs that appear to be necessary at the Institution. I was particularly pleased with the information contained in the last paragraph of your letter. It is indeed gratifying to learn that the relations existing between the pupils in attendance at the school and the Indian parents are so cordial. The enlistments are also very creditable.\n\nKind personal regards.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend George Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nActing Director.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| x 5 Gal.

Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nThe material for the roof, supplied by the Department, has been here for some time and I understand that Patmore Bros. have the contract to do the work. They are the only ones in Cranbrook in their line of business & have been unable to find time to do the work. I do not believe that, even if the weather were favourable, they would be able to do anything until after the beginning of the next fiscal year. They just haven't the time or the men.\n\nI asked for lumber and other things but have not heard what, if anything, the Department will supply.\nRe: St. Eugene Indian Residential School,\nWater Supply\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 9th instant, your file 452-32, the matter was referred to Mr. Webb and from his reply the situation appears to be as follows:\n\nThe list of projects accompanying Dr. McGill's memorandum of September 29, 1943, contained an item of $27,527.00 for water supply and fire protection based on Mr. Warren's report dated March 4, 1931. This estimate was referred to Mr. Webb to be revised to meet present conditions and he increased it by 25% bringing it to $34,375.00, roughly $35,000.00, although a portion of the work was undertaken in 1932.\n\nRegarding the proposals to be considered under the post-war programme, Mr. Webb states as follows:\n\n\"In the 1941 report the gravity fire protection service only is estimated at $16,275.00 using wood stove pipe and excluding all other attendant developments\".\n\n(It is assumed that the gravity supply from St. Joseph's Creek will be generally in accordance with the proposal outlined in the 1931 report as estimated to cost $16,275)\n\n\"The possibilities of supplying water for fire protection by means of pumps were outlined therein, in brief as follows:\n\n(1) To supply 500 gallons per minute by pump indefinitely from St. Mary's River at a cost of $8,800.00\n\n(2) To provide some degree of fire protection with the existing plant chiefly by means of new engine and inside fire outlets to cost $1,200.00.\n\n(3) Alternative to (1) - Provision of high level domestic storage capacity (25,000 gallons) and stepped up pump capacity (100 gallons per minute) to provide a supply of 500 gallons per minute for one hour duration. To be undertaken when renewal of present domestic equipment is indicated. Estimated to cost $9,900.00.\n\n\"To all these estimates of course 25 percent should be added.\n\n(Over)\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\"It was pointed out that the present domestic system was nearing the end of its life and that renewal cost would approximate $4,100.00 so that by adopting No. 3 this renewal would be accomplished for the amount estimated, whereas renewal would have to be undertaken at a future time if No. 1 was adopted.\n\nIt could be assumed that the question of the type of fire protection service to be installed at St. Eugene School depends in some respects upon the cost. I believe, however, that a gravity system should be employed for fire protection here if at all possible and so obviate to some extent dependence on mechanical equipment. Such equipment very often suffers from lack of proper care, and in consequence is costly to maintain.\n\nThere would appear to be no reason for the expenditure of $35,000.00 for any installation for fire protection purposes at St. Eugene School\".\n\n(Sgd) T.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File No. 155-0-5.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to a letter you received from the Rev. Principal Forbes requesting pipe line replacements to carry an urgently needed water supply from St. Joseph's Creek to be used for laundry purposes and fire protection at the School.\n\nThe present system requires many replacements of pipes, taps, etc., toilets, plumbing should have immediate attention. A report by Mr. W. C. Warren under date of June 29th, 1941 states that the present water works equipment has been in service for about twenty years and may require complete renewal within the next five or ten years. Three and a half of the five years mentioned have past and the pipes should be renewed. Some of the pipes are buried in the cement walls or under cement floors, which makes it extremely difficult to find and repair leaks.\n\nThe present water supply while satisfactory for drinking is impossible in the laundry. So very hard that no amount of soap and rubbing will get washing clothes. Water unfit for drinking but satisfactory for laundry purposes is brought from St. Joseph's Creek carried by an old wooden pipe line that was put in over thirty years ago. It is about 500 yards in length with its intake about that distance south of the School. It is rotted through in several places and not worth repairing. If a new pipe line is laid and connected with a one inch pipe of about 300 feet, water would be available for the laundry, urinals, toilets and fire protection as well.\n\nPrincipal Forbes and his Engineer, Mr. Townsend, have called my attention to the fact that where the intake is located about 500 yards south of the School, the creek is about 30 feet above the ground level of the School or just above the level of the second floor, which would afford considerable pressure in bringing the water down. Mr. Townsend suggests that, and when the main pipe is renewed and connected to one or two hydrants at each end of the School and one or two more near the barn with a portable booster pump placed on a cart with sufficient hose, would assure an adequate supply of water at all times.\n\n(over)\nThe taking of water from St. Mary's River would not in my opinion interfere with the irrigation rights of anyone because of the fact that the Department appears to have the only irrigation rights on the river in this area. As for St. Joseph's Creek, from the intake to its confluence with St. Mary's River is bounded on both sides by property owned by the Department and the Oblate Fathers.\n\nAs stated in the Principal's letter the need of a new pipe line is urgent, otherwise a continuance of an adequate supply of water for laundry and other purposes is contingent on the condition of the present old wooden pipe line which has already stated is nearing a condition where it can no longer be repaired.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1944.\n\nMr. A. Irwin, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the replacements required to the water supply system at the Kootenay Residential School. We have carefully considered the improvements that are required to this system. Our attention should be directed to this matter again early next April, in order that we can decide what can be done during the summer of 1945.\n\nI also note your statement that there are certain pipes, taps and toilets which require early replacement. On October 4 we requested the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have one of their officials inspect the plumbing system at the Kootenay School and submit a report. As yet this has not been received and presumably the Surveys & Engineering Branch has found it impossible, owing to the shortage of staff, to do this work. However, I am communicating with them again about the matter.\n\nFor your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $900 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. We have already expended a considerable amount more than this sum and it will, therefore, be difficult for us to finance any extensive additional repairs.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nI desire to direct your attention to our memorandum of October 4, requesting you to arrange to have one of your officials visit the above-mentioned school and submit a report on the plumbing system. As yet we have not received this report and the school management has written again pointing out the urgency of making certain repairs. I should appreciate it if you would let me know when your official hopes to be able to visit the Kootenay School.\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 16th, 1944.\n\nMr. R.A.

If the laundry equipment is not installed the estimate would be approximately $2850.\n\nNo doubt you will advise us in due course of your wishes in regard to this matter.\n\nDirector.\n| Pieces | Description | Dimensions | Feet B.M. | Total Feet | Price | Amount | Total |\n|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| 16     | #1 F.L.

M.

When the first job was completed in accordance with the tender submitted by Mr. Bond on August 29th, 1944 Rev. Principal Forbes found more work that should be done in the following rooms: one sewing room - 10 hours, two dining rooms - 7 hours, two priest rooms - 7 hours, one domestic science room - 11 hours, one attic room - 5 hours, two laboratories - 8 hours, 48 hours at $1.00 per hour, total $48.00. This work was undertaken at the request of the Rev. Principal Forbes without my knowledge. Doubtless the work was necessary and needed to be done, however, I will hold the account until advice has been received from you as to whether or not it can be accepted.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why this work was undertaken by the Rev. Principal Forbes without referring the matter to this office in order that your approval or otherwise could have been secured. Despite this fact, however, Mr. Bond has done a good job in good faith, and is therefore deserving of his pay.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Irwin's letter of January 16th and Kootenay Agency Voucher No. 1822 referred to therein covering the cost of repairing and patching the plastered walls of the dormitories at the Kootenay Residential School at a cost of $104.00 as authorized in Departmental letter 155-0-5 of September 12th.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Irwin's letter that additional repairs to other rooms in the school were undertaken on instructions from the Reverend Principal Forbes without Departmental authority at a cost of $48.00. No doubt this additional work was necessary and if funds are available it is recommended that authority be granted for the submission of an account covering the labour.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Irwin has advised that two complete valves are required to put the Lister Diesel engine at the Kootenay Residential School in running order. The Principal of the school considers that these are so urgently required that he is prepared to pay for them himself if it would expedite delivery of the parts.\n\nI have placed the order, however, at a cost of $24.20 plus freight charges and if funds are available would recommend that the Department authorize the submission of the account covering the supply of these parts in due course.\n\nFor D.

C.\n\nI wish to enclose herewith quotation in duplicate from Patmore Bros., Cranbrook, amounting to $382.45 covering the cost of labour and repairs needed for the furnace at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I may say that part of this work is already done. Mr. Patmore was asked on several occasions to check on the repairs needed and submit a quotation and when at last he got down to the School the Rev. Principal Forbes urged him to get busy immediately on the job.\n\nThe teachers and children were catching cold for want of heat. Because of a volume of work with which Mr. Patmore can not cope for want of help, the Principal insisted on his starting on the job when he had a few days to spare, believing as he did that he would have a lot of hospital cases on his hands if the School remained any longer without heat.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box. 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose letter dated 29th. Ult. addressed to you by Mr. Irwin with reference to repairs to school furnace amounting to $382.45.\n\nI have interviewed Father Forbes and apparently the breakdown in the furnace had not been anticipated and occurred during the middle of the Winter, and had to be carried out immediately.\n\nThe remedy for occurrences of this kind is a thorough check over of the school installations at the close of the school year, in order that necessary replacements may be anticipated and provided for. I have advised Father Forbes accordingly, and also that work of this kind must not be undertaken without first referring the order to this office. It is possible that the Department may wish to hold the account until the end of the Fiscal year.\n\nThe above would also refer to the enclosed quotation for $38.40 for parts supplied to the furnace, brought to your attention by Mr. Irwin on the 29th. Ult., his letter being enclosed herewith. I am asking Mr. Patmore to furnish me with an account in this connection. It will be noted that I have had Father Forbes endorse the quotation as having received the material.\n\n(J. Coleman)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith Inspector Coleman's letter of February 13th and Agent Irwin's letter referred to therein, in connection with repairs to the furnace at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Mr. Coleman's letter is self-explanatory and it would be appreciated if you would advise if there are funds available to meet this expenditure of approximately $421.00 in the current fiscal year or if it will be necessary to hold the account until after April 1st.\n\nD.

The above items\nare required at the Kootenay Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter dated February 6th from Mr. Indian Agent Irwin, and quotation referred to therein, covering the supply of nails, paint, hinges, etc., for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. In the absence of Mr. Irwin, this matter was referred to Inspector Coleman for further information with respect to the necessity for these items. Mr. Coleman informs me that this hardware, etc., is required in connection with the construction of the blacksmith shop at the school and will be additional to the expenditure of $296.39 authorized in Departmental letter 155-0-5 of February 14th.\n\nMr. Coleman states that he intends visiting the school with the Provincial School Inspector in the near future, at which time the question of the blacksmith shop, if a division of the manual training of the school, would then become a matter of discussion in correlation to the other school activities. It is recommended that if funds are available at this time authority be granted for the purchase of the materials listed at a cost of $27.45, as the school will then be in a position to proceed with the construction of the building which will provide useful training for the children in farm blacksmithing.\n\nD.

As Mr. Irwin, the Principal and the Reverend Sisters at the School were of different opinions, the matter was left in abeyance until Inspector Coleman reached Cranbrook.\n\nA recent letter from Mr. Coleman indicates that it would be advisable to replace the range, but Gordon & Belyea Ltd. are unable to promise delivery until some time in April. It would appear, therefore, that the matter must be left in abeyance until the coming fiscal year, and I would request that authority be granted for the purchase of a new range at that time at a cost of $388.50, f.o.b. warehouse, Vancouver, B.C.; this amount to include a high shelf and galvanized water coil.\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, March 19, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant,\nwith reference to the kitchen range for the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nAt schools of this size and even larger schools, we have been supplying a kitchen range No. L.H. 224-1, General Steel Wares. This has a high closet but no reservoir. There are two ovens and the range burns either coal or wood. The approximate size is 77 x 31 - left-handed feed. We can secure this type of stove at a much more reasonable price than that quoted in your letter and I think it should fill the requirements at the Kootenay School. Please let me hear further from you, and if you agree that this type would be suitable, we can place the order.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Date | DESCRIPTION                                      | Folio | Credits | Debits | Total |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Mar 9 | 5 gals Red Barn Paint @ $2.25                    |       |         |        |       |\n|      | 3 pr 12 Hy Strap Hinges & Screws                 |       |         |        |       |\n|      | 30# galv shingle nails                           |       |         |        |       |\n|      | \u00bd keg 2\u00bd com nails                               |       |         |        |       |\n|      |                                                 |       |         |        | 26.20 |\n\nTerms: Cash.

I may say that we have no record of the Voucher in question having been passed through this office.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th instant, file 155-0-5, with reference to the replacement of the kitchen range at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would advise that the writer has just returned from Cranbrook and while there checked over the present installation, discussing it with the Reverend Principal and the Reverend Sister in charge of the kitchen operations. The Reverend Principal, while not very definite, was inclined to the opinion that the range in use functions satisfactorily enough for their requirements with which opinion the Reverend Sister was definitely in disagreement. After looking over the unit while in operation, I am of the opinion it is not functioning properly but that the cause lies outside of the range itself. On the other hand, the unit is getting pretty old and it will only be a matter of a year or two before it requires replacement.\n\nMuch of the trouble at this school with mechanical and other installations is that their maintenance and arrangement is entrusted to an individual, Mr. Townsend, described as the School Engineer who, in my opinion, usually succeeds in impairing their usefulness by his \"improvements\" on the original design, and that this is what has given rise to the continual difficulty with the school engines and the range. In this instance, he has \"improved\" on the manufacturer's design by installing an auxiliary chimney and also ventilating a very large canopy into the chimney itself, thus crippling its draft.\n\nI am of the opinion that the range suggested by you, No. 224-1, General Steel Wares, is large enough for the purposes of this school and would recommend that it be supplied\nconditionally that it be installed by a competent person outside of the school staff and that the canopy be ventilated through one of the windows which could be effected by replacing one of the window panes by a sheet of galvanized iron with a hole cut to permit the pipe passing through and extending about a foot or 18 inches beyond the opening. As the school is of concrete construction, there would be practically no danger of fire. A right hand stove would be preferable to the left hand suggested, if this is obtainable. Stove pipe may be required but could be made up locally if necessary.\n\nFor D.M.

The repairs to the wiring at a cost of $23.30 are still necessary but could not be carried out in the past fiscal year. It is, therefore, recommended that Mr. Caldwell be authorized to have this work done during the current fiscal year at as early a date as possible.\n\nD.W.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a voucher in favour of the Kootenay Indian Residential School for $20.01, covering the purchase of supplies for the domestic science class.\n\nImmediately on receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo I got in touch with the School and instructed the Sister in charge of the domestic science class to purchase the material required to the value of $20.00 and send invoice covering the purchase to me. My object in authorizing the Sister to make the purchase was because I thought she could make a selection that would meet her requirements better than I could.\n\nInstead of ordering the goods locally, as I thought would be done, the Reverend Principal sent an order to Eaton's for the goods and paid for them himself.\n\nJ.D. Caldwell,\nActing Indian Agent.\nMr Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI had always paid for the license for the school radio until last year when the Department sent one free of charge. In the tenth or eleventh month of the preceding fiscal year, the Department sent a license but I had paid for one long before. This is not a request for a license. Would you please let me know whether one is being sent this year so that I may know whether to procure one or not?\n\nMr Inspector of Schools Frederickson has kindly given me a copy of his report. I consider it a very fair report and would not comment on it were it not for one statement which might very easily be misunderstood. Under \"Fire Protection,\" Mr Frederickson states that the fire extinguishers are \"not subject to inspection.\" This does not mean that he was not permitted to examine them but that, as he explained while he held one in his hands, since the school is not insured, the extinguishers are not subject to inspection by those men whom an Insurance Company would send were the school insured.\n\nThere are one or two other very minor points which, likely because I did not mention or explain them, are not quite accurate: for the last two years, the boys have faithfully kept a daily record of egg production; some boys have threaded pipes (i.e., before the inspection); a daily record of milk production was kept by the boys until this winter when the milk fell off badly. Yes, the cows were in poor condition. Like others in the district, our hay crop was a complete failure and it was very difficult to get any hay let alone good hay. As you are away, the Agent had to ship in hay for the Indians and, poor as the hay was which we got, I think that it was considerably better than that which the Agent was able to obtain.\n\nWith regard to the remark about home nursing classes, they have been discontinued although they were going well and serving a useful purpose. The nurse asked the Department for necessary supplies, which would have cost under $20.00, but her request was turned down. May I renew her request?\n\nTwo days ago, I went to see Mr Acting Agent Caldwell to ask him to make sure that the necessary work on the furnaces, plumbing, pipeline, etc. be done while the pupils are away in July and August. As soon as I mentioned the first point, he showed me the 1945-1946 requisition which does not mention these matters. That greatly surprised me especially as the Department had two men make reports on this....which shows that I had asked that the work be done. (A very little of the most urgent work was done). What surprised me even more was that the requisition asked for things that were not only requested in the previous year but were supplied by the Department last year. I have written at length on the matter to the Acting Agent.\n\nAll are in good health.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 23, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have a letter from Father Forbes, Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, in which he states that he was talking to Acting Agent Caldwell recently about work that was considered necessary on the furnaces, plumbing and pipeline at the Kootenay School. Evidently, Father Forbes wants considerable work done during the months of July and August. For your information, I enclose an excerpt from a report submitted to us last January by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, following a visit to the school by one of their officials, namely, Mr. Smelson.\n\nThe amount suggested in this report is larger than the amount of $1,000.00 which we have specifically provided. However, if the essential work would cost three or four or even five hundred dollars more, or an approximate total of $1,500.00, I think we can find the funds in the current year's appropriation. It would be appreciated if you would communicate with Mr. Caldwell and have him consult Father Forbes and give the whole matter careful consideration. Following this, a report should be submitted at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, May 23, 1945.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I am communicating with Indian Commissioner MacKay, advising him of the amount that we would be prepared to spend on repairs and improvements at the Kootenay Residential School this summer. I am asking Major MacKay to communicate at once with Acting Agent Caldwell and have him consult you.\n\nI am also writing to the Transport Department with reference to securing a free radio licence. They promised last year they would allow free radio licences to our residential schools, but evidently they have overlooked the matter this year.\n\nWith regard to the fourth paragraph of your letter, I have no recollection of this Branch having refused the $20.00 for the supplies considered necessary to conduct the Home Nursing Classes.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th ultimo, file 5-11-3, I beg to advise that I have discussed the matter of repairs to the Kootenay Indian Residential School with Father Forbes and beg to enclose a list of requirements at the school.\n\n(1) Water in Basement.\n\nWater is coming into the basement from some unknown source and until this is remedied it will not be possible to fire the furnaces as it is coming up under both furnaces. Father Forbes says the water only recently started to come into the basement and for a few days was about a foot in depth. At the time of my visit most of the water was being carried away by the drain pipe, but there was quite a stream of water going through the basement. It appears to me that this water water is likely coming from the old pipe line from Josephs Creek, which formerly supplied the old school and which is used in the lumber yard stable at present. This pipe is badly installed many years ago and is in very bad condition. Mr. Warren's report of June 29th refers to this pipe line having been installed previous to 1923. I would suggest this be referred to the Dominion Water Power to determine the source from which this water is coming and means of correcting.\n\n(2) Plumbing.\n\nIn very unsanitary condition. See Mr. Patmore's report. Tender enclosed.\n\n(3) Caulking windows and filling cornices.\n\nMaterial on hand. See Mr. Patmore's tender.\n\n(4) Renewing St. Josephs Creek Pipe Line, if not taken care of in No.1 (Water in Basement)\n\nRenewal of line would furnish some fire protection, would supply soft water for laundry and boilers. A supply of soft water would eliminate excessive clogging of boilers and pipes, which has given much trouble.\n\n(5) Painting of School Roof.\n\nMaterial on hand. Tender from Patmores for labour enclosed.\n\n(6) Repairs to cement walk and steps leading to School\n\nJ. D. Caldwell,\nActing Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of May 23rd in connection with repairs necessary at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith Mr. Acting Agent Caldwell's letter of June 8th listing the requirements in order of priority.\n\nThe question of seepage in the basement has been referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch with the request that they investigate and report on the matter but until their report is received we have no means of estimating the cost of remedying the condition.\n\nMr. Patmore's report with reference to the plumbing at the school (dated September 5th, 1944) was submitted to the Department under date of my letter of September 26, 1944, and Patmore Bros. tender of June 7th covering the necessary repairs at a cost of $809.00 is enclosed herewith. This tender would appear to cover the more urgent repairs and it is recommended that they be authorized to proceed with the work.\n\nMaterials for caulking the windows and filling the cornices were supplied last year and it is recommended that this work be done by Patmore Bros. at a cost of $30.00 as per their tender of June 8th attached.\n\nThe question of the renewal of the St. Josephs Creek pipe line to furnish some fire protection and supply soft water for the laundry and boilers was previously dealt with in Mr. Warren's report of June 29, 1941, but I have asked the Surveys and Engineering Branch to have their Mr. Mackenzie discuss the matter further with Mr. Caldwell and submit a further report.\nMaterials were supplied last year for painting the school roof and it is recommended that Patmore Bros. tender of $305.00 for labour be accepted.\n\nThe expenditures recommended above total $1144.00 and as it is anticipated that further expenditures will be incurred in connection with seepage in the basement it would be as well to leave the question of repairs to the cement walks and steps in abeyance for the present.\n\nD.M.

Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, British Columbia. This account includes an item of $24.53 for freight. It will be necessary for us to have a receipt from the transportation company before this item can be paid. I would appreciate it if you would forward the railway receipt.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe General Steel Wares,\nMontreal, Quebec.\nIA-1767-2\n\nJS.\n\nDecember 14, 1944.\n\nRE: KOTENAY, (ST. EUGENE)\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, GRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of the 2nd instant, the estimate of cost of repair work to the plumbing system at the above has now been received and, accordingly, the following comments are submitted for your information:\n\nIn accordance with instructions from this office, Mr. Snelson, who carried out the inspection, has grouped items to show repairs he considers should be carried out at once and others which are of secondary importance.\n\nWe have no Indian Affairs Record Drawings or Specifications of the School and, therefore, have no information regarding the extent or quality of the existing system but, from Mr. Snelson's report, it would appear that the plumbing installation is in need of almost complete renovation. The items which have been described as immediately necessary embody replacements of self-closing basin taps, compression faucets, toilet bowls, urinal and toilet flush tanks and fittings, toilet seats, seat operated flush valves, renewal of traps, waste lines, vent lines and floor drains. Repairs and replacements are necessary for a number of shower and bath tub fittings and several new basins are required. Mr. Snelson also considers that a specially built scullery sink and several kitchen type sinks with drain board are required at once. If carried out independently, this division of the work is estimated to cost approximately $2,200.00.\n\nOther plumbing work which Mr. Snelson considers necessary, but which is described as being of secondary importance, includes new piping for the water supply to washing machines in the laundry, cleaning out of coils and other piping in laundry machines and provision of a 500 gallon storage tank with an emersion type indirect water heater for laundry hot water supply, the provision of a small steam line to a grease trap and new piping to a sink in the school dairy. These secondary plumbing items are estimated to cost approximately $800.00.\n\nIn this connection, an excerpt from Mr. Snelson's report reads:\n\n\"Would like to have 1 - 500 gallon tank to heat wash water by means of an inside steam coil.\"\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe interpret this to indicate that inclusion or omission of the item is optional. If the tank and heater were omitted, the estimated cost of $800.00 for secondary plumbing work, according to Mr. Snelson's figures, would be reduced by $650.00.\n\nIn his report, Mr. Snelson comments separately on the condition of the domestic hot water supply. He states that the present water heater which is supplied with steam from the high pressure boiler, and, therefore, only operative when that boiler is in use for laundering, has become plugged with lime encrustation and is not of very little value. He recommends the installation of a new jacket type domestic hot water heater which could be used independently with a much less expensive type of fuel. The cost of this piece of new equipment, with piping and accessories, completely installed, is estimated at approximately $154.00. We believe this item should be included when considering other plumbing items of secondary importance.\n\nAn analysis of Mr. Snelson's enumeration of replacements for fittings to plumbing fixtures indicates a high quality and expensive type of material which, we assume, is similar in manufacture and operation to the existing equipment. It is doubtful if replacements for such articles as seat-controlled flush valves can be obtained without considerable difficulty under present conditions, but to attempt conversion to other types of flush control might necessitate replacement of the complete toilet unit and add greatly to the expense.\n\nMr. Snelson's estimate of cost for repairs and replacements has been analyzed and, under the circumstances, appears reasonable.\n\nSince so large a proportion of the total cost is for work requiring immediate consideration, we feel that the most economical procedure would be to carry out all work referred to in the report at the same time.\n\nUnder these conditions, to cover the cost of materials, labour and supervision, an amount of approximately $3,500.00 should be made available by the Indian Affairs branch. If it is not considered necessary to install the storage tank and heater for laundry operations, this amount could be reduced to $2,850.00.\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nOttawa, June 21, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School,\nKootenay Indian Agency, British Columbia,\nElectoral District of Kootenay East.\n\nExtensive repairs are required to the plumbing at this school and Indian Commissioner MacKay has submitted the attached tender, received from Patmore Brothers, Cranbrook, B.C., amounting to $809.00 for supplying the materials and installing same.

This dam held back the water of the creek and made a lake and it appears the water in the basement was coming from the lake. The dam has been removed and the water has ceased coming in.\n\nJ. D.

I had to pay a freight bill of $193 because the range was sent via Vancouver (it takes a passenger train two nights & a day to return from Vancouver) whereas it should have been shipped via Lethbridge to save time & considerable expense. Our old range smoked terribly in spite of our efforts to repair it, so not only I but especially the pupils, are very grateful for the new range.\n\nWe officially closed the school on June 30th but had to keep 7 children for cases until yesterday. We got 5 excellent books for the course in home nursing from the local hospital at half price, about $10. The new hospital baby will cost more than the remaining 10% grant but I believe that what the older girls & Indian women will learn will justify the added cost.\n\nAs usual, the health & conduct of the pupils have been very good. Would you gentlemen men an Indian school?\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOver 4 years without raising the strap on the boys once! That is my record.\n\nYou may have heard that water flooded the engine & furnace rooms. We were able to find a stop the leak.\n\nAs part of the home economics classes, the older girls designed & made dresses (for younger girls, embroidered aprons) which they took home. Mrs. Caldwell was pleased with the dresses & aprons. Sister John Anthony (who, by the way, has 5 brothers overseas) gave the girls a real course in very practical - in home cooking. The money generated from (and?) spent on the store room, etc., was well spent.\n\nBishop Johnson, of Nelson, has a camp for boys & girls (20 days, in two periods, no boys or girls for girls) & I visited his camp there for the first time this year. The object is a pleasant holiday for a few folks in location.\n\nI am forced out & do not know whether I shall be back next year. I'd like a school with no farm.\n\nI am sending a few snapshots taken during the Corpus Christi procession.\n\nI expect to apply for lodges soon.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nE. O. [Signature]\n\nP.S. Do a letter like this against Mr. Haig's instructions?\n\nI.e. Should I have addressed it just to the D.H.C. branch?\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYesterday I signed receipt upon your receipt for the kitchen range which you kindly sent. However, before you pay the bill, I would suggest that you make sure that the stone received is the one ordered. I understand Mr. Commissioner MacKay ordered a larger stone than the former. To say that this stone would be longer than the former one but it is about 3' shorter than only two stones whereas the old stone has three.\n\nI cannot see dear Cook about it (whether it is large enough) as she is in Vancouver. I will write to the Commissioner and ask him to phone her and report to you \u2014 Yours Truly,\n\nC. J. Ross\n\nJuly 12/45\nOttawa, July 18, 1945.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nWith reference to the range that was recently sent to you, I may say that at schools of the same size as Kootenay and in one or two cases at schools which are larger we have supplied the same type of range and it has been found satisfactory.

Before his arrival the principal of the school had discovered the cause of the flooding. A dam had been constructed on St. Joseph's Creek and when this was removed no further flooding occurred.\n\n\"While at the school Mr. Mackenzie investigated the water line from St. Joseph's Creek, which was found to be leaking badly and generally in bad repair. It is understood, however, that a report has already been made on this matter by a member of Mr. Walker's staff.\"\n\nWe believe the reference in the second paragraph of the quotation above is to a report by Mr. Snelson last Fall.\n\nYou will recall that the Director of Indian Affairs asked us on October 4th last, for a report on the plumbing system at this school and Mr. Snelson made an inspection.\n\nThe following is an estimate submitted by Mr. Snelson:\n\nFor renewing wood pipe gravity line to supply water to laundry, barn, gardens\n\n600 lin. ft. 6\" wire wound woodstave pipe complete with couplings for water pressure not exceeding 50 psi.\n\nLabour and installation $500.00\n\n$1029.70\n\nNote: Chlorinator not considered necessary at present time. Batch treatment in washers will be tried.\n\nIn order to provide for contingencies, we suggest that a total of $1150.00 be made available if the Indian Affairs Branch decide to do this work.\n\nI cannot be sure of course that the water line from St. Joseph's Creek mentioned by Mr. Webb is the same one reported on by Mr. Snelson, but it seems likely that it is.\n\nJ.

Since wood is the only fuel available at the school, the fire brick should be taken out and a hot water jacket installed. It is not possible to say whether the stove would require metal plates on the oven side after the brick is removed. The Manufacturer may be able to furnish you with this information.\n\nIn view of the work done by the school \"Engineer\" on the old range I would urge that the stove be installed by a local firm, but Patmore Bros. advised that they could not take on extra work. However, Father Viney from the school just informed me that he has started installing the stove. He assured me that the range would be installed next to the chimney and without any other openings into the stove pipe or chimney (like the canopy connection on the old range). He claimed that in this manner he would have the range ready to receive the water front and metal plates in the next few days.\n\nSince he has started this work in an apparently satisfactory manner, it would be appreciated if you would have the required water jacket and metal plates, if required, sent at an early date.\n\nJ.

C.,\nSeptember 7th, 1945.\n\nJ. M. Barre, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Barre:\n\nI know that the Department does not, as a rule, pay bills contracted by Principals unless the latter have been given authority to contract those bills. I know, also, that the Department wishes Principals to do their utmost to prevent a fire especially in Schools where there is practically no fire protection. I would, therefore, request that the Department pay the bill which will be submitted by Mr. MacKay.\n\nSome time ago, some boys and I rushed into the School as, judging from the dense column of smoke issuing from behind it, we feared that there was a fire in the School. Fortunately, it was no more than a rather serious chimney fire which started in or backed up into the long, large pipe from the kitchen range to the chimney. On several occasions, I had spoken to a man, who should be competent in this matter, about the advisability of having the chimneys cleaned. He said that there was no need of this because they were so large and had such a draught that soot would not collect in them. He mentioned also that they had never been cleaned in so far as he knew. Moreover, were there any need to clean them, the Department would have seen to it, when the School was built, that there were clean-out places in the chimneys. There are none.\n\nSome time before and after the chimney fire occurred, the old kitchen range smoked badly. I had three men examine it and I had it thoroughly cleaned but the smoke continued to fill the kitchen. They could not understand this as the draught is very strong. Then, recently, I heard that Mr. MacKay was in town and I asked him to try to help us. He found so much soot in the pipe from the range to the chimney that he said that it had not been cleaned for 10 years. He refused to believe me when I assured him that I had had it properly thoroughly cleaned. He cleaned it and the stove, and it still smoked. He cleaned the stove again and, when he looked at the pipe he had cleaned, a few days before, he was amazed at the amount of soot that had already gathered. He then found the cause which I understand to be this: When the pipe was put in, how many years ago I cannot say, it was not put into one of two flues but was misplaced so that instead of the smoke and soot going into one of the flues, they struck the partition between the two flues so that the smoke and soot recoiled and blew back into the pipe leading from the range. Some of the soot had lodged at, below and above where the pipe entered the chimney. There was also a great deal of smoke in the laundry and there was difficulty with the stove there although these pipes (like others) had been cleaned and renewed. Part of the cause was improper connections of the pipes into this other chimney and part was that, before I came here, someone had made alterations or repairs and had left the loose bricks in the chimney flue. There was considerable soot in this chimney.\n\nI felt that had the Commissioner or any other Official been here and had he known of the chimney fire and had he heard what the chimney sweep, Mr. MacKay, said of the situation, he would have ordered me to have the work done immediately. I am having it done because I am sure that the Department wants to prevent a fire as much as I do. I have asked Mr. MacKay to\ninspect all chimneys and to do whatever work is really necessary. This will involve some work on the old kitchen range which we have to use until alterations are made to the new one and part received. The matter was recently brought to the attention of the Department. It will involve, also, a little work on the laundry stove....Mr. MacKay has made clean-outs in the chimneys. He has been here for about a week and has had a helper part of the time.\n\nI did not consult you officially because I felt that you would have to take the matter up with Vancouver and perhaps Ottawa and I wished to have Mr. MacKay do the work before he left town because I had heard, rightly or wrongly, that the local chimney sweep is at times careless.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) G. Forbes, O.M.I.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter from Reverend Principal Forbes, together with voucher #185 in favour of Mr. George MacKay, chimney sweep.\n\nWhen I inspected the fire extinguisher equipment at the school, I inquired about cleaning of the chimneys and suggested that this work should be done before the winter.\n\nSoon afterwards Father Forbes hired George MacKay, who discovered that the chimney needed alterations and proceeded to do the work.\n\nI did not authorize this work, however, on inspection of the work done by Mr. MacKay, I found that it was required.\n\nThe pipe from the kitchen range ran into two flues (as shown in diagram 2, marked in red), as a result soot and smoke recoiled into the pipe. It was, therefore, necessary to tear a new hole for the pipe to fit in the one flue and cement the other, which connects with a fire place in a room upstairs. I should add that this chimney had no clean-out and one was made, the necessary parts being obtained from Patmore Bros. I understand that Patmore Bros. will submit an account of about $9.00 for clean-out, canopy pipes, etc.\n\nDiagram 1, marked in blue, will show the alterations made to the laundry stove pipes. The twenty-eight foot length of stove pipe was obstructed by loose bricks and soot and therefore required cleaning. All connections were made secure by means of stove bolts. The stove used for heating irons was moved from the ironing room into the laundry room, about fourteen feet from the hot water stove and direct connections made to that pipe. The stoves were both in use at the time of my visit and operating satisfactorily. I should add that the chimneys were also cleaned.\n\nIn view of the circumstances surrounding this case, the fact that the work done would undoubtedly been approved by the Department on acquaintance with this fire hazard, and the early replacement of Father Forbes as School Principal, I would recommend that the enclosed voucher be approved and paid through this office.\n\nI am enclosing a second letter with reference to the work still required for the new kitchen range.\n\nJ. M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School\n\nI beg to forward herewith Kootenay Agency voucher No. 185, amounting to $94.00, for certain repairs to the chimneys and cleaning, together with letters from the Reverend Principal and Acting Agent Barre explaining the reasons for the expenditure. Although the work was not authorized in the usual way it would appear from the information supplied that it was necessary and under the circumstances a covering Purchase Order has been prepared here and the account is recommended for payment.\n\nIt will be observed that a further expenditure of $36.00 is required in connection with the installation of the new kitchen range but this is being dealt with in a separate communication.\n\nD.

He charged only for parts supplied but his bill amounted to over $15.00. He told me that three of our Singer Sewing Machines were so old that, next year, the cost for repairs would be prohibitive. He suggested that I turn in the old Machines to him (for $10.00 each) and get new Machines. I would suggest that the Department supply three new Machines and that the old machines be put in order and given as a reward to deserving ex-pupils such as Genevieve Teneese (Shuswap), Phylis Deminic (Columbia Lake) and Edna Auld (Tobacco Plains) or other ex-pupils. As these girls will not work the machines as hard as we do, they should last. I am not asking for additional machines (although two more would be very acceptable) even though the Manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Co. has pointed out that Cardston has twenty machines.

Moey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn making the attached report on conditions in this school I overlooked the calling of your attention to a very important matter, viz, the fire hazard.\n\nI have read several reports which have been made over a period of some years regarding this matter and I am sure the present lack of adequate fire-fighting equipment must be well known to your Dept.\n\nI see that an alarm system has been introduced but there is evidently still a lack of suitable equipment to insure a proper measure of safety. I leave it to the competent authority who are acquainted with the proper type of equipment to legislate on the matter. The point I want to make clear is that it is unjust to unnecessarily endanger the lives of the children and staff for no other reason than that sufficient equipment has not been supplied. I sincerely urge that this very important matter be no longer delayed lest you be called upon to answer for a tragedy.\n\nI have been informed by the former Principal, Rev. G. Forbes, that Mr. Coleman expressed his opinion that the engineer employed here was incompetent. From my observations to date I would be inclined to agree with Mr. Coleman and I have already begun negotiations for his removal. I assure you that within a very short time this desired change will be effected and an experienced and more capable man employed.\n\nTrusting that this will prove to the satisfaction of all and the betterment of conditions at our school,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSept. 27 /45.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. R. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving been appointed Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C., I wish to report on conditions as I find them upon entering my term as Principal.\n\nI have made a thorough investigation of the school and find conditions extremely bad. I beg of you to take serious consideration of the following observations and authorize immediate action.\n\nLiving conditions are a disgrace to the Department. The building gives a fair impression from the outside but the interior is most unfavourable. Due to faulty plumbing a very unpleasant and disgusting odor prevails throughout the house. This is more pronounced in the section reserved for the boys and for a very obvious reason. Forty-six boys are limited to the use of one toilet, that is, one individual toilet bowel. All the toilets in both lavatories at the disposal of the boys are out of order except one. All the urinals are blocked and cannot be used. The odor of them surpasses description. The wash-basins in the boys section are for the most part out of order. The waste pipes are encased in the wall and cannot be opened or cleaned. The taps are out of order. It is impossible to expect forty-six boys to properly use one toilet. When it ceases to function, and indications are that that will not be far distant, what are we to do? Personally I would say it were better to leave the children at home than to subject them to the unsanitary conditions of their present quarters. At home, some of them at least, would have the partial decency of 'outdoor plumbing'. Here they have much worse.\n\nThe boys are limited to the use of three bath-tubs, placed end to end without partitions or separations of any kind. These tubs are antiquated and should be replaced. There is not one shower in the whole house, either for the boys the girls or the staff.\n\nI think it is agreed that it is part of our duty to teach hygienic methods, decency, and cleanliness. How is it possible to do so under these conditions. Instead of learning hygiene and cleanliness they are subjected to learn immorality of the basest kind.\n\nThe toilets in the girls section of the building are in a better repair but still leave much to be desired. The basins and\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nTaps are in need of repair.\n\nI understand from the disciplinarians in charge of the dormitories that it is the order of the Dept. that the dormitories be locked at night. I do not take objection to that but the order does not provide for toilet facilities during the night. The toilets cannot be reached directly from the dormitories but only by the use of the corridor, which corridor cannot be reached when the doors are locked. This condition prevails in both the boys and girls dormitories. This necessitates the use of chambers during the night. A number of these are placed at the disposal of the boys and girls. Picture a dormitory of forty or fifty being subjected to such a public, indecent, and filthy practice. When the doors are unlocked in the morning the odor is thoroughly disgusting. Practically every night one or other of the chambers is overflowed or upset. The dormitory floors and the ceilings below tell the rest. The disciplinarians are not at fault. They are doing their duty under most trying conditions. The layout of the building is at fault. The dormitories must give access to the toilets during the night. Surely this is only common decency.\n\nI know that all this has been investigated by the proper authorities. I see from reports on file that for a number of years back requests have been made regarding the toilets and baths in this institution and yet nothing has been done. I have contacted the plumber recommended for work here, Mr. Patmore of Cranbrook, requesting that he do something if only of a temporary measure to give the necessary facilities that we may carry on and he says nothing can be done with the present system, all must be renewed. What are we to do while waiting for the necessary action on the part of the dept.? There is a situation here which is a positive discredit to the Dept. and places the children in an unhealthy and unsanitary environment.\n\nThe building has neither adequate ventilation or insulation. I have not yet spent a winter here but every member of the staff whom I have interviewed and I have interviewed them all has complained of the lack of heat during the winter months. Judging from the cost of the fuel in the past and the size of the building it would seem that heat was being lost through lack of insulation. I have already read reports of the unsatisfactory condition of the boiler-room, the heating plant and the water system. Four times in the past week the water system has been out of order.\n\nThe engineer informs me that a new set of batteries is necessary for the present lighting unit. The present batteries will not hold a charge over night sufficient to give light in the morning. The power unit has to be kept going the greater part of the day in order to keep up a supply of electricity and this is very costly as it burns.\ngasoline. I have been informed that a Lister engine was installed but that it proved unsatisfactory. At present we rise in the dark or with a very faint yellow glimmer from the imperfect lights. Surely you do not expect a staff of teachers to live under such conditions.\n\nThe laundry is not what it should be. The clothes are washed in hard water. The washing machines are out of date. The steam drier works very imperfectly. The ironing is done by flat irons heated on a stove. Separate equipment is not provided for laundering the clothing of the staff. Surely we are not expected to have our laundry mixed with that of the children and yet no provision otherwise has been made.\n\nThere is no scullery. The dishes are washed on tables in the corridor between the kitchen and the refectory. Picture a number of girls with dish pans washing the dishes for almost a hundred children. It hardly impresses them with modern kitchen methods.\n\nI understand that a new stove was granted to the school during the past year. It is in the kitchen but not in operation. A stove with a water jacket was requested. One was sent minus the jacket. There is no hot water in the kitchen except what is heated on the top of the old stove by the use of kettles. Dish water has to be heated in this improper and unsatisfactory manner.\n\nSimilar conditions prevail throughout every part of the building. I am aware that Mr. Coleman gave it a thorough inspection last year and has reported on it. I also know that our present Indian agent realizes the unsatisfactory living conditions and that he is just as eager as I am to have them improved.\n\nOne of the basic steps in improving this institution is to provide adequate electrical power. That would be the foundation to eliminate much of the trouble. A power line is within reasonable distance and yet we are denied its advantages.\n\nI know that this school has been severely criticised for its lack of development in agriculture but I beg you not to expect any improvement in this regard until the unsatisfactory living conditions as outlined above are eliminated. Give us decent living conditions and modern equipment and I pledge my word that we will give in return not only an adequate agricultural course but an entire school program second to none in the province.\n\nTrusting that this report will receive your kind attention and just consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 9, 1945.\n\nDear Father Scannell:\n\nIf you have an opportunity to do so in the near future, I would appreciate your calling at my office. I have a report from the new Principal of the Kootenay School regarding the condition of the building. We have endeavoured insofar as finances will permit to make the most necessary repairs and evidently Father Kelly considers that our efforts in this regard have been by no means adequate.\n\nThere is no use in going into the matter at length in this letter. I will be glad to show you all the correspondence whenever you can call.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nVery Rev. J. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joseph's Rectory,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 9, 1945.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nYour letter of September 27, addressed to the Director, has been referred to me, owing to Mr. Hoey's absence from the office through illness.\n\nSome of the improvements which you state are required have been authorized but presumably have not been carried out, owing to lack of labour.\n\nI am submitting the whole report to Indian Commissioner MacKay. However, I may say that the fire equipment recommended by Acting Agent Barre has been ordered, but owing to circumstances over which we have no possible control the delivery of this type of equipment at the present time is very slow.\n\nI am glad to know that you are making a change in your engineer. From reports I have received it is quite evident that whoever has been in charge of this work for the past two years has been very inefficient. For instance, you mention batteries being required. Our records show that a set of Hart batteries was supplied to the school in 1941 and with adequate care should be good for at least seven years. As a matter of fact, we have had batteries last much longer in several residential schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Kelly, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nBranch a requisition for the following:\n\n24 refills for Pyrene extinguishers,\n2 # # 2\u00bd gal. Phomene extinguishers,\n2 new 2\u00bd gallon Phomene extinguishers,\n8 5-gallon pump cans and required amount of soda and acid mixture.\n\nAs you are probably aware, deliveries on this type of equipment are very slow, but this is due to circumstances beyond our control.\n\nYou will also note that Father Kelly mentions the fire alarm system.\n\nWe have not received any previous request for a new set of batteries. If you consider these are required it will be necessary to have complete details and an estimate of the cost.\n\nOur records indicate that a set of batteries was purchased for this school in 1941, and if they had received proper attention they should not be in the condition that Father Kelly reports. I also note that he refers to the Lister engine. I was under the impression that this was now in running order.\n\nI have reviewed our files this afternoon and I cannot find any recent reference to securing electric power from a neighbouring power line. Possibly I have overlooked something or, on the other hand, you may have definite information regarding the matter to which he refers.\n\nBoth of us will be glad to learn that the engineer is being changed. I am still under the impression that a great deal of the trouble at this school has been caused by an inefficient person in this particular position.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nAIRMALL\n\nOttawa, October 9, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter received from the new Principal of the Kootenay Residential School. His letter gives a very dismal view of conditions at this school.\n\nIn connection with some of the matters mentioned, I would refer you to your letter of June 13, 1945, and my reply of June 21. The tender of Patmore Brothers for repairing the plumbing at a cost of $808.00 was approved and you were so advised in official letter of July 11, 1945.\n\nAdditional expenditures of $335.00 were also authorized in my letter of June 21. As we have not received accounts for any of these disbursements, it is presumed that none of the repairs mentioned have been carried out. This is due, no doubt, to lack of labour, but I suggest that if it is at all possible the repairs already authorized receive immediate attention.\n\nWith reference to the stove, our records show that the type of stove suggested by the former Principal was obtained. However, on receipt of a letter dated August 29, from Acting Agent Barre, I wrote General Steel Wares, and they replied in a letter dated September 19. Copies of both letters are enclosed, for your information. We immediately ordered the articles recommended by the company, and it is hoped that these have already reached the school.\n\nOn August 23 we forwarded to the Purchasing\nSeptember 5th, 1944.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs, Federal Government.\n\nHaving been asked by Mr. A. Irwin, Indian Agent for a report on the Sanitary conditions in regards to the Plumbing etc., at the Kootenay Residential School, St. Eugene Mission, we hereby make the following report:\n\nPractically all Plumbing fixtures date 1912. There are fifteen J.L. Mott Toilets, Suspendo type, with Flushometer and tank action. Also nine Mott Compacto floor type with same flush action. While the porcelain pans or bowls are mostly in good shape the Flushometers on all the toilets are due for replacement, also it would be necessary to replace many seats that are broken and patched up, as the Toilets are flushed by seat action.\n\nThere were originally 36 basins in boys and girls Dormitories and washroom. Any that have been broken have been taken out or left on the wall without any replacements. The waste pipes for all these basins, four batteries of nine each, are in the outside concrete wall. Iron pipes with lead stubs through plaster and wainscoting. The traps soldered to the stubs. No cleanouts available. Numbers of these lead stubs are leaking behind the wall and running on the floor. To repair would mean (and in many places have already been done, leaving an unsightly appearance) cutting out wainscoting and plaster and cement. Would advise accessible wastes with proper cleanouts.\n\nNine Urinals are in filthy condition, often plugged, (as I found them all at time of writing) with no cleanouts available making cleaning difficult.\n\nBathing Facilities are three - five foot leg tubs, no partitions, in each of boys and girls Dormitories, to serve approximately 45 boys and 45 girls. Three showers in each of boys and girls basements have been out of commission for years and are obsolete. Mostly have been out of commission and are gone. If put in condition would greatly add to bathing facilities.\n\nYou have a report by a Mr. Warren on the Domestic Water supply, three years ago. This water not being Automatic, the pressure varies from nothing up to one hundred pounds. The Toilets of the Flushometer type need a good pressure for flushing, consequently when pressure gets down the toilets being used are not flushing properly, leave a very unsanitary condition. In this regards, Self closing Taps should be used, or installed on all washing basins used by the pupils, as when water pressure is down the pupils leave the taps open and when the water pressure is pumped up again it causes numerous floods from basins overflowing. Installing the above taps would save a great deal of pumping. All these old taps with the exception of a couple of pair, are over thirty years old and due for replacement.\n\nIn the Laundry all new taps are needed and some repairs and replacements to traps.\n\nThe Domestic Water supply is very hard water and they have tried most of the known water softeners on the market without success. Soap will absolutely not lather. The best they can get white sheets and clothes, although is a very dirty grey, with a very bad odor. There is a soft water line from St. Joseph's Creek, (Typhoid water) which used to be in use for the washers only, but this being an old 3\" wooden pipe, needs renewing. Alternative would be to pump water from St. Mary's river, both being equal distance, approx. 600 feet.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere are numerous toilets, basins, and baths needing new brass parts which are available, also toilets of type that can be replaced by Canadian goods. While all the Mott Toilets being American, parts are not available. (Since time of writing are available).\n\nThe Domestic water is heated by a steam jacket in Summer, steam being supplied by a high pressure boiler which is used for Laundry purposes. This means that unless high pressure Boilers is in use there is not hot water. This steam jacket has been in a number of years and was badly Alkilled, but, by the use of Acid we have managed to clean it good enough the coming year, when a replacement or other means will be necessary for Domestic hot water.\n\nThere is a two inch coil in one hot water boiler which heats the water during the firing season. This coil will need renewing shortly.\n\nIn Summary, the Plumbing is in very poor condition. Any inspection by Government Official will find this not to be an exaggerated report.\n\nWe have not touched on the heating. The Expansion Tank in attic does need relining. Smoke pipes need attention. It is far from a good heating system.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPATMORE BROTHERS.\n\nper: A. C.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School Plumbing\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo, file 5-11-3, I beg to refer you to Mr. Snelson's report submitted in January 1945, by the Survey and Engineering Branch, a copy of which was forwarded to this office with your letter dated May 29th, 1945. May I also draw your attention to a report dated September 27th, 1945 by Rev. Father Kelly, Principal of the above school. This report was received Sunday and a copy sent you on October 1st.\n\nActing on your instructions the writer of this letter has examined the plumbing at the above school for a second time, and I beg to report that the condition of affairs in the boys' toilets has now reached the point where repairs cannot be carried out by the school staff. Our new Principal is a practical man who agreed on doing some of the work and maintaining repairs in the future but I submit that the present conditions are beyond control.\n\nWith reference as to why the matter was not definitely taken up when the school closed for the holidays, I would refer you to Rev. Father Forbes, who was Principal here. The first indication I received was some time after school started, the matter was then taken up with Mr. Hayden of Patmore Bros. and referred to you in my letter of the 24th.\n\nWith reference to the toilets, it appears that the flush action on all of them must be replaced. The toilets that are in working order leak on the floors and create an unsanitary condition. As you suggest, a few\n\n(over)\nIf the seats can be patched up and made to last a little longer, but it was pointed out to me that this is hardly economical since the flush action is controlled by the seat and if this is worn out it has a tendency to cause excessive wear on the flush action. No great harm could be done by keeping some of the old seats till next year.\n\nSince there is only a maximum balance of $365.00 and the toilet repairs will cost in the neighbourhood of $600.00 to $700.00, I consulted Father Kelly and Mr. Hayden and would suggest the following changes on Purchase Order #4190, dated July 3rd, 1945.\n\n| Saving |\n|--------|\n| Running only 2 new exposed waste lines for 2 batteries of basins | $72.00 |\n| Leaving till next year the following items | |\n| Supplying two china basins etc. | $38.00 |\n| Supplying taps, traps etc. in laundry | $51.00 |\n| Supplying one white closet | $38.00 |\n| Supplying six pairs Bath taps etc. | $45.00 |\n\nThis saving of $244.00 to be applied together with $365.00, making a total of $609.00 to the repairs of toilets in the boys' and girls' lavatories.\n\nI would once again urge that authority be granted at the earliest for this expenditure as per Mr. Hayden's quotation of September 19th, 1945.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Patmore Bros. are in the process of exchanging correspondence and telegrams to establish the cost of the repairs needed. Since the manufacturers are in the eastern states, they must also find out whether the quotation they gave us was in Canadian or American currency and whether duty was included in it. It was, however, understood with Mr. Hayden of Patmore Bros. that the above amount $609.00 would put a necessary number of toilets in operation and that a detailed account would be furnished to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the urinals ($63.00), I might add that no account was taken by the plumbers that one waste line in the basement is reported to be five feet underground. Father Kelly offered to supply a man to break the cement floor and dig down to the waste line and Mr. Hayden will put in an accessible clean out.\nRe the new waste line for two batteries of basins ($72.00), Father Kelly also came to the rescue by supplying a carpenter to tear down the rotten V joint wall to which the basins are hung. The basins will then be attached on a wood backing (2\" x 12\" plank secured against the cement wall). It will of course be necessary to obtain King cement to plaster the walls later, but this will remove one source of dirt and bad odor.\n\nSince we have a co-operative Principal, I submit that we give him a chance to make this school into an institution the Department will be proud of.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to present this information to the Department so as to obtain the necessary authority at an early date.\n\nJ. M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nJMB/DD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 155-0-5\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of October 9th and letter received by the Department from the new Principal of the Kootenay Residential School in connection with conditions at the school, I enclose herewith Mr. Acting Agent Barre's letters of September 24th and October 6th and enclosures referred to therein.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Barre's letters that repairs to the plumbing authorized by the Department under Departmental Purchase Order No. 4190 have not yet been carried out and that it is now proposed to limit the expenditure authorized by the Purchase Order to effect a saving of $244.00 which, together with the balance of the total amount of $1500.00 available for repairs at this school during the current year, referred to in Mr. Phelan's letter of May 23rd, will provide an amount of $609.00 which could be used for repairs to the toilets in the boys' and girls' lavatories. The repairs to the toilets would appear to be the most urgent requirements at the school and it is recommended that Mr. Barre be authorized to make the necessary arrangements with Patmore Bros. for the installation of the twenty-four sets of seats and flush actions at a cost of $766.00 in accordance with their tender of September 19th.\n\nThe other questions raised by the Reverend Principal will be dealt with in separate communications.\n\nD.M.

From the reports received, I think that Patmore's original tender, which was approved in official letter of July 11, last, should be completed in full.\n\nI spoke to the Director this afternoon about the more recent tender for $766.00, covering the cost of additional work, and he authorized me to advise you that this may also be accepted. We will be able to handle the extra expenditure and I trust that all the work can be completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nOctober 25th, 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nVOTE Allotment\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Barre, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barre:\n\nI am sure we agree that the efficiency of an office depends to a great extent on the keeping of proper files. As Principals of schools are changed periodically we are at a great disadvantage when preceding correspondence and records of business transactions are not retained in an orderly manner. Upon taking over this office I find that due to a lack of a proper filing system many records have been lost or destroyed and those that remain are an untidy and jumbled heap of paper.\n\nIn order to remedy this situation, and to insure proper filing of correspondence in the future, I would like to enter a requisition for a filing cabinet. A steel cabinet of three or four drawers, fitted with files $9\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12$ inches would be most suitable for our requirements. Such a cabinet would add greatly to the efficiency of our office and school.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your customary kind and prompt attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 1, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI attach a requisition which has just been received from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School. He points out that there has been no proper system of filing letters and consequently considers that this situation should be remedied by having a proper filing cabinet, etc.\n\nIt is simply impossible to secure steel filing cabinets or even wooden ones around this part of the country at the present time. You were so successful in obtaining the refrigerator for the Sechelt School from the local Division of the War Assets Corporation, and I thought that you might also be able to secure something that would meet Father Dunlop's request. If so, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery to the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nSchool: The Kootenay Residential School was inspected before the school opened with reference to added fire extinguisher protection. As this matter has already been brought to the attention of the Department, I will confine my remarks to the statement that fire protection in this school is inadequate. I submit that the Department should lose no time in installing added protection if it wishes to prevent a serious conflagration. Added refills for extinguishers and new extinguishers requisitioned at the opening of the school term have not yet been received.\n\nDuring my inspection of the school I found the engine room in a filthy condition, the floor saturated with oil. Its proximity to the boiler room and the fact that the man in charge smokes makes this a danger spot. I advised Rev. Father Forbes, Principal, to have these rooms cleaned up immediately and to cause his \"engineer\" to take every precaution against fire. Certain alterations suggested by Mr. Arnall, the boiler inspector, would minimize the fire hazards in that part of the building, unless the Department considered major alterations such as replacing the boilers and placing them above the ground. I doubt that Mr. Townsend is a competent man to handle Departmental machines or he is called on to do too many things to attend to any properly.\n\nWith worn out batteries, poor lighting and power and unsatisfactory refrigeration, I submit that the Department should consider hooking up this school to the Kootenay Power Line. Adequate power would enable the Department to install proper fire fighting apparatus. Mr. J. Ward of the Modern Electric, who has submitted reports to the Department on this school lighting problem, claims that money could be saved by effecting this proposed hook-up. It would appear that about half a dozen sets of batteries have been burnt out and a new set will cost approximately $1000.00 and will require replacement in the near future. The wiring is also very old and would not pass inspection.\n\nThe water supply in this school is quite unsatisfactory and this matter has been dealt with at length by engineers from the Water Power Branch.\n\nThe roof of this school was repaired recently and painted early in September. The Rev. Principal was not satisfied with the work and upon inspection part of the roof was found to be spotty. This was brought to the attention of the painters, who repainted part of the roof.\n\nAuthority was given to Patmore Bros. to effect some improvements to the urinals and to replacing taps, etc. This work is delayed since it was not possible to obtain all parts necessary for repairs. The Principal complains that they have no hot water, the boiler being all sealed up. The toilets, which are about 30 years old, need repairs. This unsatisfactory plumbing is very unsanitary and dirty, one toilet being used by some forty boys. A report dated Sept. 5th, 1944 by Mr. Hayden, Plumber, was forwarded to the Department together with a quotation asking that authority be granted to have the necessary repairs done.\n\n(over)\nThe chimneys at the school were cleaned and certain alterations effected when faulty construction in the chimneys was uncovered by the chimney sweep. Authority was requested for the balance of this work.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nJ.M.

We discussed various projects and he gave me considerable encouragement in overcoming some of the difficulties which confront us at this school.\n\nOn two matters discussed he advised me to refer directly to you. The first matter was in regard to a night watchman and fireman for this institution. The need of such a man here is quite obvious on a twofold score, firstly, since we burn wood, and secondly as a protection against fire. The question raised was that of a grant for a night watchman. While reading a report on Indian education written in 1935 I saw that it was the policy of the Dept. to pay such a grant during the months while the furnace was in use. Is that the present policy? If so, to what extent?\n\nThe second matter was in regard to Agriculture. Some weeks ago I wrote to Mr. Doucet on this matter but to date have not had a reply. My questions were as follows. Does the Dept. outline a specific course to be followed in this matter or is it left to the discretion of the instructor? Is the Agricultural project supplemented by a grant for the furthering and improving of this work?\n\nAny information which you can give on these matters will be appreciated. Assuring you that we will be guided by your recommendations,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of November 1st (File 155-0-5) and requisition from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School for a steel filing cabinet, the War Assets Corporation in Vancouver has advised that they have no filing cabinets available at the present time but that our request has been forwarded to their head office at Montreal.\n\nD.

Haynes.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nNov 28/45.\n\nMr. J. Barre, Acting Indian Agent,\nIndian Office, Cranbrook.\n\nDear Mr. Barre:\n\nYou will recall that during our recent inspection of the school in the company of Major McKay we agreed that the installation of a unit suitable for sanitary dishwashing is a very urgent need.\n\nUnder present circumstances the dishes have to be carried from the refectory to tables in the corridor where they are washed in dishpans. I am sure you will remember the water soaked and unsanitary condition of these wooden tables. The dishpans of water have to be carried from the kitchen to the corridor and back again when the work is finished. This carrying of hot water is very dangerous and is a constant source of accidents.\n\nThe installation of a proper sink with drainboards would eliminate this uncalled for drudgery and unsanitary procedure. I feel that this matter is urgent enough to ask that it be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nThe quotation should allow for a larger hot water tank as the present thirty gallon one does not heat sufficient water for the kitchen and the dish washing. Installation, lead-in and waste pipe connections, would also have to be considered. As I already mentioned I will gladly have our engineer assist the plumbers so as to reduce the labour of installation.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your consideration and attention,\n\nI remain, Sincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly,\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B. C.\nNov. 29th, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Sink Unit for Kootenay Indian School\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter received from Rev. Father Kelly, Principal of the above school with reference to a sink unit for dishwashing at the above school.\n\nAs the Rev. Principal states in his letter, dishwashing is done under very unsanitary conditions now.\n\nI have, therefore, approached several local firms to obtain quotations on a monel sink unit, only Parks Hardware Ltd. were able to give a quotation, a copy of which is herewith attached. This quotation for $293.00 includes only the sink and two drainboards. It would still be necessary to purchase water pipes and waste line, etc. separately, and the services of a reliable plumber should be had to install it.\n\nPatmore Bros. advise me that they are unable to obtain any sinks at the present time, and that no time should be lost in obtaining same. On receipt of the sink, they are willing to quote on the price of water pipes, waste line and installation.\n\nI would urge that authority be granted at your early convenience for the purchase of the sink unit referred to above.\n\nJ. M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nCranbrook, B. C.\nDecember 8, 1945\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, file 5-11-4, with reference to a sink unit for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I contacted Patmore Bros. this morning and beg to advise as follows:\n\nMr. Hayden of Patmore Bros. declined to give a detailed quotation as it is impossible to determine how much cement must be broken up to reach the sewer pipe, or where to connect to the water pipes. Mr. Hayden said that it would cost approximately $50.00 to $60.00 for dual taps, trap, pipes, connections and labour. He advised me that he was quite prepared to install this sink and to furnish a detailed account of the materials and labour supplied after the work was done.\n\nJ. M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nJMB/DD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Barre's letters of November 29th and December 8th in connection with the proposed supply of a sink unit for the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nI may say that during a recent visit to Cranbrook I inspected the dishwashing facilities of this school and found that proper equipment should be immediately supplied to meet the existing need and therefore strongly recommend that the Department authorize the purchase and installation of the unit quoted on by Parks Hardware Limited. The cost should not exceed $360.00. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, 14th December, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMajor D.M.

As you stated in your letter of December 12 that you had paid a visit recently to Cranbrook, I thought the matter might have been discussed with you at that time. I would therefore appreciate it if you would let me know what the prospects are of securing electric power for the Kootenay School and also let me have an estimate of the probable cost of such installation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. J. Barre, Acting Agent,\nIndian Office, Cranbrook.\n\nDear Mr. Barre:\n\nDuring our recent inspection of the school, Major McKay pointed out that the wooden beds we are now using should be replaced by iron ones. We have eleven wooden beds in use. They have no springs and only straw mattresses. I would be pleased if you would ask for beds and mattresses to replace these. Though we have some three foot beds in use we find that the two and half wide by six feet long are more suitable. The narrower springs do not have the same tendency to sag as the wider ones.\n\nOf the iron beds in use seventeen have springs that are broken. Many of these have been repaired by rewiring the sides but have again pulled away. If it is possible to get springs without buying the complete bed it would be well to have some of these replaced. The broken springs are not only uncomfortable but are damaging to the mattresses and bedding.\n\nI have been told that some schools were able to get army blankets from the War Assets Corporation. We are in need of about hundred blankets if they are now available.\n\nThanking you for your interest and cooperation,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly,\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.

I may say that I inspected the beds at this school during a recent visit and would strongly recommend that if funds are available from any source at the present time they be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nSuitable beds, complete with spring and mattress, and 2\u00bd springs are available in Vancouver from the Nestmore Manufacturing Co. Ltd., at a cost of $15.75 for the bed, complete, and $3.75 for the spring, or a total cost of approximately $240.00.\n\nMr. Barre in his letter also mentioned the need for 100 army blankets but enquiries made recently of the War Assets Corporation indicate that these are not available at the present time.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, the Department approves the purchase of Beds and Bed Springs for use at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, at an approximate cost of $240.00.\n\nPhilip Phelen,\nChief, Training Division.\nDecember 8, 1945.\n\nMr. J. W. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some years past we have supplied and installed electrical equipment in the Kootenay Residential School. This equipment, for the most part, was used for generating electrical energy. Despite the fact that only the finest equipment was supplied, and that every effort was made to complete a first class installation, results have been very unsatisfactory. You have requested that we make a survey of this situation and give you a report on the condition of the equipment as it stands, and, if possible, the best solution to the problem of supplying adequate electrical energy to the Kootenay School.\n\nOur report is as follows - and no attempt has been made to mince words.\n\nThe batteries are in deplorable condition. They show every evidence of being operated for long periods in a discharged condition. The high sediment deposit is now partially short circuiting the plates and is due to the fact that they have several times been subjected to reverse current from the charging generator. In short, if anything like economical operation is to be obtained they will have to be replaced. No battery manufacturer ever designed a battery to operate under conditions to which these batteries have been subjected.\n\nThe condition of the Lister Diesel engine is truly disgraceful. This fine piece of equipment has been so maltreated that it could not possibly give proper service. In fact it is doubtful whether the necessary repairs to this engine would be an economically sound investment. There is scarcely a part on the entire machine that does not show evidence of careless abuse. The large ten kilowatt Westinghouse Generator, while in operating condition, is not the most suitable unit for use with the existing switch board equipment. This unit and panelboard is far from modern in design and when carelessly operated will at times reverse itself to the detriment of the batteries as noted above.\nThe four kilowatt generator, which was connected to the Petters Diesel engine, is in such a dilapidated condition that it will not even operate. Both rotor bearings are ruined and the armature is so covered with grime that only removal for shop test would determine its condition.\n\nFrom the foregoing you can readily see that your department has on its hands a considerable amount of equipment in very poor condition even though in the last decade it has spent thousands of dollars in an effort to provide electrical facilities to the school in question.\n\nYou requested that we submit our solution, if any, to your problem. We feel we have a solution and submit it after considerable thought. We have in it nothing to sell, or, are we in any way connected with those that may have. We offer this recommendation in the full knowledge that its acceptance would remove a definite condition, which has been such a continual expense to the department and such an aggravation to the operators of the school.\n\nIn reasonable proximity to the school building there is a source of hydro electric power. In our opinion, every effort should be made to obtain electrical energy from these lines. Despite the fact that a somewhat larger initial cost would be involved, the department would rid itself of purchasing and maintaining electrical generating equipment.\n\nMuch stress has been placed of late by both Provincial and Dominion Governments on the need of extending electrical facilities to rural outlets. The Kootenay Residential School is definitely a rural outlet and nowhere does there exist a greater need for an abundance of electrical energy than at this school.\n\nYour department saw fit to install electric refrigeration in this building some years ago. Since its installation this refrigerator has been in service less than fifty percent of the time, for the simple reason that there has seldom been sufficient electric current available to operate it. In an institution of this kind, refrigeration is vitally necessary yet the operators of the school are denied this facility for lack of adequate power.\nThe water system in this school is operated by an engine driven pump manually controlled. No water can be obtained until some person operates the pump. If there was sufficient electrical energy available, the system could be motorized and automatically controlled, thus supplying an abundance of water at all times. With normal water pressure the toilets, etc., could be operated satisfactorily.\n\nWe believe your present problem is a matter of deciding whether or not to spend a considerable sum of money in restoring to operation, a local electrical system of known inadequacy and limited life or soundly investing in an abundance of hydro power for the future. We trust we have given you the information you desire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMODERN ELECTRIC\n\nJ. A. Ward.\nCranbrook, B.C.\nDecember 8, 1945\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, file 5-11-4, with reference to the electric generating plant at the Kootenay School, and by way of reply I beg to enclose a report submitted at my request by Mr. Ward of Modern Electric of this city.\n\nMay I point out that Mr. Ward has given the Department several comprehensive reports in the past, which were found correct in every detail. In view of his reliability, I would suggest that every consideration be given to his recommendations.\n\nDuring the past week we have experienced much difficulty with the water pumps, which supplies the school, and are faced with eventual breakdown. Such a serious situation could be avoided by installing proper electrical equipment. As pointed out in my report, it would appear that the cost of the batteries alone would have practically paid for the proposed hook up to the Kootenay Power.\n\nJ.M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nEAST KOOTENAY POWER COMPANY, LIMITED\n\nFernie,\nBritish Columbia\n\nOctober 9th, 1948.\n\nMr. G. I. Kelly, Principal,\nKootenay Indian Schools,\nCRANBROOK, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn 1939 or 1940 I had some correspondence with Father Collins then Principal of the St. Eugene Indian Mission Schools and Mr. Walker, Supervising Engineer - Department of Mines & Resources, Banff, Alberta and also in 1941 with Mr. Irvine Indian Agent of Cranbrook, B. C. regarding the supply of power to the Kootenay Indian School, as it is apparently now called.\n\nIt may be possible that you can refer back to this correspondence and you will then have a fair picture of what was involved in this case. I will give you a brief outline on the situation.\n\nFirst, the Transmission Line to the Kimberley Airport and transformer supplying it, is owned by the Department of Transport and they feel very rightly that their power supply to the Airport must be protected. Therefore, we cannot supply the school with power without first the Department of Indian Affairs coming to an arrangement with the Department of Transport.\n\nSecond, the question of rates would also have to be settled with the Department of Transport. If we could be advised that the two Departments are agreeable to cooperate, then we would be glad to give you revised estimates of the cost of the line and necessary equipment. The last costs I have on this proposed line as made up in 1940 were $6,200.00 but there have been increases in labour and material costs since then that would make a revised estimate as much as 20% higher.\nThe length of line, according to my records, is 3\u00bd miles but this would have to be checked by actual survey.\n\nWe would have to be granted free Right-of-Way for the line through the Indian Reserve but this should not be difficult as you would own the line yourselves in any case as your consumption being small does not produce sufficient revenue to carry the cost of the line.\n\nWhen I have an opportunity, I will drop in and see you at the school but in the meantime, if you can do anything through your department towards obtaining permission to use the Department of Transport transformers and line, and arrive at a decision as to what your power costs from the Department of Transport would be, then I suggest that you do so as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEAST KOOTENAY POWER CO., LTD.,\n\n(sgd) G. E. Elkington,\nGeneral Manager.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 155-0-5\n\nI have your letter of December 18th in which you advise that the matter of securing power from the East Kootenay Power Company Ltd., for St. Eugene Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, has again been brought before the Department.\n\nIn November last I had an opportunity to visit this school, being in the district in connection with the competition being held to fill the existing vacancy on the Kootenay Indian Agency establishment, when this question of supplying electrical energy to the school from the power lines of the above-noted Company was discussed at some length with Reverend Principal Kelly.\n\nIt will be recalled that this matter was before the Department in 1941, but the cost was considered prohibitive at the time with the result that a Lister 16 H.P. diesel engine and a set of batteries were supplied, the cost of the engine and batteries being $2042.75.\n\nThe school experienced difficulty with this engine from the outset, whether this was due to lack of proper care and attention on the part of the school engineer or some weakness in the unit itself when supplied, we have not been able to definitely determine.\n\nFollowing complaints made in December, 1943, by Reverend G. Forbes, then Principal of the school, regarding this plant, I arranged for Inspector Coleman who was in the district in connection with a status investigation, to visit the school and report on the situation. Inspector Coleman secured the services of Mr. J. Bayes, an engineer in the employ of the Caterpillar Tractor Company, to look over the plant and submit a report. Mr. Bayes' report, together with that of Inspector Coleman were forwarded to the Department with my letter 215-5-2047 dated...\nMarch 17th, 1944, so that the Department has been kept informed with respect to the power situation at this school.\n\nAt the request of Acting Agent Barre, Mr. J. A. Ward, of the Modern Electric Company, which firm supplied the Lister engine and batteries in 1941, recently examined the plant and his report on his findings is also enclosed. It will be observed that Mr. Ward is satisfied that this problem at the school can best be met by connecting up with the East Kootenay Power Co. Ltd.\n\nRev. Father Kelly approached the East Kootenay Power Co. Ltd., in October last regarding the supply of power to the school and was informed that the cost to connect the school with the nearest power line would be in the neighborhood of $7,000.00, and further that the scheme would be contingent on the Department being able to make arrangements with the Department of Transport and accepting responsibility for the maintenance of the line.\n\nI may say that even should the Department approve of the purchase of power from the East Kootenay Power Co. Ltd., which I think is desirable, and would in the long run be much more economical than to continue purchasing expensive equipment to develop power at the Kootenay School, it is unlikely that funds could be made available until the 1946-47 fiscal year and in any case it would take considerable time to complete negotiations with the Department of Transport and the East Kootenay Power Co. Ltd. The first move, of course, would be for the Department to approach the Department of Transport in the matter and secure their consent to the use of their transmission line and transformer supplying it, which equipment is owned by that Department.\n\nIn the meantime provision should be made to keep the existing plant in operation. The old Otto engine and the present set of batteries cannot be relied on for any length of time and consequently it will likely be necessary to purchase new batteries and have the Lister engine repaired.\n\nI am satisfied that the only permanent solution for the trouble at Cranbrook will be to procure our power requirements from the East Kootenay Power Co. Ltd., and any arrangement we make now to put the existing plant in good condition can, after all, be only regarded as a temporary measure.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, January 7, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I note you feel that we should arrange to secure power from the East Kootenay Power Company but that, as you point out in your letter, the negotiations may be lengthy, even if we decide to do this.

However, while there was sufficient paint for the job, we had to get more Mineral Spirits.\n\nAlso as the work called for painting the main Roof we did not allow for the other work that was done and which the Authorities in charge expected was to have been done. However our Painter completed the whole work before it was taken up with us and as it was also badly needed as well as the main roof. We, of course, hadn't your authority to do this and will therefore appreciate it very much if you can also cover this expense.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPatmore Bros.\n\nPer:- G.W.P.\nCranbrook, B. C.,\nJanuary 18, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Voucher No. 250, $97.70,\nfor Patmore Bros.\n\nYou will remember that the enclosed voucher was discussed with you at the time of your visit in this Agency.\n\nThis account was held back because the tower on the school was not painted and the painters were waiting for good weather to complete it. As the weather remained cold, the work was not done, however, Father Kelly has agreed to have the school staff do the work next summer.\n\nWith reference to the 20 gallons of Mineral Spirits to complete the paint work, this was authorized by this office so as to allow the work to go on and I would recommend that it be paid.\n\nThe balance of $77.70 to paint chapel, etc. was not authorized, nor even mentioned till later. Purchase Order #19563-A authorized painting of the main roof of the school at Mr. Patmore's quotation of $305.00. This was understood to include the chapel roof, woodshed roofs, and basement entrance roofs, which are part of the main building and the work was done without the question being raised. However, Mr. Patmore, who sublet the contract, claimed he had\n\n(over)\nunderbid and asked $77.70 for extra work.\n\nI understand that Mr. Patmore has done very well on previous work at the school, and he did not lose money on this work since he admitted paying $300.00 to the painters for this work, leaving him only $5.00 profit.\n\nAs you stated that it is the usual practice to allow 10% profit on contracts, you might consider recommending to the Department that Mr. Patmore receive a $25.00 adjustment on his $77.70 claim. I feel confident that Mr. Patmore would be satisfied.\n\nJ. M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Acting Agent Barre's letter of January 15th and Kootenay Agency voucher No. 250 in the amount of $97.70 in favour of Patmore Brothers in connection with the painting of the roof of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Patmore Brothers, in their quotation of June 7th, undertook to paint the main roof of the building and it would appear reasonable to suppose that the quotation did not cover painting of the chapel roof, woodshed roofs, and basement entrance roofs. However as Mr. Patmore apparently would be satisfied to receive $20.00 for the Mineral Spirits supplied and $25.00 for the additional labour, I would recommend that the account be taxed at $45.00 and passed for payment.\n\nI may say that the last paragraph of Mr. Barre's letter is incorrect as no such statement was made.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclos.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nJanuary 29, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Boys,\nIndian Agent\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Boys:\n\nI find it necessary to take up with you the difficulties we have been encountering during the past few months with the water pump in this school.\n\nSince November of '45 we have had three serious breakdowns including the present one. I am advised by Mr. Hayden of Patmore Bros. and Mr. Knight of Cranbrook Auto Wreckers that it is beyond repair and so we have on our hands a serious emergency.\n\nBefore giving what information I have regarding it I would like to point out that the light, heat, and water facilities of this school all directly depend on the proper functioning of this pump. This is so because the engine used to operate the generator necessitates a constant stream of water passing through its cooling system during operation. The heating system is hot water and hence the water pressure must be maintained or else the furnace will be burned out. As the pump in question is both a suction and pressure pump we have to depend upon it for drawing the water from the 5000 gallon reservoir and maintaining it under pressure in the pressure tank. Hence you will see the predicament we are in when it fails us.\n\nOur most serious breakdown was on Saturday November 24th. From Saturday morning until Monday afternoon we had neither water, light, or heat. With the temperature below freezing that is a serious matter. We had the necessary repairs made at our own expense. The base of the water chamber was found to be so deteriorated with rust that it was\nalmost impossible to weld it. However I had hoped that it would last until time for the yearly requisitions at which time I intended to mention it. As the matter of installing more satisfactory lighting equipment was on hand at the time of the breakdown I preferred to delay the question of a new pump until later. Since then we have had two more breakdowns and our present position is desperate. It is found that two of the pistons are cracked thus rendering it impossible to insert the packing so as to prevent water escaping. At the present time one of the pistons is entirely out of order and the water pumped by the other two escapes through the third and pressure cannot be raised or maintained.\n\nThe local firms mentioned above both say that this is the original pump installed in the school when it was built in 1912. I cannot find here any record of its installation but there is probably a reference to it in the Vancouver Office. If, as I am told, it has been operating since 1912, some thirty years, it is not surprising that it has ceased to function.\n\nA name plate on its side gives the following information. Manufactured by Goulds of Seneca Lake, N.Y., and supplied to Fairbanks Morse Ltd. with offices in Vancouver and Winnipeg. There is no indication as to its capacity but Mr. Hayden of Patmore Bros. estimated its capacity at 2000 gallons per hour. It is manually controlled, belt driven from a 7 H.P. Petters Diesel Engine. It draws the water approximately a quarter of a mile and raises it not more than 15 feet in that distance. The water is drawn through a 3'' pipe. Its action is by three pistons, 5'' in diameter and 18'' in length, mounted on a crankshaft. Each piston has a separate intake and exhaust valve.\nDue to its antiquity and the lack of records here that is about the sum total of the information I can supply regarding it. On the matter of its urgency I do not feel that I can say too much and the facts are here to back up what I say. Were it possible to do so I would gladly wait until the annual requisition for supplies and equipment but the present situation is an emergency. I have enquired locally as to the possibility of renting or borrowing a pump to keep us going until a new one could be shipped in but none of the local firms carry equipment sufficiently heavy to meet our needs.\n\nI trust you will understand the seriousness of this situation and give us your immediate cooperation in the matter.\n\nAssuring you of our constant support and loyalty in the cause for which we are working, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly,\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.C.\nJanuary 30, 1946\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find copy of a letter from Reverend Father Kelly concerning the water pump at the Kootenay Indian School.\n\nI cannot overemphasize the urgent need of this replacement for, as Father Kelly states, both the lighting and heating systems of the school are dependent upon the pump. To this I might add that with the soft water supply no longer functioning (file 0-ll-5, June 8th, 1945) this system offers the only fire protection at present.\n\nFor the past few weeks the pump has been doing a fairly satisfactory job on two cylinders only, but its condition is deteriorating fast.\n\nI note Mr. Hayden's estimate of the pump's capacity at 2000 G.P.H., but with the following specifications I find the capacity is 10,300 gallons per hour if each cylinder fills once with one revolution of the crankshaft.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n7 h.p. Petters\n650 R.P.M.\nDrive Wheel 9\"\n\nWheel 26\"\nCylinder bore 5\"\nStroke 6\"\n\nEngine\n\nPump\n\n(over)\nI submit these specifications in the hope that you may see fit to purchase a pump in Vancouver in view of the serious consequences to the school of a complete breakdown of this unit.\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJVB/DD\nEnc1.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of January 30th and copy of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Kootenay Residential School in connection with the water pump at the school. It will be noted that the school relies entirely upon this one pump for the domestic water supply and operation of the heating plant and for fire protection and that in its present condition it is liable to break down at any moment which would necessitate closing the school.\n\nI have been in contact with Fairbanks-Morse Ltd., in Vancouver who advise that they have in stock a Fairbanks Morse \"Typhoon\" plunger type pump, Model 2240, with a capacity of 2500 gallons per hour at 215 R.F.M., at a cost of $226.50. As far as I am aware this is the only suitable pump available in the city at the present time and I would request that you wire authority for the purchase of this equipment.\n\nD. M.

I will endeavour to follow your advice in making up our next quarterly reports and henceforward.\n\nI appreciate your allowance of supernumerary grant for the extra pupils we have at this school. In undertaking some minor repairs and improvements which I felt were urgent as well as purchasing some winter sports equipment, such as toboggans, ski-suits for the girls, and hockey gear, I have incurred a few expenses which the added grant will take care of very conveniently. I feel very keenly the need here for more sports, pro-rec., and P.T. training as I am a great believer in keeping them busy. A great deal of the indolence and lack of initiative which we see on the part of the young men who have graduated from here in past years seems to me to point to a lack of organized sport and recreational facilities. I do hope that we will be able to continue developing our school along these lines.\n\nDuring the months which have passed since September we have seen some very good improvements in our plumbing. Much of the work that was requisitioned has been completed and some is still in progress. We are still lacking repairs to the flush-action toilets but I understand this is unavoidable as the parts cannot be obtained. I hope they will be able to get them before next month or else that the allowance for the work can be extended.\n\nI hope some progress is being made in the matter of more adequate power. Some months ago I reported on the need of the Kootenay Power to replace our present set-up. I have read with great interest all the correspondence of the past years regarding this question and besides being a source of constant conflict between the Principals and the Dept. I would judge that it has been a very expensive affair. What has been spent in the past ten or fifteen years on batteries, the Lister Engine, the generators, and the old Otto gas engine would go far in installing proper A.C. current. And in spite of all the expenses we stand today in a very precarious position not knowing from one hour to another whether or not we will have light. From the school one can see the Kootenay Power line crossing at the end of our farm and still we are denied the benefits of its use. Coupling that with all we are hearing about rural electrification from both the provincial and federal govts. one can only conclude that here is a first class opportunity.\nto put into action a program which would not only interest the rest of the community in electrification but would also be, in a matter of a few years, a definite saving to your Dept.\n\nDuring Major McKay's recent visit he promised to urge this matter to the best of his ability. While I know such an installation can't come overnight I hope it has not just been filed and forgotten. Why should the equipment of this school be the laughing stock of every repair-shop in town? They all think it a great joke that so much has been spent here on Diesel and gas engines and still we are in never-ending trouble. Their attitude to the equipment is extended to the whole school program, and while we should have an institution that would merit the admiration of the community, we have instead one, which, like our Indians themselves, is only tolerated.\n\nThere is no need for such a condition. We have the opportunity here to give these children an education and training which will elevate them to their rightful position in life. I have pledged myself to this task and take my word for it, Mr. Phalen, I will see it through. Give us the cooperation we need and we will give in return a school at which no man can point his finger and say it is inefficient.\n\nThere is a great scope here for development. These children need not only class training but vocational guidance in agriculture, carpentry, and the trades. This is an extensive program and it will take time, but already we are getting it under way and I assure you that when you again have an opportunity to visit us we will show you that our purpose has not been in vain.\n\nI have had the good fortune of employing a farm instructor who has had experience at other schools of the Dept. and the deplorable conditions spoken of in Mr. Coleman's recent report are being gradually but definitely converted. We are making use of the services of the National Film Board to give scope to our education and I intend in the near future to petition the Dept. to supply us with a projector of our own so that we may more extensively use this modern and practical means of education. I have delayed asking for it in the hope that we would have the Kootenay Power to operate it instead of another individual power plant such as is used in rural areas.\n\nTo return for a moment to the matter of the pupilage grant. Some months ago I sent a request that our pupilage be raised. As you know we are at present over our pupilage allowance. While we appreciate the supernumerary grant I feel we could accommodate more children. With certain minor adjustments in dormitory space, which I have discussed with the Indian Agent, we could accommodate up to one hundred and ten. As you know one of the big drawbacks here for a number of years to any program of improvement, even to the maintenance of a qualified staff,\nhas been financial embarrassment. The added grant for fifteen or twenty pupils would give us encouragement to make our school what we would like to have it.\n\nWhen building material becomes more available I hope to draft plans for a recreational centre that will give us some opportunity for training. A recreational hall 27' x 30' is hardly adequate for the pent up energy of forty-five or fifty boys. There is a tendency to kick the walls out. We have no gymnasium and hence cannot have basketball, badminton, boxing or wrestling. As a result we have a group of round-shouldered, under-developed, and effeminate looking boys instead of the type of young manhood we like to see.\n\nA few weeks ago we had to put in a request for a new water pump. I don't know whether or not that request reached you in Ottawa but if it did be assured that it is genuine and urgent. We have had a series of breakdowns during the fall and winter and some expensive repairs made by local firms. They all say the same. It is worn out and finished. I had hoped that it would last until the end of the school year but right now we cannot get pressure up and it is only working spasmodically. I have been expecting to hear from Major McKay on it. It is the original pump supplied to the school in 1912 so it is not surprising that it is giving trouble. If it comes to your hand please help us out.\n\nI hope I will see the day when these material concerns are put in order so that we can settle down to the real business of conducting the school program. To date I have spent more time either working with the engineer trying to keep things in operation or seeking repairs in Cranbrook than I have in attending to the proper concern of a principal. I know you are not to blame for such a condition but anything you can do to help remedy it will be appreciated. In return we will try to give the best of our ability and time to the work on hand.\n\nPlease excuse the length to which this has developed. Be assured of our cooperation and accept our sincere thanks for favours received.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.

The parts ordered from General Steel Wares appear to have been for the Kootenay Residential School. Probably the other items on the account are also for the Kootenay Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nGENERAL STEEL WARES LIMITED\n\nP.O. BOX 248\nMONTREAL January 26th 1946\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe list hereunder items outstanding in your account to the end of November:\n\nOctober 5th invoice, 7J3959, $4.84. This covered a shipment of repair parts for a Navy range to J.M. Barre, Acting Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C., as per your order No. 2393.\n\nNovember 20th, 7L129, $130.62. This covered a shipment of a 25-45 R electric range to Mr. C.H. Johnston, Indian Agent, Little Current, as per your order No. 5823.\n\nWe would appreciate very much if you would check up on these items and advise if they have been passed for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGENERAL STEEL WARES LIMITED\n\nCredit Division\n\nFJM/IB\nCranbrook, B.C.\nFebruary 5, 1946\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 29th, file 21-155, I have examined the new range at the Kootenay Residential School and I find that all the parts enumerated in the invoice from General Steel Wares Ltd. dated October 5th, 1945 have been received and installed. Judging from Mr. Barre's letter of January 19th, he was under the impression that each of the items in the invoice formed a different parcel, of which only one had been received. Actually all parts were in the parcel upon which freight charges were vouchered on October 30th. (Voucher No. 234)\n\nI note an item in this voucher for C.O.D. charges $1.85 and I cannot reconcile this item with General Steel Wares' invoice for $4.84 for these parts. Perhaps an explanation of this item might be sought from the C.P.R., Vancouver, and for this reason I am sending a copy of this letter to the Commissioner. Meanwhile I am withholding presentation of voucher for General Steel Wares' account.\n\nThe range is now operating well and the only part not received is the water jacket. This is not required because a more satisfactory coil system is being used for hot water supply, but I mention it in case this part was paid for in the original voucher, in which case a refund would be receivable.\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 19, 1946.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the situation at the Kootenay School.\n\nYou refer in your letter to the matter of more adequate power for the school. Our information is that it would cost in the neighborhood of $7,500.00 to connect the school with the East Kootenay Power Company, and further, that the scheme would be contingent upon the Department being able to make arrangements with the Department of Transport and we would also be required to accept responsibility for the maintenance of the line. You will realize that this is a very heavy expenditure, and in view of the many demands upon our appropriation, it is simply impossible for us to consider it at the present time. However, on the recommendation of Commissioner MacKay, we have requested our Purchasing Branch to secure a new set of batteries.\n\nI was interested in noting the many improvements that you have made and intend to make at this school, and I trust that one of these improvements is the employment of an engineer who will properly look after the mechanical plant. While you are in no way responsible, the correspondence that we have received during recent years indicates that much of the trouble at the Kootenay School with the mechanical plant has been caused by the engineer in charge not having the necessary ability to handle the plant properly. This statement is further instanced by the necessity for supplying new batteries at this time. The last set of batteries was supplied in 1941 and ordinarily should last for seven years. As a matter of fact, at schools where batteries are properly cared for, they have lasted longer than the term mentioned.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay was authorized, in\n\nRev. Gerald Kelly, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nofficial letter of February 9, to purchase a Fairbanks-Morse Typhoon pump.\n\nWe will continue in the future, as in the past, to give you every possible support insofar as our appropriation will permit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 19, 1946.\n\nMr. J. V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the parts supplied for the new range at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nI note that the parts shown on the enclosed account from General Steel Wares have been received. Consequently, I cannot see why a voucher should not be issued in favour of the firm.\n\nAs regards the charge of $1.85 for freight, the information on our file indicates that these parts were shipped from Montreal to Vancouver in a pool car and consequently the charge of $1.85 is the share of the transportation payable on our parcel of parts.\n\nVoucher No. 234 for $4.33, issued on October 30, 1945, by the former Acting Agent, J. M. Barre, covers the cost of transportation of the parts from Vancouver to Cranbrook and is a different item altogether from the $1.85 charge. I think a separate voucher for $1.50 should be issued in favour of G. H. Cottrell, Limited, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nCOPY OF PURCHASE ORDER 8538\n\nWMV/GG\n\nFeb.18/46 62899-15-16\n\nGlobe Batteries Ltd., 146 Alexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nJ.

Kelly, Principal, Kootenay Indian School, for payment of wages to a night watchman at the school.\n\nFather Kelly points out the need for a night watchman in an establishment entirely dependent upon chemical fire-fighting equipment.\n\nStarting with the month of November 1945, Father Kelly has employed a Mr. Martin Gabor at a salary of $60.00 per month plus board, and he asks that the Department render whatever financial assistance is possible toward this. In explanation of the fact that no account has been rendered earlier, Father Kelly says that he wished to assure himself that Mr. Gabor would prove satisfactory and would stay.\n\nI may say that I have spoken to Mr. Gabor and that he looks after the firing of the furnace at night in addition to his watching duties.\n\nJVB/DD\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter dated February 18th from Mr. Indian Agent Boys in connection with the proposed employment of a night watchman at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I am not aware of the Department's policy in connection with the employment of night watchmen, but it would appear to me that a watchman would be considered an employee of the school staff and consequently his salary should be paid from school funds. It would be appreciated if I might have the Department's views in this connection.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the request made by the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School for a grant towards the salary of a night watchman. As you know we have been allowing for several years a grant towards the salary of a night watchman at schools where it was considered a special fire hazard existed. In the Province of British Columbia we are allowing special grant at Cariboo, Christie and St. Mary's Residential Schools. This grant varies from $35.00 to $40.00 monthly for a period of five to six months during the winter season. Possibly, a similar grant should be made at the Kootenay school. However, it is noted that Mr. Gabor is also fireman at the school, consequently, would have to be employed in any case.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| CAT NO. | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                        | PRICE | EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | AMOUNT |\n|---------|----------|------------------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| 48801   | 1 X      | WOOD BRICK PAN (IN TWO PIECES)     | PL 15 | 2 20      | 2 20     |        |\n|         |          |                                    |       |           |          |        |\n| 96021   | PLUS 8%  | SALES TAX                          |       |           |          |        |\n\n**REPAIR PARTS FOR 223-1 WOOD**\n\n**WOOD BURNING NAVY RANGE**\n\n| CAT NO. | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION            | PRICE | EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | AMOUNT |\n|---------|----------|------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| 1 X     | WOOD GRATE | PL 10\u00bd                | 1 50  | 1 50      |          |        |\n| 1 X     | WOOD GRATE FRAME | PL 1\u00bc               | 1 50  | 1 50      |          |        |\n| 1 X     | WOOD GRATE CAP | PL 1                 | 40    |           |          |        |\n\n**TOTAL**\n\n| AMOUNT |\n|--------|\n| 5 60   |\n| 20%    |\n| 4 48   |\n\n**TO INSURE RECEIVING PROMPT CREDIT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU OBTAIN OUR PERMISSION BEFORE RETURNING ANY GOODS.**\n\nBE SURE TO QUOTE REGISTER NUMBER SHOWN ABOVE WHEN WRITING REGARDING ANY SUCH RETURNS.\n\nCLAIMS FOR SHORTAGE MUST BE MADE WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIPT OF GOODS.

The Lister engine is at present in Vancouver being overhauled and it will not likely be completed for a week or ten days. Contrary to previous information supplied, the Petter's engine is not in operating condition, apparently requiring a new fuel pump which is not obtainable at the present time so far as is known. I have been in communication with the B.C. Equipment Company in Vancouver who advised that it was likely they could repair the Petter's engine fuel pump and I therefore wired the Indian Agent to forward the pump to Vancouver.\n\nMr. Boys is investigating the possibility of hiring an engine locally and attempts are being made to utilise a steam pump to pump the water.\n\nI shall advise you on receipt of any further information and in the meantime would request that action be taken to supply the new batteries required as soon as possible and that authority be granted to overhaul the 4 kw. generator referred to.\n\nD.

We are preparing a voucher here for the amount due\nthe school for the period November 1, 1945, to February 28,\n1946.

The pupils are making rapid progress in their classroom studies, domestic science, and manual training. The tubercular patients have shown very satisfactory improvements. There has been little or no sickness in school during this quarter except for five cases of measles, one reported on December 17th and four on December 29th. Antimesas serum was used on the contacts and it is hoped that this epidemic will reach no great proportions. The pupils are well nourished and their health is carefully looked after by Sister Marion Clare. The pupils were vaccinated against smallpox, and will be vaccinated against typhoid as soon as the measles is over. The school is well supplied with milk, eggs, vegetables and fruit.\n\nThis school carries eight pupils in excess of its quota. Three Auld children, who do not belong to the reserves, will be returned home as soon as the quarantine on measles permits; however, this still leaves us short of space for twelve pupils from the Columbia lake and Shuswap Reserves who should be returned to school, not only for their own good but as a matter of discipline. This matter has been referred to the Department and I am awaiting a reply before taking any action.\n\nThe fire extinguishers requisitioned for the school were finally received, and fire drills are held as per regulations. One unscheduled rehearsal was held at 5:00 o'clock last morning when the new fireman and night watchman inadvertently pulled the fire alarm. This proved to be a good and successful fire drill. In addition to the night watchman and fireman, Rev. Father Kelly has hired a new farm manager, who has good recommendations.\n\nOn my last inspection it was noted that good work had been done in reconditioning the girls play room, several chairs having successfully been re-upholstered with bright materials. Kindergarten tables and temporary chairs as well as other objects have been fashioned in the Manual Training department. The domestic science department does excellent work in cooking under the direction of Sister John Anthony and Sister Catherine Mary's sewing classes produced very good work. The pantry and hallway near the father's dining room has also been redecorated.\n\nThe situation with reference to the plumbing at the school is still bad, even though some of the toilets were temporarily repaired, flush actions, etc., are so far unobtainable. One urinal near the boys dormitory was put in working order and all taps were replaced.\nThe situation with regard to power is worse, the Lister engine has not been in operation since it was repaired, having run only for two weeks; the Peters engine, which is used to pump water, recently broke down, the fuel jets being gone. It is now undergoing emergency repairs. This leaves us entirely dependent on an old Otto engine which through Father Kelly's ingenuity was \"rigged up\" to pump water. This engine consumes gasoline at the rate of nearly a gallon per hour! So that between pumping water and charging batteries which will not hold their charge, it is pounding away from morn till dark. The Peters engine should be repaired in two or three days but the present situation emphasizes the gravity of the situation with reference to the electric generating plant as this school. At my request, Mr. John Ward of the Modern Electric recently submitted a report on this situation and copies of it were forwarded to the Commissioner's office. The water pump has recently caused quite a bit of anxiety, it was leaking so badly that it had to be primed before each pump. It is a very ancient and heavy contraption and it is feared that the base is so corroded that it may give out altogether for the time being it has been packed with oakum, but it may become necessary to call in a welder to weld on a new base.\n\nAs a result of Commissioner MacKay's visit, authority was granted to install a new sink unit near the children's dining room. This will prove to be more sanitary and a great improvement for which we feel very grateful.\n\nRev. Father Kelly has given sporting activities more meaning in this school and he has recently purchased skates and toboggans which the children are enjoying.\n\nJ.M.

I would earnestly ask the Department's\nconsideration of this project in the near future on\nthe grounds both of good economy and efficiency.\n\nunsuspected talent was discovered in the pupils\nof both sexes by the Principal when he initiated their\ntraining for concerts to be given on special occasions.\nIn the first, at Christmas, the performers were some-\nwhat self-conscious, but this was completely absent\nwhen on St. Patrick's Day an excellent program was\nenjoyed by a large crowd.\n\nThere are further improvements to be seen on\nevery visit to the school not only in the building\nand furnishings, but, inside out of school. The\nPrincipal, Father G. F. Kelly, has worked untiringly\ntoward a more attractive life for his charges. Under\nhis direction the Kootenay Indian School promises to\nrank beside any in British Columbia.\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nWelfare & Training:\n\nAt the Kootenay Indian School continued progress is being made both in and out of the classroom. The children are well cared for and have an excellent record of health. A number of replacements have been procured for worn out beds in both the boys' and girls' dormitories. A program of cleaning and painting in the lavatories and several changes in plumbing have made for better hygiene, but a continued project for redecoration of the basement passage ways is urgently needed, because it was found impossible to procure replacement parts, the toilets on both sides of the school are still awaiting repairs to seats and flush actions.\n\nThe school is carrying several pupils above its dormitory quota, but more pupils could be accommodated comfortably if some small low-cost changes were effected. This would make possible acceptance of a number of school age children from Columbia Lake and Shuswap reserves upon whose parents pressure is being applied to have them send their children to school.\n\nMuch trouble has been experienced in recent weeks with lighting and pumping equipment at the school. A series of breakdowns has necessitated repairs to all three power units, overhaul of the emergency 4 k.w. three generator, replacement of water pump and batteries, at considerable cost to the Department and to the discomfort and inconvenience to the residents of the school. The Principal and many of the staff laboured for days with some outside help to restore services to normal. From time to time representations have been made to the Department to have an installation made, connecting the school to the east Kootenay Power Line some two miles distant. Though the initial cost is large, so too has been the cost of upkeep of the school's present, inadequate power, electrical and water equipment over the\nCranbrook, B. C.\nMay 15th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find two copies of a letter from Reverend Father Kelly, Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, enclosing estimates of cost of making structural alterations at the school to two balconies, with a view to taking them into use as preventoriums. At present this space is quite useless since it is not heated, and open to the weather. With its enclosure by fitting of windows and with installation of radiators these two light, well ventilated balconies would make ideal preventorium space. On the upper floor in the front of the building, they face East, catching the morning sunshine, and protected from the prevailing South West winds. Utilization of this space would release two good sized rooms for junior dormitories and make possible enrollment of several school-age children from reserves in this area who cannot at present be accommodated. I enclose a rough sketch of the rooms affected (not to scale). In this connection I may say that I have been unable to find any plans of the school building in the files of this office and I would ask that a set of floor plans be made available to me in order to facilitate discussion of such matters as this in future.\n\nEstimates are as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Windows (10)          | $148.00|\n| Flooring (600 ft)     | $38.70 |\n|                       | $186.70|\n| Plumbing              | $120.00|\n| Paint (approx. 6 gallons) | $30.00 |\n|                       | $356.70|\n\nYou will note that apart from the plumbing, the manual training class would do the work.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nMay 1st, 1946.\n\nMr. J. V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Boys:\n\nYou will remember since your recent visitation of the school my calling to your attention the matter of utilizing the two balconies on the second floor of the school for extra dormitory or preventorium space with certain alterations being made. I believe this matter was desired by the former Principal and during the visit of Major MacKay last autumn I pointed out the possibilities of using this space which at present is practically useless.\n\nI have procured the attached quotations on the necessary work and considering the asset that this space would be to us I think the estimates very reasonable. The fitting of the windows and the laying of the floor will be done by the manual training class under their director.\n\nTo the attached quotations should be added an allowance for painting or rather for the purchase of paint for these two rooms, the work in this case also being done by the class. It will take about fifteen dollars worth of paint for the ceiling, walls and floor of each room, that is, thirty dollars worth in all. It would be well if this could be allowed for on the same quotation.\n\nIf further information on this or a sketch of the plan is needed I will gladly furnish the same.\n\nTrusting this will be found satisfactory.\n\nI remain, Sincerely yours,\n\n(signed) G.F. Kelly,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of May 18th and copy of a letter from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School in connection with proposed structural alterations to the two second floor balconies on the east side of the building with a view to providing further dormitory accommodation. I concur in the views expressed by the agent and Principal and would recommend that the Department authorize an expenditure of $336.70 for this purpose.\n\nD. M.

Some welding has been done, making it possible, with frequent spells of pumping, to maintain a supply of water. But, for safety's sake, it has been deemed prudent to send for a safety valve to be installed in the pumping system to obviate danger of explosion in the tank, which remains uncovered.\n\nA new tank will have to be built to specifications with tappings as shown in the attached sketch. The present tank 5' x 36' is of approximately 2830 gallons capacity. Mr. Draper is of the opinion that a new tank of 5' diameter or 2000 gallons capacity would be quite large enough. It is proposed to leave the old tank in the ground, fill it with earth and set the new tank on top of it, bringing it endwise so that its end is flush with the inside of the concrete wall of the engine room. In this manner the manhole and water guage would be available from within the engine room itself and a complicated piping system would be eliminated. It would\nstill be covered by a sufficient depth of soil that there would be no danger of freezing.\n\nThis letter is submitted in duplicate to facilitate explanation to the Department. It is hoped that the order may be filled with despatch because of the uncertainty of the temporary repairs.\n\nJVB/DD\nEncls.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCranbrook, B.

At present only one end is fully uncovered, but this shows severe rusting around the rivet holes. On examination, several welding experts express their opinions that possibility of making a permanent repair is unlikely.\n\nI shall report further when the full extent of the trouble is known, but it seems not improbable that we shall be faced with the expense of a replacement.\n\nJVB/DD\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letters of May 23rd and 27th in connection with the water pressure tank at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted that the tank is rusted around the seams and around the rivet holes and will likely have to be replaced. Mr. Boys' suggestion with respect to the installation of a new tank will be noted but it is considered that, before any action is taken, the matter should be the subject of an investigation by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and I would suggest that the Department arrange for such an inspection at an early date.\n\nJUN 11 1946\n\nM.

On examination, several welding experts express their opinions that possibility of making a permanent repair is unlikely.\n\nMr. Draper of Pioneer Motors experienced in pressure tanks, and formerly engaged in the construction of submarines, informs me that a replacement is absolutely necessary, in which opinion Mr. Hayden, of Patmore Bros., concurs.\n\nThe old tank is rusted around its seams and around the rivet holes. Some welding has been done, making it possible, with frequent spells of pumping, to maintain a supply of water. But, for safety's sake, it has been deemed prudent to send for a safety valve to be installed in the pumping system to obviate danger of explosion in the tank, which remains uncovered.\n\nThe present tank 5' x 36' is of approximately 2830 gallons capacity. Mr. Draper is of the opinion that a new tank of 5' diameter of 2000 gallons capacity would be quite large enough. It is proposed to leave the old tank in the ground, fill it with earth and set the new tank on top of it, bringing it endwise so that its end is flush with the inside of the concrete wall of the engine room. In this manner the manhole and water gauge would be available from within the engine room itself and a complicated piping system would be eliminated. It would still be covered by a sufficient depth of soil that there would be no danger of freezing.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of June 12th and enclosures referred to therein in connection with the proposed remodelling of the cow barn at the Kootenay Indian Residential School at an estimated cost of $1065.56.\n\nIn view of the large expenditures already incurred by the Department at the Kootenay Indian Residential School this year for repairs to the lighting plants and the anticipated expenditures in connection with the water pressure tank, it is not thought that funds for remodelling the barn will be available. Until we have information regarding this point there would appear to be no object in investigating this matter further with a view to determining whether this proposal would rate priority over other requirements such as adequate fire protection at the school. Possibly Mr. Phelan may wish to discuss this matter with the Indian Commissioner who is at present in Ottawa.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCranbrook, B.

C.\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian School,\nAlterations to Cow Barn\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Rev. G. F. Kelly, Principal, Kootenay Indian School, which is self explanatory. Also enclosed is a quotation from McLennan McFeely & Prior Limited, Vancouver, on cost of remodelling the cow barn referred to in Father Kelly's letter. I have prepared a rough sketch of the barn as it would be when completed. I fully endorse Father Kelly's remarks as to the inadequacy of the present arrangements and recommend the changes as submitted.\n\nYou will note that in their quotation Mc & Mc have submitted a total figure for all the required equipment of $1065.56 FOB Vancouver. I have written the Company asking them to break this figure down, itemizing their quotation and I shall forward a copy of their letter when received.\n\nI trust that this project may have the Department's favourable consideration.\n\nJVB/DD\nEncls.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, File 884-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. J.V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Boys:\n\nMr. Coleman's report of last year found our dairy barn here in very poor condition and he urged that something be done to improve it. During Major McKay's visit last autumn he directed me to do some necessary work to bring our barn up to modern standards in equipment and layout. Due to shortage of material it has taken sometime to get the Beatty Bros. even to give me an estimate on these alterations but I was pleased to receive recently the enclosed quotation.\n\nThe installation of this equipment would give us the opportunity to attend to our dairy cattle as they should be attended to and at the same time teach our boys modern, sanitary, and efficient care of stock. As you know from your own inspection the present state of the barn leaves much to be desired and an agricultural program of any worth must have as a foundation the proper care of stock. With a properly equipped barn we can give our boys a good grounding in this but in its present state we are greatly handicapped.\n\nI trust you will do all you can to help us in this worthy project as you have done in others and recommend to the Dept. that these improvements be made without further delay. Assuring you of our continued cooperation,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly\nPrincipal.\nAIR MAIL\n\nJune 24, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.

The end of the tank nearest the building was exposed for a length of some 8 feet.\n\nThe tank was installed in 1913; is badly rusted around the rivets and seams and has been leaking. Efforts to stop these leaks by welding were not successful due to the age and condition of the metal.\n\nI would recommend that:\n\n(a) The old tank be removed entirely from the excavation.\n(b) That a new tank, 5'-0\" in diameter by 25'-0\" long, of sufficient thickness of metal to stand a working pressure of 100 p.s.i., be installed on the same bed as was occupied by the old tank, except that the end of the tank nearest the building and containing a manhole, 3\" holes for pipe connections at top and bottom of the manhole end, and 1\u00bc\" holes for air volume control and gauge glasses, be moved into the boiler-room through a hole to be cut in the boiler-room wall so that after the tank is in place and the wall cemented up, the end of the tank mentioned above will project at least 6\" into the boiler-room with a clearance between the bottom of the tank and the boiler-room floor of 9\".\n\nThis tank is to be painted with a suitable rust-preventive coating.\n\nThis tank will have a 2100 Imperial Gallon water capacity between a maximum of 100 p.s.i. and a minimum of 20 p.s.i.\n\nESTIMATE OF COST\n\n1. Removal of old tank $200.00\n2. New tank 5' x 25' F.O.B. Cranbrook, B.C. (tax included) $1,600.00\n3. Hauling, placing and covering new tank $250.00\n4. Plumbing and connections $150.00\n5.

Father Kelly re above.\n\nDuring a visit to the Residential School I inspected the tank in question and am in agreement with Father Kelly that the water supply will be unsatisfactory when school opens on Sept. 3rd. Keeping sufficient water pressure requires constant attention and in the event the old tank fails it would create a major hazard as to sanitary conditions.\n\nDue to the position of this tank and the major excavation problem of its replacement, I consider it advisable to complete work on this project before the Fall frosts set in.\n\nI wish at this time to recommend the installation of an automatic air compressor with this unit; the present manually-operated compressor is unsatisfactory in that there is a tendency on the part of the operator to overcharge the tank with air on one hand and in the course of his many duties allow the pressure to fall below a desired point.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nAugust 14th, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Dunn,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nI felt it my duty to request you to point out again to the proper authority, the urgent necessity of the replacement of the water pressure tank in this School. I know that materials and labour are scarce, but this question has been open since early in the month of June and replacement was to be made during the summer vacation. With the opening of the School only nineteen days away our situation is very serious.\n\nThe maintaining of pressure in the present condemned tank with a manually-operated hand pump is almost impossible. I don't need to go into details regarding the difficulty of operating the School without water. That is self-evident.\n\nAnything you can do to convince the suppliers of the urgency of this matter will surely be appreciated by us.\n\nAssuring you of our continued co-operation,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"G. F. KELLY\" O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 23 September 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School\n\nWe have your memorandum of Sept. 13th in connection with the new pressure tank required at this school. We have no objection to making the operation of this pressure tank automatic.\n\nIn connection with the pressure tank we would refer you to your memorandum of July 25th and our reply of August 1st.\n\nDirector\nOTTAWA, 12th September 1946\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Urgent Repairs for Cranbrook School\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe last school which I saw during my British Columbia visit was Cranbrook. This is quite a large establishment, capable of accommodating at least 120 children, although at the present moment, the attendance is not up to that point. In fact there has been a drop from last September's attendance to this year's. This is due in part to some children from Penticton not returning. Of course, there may be a chance and the attendance may yet reach considerably over the hundred.\n\nThe Principal says that he could easily secure children from the district around Mission and wishes to know if this would be acceptable to the Department. As you know, there must be at least 150 children in that part of the country who have no school and who might be glad to attend the one at Cranbrook.\n\nThe general condition of the school is quite good, but like most schools, it requires a good deal of painting. There is one improvement though which must be attended to immediately.\n\nThe pipe which brings soft water to the school must be renewed without any delay. The enclosed sketch shows the distance from the intake to the school, measuring 1650 feet. I am informed that Major McKay recommended its renewal and that at that time, he secured an approximate figure of $3,000 for excavation and necessary equipment. You will notice from the sketch that soft water could be secured from St. Joseph's Creek at a much closer point than the proposed one, but the present line was chosen in\norder to give it sufficient head. In fact, it might be possible by taking it at that particular point, to force it to the roof of the school by gravity. This would create in itself a very appreciable fire protection.\n\nThe water situation, due to the breakage in the soft water line, is so serious that it is damaging all the plumbing in the school and if not attended to in the immediate future, it will force the Department to renew a great many of the fixtures. For instance, the Principal tells me that he has had to replace the kitchen jacket heater three times in the last year.\n\nThis is an improvement which is essential for the proper management of the school and I hope that you will include it in next year's estimates. As prices have gone up considerably since Major McKay had it estimated, it would be better to include the sum of $5,000.00 in the budget.\n\nWhen the school was built, the specifications called for granite staircase for the front of the school but it was poorly set up or laid. It is now in fairly poor condition and should be reset. I believe that $500.00 would take care of this improvement.\n\nThere are other improvements of a minor nature which the Principal will proceed to effect and for which he will send, in due time, accounts to the Department.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 3 October 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo regarding the Kootenay Residential School the authorized pupilage is 100. We have noted your suggestion that this be increased to 120 but we are unable to give any promise that this increase will be allowed.\n\nDuring the current fiscal year, we have authorized the following expenditures at this school:\n\n1. $336.70 for structural alterations to the second floor balconies\n\n2. $500.00 for equipment for the barn.\n\n3. $2,400.00 for installing a new automatic pressure tank. This work is under the direction of the Surveys and Engineering Branch and it is quite possible that it has not yet been completed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Diesel Engine with generator and storage batteries would be of the order of $1,000.\n\nIn this connection however it now appears from information just received regarding the layout of this plant that automatic controls to the 7 H.P. Diesel Engine and Air Compressor would seriously complicate the maintenance and operation of both the water supply and electric power systems.\n\nDiesel engine operation requires frequent attention and inspection by the operator and consequently this engine was not previously equipped with automatic start and stop equipment. Apparently the plant layout was not planned for fully automatic operation and it is felt that the partly automatic air controls...\nwhich it has been intended to install with the new tank will render satisfactory service until such time as electric power at 110/220 Volts is available for pumping.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, including the large expenditure of $1,000 that would be necessary, the proposal to make the water system fully automatic is not recommended.\n\nJ.M.

MacKay, Indian Com.\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Major MacKay;\n\nI am wondering if anything further can be done to impress upon the Engineering Branch the urgency of replacing the water pressure tank at the school here. As you know it burst last Spring and was temporarily repaired for a maximum pressure of sixty pounds. It was subsequently condemned by the Engineer for the Dept. but to date nothing has been done. With the advent of winter the situation is very serious. The tank had to be uncovered in order to repair it and now it is exposed to the frost. Excavating it was a big task as it is fourteen feet under ground. We did the excavation at no small expense without receiving any remuneration from the Dept. I would not mind that if we received any cooperation in its replacement but now it seems as though we will have to fill it in again to protect it from the frost. If I thought it would stir up any action with the engineering branch I would like to leave it exposed and have it burst so that they would be forced to give us some consideration. What would you advise?\n\nAt present in order to keep up pressure we have had to employ a man to start the pump every hour, watch it till it reaches sixty pounds pressure, and then stop the engine. This is a full time occupation from six in the morning till eight at night. When I employed him in Sept. I thought it would be for a week or two till they made an installation but now it has gone on for two months. What about his salary? Don't you think it should be paid by the Dept.?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"G.F.

I tried to point out the importance of these drills and the need of taking a more serious view in this important matter. Those in charge were inclined to treat this form of protection a bit too lightly.\n\nIn general the utilities at this school are inadequate. The water supply is a source of continual worry and requires constant attention in the pumping of a supply and in maintaining the required air pressure. The water itself is very hard and deposits a heavy scale on all heating surfaces cutting their efficiency to a minimum. There is great need for the proposed additional water system from St. Joseph's Creek, this additional water supply as proposed would not only give the necessary fire protection but will provide soft water for the laundry and boilers. The lighting plant at this school is working well, but it is running at capacity most of the day and is definitely overloaded at the peak hours in the evening. The plumbing is in need of attention, authority has been granted for this work to be done, but unfortunately the supplies necessary for this important work are not available.\n\nJ.S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nKootenay Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOctober 5, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI respectfully submit the following report on\nthe general administration of the Kootenay Agency for\nthe quarter ending September 30th, 1946, and have en-\ndeavoured to cover all points of vital interest to the\nwelfare of the Kootenay Indians and the Indian Affairs\nBranch.\n\nWELFARE AND TRAINING\n\nAfter one months operation after the summer\nholidays, the Kootenay Indian Residential School has\nsettled down to an orderly routine. There was considerable\ndelay in the first two weeks of the new term due to the\ntardiness of several of the pupils, with the greatest\ndifficulty occasioned in the rounding up of pupils who\nwere in the U.S.A. with their parents. In general the\nparents have co-operated very well in sending their\nchildren to school, but there remains an undercurrent\nof dislike for the method of education, they object to\nthe method whereby the children spend only one-half of\nthe day in school with the remainder spent in vocational\ntraining or general chores about the school. They also\nobject to their children being away from home for ten\nmonths at a time.\n\nMy first visit to the classrooms in operation\nwas a delightful surprise, the rooms were exceptionally\nbright and cheerful, the pupils neat and tidy with their\nhands clean and their faces shining; the teachers ap-\npeared very efficient and their control of the pupils'\ndepartment very satisfactory. A new plan has been ins-\ntigated this term and the pupils of the two junior\ngrades are receiving full time instruction and their\nteachers are well pleased with this improvement. I am\nnot in a position to say that the curriculum in this\nschool will compare favourably with our city schools,\nbut writing and neatness of the work done in the junior\ngrades particularly would give credit to any school\nand the pupils themselves were very proud of their\nwork.\n\nThe spirit of the classrooms was not so evident\namong the children under vocational training. The parents\nobjection to their children doing chores about the school\nwas reflected in the lackadaisical way in which the chil-\ndren did their respective tasks, and it is unfortunate\nthat this important phase of their training cannot be\nmade more attractive.\n\nJ.S.

The recommendation to defer this work is concurred in. In the event that the present system breaks down before the new tank can be installed a temporary installation as outlined by Mr. Walker could be used.\n\nPlease note that it will be necessary to provide a sum of $850 in the next fiscal year to cover the cost of installing a tank when this work is finally undertaken.\n\nDirector.\nDecember 18, 1946\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nReferring to your notation on a copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs dated November 5th in connection with the installation of a new hydro-pneumatic tank at Kootenay Indian School, Cranbrook, we are now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Walker dated December 12th, duplicate copies of which are attached, together with duplicate copies of a letter from J.

This office wired the Patterson Boiler Works on November 12, asking them to advise us when the pressure tank would be shipped to Cranbrook. They replied on the same day, that they expected to ship the tank on November 18th.\n\n2. On November 12th, I wired C.F. Kelly O.M.I., principal of the Kootenay Indian School, that the Patterson people expected to ship the tank November 18, and requested him to inform me as soon as the tank arrived. A copy of this wire was sent to the Indian Agent at Cranbrook.\n\n3. On November 27th, I wrote to Major D.M. McKay, Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Vancouver, to the effect that the tank had not yet arrived at Cranbrook and that due to the existing weather conditions it would be a difficult and expensive undertaking to throw out the ground, excavate material covering, remove the old tank and install the new one, and that I would strongly recommend that the permanent installation of the tank be deferred until next spring. I stated that if it was imperative that the new tank be connected up as soon as it was delivered to the school, then it might be necessary to (a) place it on the ground surface in a small heated building, or (b) as a cheaper alternative, between wooden retaining walls covered entirely with about two feet of sawdust, roofed over and heated by a small steam pipe through the tank.\n\n4. On December 4th, 1946, Major Mackay, in a letter to this office stated \"With reference to your letter of November 27th, I have been in communication with the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School who is of the opinion that it would be better to carry on with the old tank until spring if possible as it is thought that the cost of installing a new tank under present weather conditions would exceed the cost of maintaining pressure in the present tank. In the event that it is not possible to carry on until spring it is considered that a temporary installation of the new tank could be made.\"\n\n5. I attach hereto a letter from J.S.

Mr. Johnstone of the local B.C. Public Works Department was unable to haul the tank for us due to breakdowns in equipment in attempts to clear the excessive snowfall of last week.\n\nIn conversation with Rev. Father Kelly re possibilities of continuing with the old tank for the remainder of the winter, there appears little likelihood of any local contractor taking on the installation of the new tank at this time. An excavation 30' long by 10' wide and 15' deep at this time of year would be very difficult. There is considerable inconvenience in the matter of pumping water as at present but Father Kelly suggests that providing the old tank holds out they would prefer to carry on with the present installation.\n\nIf the old tank does fail, the new one can be placed in the adjacent garage and temporary fittings connected. I will endeavor, as far as possible, to prepare for such an eventuality and therefore, wish to recommend that due to excessive costs of excavation at this time of year, the matter of installing the new Hydro Pneumatic tank at Kootenay Indian School be deferred until spring with the hope that the old tank does not fail us in the meantime.\n\nSigned: \"J.S.

In support of his application Father Kelly points out that present day trends in residential schools are for the abolition of manual labour and concentration on studies, which would be facilitated if the daily routine of hand milking was done away with. I am inclined to agree with the Reverend Principal and if the Department has funds available I would recommend that the proposal be approved.\n\nD. M.

McKay, Commissioner,\nIndian Affairs,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major McKay:\n\nI have a very serious transportation problem on hand and would like to solicit your advice. As you know we are seven miles from town and there isn't any bus service out here. Our only means of transportation at the present time is a two-ton truck and that is not very convenient for local calls. I am faced with the necessity of buying a car but present finances are on the wrong side of the ledger. If you have seen the auditor's report as made in September '46 we have a deficit of some twenty-seven hundred dollars. Our present position has not improved.\n\nThe attached quotations are in the lower priced field and I would like to present our case to the Dept. for the purchase of such means of transportation as they deem necessary. That we must have some transportation is beyond question. Placed as we are off the main highway we have no mail delivery, no bread delivery or transportation convenience of any kind. There are a number of calls every month with sick children. The expense of calling a taxi for these has become quite an item and I always feel it is an injustice for us to have to pay such expenses from the per capita allowance. Were we in good financial standing it would not be so serious but in our present straightened position it can not be overlooked.\n\nI am not asking that we be allowed travelling expenses such as are granted to Indian Agents. If the Dept. would supply us with the vehicle I\nfeel sure we could meet the expenses of upkeep. However I do hesitate to burden myself with debt by taking on the purchase of it from our present funds.\n\nThere is moreover the question of supplying transportation to the Cranbrook High School for some of our more worthy pupils. If the necessary arrangements can be made with the Dept. I am sure we can have five or six here for next year who would like to continue High School. It seems a pity not to encourage them for we certainly need some intelligent development among these Kootenays. If the Dept. will allow their continuing in residence beyond the age of sixteen we could accommodate them here and transport them to Cranbrook each day for their classes. In the event of this arrangement influencing the purchase, a station wagon would be the more practical.\n\nI will be pleased to have your recommendations on the matter,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter dated January 28th from the Reverend Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, together with enclosures referred to therein in connection with the proposed purchase from appropriation of a Station Wagon or Car for use at the School.\n\nAlthough I am aware that it is not the Department's policy to provide such vehicles from appropriation for Indian education, Father Kelly's letter is forwarded for your consideration. The Principal's suggestion that pupils over the age of sixteen whose academic standing warrants further educational opportunities be permitted to remain in residence at the school and attend the high school in Cranbrook is worthy of consideration and might be considered an argument in favour of the supply of suitable transportation facilities.\n\nD.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n155-0-5 (W.T. 1)\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nFebruary 21, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th, enclosing copy of a letter received from the principal of the Kootenay Residential School, requesting the Department to provide funds for the purchase of a station wagon or car.\n\nAs you are aware, it has not been our practice to supply such equipment to any Indian Residential Schools. Such purchases are always made by the school management from their own funds.\n\nIt is regretted that we cannot make an exception in the case of the Kootenay School. However, in view of Father Kelly's remarks about the High School students, Major Davey might comment further on this situation when he visits this school.\n\nB. F.

Dunn, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nYou will remember from our conversation of last week that I mentioned having trouble with the Petters Diesel Engine which drives the water-pump.\n\nAt that time we had the Diesel mechanic from the Cranbrook Auto Wreckers examine the engine and he sent the fuel pump and injector to the B.C. Equipment Co. in Vancouver. When they were returned the engine still wouldn't operate. Further examination shows the piston, rings, connecting rod, and main-bearing quite worn and in need of re-boring or replacement.\n\nThis work can only be done in Vancouver as the local firms have not the fittings for a Petters engine. It means sending all the engine except the wheels and base to Vancouver. The B.C. Equipment Co. states that it will take from two to three weeks for this re-building. From past experience we may expect that this will be considerably longer.\n\nIn the meantime what are we to do for power to operate the water-pump? The old Otto Gas Engine is not in condition to maintain a supply of water. It was condemned some years back as the expense of repairing it was considered too great. Do you think it feasible to get a small gas engine or a diesel on loan to keep us operating while the Petters is being repaired. I do not need to emphasize that our need is urgent as trying to carry on without a supply of water is a desperate situation.\n\nConsidering the expense that the Petters has incurred during the past and we may trust that the cost of now re-building it will be\nquite considerable, I would like to put in a request for a replacement. At best it is an old engine that has given a number of years of service, just how many years I am not in a position to say because I have been unable to find any record of its installation. I am writing the B.C. Equipment Co. asking for a statement of the estimated cost of repairing it, which estimate I have asked them to submit to you and to Major McKay. I told them not to proceed with the work until the estimate was approved.\n\nI trust you will give this matter your attention and try to secure for us some means of power with the least possible delay,\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F.

Father Kelly, Principal, Kootenay Indian Residential School, with regard to the Petters Diesel Engine operating the pump for the above mentioned domestic water supply.\n\nThe Petters Diesel Engine is out of commission and will be shipped immediately to the B.C. Equipment Co., Vancouver, B. C. In the meantime the old Otto gas engine is maintaining an unsatisfactory supply of water, its continued operation due to its mechanical condition is very uncertain, it burns about ten gallons of gas per day and its operation entails considerable work and worry.\n\nIf there is any possibility of the school procuring hydro power in the near future, I would recommend that this engine be repaired, if not, I would recommend that a new engine of Vivian or Lister make be installed.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Domestic Water,\nKootenay Indian School\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letter of January 21st and enclosure referred to therein from which it will be noted that the Petter's Diesel Engine at the Kootenay School operating the pump for the domestic water supply is out of commission. The engine was shipped to Vancouver and after considerable delay in securing from the school other parts necessary to estimate the cost of repairs it has now been ascertained that to put the engine in running order will cost approximately $350.00.\n\nThe school is presently carrying on by using the old Otto gas engine but this is very unreliable and there would appear to be no alternative to having the Petter's engine repaired.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise if it will be in order to have the repairs carried out. I may say it is unlikely that the work can be done and the accounts submitted prior to March 31st as we have yet to arrange with the Kootenay school to ship various other parts of the engine.\n\nD.

Dunn, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nAs I already informed you by telephone our Lister Engine for supplying power developed a serious oil leak last week and I wired to Major MacKay for authorization to have it repaired. Thirty dollars was allowed for the work and the attached invoices for twenty-one seventy-five shows the work complete in so far as they were able to fix it. It is still leaking slightly around the main-bearing but the Cranbrook Auto Wreckers, or any local firm have not the equipment to make the repair. However this leak is not serious as yet and the engine is again in operation.\n\nI was with the mechanic while he was working and as he found the interior in bad condition I had him make the attached report as to his findings. Just how long it will continue to operate no one can say but it does look as though we will have more trouble with it in the near future.\n\nApproximately a year ago this engine was overhauled by a Vancouver firm and since that time we have followed to the letter the instructions as to type of oil, times of changing, and the filter system. Knowing from past correspondence that this engine has from its first instalment been unsatisfactory I have taken every precaution since its last overhauling that it has received the best of care and attention. If as it seems from the mechanic's report we are again to have trouble surely we are entitled to a means of power more satisfactory than this has been. I would be very pleased if you would give this matter your support.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F.

As this engine was abandoned some time ago as obsolete certain repairs had to be made in order to bring it into service and to keep it running. As we have not as yet heard from the B.C. Equipment Co. regarding the repairs to the Petters Engine we are still using the Otto Engine at no small expense for gasoline.\n\nThe attached invoices cover the repairs as follows:\n\nPioneer Motors ........... $3.20\nStrauss Engineering Co. .... $57.60\nKootenay Indian School .... $9.60 (Customs)\n\nIn order to have the parts released from Customs I had to pay the duty in cash as shown by the attached Customs form. I trust we will be reimbursed to that extent and that the other invoices as attached will be accepted by the Dept.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.

Phelan,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Welfare Department,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nMay I draw to your attention the condition of the Cranbrook school transportation. For quite a while there never has been a car that actually belonged to the school. The school made use of a car that was purchased by the Bishop for the Indian missions. Now that the Indian missions car has been transferred elsewhere rather belly is in need of something in the way of a station wagon to transport the children of the school who are likely to attend the public high school. He also needs this wagon for transporting the commodities of life as well as the mail, which has to be brought\nin several miles from the town.\n\nIn a letter received today he tells me that his application to Major McKay for such a means of transportation has been turned down cold. I fail to understand the reason why. I feel that it is absolutely essential that there should be some means of transportation between the school and the town.\n\nWith my kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

There is no doubt whatever but that the maintenance of these units has not only been extremely poor prior to the school being taken over by the present Principal but that the so called engineer ruined them by a combination of tinkering and neglect.\n\nThe Petters now in Vancouver undergoing repairs shows evidence of great abuse since it was completely overhauled about two years ago.\n\nThe present situation is that the institution is without water and light, twenty-seven of the pupils are ill, two of them having been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. That the local health authorities have not ordered the school closed down until services are restored indicates that they are not yet aware of the situation.\n\nFrom the information received none of the engines can be restored to service without delay and it would appear that our only alternative is to install the most suitable plant immediately available locally, this being the \"International\" 34 H.P. diesel, costing $2,250.00, and I would so recommend.\n\nfor D.

We also received your telegram of the same date.\n\nWe wired Father Kelly authorizing the purchase of the diesel engine available at Cranbrook at a cost of $2,250.00. When this is installed you should issue your purchase order and attached it to your voucher.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nApril 1/47.\n\nMr. B.F. Neary, Superintendent,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nFurther to our conversation of a few hours ago I thought I should add a few words of further explanation as to the situation. My action in phoning you was probably somewhat unorthodox but I am sure if you were here and could see our present predicament you would understand that some drastic action had to be taken. We are in the midst of a serious flu epidemic with some cases developing into pneumonia. Today we have twenty-seven patients in bed. Saturday and Sunday we had neither light, heat, or water. The old gas engine used for water pumping refused to run and of course without water we couldn't have the furnaces on. The Doctor came here Sunday and was ready to take this thing to the highest authority he could find. Our nurse and staff were naturally unable to cope with the situation and the whole affair was pretty drastic. We were able to get temporary repairs for the old gas engine and get some water but we still had no light. Attending these patients in the dark was a bit too much.\n\nI had hoped that we could keep the equipment operating until the appropriation went through for what we should have, the East Kootenay power. But the line can't be built in a day and so I felt the only thing was to get the available unit. The engineers are here now installing it and by evening they say they will have it running. Deo Gratias.\n\nWhen the breakdown came Saturday morning we wired Major McKay and the reply was that he could do nothing without further specif-\nications. That was a bit too much for me and I suppose I said a few things to him when I got him on the phone that he didn't like to hear but I felt we had taken it on the chin just about long enough. If his home was two and a half miles for the Power Line I am sure it would long ago have been connected up. If the Dept. had done that ten years ago enough money would have been saved to pay for all the engines and repairs that have been necessitated in that time and many of the disagreeable situations that have arisen between Principals and the Dept. in that time would have been avoided. I know that you understand that as well as I do and I do feel sorry that at this stage when we were assured of the proper power within two years this situation had to arise and necessitate a new engine installment. However in an emergency one has to do what seems best and meet the future when it comes.\n\nFor some time I had been considering sending you a detailed report on the conditions of this institution, not only the matter of power, but the whole set-up of the school and the reserves which we are attempting to serve. I am following with great interest the Bulletins which you are publishing and I have set my heart to bring this institution up to what it should be. The ignorance, lack of initiative, and in some cases evident misunderstanding on the part of the Indians of what we are trying to do for them, is quite appalling here. I would say that our Kootenays are about fifty years behind the coast Indians and the radical views of some white so-called citizens are raising a situation which if not soon remedied will have serious results. The urgent need is housing, encouragement, and education. The radical ideas of some of these poor fellows, who really don't know what they are talking about, is astounding. As Mr. Hoey said to the Committee examining the Indian Act\nin their session of March 6th, \"There is no doubt but that we are working in the right direction, but are we working fast enough\".\n\nI had hoped that during the recess last summer some of the members of the Commission would have paid us a visit. There are enough issues here to fill a book. We are not in the class that they term the 'Bush Indians' and yet we are not with those upon whom white civilization has had a good influence. The white influence here is for the greater part the bootleggers. The citizens of Cranbrook just don't accept them at all. And in the present state of the Indians that is understandable. To bring them to their rightfull place will be a long task but we must get started without further delay.\n\nWith my sincere appreciation for your assistance in the matter discussed this morning and kind cooperation on many past occasions,\n\nI remain,\n\nTruly yours,\n\nG.F.

That the local health authorities have not ordered the school closed down until services are restored indicates that they are not yet aware of the situation.\"\n\"From the information received none of the engines can be restored to service without delay and it would appear that our only alternative is to install the most suitable plant immediately available locally, this being the 'International' 34 H.P. diesel, costing $2,250.00, and I would so recommend.\"\n\nIn view of the emergency that existed at the school at that time, Colonel Neary, Superintendent of Welfare and Training phoned Mr. Jackson and received verbal authority to authorize the purchase and installation of the new power unit.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. Coding is as follows: 884-516-12-415.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nDirector\nBanff, Alberta.\nApril 25th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTo - C. M. Walker, Esq.,\nDistrict Engineer,\n\nInstallation of Hydro-Pneumatic Tank\nKootenay Indian Residential School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nI arrived in Cranbrook at 5 P.M., April 18th, and drove out to the school after dinner. I found that the excavation had been completed to the bottom of the old 30 foot tank, but on one side only. The other side of the tank was partially covered, and this cover was all that was preventing the earth under the south end of the garage from caving into the excavation. A part of the foundation earth under the northeast corner of the garage had already caved into the excavation. Cracks in the adjoining earth, some six feet on the north side of the excavation at the west end of the tank, indicated that a serious cave-in might occur as soon as the old tank was lifted and its support removed from under the earth wall supporting the garage. Earth was beginning to run into the excavation from under the church foundations on the south side of the excavation.\n\nIt was therefore deemed advisable to let the old tank remain in place and set the new tank in the excavation parallel to, but with its centre line some four feet south of the centre line of the old tank and with the elevation of the bottom of the new tank some two or three feet above the elevation of the top of the old tank.\n\nTo make this installation would necessitate filling the excavation up to the proposed elevation of the bottom of the new tank and not installing the new tank in position until the filled in earth had become well settled. It was estimated that one or two months should elapse before this settlement was satisfactory, and deemed necessary that in the meantime the new tank be pulled into the garage building and connected up to the water system.\n\nThe above method of procedure met with the approval of Mr. Dunn, the Indian Agent, and Father Kelly, the principal of the school. The latter pointed out that the time of installation of the new tank should be deferred until the end of the present school term, some time near the end of June, as at that time with only the staff in attendance, the loss of water pressure for the day or two necessary to make the tank change over, would not be so inconvenient as if made when the school was full of students.\n\nOn Saturday April 19th the new tank was pulled into the garage, placed in position and most of the connections made.\n\nOn Monday April 21st, the connections to the new tank were completed and a bulldozer, hired from a Cranbrook firm, filled the excavated earth back into the excavation, over and around the old tank, and up to the elevation for the bottom of the new tank plus 20% shrinkage.\n\nEstimated cost of ..................\nESTIMATED COST OF INSTALLATION TO DATE:\n\nPlumbers labour and material $100.00\nTank delivered to school $1,588.00\nPipe and fittings - Crane Company Limited $64.65\nIndians Labour excavating $200.00\nBulldozer hire $50.00\nEngineering $70.00\n\n$2,062.65\n\nThere remains to be done, at the close of the school term:\n\n(1) Work for a bulldozer one day pulling new tank out of garage, pushing it to position in excavation and pushing earth cover over new tank.

H. Nelson,\nSenior Assistant Engineer.\nBanff, Alberta,\nApril 28th, 1947.\n\nRe: Installation of Hydro-Pneumatic Tank,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nWith reference to the above I would advise that on April 16th Mr. W.H. Snelson left Banff for Cranbrook to undertake installation of the new tank in the Residential School.\n\nOn arrival at Cranbrook on the 18th Mr. Snelson discovered that considerable caving-in of the earth supporting the garage, and also one wall of the Church School, had taken place subsequent to excavating operations for the placement of the new tank.\n\nIn view of conditions as found by Mr. Snelson it was decided that a rearrangement should be made regarding placement of the new tank in order to do away with the possibility of any additional weakening of the foundations under the church wall and garage. I enclose herewith in triplicate copies of Mr. Snelson's memorandum regarding operations at Cranbrook, together with pencil sketches of proposals made by Mr. Snelson re the final installation of the tank in its proper position. Please note that while at Cranbrook Mr. Snelson had the new tank temporarily installed in the garage, and at the same time had all necessary pipe connections made thereto in order that the new tank could be immediately put into use. Our information is that the new tank as so temporarily installed is functioning properly.\n\nYou will note from Mr. Snelson's memorandum that Father Kelly favours delaying the final installation of the tank in its proper position until the end of the present school term when, being without water service for a day or two while connections are being made will not interfere to any great extent, since only the permanent staff would still be in quarters at the school. At the same time this proposed delay will give the newly placed earth in the excavation a chance to settle properly and thus provide a much firmer foundation for the tank when installed.\n\nI am quite in accord with the action taken by Mr. Snelson when at Cranbrook, and also with the proposal that final installation should be delayed until the end of the school term.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

It was thought that to disturb the old tank would cause settlement or collapse of the garage and perhaps of the wall of the church, so some of the material excavated to expose the old tank was replaced in the pit over the old tank and it is proposed to allow this material to settle until the school holidays before completing the tank installation in the pit.\n\nIt is unfortunate that it was not possible to place the new tank on the bed used by the old one. The permanent installation of the new tank is to be made during the school summer holidays.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncs.\n\nJ.M.

Dunn, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nAs you know from your visits to the school we have no means of heating water during the months of the year when the furnaces are not operating. A steam boiler provides for the laundry but we are greatly handicapped for the bathing of the children. There is no need to explain the possibility of teaching them cleanliness when they are only provided with cold hard spring water. During the recent visit of the boiler inspector, Mr. Halsall, this was pointed out to him and he thought it incredible that we should be expected to operate without the common facility of hot water. I had him inspect a water heating jacket which Patmore Bros. had for sale and which they are willing to install with a sawdust burner attached for the very reasonable sum of one hundred and seventy-five dollars.\n\nI would be pleased if you would take this matter up with the Dept. and point out our necessity. As you know we have an ample supply of sawdust on the Reserve and I am very anxious to try out a saw-burner on this jacket heater with a view to using sawdust more extensively on our other heating units.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F.

The heating coils in the furnace being the only method of heating water for bathing and daily ablution of the children and staff.\n\nMr. Patmore has a second hand water heating jacket that is sufficiently large for the school needs and although yellow pine sawdust is not the best of fuel in a sawdust burner, I feel sure that a mixture with fir will make this unit practical. The unit was only used for a short space of time in Kimberley by a laundry, which has since gone out of business.\n\nThis request for assistance from Father Kelly is warranted and I would, therefore, recommend that authority for installing this hot water heating unit be granted if at all possible at a cost of $175.00.\n\nJ.

Dunn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCRA BROCK, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my visit to the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I find that the present methods of handling the milk supply from the farm are very inadequate.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the milking is done, under supervision, by the Indian students, and whilst this may appear satisfactory, in all likelihood the dairy cows are probably not supplying all the milk that can be expected of them. This could be due to excitement caused by inexperienced milkers and also by lack of thorough stripping. In any event I would strongly recommend the installation of a milking machine, which in turn will necessitate a power line being brought in to the school.\n\nAfter milking the milk is brought over to the kitchen, in the basement of the school, filtered into cans and put into a storage containing milk, vegetables, etc. As you know milk will readily adopt any adjacent flavours, especially warm milk, and even though the milk is placed in a cold storage it takes a considerable time to cool down to a temperature which prevents the normal growth of bacteria. No facilities are provided other than the above, and it is a remarkable thing to me that, under these circumstances and the method of milking, no serious outbreak of disease has occurred at the school.\n\nWith these facts in mind I sincerely recommend the construction of a suitable farm dairy of sufficient size to accommodate the daily milk supply, which at present is approximately 50 gallons per day, in which case a milk house with inside dimensions of 12' x 14' would be quite suitable. I am forwarding Dairy Circular No.5 under separate cover, issued by the Provincial Department of Agriculture, which includes information and a plan for such a building.\n\nWith regard to costs it is very difficult to give an accurate estimate for such a building, but providing labour can be provided the probable cost of material would be in the neighborhood of $150 to $200. In addition the following equipment would be required\u2014a suitable boiler for providing live steam and heat, a double sink for washing and rinsing utensils, a steam cabinet for sterilizing, a surface cooler with water pressure connection, and a suitable rack for cans, pails, etc.\nIt would, of course, be highly desirable to pasteurize milk used in such an institution, and in which case an extra room would be required in the milk house. In any case a milk house of some description is highly essential and it is with this in view that I am also forwarding Dominion Department of Agriculture Bulletin No.165 on Cooling Milk on the Farm and our own Dairy Circular No.36, the Care of Milk on the Farm.\n\nTrusting that my observations and recommendations may prove of some value in improving the milk supply at the school, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. D. Johnson,\nProv. Dairy Inspector & Instructor\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nJune 10th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Mr. G. D.\nJohnson, Provincial Dairy Inspector and Instructor, dated\nKelowna, May 30th, in connection with the methods used in\nhandling our milk supply at the Kootenay Indian Residential\nSchool. Due to a serious outbreak of Undulant Fever in the\nCranbrook District every source of milk supply has been\ncarefully inspected by B. C. Department of Agriculture In-\nspectors.\n\nIn reply to a letter from Rev. G. F. Kelly,\nPrincipal of the school here in Cranbrook, March 25th last,\nyou suggested full details in connection with the proposed\nconstruction of a dairy building and I have been endeavour-\ning to arrive at an estimate of the cost of this project\nand find it, although a necessity, a rather expensive\nundertaking.\n\nMr. Johnson suggests that material for the\nbuilding would be in the neighbourhood of $150.00 to\n$200.00 not counting labour. It is possible that a suit-\nable structure could be erected as a manual training\nproject at $300.00.\n\nA can washing sink, two-compartment with steam\njet, and a sterilizing compartment complete with necessary\nplumbing could be made by local sheet-metal workers for\napproximately $125.00.\nThe DeLaval Co. of Vancouver quote surface milk coolers f.o.b. Vancouver - 350 lbs. cap. @ $77.00.\n\nA suitable steam boiler 2\u00bd H.P. with injector, f.o.b. Vancouver sells @ $336.50.\n\nAn appropriation of around $850.00 will therefore be necessary to complete this project.\n\nAs the Dairy Inspector has warned us of the eminent danger, any milk bourne epidemic occurring at the school would be our responsibility as the present methods of milk handling are definitely inadequate.\n\nFurther to all this expense an adequate supply of running water is not available. This brings the St. Joseph's Creek pipeline project into the picture, and as the new diesel power unit and installation of the new hydro pneumatic tank will cost more than the specific amount of $2,400.00 for the purchase of new equipment and repairs allotted this year, the new dairy building would appear to be impossible.\n\nI would suggest that after over twenty-five years the utilities of the school have now reached a point where extraordinary expense to maintain adequate facilities for a further number of years has become a necessity.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJSD/DD\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letter of June 10th and enclosure referred to therein in connection with the proposed construction of a dairy building at the Kootenay Indian Residential School at an estimated cost of $850 to the Department for materials and equipment.\n\nAlthough an amount of $2,270 has already been spent for the purchase of a new diesel power unit, an expenditure of $800 will be required in connection with the installation of a new water pressure tank, and the Rev. Principal is pressing strongly for renewal of the St. Joseph's Creek pipeline, the fact that the dairy facilities at the school have been the subject of inspection by an official of the Provincial Department of Agriculture who has reported adversely and pointed out the imminent possibility of a serious outbreak of disease leads me to believe that the Department would be well advised to approve the expenditure above mentioned if funds can be made available.\n\nIt would appear to me that the equipment and facilities at the Kootenay Residential School are such that if possible a supplementary appropriation should be made this year.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. J.S. Dunn, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nFurther to our discussion regarding the St. Joseph's Creek pipeline and the enquiry of the Dept. as to its urgency, I would like to point out that it is second only to the necessity of the power unit for light. Certainly we had to have the power unit as we cannot operate in the dark, but when the appropriation of $2400 was made for new equipment and repairs for the current year no one could foresee that the new engine would have to be purchased. I think it is quite unfair that we in this year should have to take the blame for the mistakes of others in past years when the Lister Diesel engine was purchased. If anything may be classed as an emergency expenditure surely the necessity of the new engine may be so classed and should therefore be provided over and above the current appropriation. If I might make a comparison, supposing we had a fire causing five thousand dollars damage, according to present reasoning repairs could not be made because the current appropriation only allows for twenty four hundred dollars. It is the same in this case. As I understand it appropriations are based on evident repairs and replacements. This pipeline has been repeatedly asked for for the past five years. I see it mentioned in correspondence as far back as '41. When Major McKay visited here shortly after my arrival two years ago he told me that the expenditure of this money for the pipeline had already been approved of and assured me that we could expect\nII\n\naction on it as soon as the pipe was available. At that time due to war restrictions it was not available. I understand that it now is.\n\nIf I had the capital with which to do it I would put it in myself because in five years time it would pay for itself in the saving of soap and water softening chemicals. It has been pointed out again and again and lastly by our recent boiler inspector, Mr Halsall, the great advantage the soft water would be in our steam boiler and heating system. Soap and water softener for the past year cost us twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars. Over one hundred dollars a month, just about double what it should be if we had the soft water. And even with that expenditure the results in washing and keeping the children clean are far from good. If I was asking for some new installation I could understand the hesitancy of the Dept., but when the builders of this institution had the foresight to install this water supply, it doesn't seem so extraordinary that the wooden pipe should rot and need to be renewed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nJune 11th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Renewal St. Joseph's Creek Pipeline\nKootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 30th in which you requested I discuss the matter of deferring proposed repairs to the above-noted water supply line with the Rev. Father Kelly, Principal of the school. I am enclosing a letter from the Rev. Principal and as you will perceive he is dismayed that there may be further delay in this matter.\n\nThe Rev. Principal is dismayed with the prospect of another year without adequate water supply, inconvenience and expense in renewing burnt out heating coils and stopping of supply lines due to the hard domestic water, not to mention the added expense of soap and softeners, as well as additional fuel to run the water pump.\n\nI would suggest that the Surveys and Engineering Branch approach this matter with a view to supplying much needed soft water and at the same time consider an intake approximately one mile from the school that would not only provide adequate supply of running water, but would also provide a permanent head of water under sufficient pressure to give adequate fire protection for the main school building, barn and outbuildings. The supply of chemicals on hand would be of little avail in a fire of major proportions.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 155-o-5 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of May 27th in connection with the proposed renewal of the pipeline serving the Kootenay Residential School, enclosed herewith for your information is a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letter of June 11th and communication from the Reverend Principal referred to therein.\n\nI am in agreement with the views expressed by the Agent and the Principal and feel that if it is at all possible to provide the necessary funds the pipeline should be repaired this year.\n\nThe condition of the school establishment at Cranbrook is such that the Department will likely be called upon to make further large expenditures next year, in view of which it would be as well to dispose of the question of repairs to the pipeline this year if possible.\n\nD.

Two different firms were kind enough to make the attempt with small electric concrete drills. This met with no success as the drills were not powerful enough.\n\nAugust 7th - A portable air compressor was finally located at a gypsum mine near Wardner that was, at the time, not operating. The man in charge hauled the compressor and hammer to the school arriving at noon. By 4:00 P.M., this powerful equipment had made a 6\" diameter hole through the wall.\n\nAug. 8 & 9 - The local plumber and helpers made all necessary piping connections. Father Kelly, principal of the school, said that he would have Indians fill up the small hole remaining next the building. At 6:00 P.M., August 9th the tank had been filled to the H.W.L. and all equipment was functioning satisfactorily.\n\nEXPENDITURES TO DATE ON PROJECT\n\n| Item                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 5' x 25' pressure tank delivered          | $1588.00 |\n| Excavation by Indians                     | 215.00   |\n| Bulldozer rental in April                 | 49.00    |\n| Plumbing and fitting in April             | 80.56    |\n| Crane & Co., Limited                     | 65.25    |\n| Bulldozer rental August                   | 130.00   |\n| Plumbing and fitting in August            | 95.35    |\n| Engineering Expenses, April               | 55.15    |\n| Bulldozer Expenses, August                | 79.68    |\n| City of Cranbrook Electric Hammer rental  | 10.00    |\n| Kimberley Mines                           | 5.00     |\n| Labour of Indians                         | 6.00     |\n| Rental Air Compressor                     | 15.00    |\n| Labour of Indians                         | 20.00    |\n\n$2,398.23\n\nT.

In order to complete the renewal next spring the material should be ordered as soon as possible and the amount of money required this year for material will be $2,100.00.\n\nKindly advise if we are authorized to call for tenders on the material and if so please arrange for the transfer of the funds necessary, viz. $2,100.00. The remainder of the estimate will be needed next Spring.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEnc.\n\nJ. M.

It would be proportional and would operate only when the laundry was in operation. It is not considered necessary to chlorinate that portion of the water supply that would be used for the boilers, stock-watering, or irrigation.\n\nThe water surface in the proposed forebay in St. Josephs creek would be 25 feet above the ground surface at the school building or 30 feet above the basement floor where the laundry machinery is located, or 28 feet above the large laundry tube.\n\nThe proposed 6\" pipeline would, therefore, deliver 450 U.S. gallons per minute, or approximately 1 c.f.s. to the Laundry; or 400 U.S. gallons per minute for irrigation purposes at ground level. Static pressure at the laundry would be approximately 12.0 p.s.i.\n\nThe above estimate is based on the assumption that a power shovel could be obtained locally to do the excavating and back-filling work, and on pipe prices as obtaining in July 1947.\n\nRecent advices from wood pipe manufacturing firms in Vancouver quote six to eight months for date of delivery after receipt of order. It is recommended that the materials required be ordered immediately and that local firms having ditching shovels be contacted to insure that the work could be done immediately upon receipt of the materials.\n\nC.

Dunn, Esq., Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nRe - Telephone Communication -\nKootenay Residential School -\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th inst., requesting assistance for the Kootenay Indian Residential School in the reconstruction of the telephone line, I would advise that you appear to have overlooked my telegram of July 25th last as follows:\n\n\"Retel school management should arrange for repairs telephone line their expense with possibility of securing reimbursement from department if our responsibility established.\"\n\nThe maintenance of this line is definitely the responsibility of the school, and if a grant additional to the school funds should be required, it should be treated the same way as any other special assistance, provision being made, of course, in the estimates.\n\nAs you are aware, the estimates for the current year provided for a refrigeration unit and repairs to farm buildings at a cost of $2,400.00. However, the Department found it necessary to spend $2,265.79 for a diesel engine and faced an expenditure of $2,400.00 in connection with the installation of a hydro-pneumatic tank. They also approved of an expenditure of $850.00 for a dairy building and an additional amount for the water supply line. When you add to this the $1500. for boiler repairs you will see that the original provision has been considerably exceeded, at the expense of other schools.\nUnder the circumstances I am of the opinion that the Department will be unable to meet this additional demand, and if the school is unable to maintain the line, I can only suggest that they abandon the telephone.\n\nIf funds were available, the lack of detail in your submission would have made it impossible to secure authorization without referring it back to you. Detailed estimates, including labour, are required.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\ncc. Department.\n\n:ms.\nCranbrook, B. C.,\nOctober 18, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Telephone Communication,\nKootenay Residential School\n\nI wish to again bring to your attention the unsatisfactory condition of the above mentioned service in that many of the poles supporting this service line need replacing or resetting.\n\nIn a letter of August 20th, Mr. C. E. Fisher, District Manager, Kootenay Telephone Company, Nelson, B. C., stated as follows: \"Service is given on the condition that 'Subscriber owns and maintains the private line from coil on pole 138/21', the instrument and equipment belongs to the Kootenay Telephone Company\".\n\nThis telephone line was apparently installed by the C. P. R. during construction of the Crows Nest Pass Railroad in connection with hospitalization of their construction crew at the old St. Eugene Mission Hospital. The line was taken over when our Kootenay Indian Residential School was constructed after being abandoned when the St. Eugene Hospital was moved to Cranbrook.\n\nThe Kootenay Telephone Company at present is unwilling to estimate cost or undertake repairs but made a survey of the situation. Mr. D. Miller, Local Manager, reports that at least 30, No. 3, butt-treated poles at a cost of $4.00 each will be necessary; other poles will be satisfactory if reset.\nObviously communication between the School, St. Mary's Reserve and the City of Cranbrook is a service that should be maintained. The operators of the school are naturally loath to meet this major expense, which may cost between $400.00 and $500.00. In the meantime this telephone service is threatened with every heavy wind.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJSD/DD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe - Telephone Communication -\nKootenay Residential School -\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letter of the 18th inst., requesting assistance for Kootenay Indian Residential School in meeting the cost of reconstructing a telephone line between the school and the company's main line, which is expected to amount to $500.00.\n\nI also enclose copy of my letter of today advising that it is doubtful if funds would be available for this purpose in view of current heavy expenditures in connection with the school. However, if you have the funds it might assist if they were given a grant of $250.00 towards the cost of the work as undoubtedly the telephone is of considerable service, the school being some six miles from Cranbrook.\n\nfor D.

C.\n\nRe: Kootenay Residential School\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 2nd, file 5-11-3, in which you requested advice as to cost of installation of four overhead tank units for the boys' lavatory at the school as supplied by Patmore Bros.\n\nThe cost of this work will be as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 4 overhead used tank units                | $20.00 |\n| Pipe and fittings to connect tanks        | $23.25 |\n| 4 new open front closet seats @ 6.25      | $25.00 |\n| Car expense to and from school            | $4.00  |\n| Labour on installation                    | $80.25 |\n\nTotal: $152.50\n\nLabour costs are high on this project, but considerable improvisation had to be done. The results are very satisfactory at this time and the Rev. Principal is very pleased to have five good toilets available in the boys' basement lavatory.\n\nWith no promise of supplies becoming available to make permanent installations in the lavatory, it is hoped that these four used overhead tank units will continue to give satisfactory service.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nCranbrook, B. C.,\nNovember 24, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 5th with enclosures of letters from Rev. G. F. Kelly, Principal of the Kootenay Indian School and Mr. Barber, Manager of the Plumbing Dept., McLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd., Vancouver, in connection with repairs to toilets in the boys' lavatory at the school.\n\nIn the past year the question of repairs to these toilets has come forward on a good many occasions and in each case Mr. Patmore was in touch with one hardware dealer or another in an attempt to obtain parts to repair the present installation. Mr. Patmore has had both Crane and Mc & Mc agents call at the school, both of these Agents had given us some hope. Mr. Patmore today informs me that the whole case of obtaining parts is apparently hopeless and that he is also unable to quote or supply new units.\n\nMr. Patmore has four second-hand overhead tank units removed from the Cranbrook Public Building. He has assured me that costs will be kept to a minimum but is unwilling to quote cost of labour, which will be the only major expense involved. These second-hand tanks appear to me to be the only possible relief to be obtained in the near future. I can see no reason why they should not work satisfactorily as a temporary measure and have asked Mr. Patmore to install the four tanks immediately.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 155-0-5\n\nFollowing my letter of April 5, 1946 to you regarding flush actions and seats for toilets at the Kootenay Indian Residential School nothing further was heard regarding the matter until October 30th of this year when the Reverend Principal brought the matter to my attention. Mr. Indian Agent Dunn subsequently wrote me on November 24th, a copy of his letter being attached, from which you will note that Patmore Bros. had secured four second-hand overhead tank units. A further letter dated December 10th from Mr. Dunn is also attached in which he details the cost of the work, amounting to $152.50.\n\nAlthough it is regretted that Mr. Dunn did not first secure authority for the expenditure the improvements were urgently required and if funds are available I would recommend that the expenditure be approved and that the Agent be authorized to submit vouchers.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of December 16th, file 5-11-3, the Department approves an expenditure of $152.50 at the Kootenay Residential School for the installation of four second hand overhead tank units.\n\nWhen forwarding account, a copy of your purchase order should be attached.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 2nd,\nfile 5-11-4, requesting information with respect to our\nvoucher No. 411 in favour of Patmore Bros. for repairs\nto No. 1 heating boiler at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The repairs completed by Patmore Bros.\nwould have been done by the Cranbrook Foundry had not an\nemergency arisen in which heat to the school became a\nnecessity and the Cranbrook Foundry were unable to supply\nthe necessary material or labour at that time. Mr. Mac-\nKinnon of the Cranbrook Foundry requested me to have Mr.\nPatmore do this work.\n\nOur voucher No. 433 in favour of the Cran-\nbrook Foundry is enclosed. The original estimate sub-\nmitted to the Engineering Branch, Banff, by this company,\nof which I did not receive a copy in this office, gave\nan approximate cost of the work to be done with brick-\nwork found necessary to be in addition to the estimate.\n\nBefore the tubes of No. 2 boiler could be\nremoved, the rear brick wall had to be removed. This\nbrickwork and all other brickwork on both boilers was\nbeyond repair and arch plate and side wall bricks had to\nbe renewed. This brickwork amounts to $215.00.\n\nThe original estimate on the second-hand\nboiler tubes was $690.00, the new tubes adding $300.00\nto the cost. The Cranbrook Foundry account for $1,892.\nplus $116.05 for work done by Patmore Bros. brings cost\nto $2,008.05, deducting $300.00 extra for the new tubes and $215.00 for brickwork leaves a net of $1,493.05 on the original estimate of $1,500.00 as submitted by the Cranbrook Foundry.\n\nIf necessary, I could have the Cranbrook Foundry incorporate Patmore Bros. account to cover repairs to school boilers under one voucher.\n\nThe condition of No. 1 and No. 2 heating boilers is now satisfactory and with reasonable care of brickwork in firing, these boilers should give efficient service for many years. The high pressure boiler appears to be in good condition and satisfactory arrangements for removing smoke box for cleaning purposes have been made.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJSD/DD\nEncl.\nCranbrook, B. C.,\nNovember 25, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThe attached Voucher No. 411 in favour of Patmore Bros. covers repairs to No. 1 heating boiler at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Some two years ago Mr. Patmore was asked to renew a burnt out elbow and tee joint but was unable to complete this work due to lack of material.\n\nWhen it became apparent that renewal of tubes in No. 2 heating boiler would be delayed until after opening of school for the fall term, Mr. Patmore was pressed by this office to complete the repair work on No. 1 boiler. An early cold snap developed before this work was accomplished and the Rev. Principal was unwilling to fire up No. 2 boiler, which was undoubtedly in poor condition but capable of heating the school. Fortunately, warmer weather developed after two or three days and No. 1 boiler was repaired by Mr. Patmore before another cold spell.\n\nRepairs to No. 2 boiler have since been completed by the Cranbrook Foundry and with the renewal of main arch and brickwork is now operating efficiently. No. 1 boiler was leaking quite badly at the tube ends but these tubes have been secured.

No reply was received from that branch but the Cranbrook Foundry apparently proceeded with the repairs in accordance with the authority given by the Department in Mr. Neary's Radio Signals message of August 16th.\n\nOn November 25th Mr. Indian Agent Dunn submitted the attached voucher No. 411 in favour of Patmore Bros., Cranbrook, in the amount of $116.05 covering the cost of repairs to the No. 1 heating boiler at the school. His letter in this connection is enclosed on receipt of which I wrote to him for confirmation that the repairs undertaken by Patmore Bros. were not a duplication of those which the Cranbrook Foundry had been authorized to carry out. A subsequent letter dated December 8th from the Agent is enclosed from which you will note that the work in connection with the boilers has been completed at a total cost of $2008.05 inclusive of the account attached. Kootenay Agency voucher No. 433 has been returned to the Agent for correction and will be forwarded to you in due course.\n\nD. M.

He said the chief obstacle was the fact that a new Diesel was installed here last Spring at a cost of twenty-two hundred and some dollars and that it was the mind of the Dept. that we should use it for at least another year. When I asked for its installation I knew it would be a stumbling block to the introduction of what we should have but in the emergency what else could we do? However the Dept. need not lose any money on the installation. I am prepared to pay the full cost price of the Diesel if it can be released any time within the calendar year '48. These engines are in great demand among the lumber companies here and I have the promise of a local operator that he will take it off my hands any time within the next year. On the other hand I hope to have a saw-mill operating here within a short time and could put it to use ourselves. Naturally if the engine runs much over a year the Dept. is going to lose money on deterioration but if this matter can be kept in this year's estimates the above offer stands.\n\nThis would reduce the price of the power line from eight thousand two hundred to six thousand which should be sound business. If it will facilitate matters I will be glad to draw up a contract to the above effect immediately because I know I can dispose of the Diesel engine without suffering loss and at the same time dispose of the major headache of this whole set-up. I am sure there is no need to rehearse what has already been said many times that our whole program of school activity is being hampered by this lack of substantial power. Your excellent publication, The Indian School Bulletin, encourages us to introduce extra curricular activity and to bring our school up to modern standards in every phase of education but who can do that under such an antiquated system as we have here? Children who are burdened with ironing clothes with sad-irons, peeling potatoes, polishing floors by hand, milking cows by hand and the other host of manual duties which we now have in the maintenance of the institution, have little time for real education. Give us a supply of A.C. power and we will give in return a school second to none in the Province.\n\nDo you think it would help matters if I sent an offer to buy the Diesel engine, as stated above, direct to the Treasury Branch? If you would advise it, to whom should I address the letter? I would be very pleased to hear from you on this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I. Principal.\nOttawa, November 25, 1947.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nWe received your letter of November 12th and have carefully considered its contents.\n\nEven if we approved the sale of the diesel engine that we supplied during the current calendar year, to the Kootenay School, the proceeds could not be used for building the power line. Such action is contrary to Treasury Board regulations.\n\nAt the present time I am not in a position to state when we will have funds available for installation or an electric line to the Kootenay School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.F. Kelly, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Res.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nKootenay Indian Residential School:\n\nPlans are well advanced for the installation of fire hydrants and hose in the school. The present fire protection consists of pyrene and foamite dispensers which are not considered adequate.\n\nIt is expected that pipe will be on hand before frost is out of the ground for the installation of a renewal of the old soft water line from St. Joseph's Creek. A chlorinator will be installed on this line to counteract any contamination that may enter the creek.\n\nThe boilers at the school have been overhauled during this quarter and are now giving satisfactory and efficient service.\n\nMaterials to repair toilets in the boys' lavatory have proved unobtainable and four second-hand overhead tank units have been installed. This temporary installation has proved satisfactory.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has installed, at his own expense, an electric potato peeler and an electric mincing machine, which have eliminated many hours of tedious work for the pupils.\n\nMaterial is now on hand for the construction of a modern dairy building of hollow cinder brick construction with steam boiler, can washing and sterilizing equipment. The old method of milk handling in the main school building being considered unsanitary by Provincial Dairy Inspectors.\n\nPower facilities are inadequate at this school and it is hoped that arrangements for the acquisition of nearby hydroelectric power will be made in the near future, that the utilities of the school may be placed on an efficient basis.\nPlease forward the following materials to the address given below, and charge to the account of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRender a separate invoice for each order and send copies to when goods are shipped.\n\n| Quantity | DESCRIPTION                                      | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|------|-------|\n| 4 only   | For Kootenay Indian Res.

Birch, O.M.I.\nProvincial.\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe Sale of House at Cranbrook to Indian Department\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to your office in February in the company of Rev. Fathers O'Grady and Mulvihill I mentioned to you the willingness of the Oblate Fathers to sell the Department a house on the Oblate property at Cranbrook, which the principal of the school wishes to have moved onto Government property at the rear of the school for the purpose of housing workmen.\n\nWill you kindly put the matter before the proper authorities in your Department for their consideration.\n\nThe dwelling in question is situated on Lot I Kootenay District owned by the Order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, copy of Title 319K as registered in land registry office, Nelson, B.C.\n\nThis house is a four room bungalow with unfinished attic. It is finished inside with lath and plaster and wall board covered with paper. The floors are B.C. fir and are in good condition. The roof is shingled and stained and has given no trouble. Until recently it has been occupied by a man and his wife employed at the school and so has been kept in good repair.\n\nIt is the wish of the school principal, Rev. Father Kelly, that the house be moved from its present location to the school property a distance I would estimate at not more than one-quarter of a mile. His reason for moving it and having it purchased by the Government is to use it for single men. In its present location it is not practical for single men during the winter months when it has to be heated. By placing it at the rear of the school building, between the school and the barn, the men can use it very conveniently and will take their meals in the school. It could accommodate an engineer, manual trainer and farm manager. Hot water and light could be installed from the school plant if the Department saw fit to do so. Its present location is too remote for these facilities.\n\nFather Kelly estimates that the move will cost from $175 to $200. This would be the use of a caterpillar tractor. Most of the other equipment, jacks, skids, etc., they have on hand at the school and he says that he will gladly give the use of men and time for the project.\nOttawa, March 30, 1948.\n\nDear Father Birch;\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant offering to sell us a house at Cranbrook that can be moved to the site of the Kootenay School and used as a residence for the male help.\n\nWe are submitting a copy of your letter to the Indian Commissioner in Vancouver and on receipt of his reply will communicate with you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nVery Rev.

C.,\nMarch 20, 1948.\n\nMr. J. S. Dunn, Indian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nRepeated requests have been made over a number of years for a unit to supply hot water during the months when the furnaces are not in use. With the advent of Spring we are again faced with this handicap which is a very serious one. While the furnaces are in use water for bathing and domestic use is heated by a coil in the firebox of No. 1 boiler. However when this boiler is not fired, and in a few more weeks this will be the case, we are left without any hot water.\n\nWhat we need is a coal-burning hot water jacket capable of heating the five hundred gallon hot water tank. This tank is a vertical one installed beside the present furnaces. It is well insulated and fitted with the necessary outlet and intake valves. The installation of the jacket would be a very simple matter which we will gladly do ourselves. However I don't feel that we should be called upon to purchase it out of school funds as it is a necessary part of the school set-up. At the same time we cannot continue under the present arrangement. Bathing children in cold water is both unsanitary and dangerous to their health. When that water is both cold and hard it becomes an ordeal.\n\nIf at all possible please rush this matter through so that by the middle of April when we no longer have need of the furnaces, we will have a unit suitable for our hot water supply.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) G. F. Kelly, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nCranbrook, B. C.,\nMarch 23rd, 1948.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Domestic Hot Water Supply,\nKootenay Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. G. F. Kelly, Principal of the school with the reminder that another season is at hand when the school will again be without a hot water supply for bathing purposes.\n\nIn his letter of September 3rd, 1947, file 5-11-4, to Mr. W. H. Snelson, Surveys & Engineering Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Banff, Alta., Major D. M. MacKay pointed out the need of a suitable hot water supply and recommended purchase of a unit with sufficient capacity for the school's demand for hot water.\n\nHaving had no word on this matter from Mr. Snelson, I wrote to him on February 16th, 1948 and received a reply stating the matter had been referred to a Mr. Mills but to date no further correspondence has been received in this connection.\n\nThe main heating boilers will be taken out of commission shortly and the school will again be without a supply of domestic hot water.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJSD/DD\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Domestic Hot Water supply - Kootenay Residential School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letter of March 23rd attached I should appreciate being advised what action the Department proposes to take with regard to the provision of hot water facilities for the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nThis matter was the subject of correspondence last year, reference my letter of July 3rd, at which time it was suggested that boiler No. 43794, B.C., surplus to requirements at the Kamloops Residential School, be shipped to the Kootenay school in lieu of the supply of a hot water heater but Departmental approval of this suggestion was not received and no action was taken presumably for the reason that the boilers and heating and plumbing installations at the school were subsequently investigated by Mr. W. H. Snelson of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Banff. Not having received a copy of any reports submitted by Mr. Snelson, I do not know what recommendations he made but feel that early consideration should be given to the provision of domestic hot water facilities at the school.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\n\nW.G.

This\ntank is a vertical one installed beside the present\nfurnaces. It is well insulated and fitted with the\nnecessary outlet and intake valves. The installation\nof the jacket would be a very simple matter which we\nwill gladly do ourselves.\"\n\nI presume that you can secure a jacket heater\nin Vancouver and if so please let me know the cost.\nIf not, let me have complete information regarding the\nsize and type required and we will arrange to have it\npurchased by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nIn connection with Indian Agent Dunn's letter,\nwe do not appear to have received any communications\nfrom the Lands and Development Services Branch with re-\nference to the letters to which Mr. Nelson states he\nsent to them.\n\nBernard F.

C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: School Dairy Building\n\nIn his letter of July 17th, 1947, Major D.\nM. MacKay informed this office that an expenditure of\n$250.00 had been approved toward material and equipment\nfor the construction of a dairy building at the Kootenay\nIndian Residential School.\n\nA total of $414.13 has already been expen-\nded for equipment and $235.50 for cement and cinder\nblocks. The lumber for completion of this building -\nshiplap, shingles, windows, doors, etc., will cost\n$286.06 and we will still be without a chimney or funds\nfor plumbing in connection with the water supply,\ndrainage and connecting up the steam boiler.\n\nAltogether costs of materials and equipment\nwill be 30% higher than the original estimate and a\nfurther grant of $250.00 will be required to complete\nthis building.\n\nThis dairy building will be of permanent\nconstruction in keeping with structure of adjacent\nschool building with all labour costs, exclusive of\nplumbing, being the responsibility of the school and I\nwould recommend that this additional expenditure be ap-\nproved.\n\nJ. S. Dunn,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 155-0-5 (WT)\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 3rd, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Dunn's letter of March 23rd advising that an additional expenditure of $250.00 will be required to complete the dairy building at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nIn view of the increased cost on all commodities since the date of authority it is felt that the increase is understandable and I would recommend that a further grant of $250.00 be approved.\n\nW.S.

He makes the following comments with regard to the physical condition of the school:\n\n\"WATER:\n\"The present system is inadequate and the water is hard. It is understood that a new system is to be installed as soon as the materials required are available.\n\n\"SANITARY CONDITIONS:\n\"The automatic flush toilets in the school are defective in almost every case. The Principal informs me that he has had a plumber out at the school on a number of occasions but only a very temporary improvement was accomplished.\n\n\"The kitchens, lavatories, boiler room, etc., were clean. The boys playroom was rather dirty and the floor in this room required repairs. In one spot the floor had given way.\n\n\"MAINTENANCE OF BUILDING:\n\"In addition to the repairs to the floors in the boys playroom and the repair or replacement of the flush toilets previously mentioned there are two major requirements in the maintenance of the building. The exterior walls of the building have cracked badly, apparently...\"\ndue to an earthquake which was experienced in this area several years ago. These cracks should be pointed with a water proof material immediately in order to prevent the seepage of rain and water from melting snow which will cause irreparable damage. The stairs which form the main approach to the building are in such bad condition that they are almost unusable. These should also be replaced this year. The window casings have in many places shrunk away from the walls causing a serious loss of heat and draughts in the rooms. When the cracks in the walls are pointed, the gaps between the window casings and the walls should be caulked.\n\nThe Principal reports that the power plant at the school is most unsatisfactory and hopes that at some time in the near future it will be possible to connect up with the power company line which will be running a few miles distant. In view of the considerable amount of repair work which the present school plant has required in the last year this would undoubtedly be the ideal solution. In addition to the cost factor it would supply the type of power for which the standard electrical devices are built to handle.\"\n\nWe realize that your engineers have done considerable work at this school in the past year and that more is planned for next year. Therefore, we are bringing these matters to your attention so that they can be advised of the present condition of the school.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nNOTE: This slip to be used for passing correspondence when the main file is charged out or is not required, and must not be removed but will be attached to the main file as soon as possible.\n\nRecords Service Division\n\nSlip No.: 1122\nIndian Affairs File No.: 155-0-5\n\nSubject of File: Kootenay Indian Res School\n\n| Date       | P.A. or B.F. | Initials | Referred To | For Remarks | Initials | Date   |\n|------------|--------------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|\n| 15.4.48 PA | 116          | EM       | 7.4.48      |             |          |        |\n\nIf action cannot be taken without file, please make statement to that effect and return paper to Records.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6454, file 884-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Kootenay Agency voucher No. 91 in the amount of $87.80 covering the supply of textbooks for use at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.

National Health & Welfare,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few days ago I wrote you to acknowledge the receipt of my final cheque on my retirement as Medical Officer in the Indian Department.\n\nI am now asking for information to whom I should address a letter in which a request is made to supply the Industrial School at The St. Eugene Mission at Cranbrook with an efficient electric supply, or perhaps you would be good enough to direct this letter to its proper destination.\n\nI understand that Father Kelly who is in charge at the School has already introduced the subject.\n\nAt the present time the school generates electricity by a Diesel machine. It is inadequate and obsolete.\n\nA high tension line stretches from the power plant at Bull River to Kimberley and passes about a distance of three miles from the Mission.\n\nIn an interview here with the Power Commissioner I learn that to take electricity from this source direct to the School would require the outlay of an expensive transformer equipment. The Commissioner suggested it would be more feasible to obtain electricity from the City of Cranbrook which also gets its supply from the East Kootenay Power Company.\n\nThe St. Eugene Mission is about five miles from Cranbrook. An efficient supply of electricity to the School would in many ways be a tremendous asset to the School. It is\nnot necessary for me to go into detail.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that the Department will realize the full importance of this undertaking and within the very near future make arrangements with the East Kootenay Power Company to supply the School with electricity.\n\nHoping you will accede to my request to forward this letter.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[F.

From time to time in the past the school management has suggested to us the advisability of securing Hydro power for the Kootenay School. The estimate of securing this service was always so high that we did not have the funds available.\n\nIt appears from Dr. Green's letter that he is of the opinion that electricity could be obtained cheaper direct from the City of Cranbrook rather than by obtaining it from the high tension line which passes approximately three miles from the school.\n\nAt your convenience you might get in touch with the municipal authorities at Cranbrook and ascertain if Dr. Green's suggestion could be carried out and if so, you should let me have an idea of the cost.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nPurchase Order No. 16574 B\n\nEast Kootenay Equipment Co., P.O.

Kelly,\nPrincipal of our school.\n\nDuring the past hockey season the two boys hockey\nteams made a very creditable showing in competition with\nlocal teams, winning the majority of games played. The\nschool has supplied the transportation and most of the\nequipment used with the exception of skates which the\npupils provided themselves.\n\nThe natural ability and willingness of the Kootenay\nIndians to partake in competitive sport is above average\nand I feel that every effort should be made to encourage\nthese activities for the school children. I would,\ntherefore, respectfully recommend that as much as pos-\nsible of the sporting equipment requisitioned be made\navailable.\n\nThe season for baseball, volleyball, football and\ncroquet for the girls is at hand and any supply of\nequipment for these games at your earliest convenience\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\nJ.

It is noted however that the Reverend Principal has requested equipment for sleighing and hockey. It has not been the policy of the Department in the past to supply this type of equipment but in view of the long winter period and the fact that sleighing and hockey are the two chief sports during that period I consider that they should be supplied.\n\nR.F.

Green to Indian Health Services that electricity for our Residential School would be obtained from the City of Cranbrook at less cost than from the East Kootenay Power Company. I approached the Cranbrook City Electrician, Mr. Burch, and the Alderman who is Chairman of the Lighting Committee.\n\nI have received no word from the City to date but Mr. Burch's opinion is that the six mile line required would cost $1250.00 per mile and that the City could not provide power as cheaply as could be supplied by the Power Company. He also doubted that the City would be in a position to construct or service such a project. A transformer at the school would be required at additional cost and the line loss over the distance would require a prohibitive tariff.\n\nJ. S.

In the report a number of items relative to the heating and plumbing systems were noted.\n\nSince the Donald Inspection Company have been charged with making a complete survey covering all phases, it is felt that no action should be taken with reference to the mechanical services in general, until their report and recommendations are received, except for the work required to provide a method of heating water for domestic purposes.\n\nIt is recommended, therefore, that a high test jacket heater be provided and installed in accordance with the following specification as soon as possible.\n\nOne only high test cast iron square sectional jacket heater having a capacity to heat 1200 gallons of water per hour through a 25\u00b0 temperature range. Heater to be constructed for a working pressure of 75 lbs. per square inch, and to be provided with a pressure relief valve and gate valve located on the cold water line to the existing domestic hot water storage tank. Connect heater to existing storage tank with piping full size of heater tappings. If necessary, tank tappings shall be increased in size to take this pipe. This heater shall be equal to Dominion Radiator size H-1-Wall.\n\nIt is estimated that the above heater and the installation will cost in the neighbourhood of $600.00. This equipment could be purchased through the Department for delivery to the school, and there is nothing involved in connecting it up that could not be handled by the Indian Agent.\n\nUpon receipt of a report from the Donald Inspection Company, it will likely be found that numerous other items will be noted which will require that more or less extensive revisions to mechanical services will be necessary.\n\nR.A.

Coal burning grate area 4.55 sq. ft. width not to exceed 42\". Pressure not to exceed 75 p.s.i.\n\nTenders were called for in Vancouver but local plumbing and heating establishments were unable to quote on a heater in accordance with these specifications, some of them being of the opinion that a heater of the capacity required based on a 25\u00b0F temperature rise was not made. Mr. Snelson indicated that in early May he had made an inspection of the boiler room at the Kootenay school and on May 10th submitted a report to Mr. Mills in Ottawa, including specifications on a suitable domestic hot water heater. May I suggest that the Department check with Mr. Mills' office on these specifications and if in order have the purchasing branch call for tenders.\n\nW.S.

Before this work is undertaken it is recommended that Father Kelly be requested to give dimensions of the new dormitory room and that authorization be secured from the Department for an increase in enrolment in line with the size of the room which will be made available. At a rate of 500 cubic feet of space per pupil a total of 7500 to 10,000 cubic feet would be required for the 15 to 20 pupil increase suggested by the Reverend Father. If this space can be made available it is recommended that the pupilage be increased from the present 100 and that the work suggested by Father Kelly be undertaken.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nJuly 8, 1946\n\nMr. R.F. Davey, Inspector of Schools,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Davey:\n\nAt the time of your visitation we discussed the necessity of further class-room space and additional dormitory space for this school. As at that time the junior class-room had an enrolment of fifty-six pupils and prospects for next year are that we will have from fifteen to twenty new pupils, we will need extra space for the coming year.\n\nYou are aware how hard it is even to get a contractor to give an estimate on any job to say nothing of doing it and these parts are no exception. However I was able to get the attached estimate from Mr. Lundy, a private contractor in Cranbrook who has a reputation of good work. A few years ago he was employed here by the Indian Affairs branch to re-roof the school and his work was quite acceptable. The attached estimate is to complete the third floor dormitory in the boys end of the building in the same manner as has been done in the girls in former years, plus a few alterations in the existing unused classroom, particularly the installation of blackboards. Mr. Lundy has promised to do this work next month and to have all in readiness for Sept. 7th.\n\nThis estimate does not provide for a toilet in the boys new dormitory, nor for desks in the classroom or paint for both rooms. As for the toilet I would suggest a sum of fifty dollars for its installation as we have on hand a tank and toilet bowl which can be used. There is no need of washbasins in that dormitory as all can come to the common wash-room on the second floor. As for desks we should have thirty-five suitable for grades four and five. An allowance of twenty-five dollars for paint should do both rooms. If the paint is provided we will gladly put it on ourselves.\n\nOur plans for the coming year, that is opening in Sept., are that the junior class-room retain grades 1, II, & III, the new class-room accommodated grades four and five, and the senior class-room grades VI, VII & VIII.\n\nIf funds can be provided for these projects it would greatly facilitate matters here, relieve the over-crowding in the junior class-room, and would mean a great deal in extending the efficiency and general standard of our school. If this matter\nKootenay Indian School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nJuly 23/48\n\nW.S. Arneil, Commissioner,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil: Re 5-11-3\n\nMany thanks for your letter of recent date regarding proposed alterations in dormitory and classroom space in this school. I am pleased to report as follows. When this school was built the third floor was left unfinished. In 1940 this floor was finished in the girls side of the building thus giving ample dormitory space. The proposition at present is to do likewise in the boys end of the building. As to the extra classroom the original plans called for this room to be used for manual training however as it is directly across the hall from a classroom it was found to be causing too much noise and hence a separate building was erected for manual training.\n\nThe proposed dormitory will give 9,600 cubic feet of space, which according to the requirements would provide for 19 extra pupils. The proposed classroom would give 10,500 cubic feet of space, which would accommodate 21 pupils.\n\nOur present allowance is for 100 pupils. With the alterations we could accommodate 19 or 20 more and by adding the third classroom could give a more efficient course of study as we could thereby have more of the children in school for the full teaching day.\n\nTrusting this information will be satisfactory and hoping to have a favorable reply at your earliest convenience as I would like very much to have this additional space available for the opening of school in September.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"G.F. Kelly\"\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing copies of letters dated July 8th and 23rd from Reverend G.F. Kelly, O.M.I., Principal, Kootenay Residential School, together with a memorandum dated July 15th from District School Inspector Davey in connection with a proposed increase in the authorized enrolment at the school and the provision of additional dormitory and classroom accommodation.\n\nApparently part of the third floor of the school is unfinished and the alterations suggested by Father Kelly will provide sufficient space for the accommodation of an additional 20 pupils. Providing funds are available for the alterations required I would recommend:\n\n(1) That the Department approve an expenditure of $1475.00 for the alterations necessary in accordance with the tender submitted by Mr. L. Lundy, Cranbrook attached hereto\n\n(2) That the Department approve an increase in the authorized enrolment at the school to 160 pupils.\nOTTAWA, July 30th, 1948.\n\nAttention: Colonel B.F.

Dunn, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn:\n\nFurther to our conversation of this afternoon I would like to take up the matter of proposing certain changes in the paint contractor in conjunction with the Kootenay Paint Co.\n\nI understand that their contract called for definite work on the exterior of the building plus painting the storm windows. On the basement floor of the building these windows fit on the outside and thus being exposed to the weather need this attention. However on the first, second, and third floors these storm windows fit on the inside of the present windows and not being exposed to the weather hardly seem in need of attention. You will remember from our examination of them that they are in good condition and the varnish stain on them does not show any serious signs of deterioration or checking. There are in all one hundred and two of these windows.\n\nThe proposition I discussed with the manager of the Kootenay Paint Co., and which I would be glad if you would take up with the Dept., if you deem it advisable, is to have interior painting done instead of doing the storm windows. The manager of the Paint Co estimated the labor involved in doing these one hundred and two windows and said he would be willing to apply a coat of sizing and two coats of paint to the main corridor of the building which measures 96 X 10 X 8 feet instead of doing the windows if such was agreeable to the Dept. He figured that the labor on either job would be approximately equal. You are acquainted with the present condition of the main corridor and I'm sure will agree that it is definitely in need of attention. I understand from members of the Staff who were here at the time that it was done in '38 or '39 with Murexco and has not been touched since. As the Murexco can not be washed it has in that time taken on a considerable coating of dust and disfigurements of various kinds.\n\nWhile I appreciate very much having the exterior of the building being renovated and I'm sure you will agree that it has taken on a decided improvement in appearance, I do feel that this slight change in the contract would be a definite advantage to the appearance of the building as a whole.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I. Principal.\nKootenay Agency,\nCranbrook, B. C.,\nOctober 9th, 1948\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B. C., P. O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Rev. G.F. Kelly,\nPrincipal of the Kootenay Residential School, which in\nitself is self-explanatory. A coat of varnish on the\nstorm windows would improve them considerably but as\nFather Kelly states this work is not essential at this\ntime.\n\nThe main corridor mentioned is poorly lighted\nand the buff walls do not improve this situation. Fur-\nther to painting the corridor, Father Kelly intends to\nhire the Kootenay Paint Contractors to paint the walls\nand ceiling of the new classroom at his own expense.\n\nThe new classroom is well lighted, the old double\ndesks have been cut to individual desks and they have\nbeen sanded, stained and varnished, the floor has been\ncleaned, stained and varnished. New blackboards and\nwainscoting installed, but the walls and ceiling are in\npoor condition.\n\nI am in agreement with Father Kelly that the\npainting of the hall and classroom is more important at\nthis time and trust you may be able to concur. I would\nalso respectfully request that the following expense of\nmaterials required be borne by the Department if at all\npossible. Mitchell's Hardware, Cranbrook, quote on paint\nfor 8,500 sq. ft., two coats.\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|---------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 10 gals. flat white @ $5.45 per gal. | $54.50   |\n| 2 qts. pale green \" 5.45 \" \"         | 2.73     |\n| 2 gals. ivory \" 5.45 \" \"             | 10.90    |\n| 6 lbs. size \" .45 per lb.            | 2.70     |\n\n$70.33\n\nJ.S.

We intend to have Hydro brought into this building next year and to replace the present direct current system.\n\nHowever, a visit from an Electrical Engineer will probably be required as plans and specifications will be required for a complete change in the wiring system.\n\n(4) Water System - It is presumed that your own engineers have noted the comments made in recommendations 1 and 4.\n(5) Out-Buildings - The replacement of the garages which are a fire hazard and the root house would seem to be items which can be handled by this Branch.\n\nIn conclusion, I would again like to recommend that this report be the subject of a discussion in the near future between officials of your Engineering and Construction Service and of our Education Division.\n\nActing Director.\nDecember 10, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S.

Dunn, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Dunn: Re: Replacement of heating coil for domestic hot water supply.\n\nA few days ago we suffered a break in the coil for heating domestic water. This coil is in the fire box of the heating furnace and during the winter months supplies hot water for the house thus saving fuel. Due to alkali in the water it periodically becomes clogged and breaks. The last break was three years ago at which time a new one was installed.\n\nI contacted Patmore Bros., plumbers, and they estimated the cost of sufficient three inch pipe and installation of same at fifty-five dollars.\n\nI would be pleased if you would request permission for this expenditure so that we can again have our hot water supply as soon as possible.\n\nWith sincere thanks, I remain,\n\ntruly yours,\n\nG.F.

If my memory serves me right it seems possible that we can get not only assistance in paying his salary but also that the Dept. will install time-clocks to insure careful guardianship of the building during the night hours. For our school I think two clocks would be sufficient, one in the engine-room and one on the main floor. If it is possible to have these supplied I would be pleased to receive them. Would you also inform as to the proper procedure regarding the salary and the amount allowed by the Dept.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: St. Joseph's Creek Pipeline - Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of December 24th we have received the memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs dated January 4, 1949 in which we are advised that a transfer of $200.00 will be made to complete the work on the St. Joseph's Creek pipeline at Kootenay Residential School.\n\nWe have not, however, yet received approval from you to accept the offer of Messrs. Patmore Brothers of Cranbrook, B.C. to complete the pipework inside the school at a cost of $560.00. This matter appears to be urgent as it will take this Firm about two months to obtain the necessary material and we would like to have the installation completed during the present fiscal year.\n\nCould we now please have approval to accept this tender.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.

The usual allowance is for a period of seven months at $60. a month.\n\nFrom time to time some officials have expressed the opinion that an allowance for night watchmen should be paid at all Government-owned Residential Schools.\n\nWe have just received a request for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at the Kootenay School which school we have not previously made any allowance. We are aware that practically all our schools employ a special night watchman during the heating season and we feel that it would be in the best interest of all parties concerned for the Department to allow a grant towards the salary of the night watchman at these schools at which no allowance is made at the present time.\n\nI would appreciate having your approval.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/HM.\nAIR MAIL\n\n29th January, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe recently received a request from the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School for an allowance towards the salary of the night watchman, effective 1st January, 1949.\n\nFor several years past we have been allowing a grant towards the salary of a night watchman for the period October to the following April at those Schools where we considered a definite fire hazard existed. The schools at which this allowance is being paid were selected some years ago, and no recent additions have been made to the list. As a matter of fact, we are not making any allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at any of the Government-owned Residential Schools in the province of British Columbia.\n\nWhen we received the Principal's request, we submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Minister asking his opinion regarding the payment of an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman. His reply was as follows:\n\n(1) Allowance must not be paid to a present member of the staff.\n(2) Allowance must be paid only to schools which are certified by an engineer as subject to special danger by fire.\n\nIn the case of the Kootenay Residential School, I note the following statement contained in the report submitted to us by Donald Inspection Limited in connection with their inspection of the Kootenay Residential School on 11th September, 1948:\n\n......2\n\"In addition to this, there should also be an elevated water tank of not less than 20,000 gallons capacity. At present a small air pump pumps pressure to a tank which has been buried in the ground. So long as it is only used for domestic purposes there should be no trouble, but should you have a fire and any quantity of water is taken from this tank, the pressure is dropped and no water will be available for fire fighting purposes.\"\n\nIn view of this report which was made by an engineer, it would appear that the Kootenay Residential School might be considered as one at which an allowance could be made towards the salary of the night watchman during the months mentioned in the first part of my letter.\n\nHowever, when we allow a grant for a night watchman at one school, we generally receive similar requests from other schools, and consequently before replying to the Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, we would like to have your comments and at the same time, you might state if you consider there are any other Government-owned schools in British Columbia at which any such allowance should be made, keeping in mind the conditions laid down by the Deputy Minister.\n\nBernard F.

Perry of the Public Health Engineering Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare, Vancouver, B.C., we have received the following from Mr. Cornish which deals with this report of Mr. Perry and gives a little more information:\n\n\"The only proposed uses of unchlorinated creek water not covered in the report are for feeding stock in the barn and for cooling milk in the dairy. Untreated creek water is now used for these purposes. I understand that there is no objection from a public health point of view to use polluted water for feeding stock, that is, no pollution can be carried from the drinking water to the milk. However, such water should not be used for cleaning cows and precautions will need to be taken on that point. At present there are several exposed taps in the barn and these are to be eliminated if possible otherwise reduced to the essential minimum size marked. The troughs for cooling water should have covers with holes through which the milk cans are inserted so that there is no exposed water surface. It should be borne in mind that the installation to supply creek water to the barn and dairy are to be made by school authorities and that this Division will not be responsible for such work.\"\n\nIndian Affairs are advised to see that the recommendations of Mr. Perry and Mr. Cornish are carried out in order that the contaminated water from St. Joseph's Creek shall not be used in its raw state in a manner which might affect the health of those using it.\n\nR.A.

Father Kelly. The main topic of conversation was, of course, the possibility of having this school connected with the East Kootenay Power line at the Wasa substation.\n\nYou will recall that in our Estimates we have the sum of $8,100 for this purpose, together with an item for $2,000 to effect the minor improvements to the school wiring, etc. I really feel it is imperative that the school get the benefit of East Kootenay Power. The present arrangements for ironing, which are really pathetic, should be replaced and other electrical services which are not possible under the present system provided. I am quite sure we can utilize the present diesel engine which generates power at present to good advantage elsewhere.\n\nThis letter is merely to remind you of this matter and in the hope that it will remain in the Estimates and enable us to go ahead with this much needed improvement at as early a date as possible.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n9th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of 1st March, 1949, with reference to electricity for the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nFor your personal information I may say that we included an amount of $10,000.00 in the main appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50 for the purpose mentioned. Our estimates have not yet been approved by Parliament, but I feel certain that the amount will be allowed.\n\nHowever, on reviewing our file, I found your letter of 28th August, 1948, enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to Superintendent Dunn from the East Kootenay Power Company, Limited. In your letter you recommend a three phase line on which the power company quoted a price of $10,893.20 and as a matter of fact, this amount was not a firm bid.\n\nWe note from your letter of 1st March, 1949, that you estimate the cost of the improvements to the school wiring to be $2,000.00. On the prices quoted the total expenditure would be approximately $13,000.00. It is our intention to make every effort to secure the additional amount over and above what has already been provided in the appropriation, but in the meantime, I think it would be to our mutual advantage if you could secure the following information:\n\n.......2\n1. Another quotation from the East Kootenay Power Company, giving a firm bid if possible on the cost of supplying a three phase line to the Kootenay School.\n\n2. A quotation from two or more reliable electricians, tendering on the electrical work required to effect the necessary improvements to the school wiring.\n\nIt is possible that Mr. Webb of the Lands and Development Services Branch has already made some enquiries along the above lines, as following receipt of the Donald Inspection Company report on the Kootenay School, we wrote to the Lands and Development Services Branch.

I think, however, that in the case of the Lejac School we will let the matter stand, unless the matter of an allowance is raised by the Principal.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n15th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant regarding the request for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at the Kootenay Residential School. In view of your recommendation, we are advising Superintendent Dunn that an allowance of $60.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman will be allowed for the period 1st January to 30th April, 1949.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\n15th March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.S. Dunn,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nWe recently received a request from Rev. G.F. Kelly, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman. In connection with the request, I may say that the Deputy Minister has ruled as follows:\n\n(1) Allowance for a night watchman must not be paid to a present member of the staff.\n\n(2) Allowance must be paid only to schools which are certified by an engineer as subject to special danger by fire.\n\nWe wrote to Indian Commissioner Arneil and he has recommended that we make an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman, due to the fact that one of the Departmental engineers recently reported that there is a fire hazard at the Kootenay School. We presume from the contents of Father Kelly's letter that the man employed is not one of the regular members of the staff.\n\nIn view of the above, it has been decided to allow $60.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman at the Kootenay School for the period 1st January to 30th April, 1949. For your information I may say that at schools where an allowance is made...\ntowards the salary of a night watchman, it is our usual practice to make this payment from 1st October to the following 30th April. However, as Father Kelly's letter stated that the night watchman only commenced duties on 1st January, 1949, we are only making allowance for four months.\n\nBefore the next heating season commences if you consider conditions warrant such assistance, you should apply in September for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman for the period 1st October, 1949, to 30th April, 1950.\n\nFor your guidance I enclose a sample of the Voucher which should be forwarded.\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F.
