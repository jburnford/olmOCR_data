This we have done, and even as it is, the report is not totally what is desired, but owing to the unusually tardy submission by the School, we are forwarding it herewith, with several amendments noted.\n\nWe have asked the school to prepare the usual admission and discharge summary and when this is to hand it will go forward. Apparently the Sister who has done this report the past several years is no longer at the school and her successor has found much difficulty in compiling the report.\n\nTwo Wawea children were admitted Oct. 25th, but they were omitted from the report by the school and they have agreed to enter on report for 31st March, retro-actively.\n\nJ.G.

However, we are writing her, impressing upon her that we can perhaps assist until June, but thereafter the responsibility for Gladys will remain entirely in her hands.\n\nnp/\nc.c. to Mrs. Tookanay,\nSchreiter, Ontario.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT THE WILSON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1947\n\n#### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |                        |\n| 452 | Magotika, Mile I.     | Sep 6/49 B        | 105                   |                    |                        |\n| 444 | Shagamish, Clifford I.| Aug 7/49          | 41                    |                    |                        |\n| 459 | Tookney, Victoria     | Aug 9/49          | 150                   |                    |                        |\n| 445 | Tookney, Felix        | Aug 6/49          | 6                     |                    |                        |\n| 447 | Fenagle, Isadore      | Aug 6/49          | 388                   |                    |                        |\n| 446 | Danielson, Conrad     | Aug 14/49         | 210                   |                    |                        |\n| 448 | Moses, Joseph         | Aug 9/49          | 143                   |                    |                        |\n| 449 | Moses, Arthur         | Aug 6/49          | 6                     |                    |                        |\n\nNote: One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10), Volume 6199, File 464-10, part 2\n| No. | Name                  | Band | State of Education | Periods in the School | Date of Discharge | Remarks |\n|-----|-----------------------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------|\n|     |                       |      |                    |                       |                   |         |\n|     |                       |      |                    |                       |                   |         |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n**Notes:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10, Volume 6196, File 464-10, part 2)\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Band | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| 438 | Martin, Glen A.       | Sept. 1, 1949     | 12   | XI.1               | Taken out by their Father |\n| 439 | O'Gorman, James       |                   |      |                    | Did not return after holidays |\n| 440 | J.

The compiling authority at the school was going to include these two admissions retro-actively on the 31st March return (to Oct.25th), and we have been holding the admission orders here until the quarterly report for period ending 31st March was received from the school. However, these Admission Orders are now enclosed.\n\nRegarding the admission orders on the other listed pupils, we have checked out records and find we only have the required copy for our office, the originals having been mailed to you with the Quarterly Return for the period ending 30th Sept., that being the quarter of the year in which they were received into admission at the Res.

However, as this report (covering period ending 31st Dec.) was just received and is so late we do not choose to delay it further, so am submitting same as is.\n\nI have not had time to thoroughly check the background of these children, also the financial aspects of the parents, but the children are about one half Indian, but are not holding memberships in any of our recognized bands.

However, in view of the information contained in the last paragraph of your letter of March 4th, we are doubtful if they are eligible for admission as grant earning pupils to an Indian Residential School.

The Starr children had been attending a Public School at Coldwell, Ontario, and were urgently in need of the proper guidance. The Wilson children do live at Gull Bay Reserve at times, but the parents are terrible wanderers and when they move on to hunt, or fish, they take all their children with them. Therefore we suggested that these two younger children be placed in Boarding School. We are unable to have the parents sign this form at the present time, as they are off in the bush somewhere trapping.\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nSuperintendent.\nDecember 18, 1950.\n\nMr. J.G.

Soy (principal) of the White River School, regarding Percy Hannanish who resides approximately 1\u00bd miles from White River. In reply I wish to advise that I contacted the principal of the St. Joseph's Boarding School and they informed me that they would be very pleased to have the boy enrolled at the school. I have written to the parents of the boy today suggesting that he be sent up after the Christmas holidays.\n\nFor your information, I may say that I have spoken to the boy's father, Frank Hannanish regarding the child attending Boarding School and he was not very favourably inclined. Mr. Hannanish feels that the boy should live at home as Percy is crippled and he is invariably teased by the other boys, but I will try and persuade Mr. Hannanish to allow the boy to attend Boarding School.\n\nI have sent a copy of this letter to Miss Foy at White River School.\n\n(Sgd) J.W.

G. Burk,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Burk,\n\nSome days ago your office informed us that the Dept., had issued orders to have the names of our High School pupils included in the regular quarterly report. We have done this in the case of Mary and Robert Michano. Annie Fisher was not admitted until the end of October.\n\nYou may recall telephoning us at the beginning of September stating that you were unable to procure accommodation for these pupils in a private home and requested us to admit them here until such time as different and suitable arrangements were made. We were under the impression the same remuneration would be forthcoming as if they were in a private home. Incidentally the lady with whom Robert was stationed last year told us that she could not to use her own words, \"make ends meet\" at the rate of $40.00 per month and for this reason had refused to accept him this year.\n\nOur overhead expenditures are exorbitant and we feel that you will agree with us that the per diem rate paid by the Dept., is very meagre when one considers the present high cost of living.\n\nPerhaps it would be well to make a further effort to procure accommodation for these students since the Department apparently is in favour of paying the private individual rather than the institution.\n\nLooking forward to an early reply for which we thank you in advance.\n\nYours very truly,\nPORT WILLIAM INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nM. Thomasina (Sister) Sup't.\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\nDecember 8th 1951.\n\nRes: Your file #464-10 (E6)\nletter dated Nov. 14/51\n\nFurther to your letter dated as above I am enclosing herewith copy of letter received from Rev. Sister M. Thomasina, Superintendent of the Fort William Indian Residential School, which is self-explanatory.\n\nRobert Michano who was boarded out last year in a private home was refused lodging this year as the lady concerned informed me that she could not \"make ends meet\" at $40.00 a month. Under the existing circumstances would you kindly reconsider your decision and allow the Fort William Residential School $35-$40.00 per month for each of the three Indian boarders, namely Robert Michano, Mary Michano and Annie Fisher, who are attending St. Patrick's High School, Fort William, Ontario.\n\nWhen these children came into town it was absolutely impossible to secure any private homes in which to place them. Rev. Sister Thomasina very kindly stated she would take them in until such time as we could secure suitable lodgings; this has been impossible to do.\n\nJ. O. Burk,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nencl.\n| Name                  | Date of Admission | School During | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| T086 - Schum, Gertrude | Sep. 1, 1959      | Long Lac      | R.C.               | Longlac Day           |\n| OR87 - Bohum, Maryann |                   |               |                    |                       |\n| OR88 - Legarde, Lilian |                   |               |                    |                       |\n| OR89 - Dor\u00e9, Eliza    |                   |               |                    |                       |\n| OR90 - Dor\u00e9, Isabel   |                   |               |                    |                       |\n| OR92 - Desmoulins, Irene |                 |               |                    |                       |\n| OR92 - Sinoway, Marie |                   |               |                    |                       |\n| OR93 - Boucher, Victoria |                |               |                    |                       |\n| OR94 - Shaganash, Georgia |              |               |                    |                       |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n| Name                  | Date of Discharge | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| T086 - Schum, Gertrude |                   |                        |\n| OR87 - Bohum, Maryann |                   |                        |\n| OR88 - Legarde, Lilian |                   |                        |\n| OR89 - Dor\u00e9, Eliza    |                   |                        |\n| OR90 - Dor\u00e9, Isabel   |                   |                        |\n| OR92 - Desmoulins, Irene |               |                        |\n| OR92 - Sinoway, Marie |                   |                        |\n| OR93 - Boucher, Victoria |              |                        |\n| OR94 - Shaganash, Georgia |             |                        |\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT P.E.William Indian Residential School During September 30, Quarter 1952\n\n| Name          | Date of Birth | Age | Sex | Race | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|---------------|--------------|-----|-----|------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Zanecey, Albert | July 13      | 159 | M   | R.C. | N.M.I.              |                       |\n| Peters, James  | Aug. 24      | 7   | M   | L    | Mary L.             |                       |\n| Legarde, Mack Oliver | Sept. 1 | 10 | M   | L    | Rose D.             |                       |\n| Legarde, Gilbert | Nov. 1      | 8   | M   | L    | Harriet L.          |                       |\n| Esquiman, Gordon | Jan. 13     | 221 | M   | L    | Madeleine           |                       |\n| Esquiman, Stanley | Jan. 11    | 111 | M   | L    |                    |                       |\n| Esquiman, Norman | Jan. 7      | 180 | M   | L    |                    |                       |\n| Tovechahig, Allan | Jan. 8     | 1   | M   | L    |                    |                       |\n| Tovechahig, Lee | Jan. 8      | 1   | M   | L    |                    |                       |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| Name          | Date of Discharge | Age | Sex | Race | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----|-----|------|------------------------|\n| Zanecey, Albert | July 13           | 159 | M   | R.C. | N.M.I.                 |\n| Peters, James  | Aug. 24           | 7   | M   | L    | Mary L.                |\n| Legarde, Mack Oliver | Sept. 1 | 10 | M   | L    | Rose D.                |\n| Legarde, Gilbert | Nov. 1       | 8   | M   | L    | Harriet L.             |\n| Esquiman, Gordon | Jan. 13      | 221 | M   | L    | Madeleine              |\n| Esquiman, Stanley | Jan. 11    | 111 | M   | L    |                       |\n| Esquiman, Norman | Jan. 7      | 180 | M   | L    |                       |\n| Tovechahig, Allan | Jan. 8     | 1   | M   | L    |                       |\n| Tovechahig, Lee | Jan. 8      | 1   | M   | L    |                       |\nDecember 11, 1951\n\nMr. J.G.

I presume it costs on an average $400 or a year to maintain a day school. Having Lake and district are entitled to 6 such schools - five on rainy Lake proper and one to the south. (Two of these schools are already in operation, appropriations have been voted for two more, and Indians have approached me with regard to a fifth). The maintenance of these six schools would mean an annual expenditure of at least $2,400.\n\nA good Boarding School or an Industrial School on a limited scale could be maintained on this amount until such time as circumstances would call for further development.\n\nIt is therefore a question of suppressing the day schools in that district, and by combination, all energies in one institution obtain tangible and lasting results.\n\nI shall further observe that the Roman Catholic is the only religious influence exercised over that district where are no conflicting interests in the way.\n\nAnother conclusion we arrived at was that the establishment of a school at that point would probably do away with this once cherished for a portion of Father's Point, the old Mission, and Rockville. This had in view of conserving by a very few men an ancient landmark of mission civilization, one of the most ancient forts being there by its great services obtained.\n\nTrusting these few remarks may help solving within the limits of my station what is becoming a serious problem.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. FRC 10, Volume 6197, file 465-1, part 1\n132830\n\nWat Portage, Ont. 5th Oct. 1878.\n\nHon. J. S. Wills,\nSubl. General of Indian Affairs,\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nHaving had occasion lately to speak to His Grace Archbishop Langevin & Mr. Boniface in reference to certain Indian schools in the Rainy Lake district, over which I have charge, the matter was deemed of sufficient importance to be brought to your notice.\n\nThere is question of constructing a number of new schools at Sioux River Reserve and on \"Red But\" Reserve respectively on Rainy Lake. Application has also been made for a new schoolhouse on Cuthbertson River, valued at \u00a31,000. The money for the first two schools has already been voted, and the Indians are pressing for the construction of these schools, but as it is not an admirable system of day schools in some cases, I have neglected so far to bring the matter on the Department's attention to come to the point. I consider that the amount called for to be expended on Rainy Lake alone (Cuthbertson \u00a31,000, \"Red But\" and Sioux River combined \u00a3600), would be sufficient, in view of exceptional facilities, to provide for a well appointed Boarding School or an Industrial School on a small scale.\n\nThe facilities I allude to are the buildings and grounds pertaining to the Cuthbertson Agency. This Agency, by its nature, is not centrally nor conveniently located for its present purpose\u2014it is nearly two miles from Fort Frances where the central and railway lines for the district this Agency is intended to serve. The present Agent Mr. Cornish has pointed this out more than once to Mr. Reid and begged to be fixed in the throat. He also drew my attention to the advantages and...\nIt is, however, a matter of great uncertainty, owing to the demands made upon the Government for school purposes, whether funds could even be found for increasing the Fort William School, to say nothing of getting funds for an additional Institution.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nDep't. Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant addressed to the Hon. Mr. Dely, submitting a proposition for the establishment of a Boarding School at Fort Frances or Rat Portage. In reply I beg to say that I have been directed by the Superintendent General to inform you that the Department is fully alive to the advantages which would accrue from the establishment of such an Institution in the Neighboring District, but I consider it not in view of the fact that the Roman Catholic authorities at Fort William have just completed a large Institution there, aided by a Government Grant, it would hardly be justified in asking Parliament at present for a similar grant for a school in the locality in which we are situated, especially in view of the fact that there will be room for fully 75 additional pupils more than are now provided for at Fort William. It is therefore considered that it would be better, instead of erecting new buildings at Rat Portage to send the children to Fort William, and this course commends itself to the Department for other reasons, one of which is that the other denominations which are carrying on work in the same district would naturally feel entitled to the privileges.\n\nYours,\n\nC. Cahill, O.M.I.\n\nRat Portage, Ont.;\nOctober 1st, 1907\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the recent decision made by the Board of Directors.

Being an answer to a Departmental letter it left it to be understood that instead of these grants provision would be made for the ten additional boarders. This occurred after the estimates had left this office for Ottawa and it was left to the Department to make such rectifications as were necessary. The School authorities are naturally under the impression that they will not be required to send back home these ten pupils which they have had for six months, at the expiration of this year;\n\nJ.D.

David Paton,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to point out that the estimate for the current fiscal year contain a provision for only 20 boarders for the Rat Portage Boarding School whilst our Draft Estimates provided for thirty-five. At the present moment there are thirty boarders, the number authorized by your semi-official letter of the 17th of June 1898 in answer to a letter of the 13th of the same month. All the data in this connection are in the possession of the Department and you will remember that although the provision last year was for only 20 boarders owing to the closing of some day schools and the intention on the part of the R.C. authorities not to urge the establishment of new ones at places where they would be of no benefit, that the number of pupils was increased to 30. If the number for the current year must remain at 20, it will be impossible to expect the Principal to maintain 30 pupils upon the provisions now in force. The pupils will have to be returned to their homes after hardly two years' stay at the school, and the money expended will simply have been thrown away.\n\nI therefore take the liberty to urge the necessity of restoring the original figures placed in our draft estimates.\n\nViz:\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 10th August, 1899\n\nThe Acting Secretary:\n\nA letter has been received from the Commissioner's office, dated the 4th inst., calling the attention to the fact that only 20 pupils are provided for at the Rat Portage Boarding school in the current year's estimates.\n\nIn June '98 the Commissioner was instructed to authorize the school to take up to 30 pupils and they now have that number on the roll and I think they should be allowed to keep them.

I presume the matter can be rectified by your calling the attention of the Department to their agreement on this point.

Payment was made for 20 pupils only, that being the number provided for, no authority being given to pay for an additional 10 as was done for two preceding years. Fifteen additional pupils were provided for by the Commissioner for this school, but were disallowed here, leaving the number provided for at 20. The school had 35 pupils on the roll and it seems to me that it is as much entitled to payment for 30 now as it was two years ago when it started.

These same Indians are now now left without the means of Education except one or two day school which they are willing to close down at the opening of a boarding school.\n\n3. The distance and difficulties of communicating with the boarding School at Rat Portage and at St. Boniface are such that it cannot be expected that the Indians of this District will ever avail themselves of the advantages held out to them at those Schools.\n\n4.

Allard O.M.I., T.S.,\nin charge of Catholic missions of the Rainy Lake District.\nHonourable Clifford Wilson,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI have the honour to recommend most earnestly that a boy and Indian boarding school be established at or near Fort Frances on behalf of the Indians of the seven surrounding Ring Reserves of the Rainy Lake District viz., the Constance Bay, the Red Butte, the La Perouse, the Cross Lake and the Little Portage Reserve with accommodations for at least thirty pupils, so it would be easy to secure an average of four or five children of school age from each of the reserves above mentioned. My reasons for this respectful request are the following viz:\n\n1. The location of the intended Indians for such a school at Fort Frances, under the\nThe Secretary,\n\nIn reference to the application from Rev. Father Allard of Fort Francis for the establishment of a boarding school at that place I beg to say that the total number of children of school age in the Couchiching Agency is shown by the last census to be 138, of whom 97 reside on the reserves referred to by Father Allard. There are day schools in operation at Couchiching, Cross Lake and Little Forks and provision is being made in next year's estimates for one at Stanagecong. There are 50 children enrolled at the three schools now in operation but the only one of these conducted under Roman Catholic auspices is at Couchiching, Cross Lake being Methodist and Little Forks Church of England. The census shows that half the Christian members of the bands in the Couchiching Agency are Roman Catholics, may 13%, the remainder being Methodists and Anglicans, but by far the greater number of Indians are still pagans.\n\nIn connection with this application I beg to refer you to my memorandum of the 9th May last and the ruling of the Deputy Minister thereon.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

His Grace asks for a grant for 20 children at $72 per head and as I take he will not make further demands for five years for an increase. The present arrangement provides an education for 46 children at the two days schools he proposes to close at $600.00 a year, while if the boarding school were established, only 20 would be taken at a cost of $1440.00 a year and the remaining 26 would be cut off from all chance of receiving an education.\n\nIf the local Agent and Indian Commissioner are in favor of this school, as stated by His Grace, this is the first intimation the Department has had of it.\n\nThe question of establishing a boarding school at Fort Frances has been before the Department on two previous occasions. The first time was in May 1900 when the Deputy Minister made a note on the memorandum prepared by me saying that the Department \"cannot authorize any grant for school at Fort Frances with one at Port Arthur (Pt William) and Rat Portage so near\". In December of the same year, Rev. Father Allard renewed this application when he was informed that in accordance with the memorandum of the Deputy Minister above quoted,\n\nOn a late memorandum prepared by me the Deputy Minister makes the following note to the Supt. General:\u2014\"I think this demand for boarding schools is growing too fast and it would be well to call a halt for a few years until the whole question can be gone into.\" This was approved of by the Ministe\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 11th November, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the application hereunder dated the 6th instant from His Grace, Archbishop Langevin for the establishment of a boarding school at Fort Frances, Ontario, I beg to say:\n\n1. That I do not consider that another boarding school in this neighborhood is required. The Roman Catholics have schools of this class at Rat Portage and Fort William, and the Indians of the five reserves who have asked for a boarding school, as stated by His Grace, are not likely to be benefited to any great extent by sending their children to a boarding school, as hunting, fishing, and working in the lumber camps is what they have to look forward to as means to obtaining a livelihood, the land on their reserves being unfit for farming. Life in a boarding school will not fit them for the hardships they will have to endure in following these avocations.\n\n2.

These schools are doing well; the former having enrolled all the children of school age (27) with an average attendance of 16; while the latter has an enrollment of 16 out of a school population of 19, with an average of 10 for last year.

The interior is plastered except the ceilings which are of wood. The main building is 36 x 30 ft., 3 stories high, with an extension at the south end, 36 x 26 ft., 2 stories high; also attached to the rear of the main building is a lean-to kitchen, 16 x 14 ft.\n\nThe other buildings are: Principal's residence, 20 x 16 ft., with lean-to, 14 x 12 ft.; Workshop, 22 x 16 ft.; Stable and carriage shed, 16 x 18 ft.; Woodshed, 20 x 12 ft.; and dog house for visiting Indians, 18 x 14 ft.\n\nAccommodation: There is suitable accommodation for 40 pupils and 40 of the staff.\nOttawa, February 26, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Supt.

The Superior said that they were no longer able to retain them as grant-earners and asked that they should be recognised by the Department.\n\nMr. McKenzie was informed that the authorities of this school were well aware when they received these children that they were not entitled to draw the grant for them, and if they were not willing to keep them they should not have taken them in.\n\nSister Rachambeault brought this matter again to the notice of the Department in October, last, when she received a similar reply. She has written again asking that the Department may reconsider its decision and allow these pupils to be enrolled as grant earners. They are orphans and have no one to look after them, and it would be an act of charity to provide for them. As the grant for this school has been increased from 30 to 40 pupils and they have not that number as yet on the roll, these two orphan children right, under the circumstances described, be received as grant earners on the understanding that this concession is not to form a precedent.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa 13th December, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to direct your attention to your letter of the 25th September 1906 in which you drew the Department's attention to the case of two little half-breed girls who are at the Pat Portage Boarding School. You spoke of these children as having either father or mother, and stated that they were totally without protection, having no means to care for them, for which reason you recommended that they be taken into custody. The Daily Superintendent of the Institution then writing the Department reported to me that two children on the 28th October last returned to the fact that their wants are living but too poor to earn them. The Board will advise that you will kindly at once look carefully into this case and report definitely which statement is correct. It is impossible to deal with the case properly until the actual facts are known.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nP.S.

One of the girls is named Annie, Chahyer, whose father is supposed to be alive, & is aged between 7&8 years. The other is named Mary Louise Copier, and has no father or mother, aged between 8 & 9. years\n\nIf this cannot be done the Principal will have to try to get them into some orphanage, or some such institution.

As this school has had the number of authorized pupils increased by 10 and as this is a deserving case, I am of opinion that the department would be quite justified in allowing them to be placed on the roll as grant earners, as the school can hardly afford to maintain them and if they are discharged there is no place for them to go. In one instance both father and mother are dead and in the other case the father has abandoned the mother, who is unable to support her daughter.\n\nI beg to refer you to my previous memorandum on this subject, of November 30, last.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, January 3, 1907.\nthis case is one which should be so dealt with.

This\nas I have already pointed out to you can not well be done, unless,\nas I strongly recommend, they be received into treaty as Indians.\n\nIn conclusion I may refer to a letter of the 24th October, 1899\n(Pyle No 180148/1) written by Mr Smart to Commissioner Laird,\nin which it was stated that the Minister could not approve of the\nabsolute rule which Mr Laird had laid down that none but treaty\nchildren should be admitted into Indian Schools.\n\nThe letter read as follows\u2014-----------------\"A well defined\n\"line can be drawn between half-breeds, properly speaking,\n\"and Indians, and while the Minister does not consider that the\n\"children of half-breeds proper, of Manitoba and the Territories,\n\"should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the\n\"Department, still he is decidedly of the opinion that all\n\"children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not,\n\"who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either\n\"side live as Indians upon a reserve, even if they are not\n\"annuitants, should be eligible for admission to schools. It\n\"should be remembered in this connection that boarding and\n\"industrial schools were not established for the purpose of\n\"carrying out the terms of treaty, or complying with any provision\n\"of the law, but that they were instituted in the public interest,\n\"so that there should not grow up upon reserves an uneducated\n\"and barbarous class.\" The North West Government can not\n\"provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves,\n\"and if we should exclude them from our schools, they would\n\"practically be debarred from all means of education.\"\n\nWhile the foregoing does not approve of half-breed children,\nwhose parents do not live upon reserves as Indians, being admitted\nto the schools, yet it takes into consideration the fact that\nthere are circumstances under which in all justice half-breed\nchildren should be admitted to such Institutions; and I have\nquoted therefrom in order that you may have the full facts before\nyou, and also as I consider this the ruling in question strengthen\nmy view of the case.\n\nI have been accustomed to deal with cases of this nature\nupon the grounds of humanity and expediency, rather than rules\nlaid down by law, written or unwritten. It seems to me that this\nOn the 15th October last Agent McKenzie reported that No 48 of the Wabigoon Band has two children, a boy and a girl. He stated\u2014\n\n\"Their father is now dead. He was a White man, and this woman has been a member of that band all her life, and has lived on the reserve, all but about three years which she lived with her husband until he died.\n\n\"One of these children has been admitted to the Kenora Boarding School by authority of the Commissioner's letter of the 12th October, 1906, No 123/53, and this is to ask if it would not be as well to have these children admitted to treaty, and their money funded for them.\n\n\"No 59 of the same band has also an orphan boy the son of an Indian woman, but the father was a White man, and is now dead, the mother being married to No 59, this boy has also been admitted to the Kenora School, on authority of the same letter above. Could this boy be admitted to Treaty also, as he is to all intents an Indian?\n\n\"No 57 has also a little girl. Illegitimate, that should be in treaty, for the same reason as the others, and her annuity funded for her. Kindly instruct me in regard to these children.\"\n\nIn each of the cases cited by Mr McKenzie, as above mentioned, the Department approved of admission to treaty (upon the understanding of course that no arrears were to be paid).\n\nOnce admitted to treaty all of the individuals referred to become Indians in the eye of the law, and are entitled to all the privileges accorded such persons. The two children whose case is under consideration are, according to Agent McKenzie's report of the 23rd September 1905 (File 12992/1), the offspring of Indians who withdrew from Treaty. He states \"they have no relatives in this district or any one to look after them\", and he adds still further\u2014\"As the children in question are totally without any protection or any one to care for them, and are to all intents and purposes Indians I would suggest that the suggestion of the Lady Superior be acted upon viz\u2014 to arrange\nMemorandum:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nPursuant to our conversation regarding the case of the two little half-breed girls who are at present at the Kenora Boarding School, and who it would appear were taken into the Institution in 1904 by the Lady Superior, as an act of charity, I beg to set forth the following facts, which I think are sufficient to prove that in the present case (which may be regarded as exceptional, the children being orphans, and having no one to care for them if sent away from the Institution, which has been proposed) the Department would be quite justified in admitting them to treaty, placing them on the pay-list, which would entitle them to become grant earners at the school.\n\nIn September 1905 Inspector Chisholm reported to the Department, in connection with annuity payments at the Carlton agency, (File No 156710/7 A) regarding certain individuals who he considered should be admitted to treaty. With respect to the following he stated:\u2014 \"No 131. The woman on this ticket has been twice legally married. Her first husband was a half-breed, by whom she had two boys, who are now living with their grand-mother, No 89, a helpless widow, nor is the mother with her present husband any better able to support them. Of course these are not illegitimates, but if any such cases can be considered I would recommend that these be taken into treaty.\"\n\nThe Department after duly considering the matter approved of these two half-breed boys being taken into treaty, and the Inspector was instructed accordingly.\n\nThe Inspector also brought forward the following case:\u2014\n\n\"No 133 Keeneequonaseew.

As his school has ample room for that number,\n\nSome time ago we could not get sufficient pupils for the schools, but now that the Indians are willing to send their children, it is hard to turn them away, which if done will soon have a very detrimental effect, on securing pupils when required, and would recommend if at all possible they be allowed the number of pupils asked for.\n\nI may add that the same thing applies to the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding school. In fact both these schools have at present several children, in the schools over and above the number allowed them, rather than turn them away, and for which they do not receive any grant.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval, and that you will be pleased to allow both these schools seventy pupils in future.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.,\nOttawa Ont.:\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Kenora Boarding School, dated November 26, 1918.

It is noted that under the Department's requirements in regard to the air space in the dormitories your school has only accommodation for sixty pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The reasons he gives for the proposed change are as follows:\n\n1. Parents complain that the school is too far away from them and they do not care to let the children go, for that reason.\n\n2. The land on the Lake is much better and a far greater amount of self help could be secured.\n\n3. It would make the Principal's work lighter and keep him at home more if it were not for the incessant long trips made necessary by the duty of distributing and collecting pupils as well as visiting people on reserves, who require the ministerial supervision.\n\nThese reasons for the desired change of location are worthy of consideration from a church standpoint. It may be more difficult for the Department to see their interest in the proposed change. To be plain what is aimed at is likely to put one school at McIntosh for the accommodation of the Savarte Agency and one at Big Island for the benefit of the Kenora Agency. This would extend and consolidate ecclesiastic control of the educational institutions of western Ontario and add to the prestige and honor of the Catholic Church. One cannot but admire the breadth of view these people have and who after all is so well qualified to boost these schools as the Catholic sisterhood.\n\nDate of Inspection, October 4th, 1916.\nOttawa, November 5, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report on your recent inspection of the Kenora Boarding School regarding the proposal of the principal to dispose of the present building and reestablish the school on a reserve, I beg to say that this has been noted.\n\nThe Department is not in a position to consider this change at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. J. Sommese,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMemorandum.\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen.\n\nAugust 2, 1919.\n\nIncl.\n\nThe attached letter from the Archbishop of St. Boniface suggests that the Government might buy the Indian boarding school property at Kenora for use as a home for disabled soldiers, and erect two new school buildings, one on the Lake of the Woods and the other near McIntosh Station, in the Savanne agency.\n\nThe buildings at Kenora are owned by the Church, and I see no indication in the letter that the Church would propose to meet the cost of the erection of the two new buildings. If it is intended for the Government to purchase the school and find the money for the new scheme, it would, no doubt, be to the advantage of the Church, but, at present, I cannot see any reason for carrying out the suggestion. Apart altogether from the doubt as to whether the buildings would be suitable as a home for disabled soldiers, and whether the Government needs such a building, I cannot at present see that the proposed change is urgent in the interests of the Indians for our educational work, and, therefore, I cannot support it.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Kenora Boarding School. Original on 129992-6\n\nAs I understand the Cecilia Jeffrey Shoal Lake Protestant Indian Boarding School is about 1/3 smaller in accommodation than this school and is allowed to accommodate 70. When all the pupils return there will be 79 or 80. If this school be not permitted to retain these, the children concerned will be without any school whatever as there are none around.\n\nOwing to the lack of educational facilities for Indian school children in the vicinity of Kenora, I would recommend that this school be allowed to accommodate all possible. I have inspected the dormitories and accommodations and I feel that they can easily accommodate from 70 to 80.\n\nThe allowance of $145.00 for each child is really terribly small. It amounts to 40 cents a day. On this these Indian children are clothed, fed and instructed in civilized ways and the maintenance of all buildings, etc., to accommodate these children must also come out of that. These facts are so plain that surely the Dominion Government Indian Department could arrange for a higher per capita allowance.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\n\nInsp.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kenora Boarding School, states that, owing to the lack of educational facilities for Indian children in the vicinity of Kenora, he would recommend that this school be allowed to take in such children up to the number for which it can provide accommodation and that the grant be paid for them.\n\nAt present a grant is allowed for 60 pupils. The Inspector states that he has inspected the dormitories and that the school could easily provide accommodation for at least 70 pupils. He compares the accommodation at this school with that at the Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding School and states that, while the Cecilia Jeffrey School is one-third smaller, it is allowed to accommodate 70 children.\n\nWhile there are no funds to provide for an increase in the pupilage during the present fiscal year, I would recommend that the Kenora School be granted an increase of 10 pupils from the first of April, next, and that this increase be provided for in the estimates for the next fiscal year. The Architect's Branch will, no doubt, be able to state the number which the Kenora School can accommodate, taking into consideration the requirements as to air and floor space in the dormitories and class-rooms.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

If your services are available, I would ask you to undertake this work for the Department. It will be necessary that you furnish me with a detailed list of buildings, furniture, stock of all kinds, the area of land, etc. It is understood that the valuation should show the actual present value of the property, and that you will arrange matters in such a way as to avoid further claims after the transfer has been made.\n\nAs it is important that the transaction be closed at an early date, I would ask you to kindly undertake this work at your earliest convenience, and advise me by wire as to the date of your inspection.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this letter, and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

He states that it is too much to expect one teacher to perform the classroom work satisfactorily and besides the children need the attention of two teachers.\n\nThe Department considers that, for the number of children in attendance, there should be two teachers engaged, and I shall be pleased to hear from you concerning this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Now I have to say that the Indian Boarding School of Fort Frances through the generosity of the whole staff has been able to have its location at the school, and that is the reason why the children are progressing and speaking good English, according to the Inspector's report.\n\nBut as I have already said, it is through sacrifices we come to that point. I mean, that is by defining ourselves the most legitimate pleasures of life, and sometimes the most necessary things in our health.\n\nHowever, I must not forget that the Principal and his assistants' salary is so high.\n\nVery devotedly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.B.

As you have been advised in communications of July 19th and August 24th, we wish to receive this detailed report at an early date. In the light of your telegram of the 28th of July, promising action within a few days, I am unable to understand the delay. The Department would be pleased to have this valuation immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. M. Ross, Esq.,\nBox 362,\nKenora, Ont.\nIf possible I should like to know the exact complaints and from whom they come so that I may be in a position to explain.\n\nThere is a lot of jealousy on the part of this School against the other School owing to the liking the Indians have for Cecilia Jeffrey School, which is doing such good work.\n\nI trust you will pardon me for writing such a long letter of explanation, but I think the charges justify it,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nmy Office but he would not meet them and try to find out the\ntrouble in public, there must be only one Indians in at one time,\nit does not appear to me to be a good way the Indians should have\nbeen to meet the Indians at their council and ask what they\nare against the School and we could get to the bottom of things.\n6. There is no doubt it is desirable to get the children to school\nat an early age. Holidays The length of these holidays has always\nbeen arranged by the School and also the time when they should be\nthe agent has not interfered as been asked to these matters\nin my opinion the length of the holidays and the time is alright\nas it enables the children to accompany their parents on their\npicking time, when they are a considerable help, but the parents\ndo not like returning their children to this School after the\nholidays and we have considerable difficulty in getting them back.\nWe have to use pressures to get the Indians to send their\nchildren to the Kenora School, and the Indians say that they are\ncruel to the children, and hit them because of them. I have made all\nthe enquiries I can but I can get nothing definite, and do not\nbelieve they are cruel. There have been several cases of thrashing,\ntwo since this Principal has been at the School, but no doubt the\nchildren deserved it, the reason given was that the boys were\nnoisy at table and would not do what they were told, so I have\ntold the Principal that in future no thrashing should be done\nuntil the matter has been taken up with me, and if I considered\nthe children deserved it I would not protect them. This order was\ngiven owing to the numerous complaints received.\nI may say that the Principal has not had very much experience\nwith Indians and does not speak good English. The other Superior does\nnot speak any Indians and has not done this kind of work before,\nand none of the staff are English perfect with the exception of\npossible one.\nMy sympathy is at present with Cecilia Jeffrey School as the\nfinished product is much better than that turned out from Kenora\nSchool, and when I visit the Kenora School the children always\nseem to be frightened of the Agent and the School staff, the exact\nopposite is noticeable at Shoal Lake. In my opinion it is not a\nquestion of religion but in the way the School is run. This one by\nfear the other by kindness.\nEvery child of school age at the Shoal Lake Reserve is at\nschool or not available, and very few of their children come from\nthe Rat Portage Reserve which is situated close to the Kenora School\nbut the only way I can fill this school is by force whilst we do\nnot have much difficulty in getting pupils for Cecilia Jeffrey, a lot\nof the Indians are willing to send their children to school but will\nnot allow them to go to this school.\nThe principal does not believe in not giving holidays to those\nchildren who do not remain at the proper time as it would punish the\nstaff as well by keeping them away.\nI would refer you to the last annual report from the School\nwhere they thank me for assistance my kindness and attention\nin all matters connected with the School, and Mr Paget will no\ndoubt remember the flowery letter of thanks I got from the Principal\nand Staff of the School last Xmas this was a personal letter to me\nand was written by Mr Paget returned it to me.\nThere have been three new Indians at the School since I\nhave been at this Agency, I do not know why so many changes.\nConstable on several occasions had to make trip to get\nrunaway children back to this school last summer.\nI wish to assure the Department that this Office does the best\npossible in every way to assist the Kenora School and does not make\nany distinction or show any favoritism to the other school, the whole\ntrouble lies in the management of the school or some grievance the\nIndians have against it.\nI have asked the Parish Priest Father Larentie and also several\nPeople round if they would not take more interest in this School\nas things were not going well, but it does no good.\nMr Ferrier might take a trip here and he could inspect this\nSchool and the one at Shoal Lake, and we might then find out where\nthe trouble is.\nThe Principal assures me he has made no complaints against\nIn reply to your letter No 129-1-10 of 18th instant, re complaint re Kenora Industrial School.\n\nI have had an interview with the Principal, and he gives me a few observations he has made since he has been at the School about one month.\n\nHe says:\n\n1. There seems to be someone inciting the Indians settled close by the School to agitate against us, to have meetings calculated to give us trouble &c. Reasons, Children not allowed to go home as often as they like, and we do not do here what is done at Shoal Lake. There is someone constituted in authority & desiring secrecy urging them to send their children to Shoal Lake.\n\n2. Asks me to give School support to the children who have not returned to School from holidays back and also to get new pupils. Indian Agent in last 15 years have only brought 3 new pupils to the School.\n\n3. The Indian policeman seems to be unable to bring back the children to the School; would Mr Edwards ask the Mounted Police to help.\n\n4. Is Mr Edwards prepared to punish any fellow carrying stories against the school, i.e., that we are illusing the children, and that there is always some sickness at the School.\n\n5. I will never go to any meeting of the Indians.\n\n6. Why is it difficult to educate the children here, (a) They are too young when they begin to come to School, (b) Their holidays are too long, (c) They are too much in contact with their parents.\n\nIn connection with the above:\n\n1. The Principal cannot give me any idea who he refers to, but says it is not the Agent or anyone in this office, it may be the Chief, but he cannot find out who it is, but knows there must be someone or there would not be so much trouble.\n\nLast summer the Principal on his asking me was instructed to allow the parents to take their children to see their children only during holidays and after school hours, he was also told that he need not let the children out of School to see their parents unless he wished to, as in my opinion the Agent had nothing to do with how he ran the School provided it was run according to the laws and wishes of the Department as laid down in their publications and if there was any trouble he was to let me know. This I may say now is the first complaint from the School I have received.\n\nThere is no one to my knowledge inciting the children to go to Cecilia Jeffrey School instead of this.\n\n2. All support possible is given to the School from this office and many children have been indirectly sent back to the School through myself and my constable. In fact Hansen has made trips by canoe and train 40 and 50 miles to see Indians who had not seen their children back, and we have brought children back on the boat from the Reserve for the School, but of course have not landed them at the School door. The Mounted Police could not do any more than Constable Hansen has done, but the Principal might be allowed if he asks us for help and does not get it to employ the Mounted Police.\n\n3. I am always prepared to punish any one who carries tales that are untrue, against the School, if the Principal will bring them or some with them before me, but he does not seem willing to do this as I asked him today, the other day who had a complaint to come to the School with the Priest, the Indians turned and said the Priest would not come, so when I saw the Principal he said he said he would not come with any Indian, he would not lower himself, but if I had asked him to bring the Indian it would be alright.\n\n4. I have asked the Principal to come with me to the Reserve on the 2nd, and meet the Indians and we could get at what all the trouble was, but he would not do so, he would meet an Indian at\nSir,\n\nIn reference to my letter of the 23rd ult re Kenora Industrial School.\n\nOn 2nd instant after the payments, I had a long conference with the Indians and asked their complaints against this School. The main points were that the new Principal was too rough with the children and would not listen to the Indians when they came to the School. He went to the Indian houses with a gun, and frightened them, that he carries a knotted noose with him for the purpose of hitting the pupils.\n\nI visited the School next day and discussed these points with the Principal and he informed me that he was not too rough with the children, but that the discipline was so bad he had to be very strict, he did not use the gun to frighten the Indians, and he did not often use the noose.\n\nThe staff at the School did not seem to think the Principal was too strict, and said that more discipline was needed. The last Principal was too lenient.\n\nThere have been 7 children run away from this School during the last few days; they have all been brought back by Constable Hansen with the exception of one, who has not yet been located; these children are not sent to the School and we were lucky enough to get them when the Indians came to pay.\n\nThe Principal explained to me that the late Principal used to go round and get the children back himself, but he could not do so as it cost too much, I explained he should do his share and not expect the Department to pay everything, but he seemed to think that was entirely the Agents duty and also that it was only the Agents duty to get the children and not the Church or School.\n\nOn questioning the children it appears they all ran away because they were afraid of being punished for something wrong they had done.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that the Principal was overzealous and is very nervous and excitable and this may be the cause of the trouble. In my opinion another Principal in his place might help matters as the Indians here are very indignant and do not like this man although I believe he is doing what he considers is the best.\n\nThe same Indians used to come round at all hours, now he has specified hours, and he has also stopped the Indians from camping on the School property, this is alright but I do not think he has enough tact in his dealings with the Indians, and is making the same changes too suddenly.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. The Principal and myself are very friendly, but I do not approve of the way he making these radical changes. One of the runaway children informed me that the teacher had told him if he reported anything to me he would be thrashed.\nOttawa, October 10, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letters of the 23rd ultimo and 4th instant, both referring to general conditions at the Kenora Boarding School. I have to thank you for your detailed report and for the assistance you have given the institution at this time.\n\nIn the light of your explanations, the Department is convinced that you have done your duty at this school, and that the difficulties arise due to a lack of confidence on the part of the Indians of the band. I might inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General is communicating with Rev. Father Boys, of Winnipeg, in an effort to remedy conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

That these two boys have a very bad record in our school and have caused a great deal of trouble to the staff on account of their personal character and of their influence on the other pupils.\n\n2. That on the 12th instant it was decided between Inspector Bennett, the Indian Agent and myself that we are going to send these undesirable pupils to the Chief Indian Industrial School.\n\nI do not think it would be wise to change this decision and was announced publicly by Inspector Bennett and the Indian Agent to all the pupils and staff of the school.\n\n3. That I feel sure this transfer shall prove beneficial to the above named boys and shall save our institution from many more bad influences as they are so now convinced.\n\nI am sure this will meet with your approval.\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM:-\n\nMr Russell T.

McLennan\n\n(Charge Dept. of Indian Affairs)\nOttawa, Oct. 30, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, informing the Department of your wish to transfer No. 78 Arthur Mushenow and No. 131 Adelaide Jasine to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School at Lebret, Sask. This request should have been forwarded through the office of Mr. Agent Edwards, whose recommendation would have been attached. The Department has written to Mr. Edwards, advising him that in all matters pertaining to leave or truancy he and yourself should take concerted action, as individual rulings and requests will be sure to result in misunderstandings.\n\nThere are but two courses open to the Department in connection with the two boys named above: they must either remain in the school or be discharged. We are not able to authorise a transfer to Lebret. The Indian Act, Section 10 (subsection 1) reads in part: \"Provided, however, that such school shall be the nearest available school of the kind required\". The advanced age of these boys would also complicate matters if we tried to commit them to another school.\n\nYou and Mr. Agent Edwards should decide whether or not these boys are to remain in the Kenora Boarding School. You have the Department's authority to discharge them, if our representative and yourself decide this is in the best interests of the school.\n\nI trust that you will be able to make a satisfactory arrangement and that there will be no more trouble at the institution. A copy of this communication is being addressed to Mr. Agent Edwards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. C.M.

You and Father Karbrat have authority to discharge the above mentioned boys if you believe it is in the best interests of the school.\n\nThe Reverend Father asks for the discharge of pupil No. 101, Peter Savage. The reasons given are poor health and bad conduct. The discharge of this boy is granted, if you are of the opinion that the Reverend Father's request is reasonable.\n\nKindly intimate to the Department what disposition has been made of these three boys, so that our records may be accurate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

M. Ross, Box 362, Lenora, Ont., has failed to submit to the Department his valuation of the Lenora Boarding School property. The commission was offered him under date of July 19th, last, and we asked him to kindly undertake the work at his earliest convenience and advantage by wire. On July 27th he accepted the work and on the 28th of the same month wired the Department as follows: \"Have made inspection of Lenora Boarding School property and report of valuation will be made within a few days.\"\n\nOn August 24th the Department reminded Mr. Ross that we were waiting for his report. Again on September 22nd we called for the valuation immediately. On October 10th we telegraphed Mr. Ross for his report. He wired, in reply: \"Report Lenora Boarding School will be in your hands 17th.\" On the 30th ultimo we informed Mr. Ross that we would make other arrangements for a valuation of the property in question.\n\nWill you please inform me the name of another resident of Lenora, who is competent to make a valuation of the Lenora Boarding School property.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Oct. 11, 1922.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nI wish to acquaint you with a situation that has arisen at the Kenora Boarding School. Rev. Father Kerbrat has as yet failed to win the confidence of the Indian band. Several children have run away and have been located by the Indian agent, after some difficulty and considerable expense. The discipline at the school has not been very good, and the present principal has adopted rather severe measures, in an effort to better conditions.\n\nI am convinced that a letter from you to the Rev. Principal, urging him to move slowly and bend every effort to gain the sympathy of the Indian band, would assist at this time. I am directing our agent to cooperate in every way possible with Father Kerbrat. The principal should be informed that it is his duty to assist in the return of runaways and to undertake active recruiting. Discipline must be maintained, but methods should be carefully considered.\n\nI am sure that you will cooperate with this Department, in an effort to improve conditions at the Kenora Boarding School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

Holman\nJ D McLean\n\nDeputy Supt General Dept Indian Affairs Ottaw.\n\nReport Kenora Boarding School will be your hands seventeenth\n\nA M Rose\n\n1956\nSir,\n\nThe Principal of the Yenorah School telephoned me at 9 a.m. this morning that five of the boys had run away\u201476, 104, 131, and 101.\n\nTwo of the boys #76 and 121 came to my office at three o'clock this afternoon, and said they had run away because they were afraid of being punished by the Principal, and he was always blaming them for things.\n\nI went to the School and saw the Principal who informed me that the only boys he would take back were #116 and 104, and he would not take the others back at all; he said he had applied to someone for permission to send some of the boys to LeBreton Industrial School as he could not manage them.\n\nUnder the circumstances I have sent them to my Interpreter's house to be kept until I hear from the Department what is to be done with them.\n\nThe boys' ages are 17, 17, 16, 15, and 17. They are almost old enough to be discharged, and one of them had been working on the Government Road at Red-Litt, and getting big wages during his summer holidays; he is old enough to fend for himself.\n\nI shall be glad to receive instructions as to whether they should be sent to another School or discharged. It seems better to me, if we send them to some other School for a few months before discharge, so as to show other boys they cannot run away with impunity.\n\nI may say whilst at the School, I met Mr. Bennett, an Ontario Catholic School Inspector, and discussed the matter with him; he thinks the boys should be sent to another School before discharge.\n\nThis School is causing us much trouble and I do not think we can remedy matters until we have a new principal. We cannot get Indians to send their children to the School, whilst under the control of this man.\n\nI may say I do not interfere in any way with the running of the School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir, Your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No 129-1-1 of 10th instant, re Kenora School.\n\nI had to take an Indian from Assiniboin band who had been accidentally shot to Winnipeg, and whilst there called on Inspector Bunn in reference to the above. Mr Bunn quite approved of the action, I had taken in this matter, and phoned Rev Father Boys of St Boniface, who kindly said he would come to Kenora this week and look into the matter for us and if necessary make a change in the Principal.\n\nInspector Bunn did not approve of transferring the children the Principal did not want, and thought they should be sent back to the same school, under a principal who could manage them. He quite agreed that as the Indians had not the confidence they should have in the Principal he should be changed.\n\nWhen Rev Father Boys arrives, I will go into the matter with him and feel sure, we shall have no further trouble.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Oct. 18, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Numbers 108-12 of the 12th and 15th instant, concerning the discipline at the Kenora Boarding School. I have noted that 5 truant pupils have been held by you, awaiting the Department's instructions.\n\nIn the light of your second letter, in which you expect an improvement following Father Bays' visit, I wish to suggest that the 5 boys be returned to the school, but that they should understand that you are supporting the principal in his efforts to maintain discipline and that truancy will not be countenanced. You might address the big boys at the school, with a view to assisting the principal at this time. Their practice of running to your office with their complaints should stop. If they have any troubles, they should be told to you when you are visiting the school.\n\nIn all matters pertaining to leave or truancy, the principal and yourself should take concerted action, as individual rulings will be sure to result in misunderstandings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nTHE HONOURABLE DUNCAN SCOTT\nDeputy-Minister of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., re. some trouble in our Kenora Boarding School.\n\nI have lately made a short inspection of that school and gave some instructions to the Principal.\n\nMy intention is to follow developments and direct if possible the activities of the new Principal, or replace him and have things go on normally.\n\nI sent the results of my first investigation to Rev. Father Guy, but as I feel the Agent in Kenora shall readily understand our position, I would beg that this report be not communicated to Him.\n\nYours, faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.-B.

Buildings and Land.\n2. Machinery, Implements & Miscellaneous Articles.\n3. Furniture and Furnishings.\n4. Livestock.\n\nIn connection with this report and valuation I would say that the property has been carefully and thoroughly examined and found to be in good condition, less the ordinary wear and tear. The situation of the school is ideal for the purpose for which it is used, being of easy access by both land and water. When making my investigation I found that this establishment was well managed and the property had all the ear-marks of careful superintendence.\n\nIn my detailed valuation I have endeavored to be fair and reasonable to all concerned and have given due consideration to the wear and tear wherever necessary. In reference to the Buildings and Land Schedule, I would say that I have omitted one frame house as it had no commercial value whatever. This is a building that is the furthest removed of any from the school building proper, and to all appearances had been abandoned.\nOTTAWA, November 15th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing your report and valuation of the Kenora Indian Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have noted that the principal cannot give you a proper description and that there is an additional 45 acres to which title is held by the Oblate Fathers, on which the school is built. Your opinion that $60,000 is a high valuation for the property has been noted.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform you that the Oblate representative in Ottawa assures us that copies of the deeds to the Kenora Boarding School property have been directed to you from Winnipeg and should be in your office about this date. I am therefore requesting again that you will give a proper description, by metes and bounds, of both parcels of land owned by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nIt appears, after an examination of our files, that the block which was surrendered by the Indian band in January 1917 comprises 115.8 acres. The other parcel is roughly 45 acres and is the site of the school. The Department would be pleased if you could give a proper description of both these blocks, after an examination of the deeds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 28, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to refer to the first page of your report on the valuation of the Kenora Boarding School. You have mentioned 116 acres of land, 15 of which is cleared. Immediately following this statement there are two items of 15 acres cleared and 113 acres uncleared. This would make a total acreage of 128.\n\nFurther, the Department is of the opinion that the above refers to a parcel of land that was originally part of the Indian reserve. You have not mentioned in your valuation the block of 45 acres more or less, which is the site of the school.\n\nThe Department is not asking that you go to any trouble further in this matter, but I would be pleased to have an explanation of the difference in the figures referring to the first block of land and an explanation why the parcel of land upon which the school stands is omitted from your report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. M. Ross, Esq.,\nP. O. Box 382,\nKenora, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFather Guy believes that Mr. Agent Edwards has by this time a copy of the title to the Kenora Boarding School property. The Department of Justice has given us the name of the lawyer in Kenora who can be given the searching of the title.\n\nBefore this is done, I believe the valuator, Mr. Rose, should be more definite regarding the land that belongs to the school. I understand that there are two parcels - one of 118.8 acres acquired in January 1917 after a surrender by the Indian Band (Res. No. 38 B.) The price was at $5.00 an acre, or $594. I have pointed out to Father Guy that very little work has been done on this property since it was acquired by the Oblate Fathers (15 acres is cleared) but that the valuator has offered the figure $9400.00. The other block of land is roughly 60 acres; it is on the edge of the lake and is the site of the school. The valuator did not mention this parcel in his report.\n\nI am writing Mr. Agent Edwards, explaining these facts and asking him to give the lawyer the commission of searching the title which secures a proper description to both parcels.\n\nMr. Moffat should be asked, after the title has been searched, to prepare an O.C. for the authority to purchase. Lastly, it may be necessary to secure the Receiver General's Check as the amount is in excess of $25,000.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

In the title, known as Transfer 553.1k and Parcel No.22, the acreage of this property is not given but my map shows it as 51 acres which, in all probability, includes the 5\u00bd acres sold to Mr. Ryan, thus leaving approximately 45 acres of what might be called the school site property, and in my opinion the 45 acres is the most valuable portion of the land holdings of the Reverend Fathers. This is because of the fact of it having such a large water frontage. Notwithstanding, I have made my valuation along most reasonable lines and am putting the 45 acres in at $150.00 an acre, although the 5\u00bd acres were, I believe, sold to Mr. Ryan at about $350.00 per acre. This acreage of course has a very large water frontage which, no doubt, accounts for the price received for it.\n\nIn further reference to these land holdings, I would like to say that the school site property itself will become an exceedingly valuable one and would be, in fact, at present of considerable value in the event of the property being put up for sale, as it lends itself to the requirements of the summer tourist, and in all probability, if it were put on the open market today, this land and buildings thereon would be readily saleable. Notwithstanding this, I have endeavored to put a fair and reasonable value on the property as a whole as I possibly could.\n\nI am correcting pages 1 and 4 of my first report which, I trust, will explain my error and be satisfactory to you and, therefore, I am enclosing you a completed detailed report, in duplicate, as corrected.\n\nI would at this time state that in the detailed list of Furniture and Furnishings in my first report, I overlooked stating to you that I omitted, and still omit, the Furniture and Furnishings of the Chapel contained in the school proper and used for religious services, as I was not informed as to whether these were to be included with all of the\nKenora, Ontario, December 7th, 1922.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 124-1-1.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th ultimo in this matter and in reply would make the following explanations.\n\nIn my valuation report of this property - page 1 - (Buildings and Land), I give the acreage as 118 (15 of this cleared) but in error I carry it out as 113 uncleared. This should be 103 uncleared, and I also now discover that the school site proper is not contained in the 118 acres although, from my conversation with the Brothers resident in the school, I got the impression that the total acreage was 118 acres including the 15 acres, but after careful examination of the titles and map I find that this is not the case.\n\nTo outline more accurately this property I would say that the 118 acres are apparently made up of the east part of Location I.8 and part of Location K.16. I am using these Location numbers because I am enclosing you a sketch from a map showing the various locations of the Indian Reserve - 38.B - and these are part of them. This sketch is taken from a map of the North Eastern part of the Lake of the Woods, District of Kenora -1917, and issued by the Department of Lands and Forests, Parliament Buildings, Toronto.\n\nI note from the title that the Reverend Fathers, in the year 1913, sold 5& acres of the West part of Location I.8 to Mr. Thomas Ryan of\nOttawa, Dec. 13, 1922.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a report and valuation of the Kenora Indian Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I presume that the real estate is subject to the Land Titles Act. It would seem unnecessary to submit a draft transfer of the same, but so far as the personal property is concerned, please submit draft bill of sale with your report, and in any case do not commit the Crown to the purchase of the property or any part thereof until your report and the said draft has been received here and further instructions forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

P\u00e8res Oblate de l'Immacul\u00e9e Conception.\n\nWe beg to advise you that we have searched part of the title in connection with this matter known as Parcel No. 22. This is the property upon which the present Boarding School now stands. This property is still registered in the name of Les Reverends P\u00e8res Oblats de l'Immacul\u00e9e Conception de Marie', free from encumbrances.\n\nThe additional property containing 118 acres more or less, although we made an initial search at the Land Titles Office in connection with it is property, we were unable to find any Grant of the same. In placing ourselves in communication with the local Indian Agent he handed us with the Certificate of Citizenship of Parcel 22 and the original Patent issued by the Governor General of the Dominion of Canada to Les Reverends P\u00e8res Oblats of this 118 acres. This has never been registered and no before negotiations can proceed to prepare a transfer or to consummate the sale, this Patent will have to be registered and a new parcel given out by the Land Titles Office to cover this land. This will have to be done by the Vendors before they will be able to give a sign a proper deed to the Department of Indian Affairs, who have assigned Father Peyo the President of Les Reverends P\u00e8res Oblats of this Institution, and we are advised by Father Labonte of Kenora that it is the intention of the proper officers of this Institution to come to Kenora and have the matter of this title adjusted. As soon as it has been adjusted we will make a request transferred to you, the same to you. We do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the title to this particular piece of property.\n\nIn connection with the Bill of Sale of the machinery, live stock, etc., we have prepared a draft Bill of Sale from Les Reverends P\u00e8res Oblats to His Majesty the King as represented by the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs, which we enclose herewith, and submit to you for your approval. We would be pleased if you would fill in the amount of the consideration to be given for the chattels. We understand the whole purchase price is $46,000, including both parcels of land and the Chattels and effects, etc., but how you divide this amount, we do not know.

As I understand it, the Department of Indian Affairs would have no right to transfer the land covered by water.\n\nI would also like a small plan showing this property colored to be attached to the Patent.

Peres Oblats De L'Immaculee Conception de Marie, a portion of this Indian Reserve lying South of the Industrial School here. See Ref. No. 17,905, Sale No.6, recorded in the Department of Indian Affairs on the 14th. May 1917 in Liber 48, Folio 88.\n\nThis Patent was yesterday filed in this Office for registration, but before I can register it and open a parcel therefor I will require a description which will stand alone, that is, the description contained in the Patent starts thus: \"Commencing at a point on the North boundary of the said Indian Reserve distant One chain West of the South-east corner of the School Lands now in use adjoining the said North boundary of the said Reserve &c., &c.\"\n\nIn order to ascertain this starting point, it is necessary to search and find out what property the Industrial School owns north of the Reserve. A given starting point must be given without referring to other property. I have prepared a rough sketch of this property from the blue print which your Department kindly forwarded me showing the properties leased and sold on this Reserve, and would ask you to please give me the distance from the lake to the North west angle of this property, then as the other distances are shown, it is an easy matter to prepare a description of the property, without\nOttawa, 4th January, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nB 5155.\nRef: Purchase of Kenora Boarding School Property.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing copy of a letter dated the 21st ultimo from your Agents at Kenora, in the above matter.\n\nThe draft bill of sale, however, referred to in your letter was not enclosed. Would you kindly have it forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nExtract from letter of 3rd January 1923 received from Indian Agent Edwards, Kenora, Ont.\n\nHad a busy time last week. Xmas day at Kenora School giving out toys and prizes. We had a Xmas tree and every child got a toy & some candles. I gave special prizes to the best boy, the best boy writer, the best girl singer and the best girls fancy work, they did not cost much and gave a lot of pleasure to the children.\n\nOn Thursday, I got the Manager of the Y.M.C.A. to take his small moving picture out with him and we gave the children a show. Quite a lot of the older Indians were there and enjoyed it, many of them had never seen moving pictures before.\n\nI am President of the Kenora Boy Scouts and on Saturday took 27 of them for a snowshoe walk to the reserve and the School, where the Principal gave them tea, and we intended to have a shooting match (C.C.'s) but the weather was too bad snowing, so we are going to take them there some other time and have a hockey match, the Boy Scouts against the Indian Children, and shooting match after. I think it makes better feeling to get the white children take an interest in the Indians and it makes the Indians less shy.\n\nThe Priest was very pleased and wants me to get literature and he may start a troop at the school, as they have one at LeBreton. He wants to know if we could get the Government to let us have some educational films occasionally for these moving picture machines as he believes different departments supply them free, and they are of great educational value. Mr. Mercer of the Y.M.C.A. will take out his machine and show them occasionally if we get the films. The only cost I believe will be the express on the films. Do you know where we can get them? I understand some firm in Winnipeg distributes them they could come down here one day and be sent back a couple of days after.\n\nIf this could be worked, perhaps it might pay to buy a machine for the School, and it could be used by the Cecelia Jeffrey School occasionally when they get the electric light in. The machines I understand cost about $50.00 or $60.00. This is only a suggestion.\n\nThe Principal at the School, is improving and the Indians are beginning to think more of him, he has a mess of things at the start, but after getting called down by myself and the Priest from St. Boniface, he changed his ways and I present years to be doing good work.\n\nWhat amount was put in the Estimates for the School at Polling Portage last year, and have the Church promised to do anything?\n\n(Sgd) Frank Edwards\nOttawa, January 8, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Paget of this Department has brought to our attention your unofficial report on the Christmas activities at the Kenora Boarding School. The Rev. Principal and yourself are to be congratulated on the interesting programme arranged for the children in residence. I have noted that educational films could be used to advantage, and I regret to inform you that no Government department has for distribution pictures suitable for a school. However, if you make application to the University of Manitoba, or the University of Toronto, I am convinced that their Extension Departments may be of some assistance in this connection.\n\nI am pleased to learn that the Rev. Principal has been more successful in winning the confidence of the Indians of the vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, January 8, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the latest reports concerning the Kenora Boarding School have led this Department to believe that Rev. Father Kerbrat, the Principal, has been working in harmony with Mr. Agent Edwards and is winning the confidence of the Indians in the vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. B. Keys, O.M.I.,\n222 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nOttawa, 9th January 1923\n\nMemorandum\n\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\n\nIt appears from the correspondence on file that the Department is about to purchase the property of the Kenora Boarding School and included in the property is a part of approximately 113 acres which was acquired from the Department. Patent has been issued embodying a description compiled from information supplied by the school authorities. The school authorities are now endeavouring to register this patent with the local registrar who informs the Department that he cannot complete registration as the description is not sufficient. I agree with the Registrar on this point and to provide a correct description it would be necessary to have a survey made of the property.\n\nI consider that instead of either the Oblate Fathers or the Department going to the expense of having this survey made the old patent cancelled and new patent issued and registered it would be more advisable and I think legally sufficient to acquire title to this particular portion of the property by requesting the return of the patent issued by the Department and also Quit-Claim from the Oblate Fathers any interest they may have in said parcel. Should this procedure be adopted, no further action need be taken on the Registrar's letter other than the withdrawal by the Oblate Fathers of their application for the registration of the patent.\n\nIt is noted in the valuation prepared by A.M. Ross (see ref. No.57537 hereunder) that he included in the property lot 113 acres of land which he states is known as the East part of Section 11 and part of K.16. The sketch plan accompanying his report shows the correct location of L.8 and K.16 and it is apparent that the 113 acre parcel transferred by this Department cannot be considered as being in either of the above mentioned locations. I have indicated its correct position in pencil on his sketch.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nKenora, Canada\nJanuary 4th, 1923.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nW.S.E., B.5155 re purchase of Kenora Boarding School property \u2014 Vendor: Les Rev. Peres Oblats de l'Immaculee Conception de Marie.\n\nSupplementing our last letter to you in connection with this matter, we beg to advise you that the original patent to Les Rev. Peres Oblats de l'Immaculee Conception de Marie has been returned by the Master of Titles who objected to the method of describing the land as set out in the patent and desires to change the same. For that reason he has placed himself in communication with the Department of Indian Affairs, but he will probably fix that end of the matter up, when we may proceed to consummate the transaction by having the transfer and the bill of sale signed.\n\nWe forwarded a draft copy of the bill of sale to you in our last letter for your approval. All the land will be under the Land Titles Act and as from your previous statement I do not think it necessary to submit a draft transfer of the said property.

See Ref. No. 17,906, Sale No. 6, recorded in the Depart-\nment of Indian Affairs on the 14th May 1917 in Liber 43, Folio\n88.\n\nThis Patent was yesterday filed in this Office for\nregistration but before I can register it and open a parcel\ntherefor I will require a description which will stand alone,\nthat is, the description contained in the Patent starts thus:\u2014\n\"Commencing at a point on the North boundary of the said In-\ndian Reserve distant one chain west of the south-east corner\nof the School Lands now in use adjoining the said North bound-\nary of the said Reserve &c., &c.\" In order to ascertain this\nstarting point, it is necessary to search and find out what\nproperty the Industrial School owns north of the Reserve. A\ngiven starting point must be given without referring to other\nproperty. I have prepared a rough sketch of this property\nfrom the blue print which your Department kindly forwarded me\nshowing the properties leased and sold on this Reserve, and\nwould ask you to please give me the distance from the lake to\nthe North West angle of this property, then as the other\ndistances are shown, it is an easy matter to prepare a de-\nscription of the property, without any reference to any ad-\njoining property.\n\nI also note that this property extends at the South-\nwest corner into the waters of the lake.

It will cost considerable money to make the necessary survey and it occurred to the Department that the transfer might be accomplished by the vendors withdrawing the patent from the Land Titles Office and giving a quit claim deed of the lands described therein and forwarding both to the Department where the patent might be cancelled under the provisions of section 70, Chapter 61, R.S.C., being the Indian Act. If you consider this procedure satisfactory, kindly have your Agent proceed accordingly. If not, kindly advise us so that we may have the necessary survey made.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nof having the matter duly entered in the Land Titles Office is that you have an absolute title guaranteed by the Province, and if at any time you wish to sell the land or any question of title arises the record will be clear in the proper register.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Edward Edwards\n\nAsst. D. M. J.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant (189-1-1), it is to be observed that the provision for cancellation contained in section 70 of the Indian Act contemplates the issue of amended letters patent, so that it does not seem to apply to a case like the present where the intention is that the land should remain vested in His Majesty. Moreover, if the method you suggest were adopted we would have no means of satisfying ourselves that no mortgage had been given or other dealings had with regard to these lands during the period they were vested in the Oblate Fathers. Unless, therefore, your Department is willing to accept the assurance of the present owners that no encumbrance has been created or other dealing had in connection with these lands since the letters patent, I think it would be better to have a new survey made and clear up all outstanding questions at the present time.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 24, 1923.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department of Justice has advised us of the desirability of registering the patent for the 118 acres, more or less, that were surrendered from the Indian Reserve No. 28 B in the Kenora district. I would be pleased if you will arrange with your Western representative for a proper survey, so that a correct description can be given to the Land Titles Office at Kenora.\n\nI regret the necessity of this action and the resultant delay in completing the transfer of the Kenora Boarding School property to the Crown; but, as the patent embodied a description compiled from information supplied by the school authorities, I believe that a proper survey and a correct description should be offered by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

With reference to him forwarding the $23 to the Department, I have to inform you that this may be considered school money and used as the Principal sees fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI visited the Kainai Lubicon Residential School about the 28th and 29th of July. The Rev. Principal is an extremely nervous type, due, I believe, to overseas experience. I have reported to Father Guy that his position is not fair to him, as the details and noises of an institution are somewhat wearing on the nerves. He is doing as well as can be expected and is ably assisted by a Lay Brother, who is a host in himself.\n\nThe management is continually bothered in the summer by the parents wishing to take their children home. For the past eight years they have taken a two months' holiday. This should be looked into. The Sisters are French, but have fairly good English at their command. I intend to look up the qualifications of Sister Gregoire, who was formerly at Qu'Appelle.\n\nThe dormer roof outside sash and doors of the main building require paint. This should be attended to in 1925. The work on the barn is going forward with despatch and I authorized an expenditure of $160 for a hay fork and track in the loft. A confirming letter should go forth if the account is not in.\n\nI promised favourable consideration for cement, to be used for flooring a 40 x 15 ft. henhouse which has been infested by rats. Mr. Orr estimates 10 bbl. cement, at an estimated cost of $45, are required.\n\nI also promised that 6 enamel tubs would be sent for the laundry. The management will be responsible for installing them. They have absolutely no suitable equipment of this kind.\n\nThe following equipment and repairs will be required in the near future:\n\n1. Lumber for an addition to the implement shed.\n2. A drain from the school to the barn to carry water. I believe they have the pipe already.\n3. A 10 horse power motor for cutting wood and pumping water. (City electric power is used and the water supply is from the lake to 2 pressure tanks.)\n4. 25 bbl. cement for a retaining wall around the water tank.\n5. A metal wall in the boys' playroom.\n6. A dryer and steam boiler required. (The washing machine is equipped for steam.)\n7. The eaves at the rear of the main building need enlarging.\n8. A proper root cellar is required.\n\nThe school has very little opportunity for farming, as it is situated on rock, at the edge of the lake. They have a good boat for transportation to and from the city of Hanna and the reserves.\nKenora Ont. Sept 23rd - 1924\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regard to the management of this Indian Industrial School that you maintain here, I think it is time some investigation into the management of the Institution should be made. From complaints that come to me, it seems to me that the mode of punishment that is being adopted is inhumane and barbarous, and should not be tolerated in any civilized community.\n\nChief Pines granddaughter from Big Island and another girl Mary Robinson and another whose name I have not got were first whipped and beaten by the Priest and then their hands tied together and their feet tied together, and four of them put in the cellar and kept there for 4 hours. And the one the chief's grandchild was shut up the the toilet (an outhouse) with her hands and feet tied together. And this kind of humiliation was continued for 4 days. This happened in May last. The Sabaaskong Indians reported this to the Indian Agent Captain Frank Edwards and asked him to investigate this thing. But the Agent has never done anything.\n\nMinakijikat\n\n#83 at Sudbury\n\nAcknowledged this little letter 1/8\nOttawa, Sept. 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a communication which has been received by the Department. Our correspondent is evidently an Indian named Minakijikok, No. 85 of the Sibassong Band. Please let me have a report from you relative to the contents of the communication and the Indian who has signed the letter.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLenora, Ont.\nI believe the Principal is doing his best, but he is too nervous (he is suffering from shell shock) for the position of Principal of this school, and I would suggest that he be given a rest and another man take his place, one who would make himself more friendly with the Indians.\n\nThe Indians here object to sending their children to this school, and the school register shows the difficulty experienced in getting the pupils back from their holidays. The Principal, owing to shell shock has not got that human touch that appeals to these people.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S. Mr. Harris met the Principal which he was inspecting the School and can give you his opinion.\n\nPlease refer to my letter 23rd April 1922.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter 129-1-1 of the 30th ult., enclosing letter from #63 Assabaska Band, which letter in my opinion was written for this Indian by an educated white man.\n\nThe woman, #63 Assabaska (Sabastong) is the mother of two children #090 and #0125 pupils at Kenora Residential School, and she is living with a half breed Joe LaPointe or Sabeska.\n\nJosephine the eldest child refused even to go with her mother for the holidays, but Mary, the youngest did. Owing to Mary not returning to the school after the holidays I had to send the Constable after her and wrote her to the office to see why she had not returned back to school. As the mother made certain accusations against the school I allowed them to bring Col. Macdonald, barrister, to my office and we went into the whole matter and decided there was nothing very serious in it.\n\nIf you will refer to my previous letters you will see that the Indians complained of the Priest hitting the children, and he promised me not to administer corporal punishment.\n\nOn April 28th last five girls ran away from the school and at night came to my house, as it was then too late to send them back to school. I allowed them to sleep at the Agency, and gave them their breakfast the next morning going back to the school afterwards that day. The children informed me they had nothing against the school but ran away because they were not allowed to play with Chief Pine's grand daughter.\n\nThe Indians inform me that he left Kenora for Winnipeg at 10 o'clock A.M. on April 29th last, and that none of the children were whipped or beaten, but he is informed as we did not want corporal punishment administered. Two of the children were locked in the cellar and two others locked in other places for about 2 hours and they had their hands tied together.\n\nChief Pine's grand daughter used to shut herself up in the dormitory toilet at night to vex the Sister in charge, and was therefore shut up in the same toilet for about 2 hours as a punishment.

I replied to the Principal's letter above quoted extract from his letter is as follows:\n\n\"You will remember some time ago Indians complained of being threatened and hit for trivial offenses, and now a report goes in connection with children having had their hands and feet tied, and having been locked up in the cellar for several hours. There was a considerable amount of truth in these allegations, and in my opinion this is partly the cause of the difficulty experienced in getting the children to return to school after holidays, and also in getting new pupils to attend school.\n\nI do not wish to interfere with the working of the school, but on receipt of complaints it is my duty to investigate them and see that the school is carried on in the right manner, as even although the principal is appointed by the Church, he has to meet with the approval of the Department.\"\n\nOn the 22nd inst. the Principal replies to the foregoing extract from his letter as follows:\n\n\"As for our difficulties with the local agent I leave it to the Indian Department and the Church authorities to settle them as best they can.\n\nFrom the above it will be noted that the Principal appears to be very displeased with me, and I am writing this for your information. I can assure you I have given every assistance to the Principal in helping to get the pupils back to the school, and also in all other matters relative to the school's welfare.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\"\nOttawa, October 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your No. 108-12 of the 2nd instant, with reference to general conditions at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Pollnaire d'Amour, assistant principal of the Indian boarding school here, was shot dead, and Joe Bernicott, a hired man, was severely wounded by Fransois Balou, employee of the institution, early this morning. After his murderous assault, Balou ended his own life with the same weapon.\n\nAuthorities investigating the crime are unable to assign any reason for the killing, as there had been no quarrel and no other indication of trouble. It is believed that the murderer had gone temporarily insane. Bernicott, who was wounded in the jaw, is expected to recover.\n\nBernicott and Balou, according to the school account, were engaged with their duties in the stable and after milking the cows Balou left with two pails in the direction of the school. Bernicott thought he was being murdered, but on turning around he saw Balou pointing a gun in his direction.\n\nThe next moment Bernicott was struck on the side of the face with the full charge of the short gun. The wounded man rushed toward the school, followed by his assailant. Just before reaching the building Balou stopped to reload the weapon, and when Brother d'Amour interceded, the latter was stabbed with a shot through the left eye.

Our Medical Officer Mr. D. Ferguson was already there with the Provincial and Town Police.\n\nIt appears that a man named Francis Selou shot at Mr. Bernicot in the barn (these men were rummaging through the School). Bernicot was badly wounded in the left cheek, he ran away from the barn and into the School, brother Albert Selou (who has been at the School over 17 years, and is well thought of) came out of the School and called out for his brother about, and Bernicot ran round him. Selou again, took another and apparently severely hit, shot the brother in the head, killing him immediately. Selou then appeared to have disappeared for some time, and the police were searching for him, but without success. The time I quoted was only a guess made on the basis of information that he was found two rummages about 100 yards in the bush, it appeared that when he found himself locked for he committed suicide by shooting himself.\n\nThe inquest will be held tomorrow, no active steps yet taken for the murder.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 108-12 of the 12th instant, with reference to the recent tragedy at the Kenora Indian Residential School.

The Department has just received from the Very Rev. J. B. Boys, O.M.I., 340 Provencher Ave., St. Boniface, Man., an intimation concerning these appointments and approval has been given. I note, with satisfaction, that the Rev. Father Perreault has given splendid service at the Kenora institution. I trust that the new principal for Kenora, the Rev. J. M. Baillargeon, O.M.I., who has had previous experience at this class of school, will meet with much success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nJ. M. BENNETT, M.A.\nInspector of Separate Schools\n\nToronto,\n\nCould a few of the worst trouble be transferred by Indian Agents order to some far away Indian schools? The school hasn't much control of the Indians. The Agent knows their haunts and children make him responsible for placing them in residence and for truants and the matter will be settled. If an Indian agent does not do his duty when he understands he should be removed. The Education of the Indians should be his greatest interest. Agent Lewis and some still I have met sure do deserve praise and credit for what they do.\n\nOther schools have no trouble on this matter. Why should \"enera\" rather than that the Indian children growing up should have the idea that school teachers are there simply to turn the school into a day school and let the parents send them when they like.\n\nAn Indian agent who will show the Parents that he supports the school every time.\n\nThe agent to place the children in residence and see that they stay and if necessary teach them a lesson by transferring them to another schools.\n\nOr an attendance officer with better beat responsible for it. However I feel it to be the Agent's Duty and only he will accomplish a result. He is the only one that has any control over the Indians.\n\nOr it may be like at Spadina. It is situated far from the reserves. Transfer most of the enerera children to some other school and bring outsiders to Kenora.\n\nThe school authorities have enough to do to instruct and develop the children under their charge. Remove these hindrances which make the Indians feel that the teachers are not there for Indians or else how will the rising generation of them have these Christian principles necessary for citizenship?\n\nI am rather late in sending this but it is caused by a natural hesitancy on my part in sending such to you since most likely it is outside my business. But conditions in Kenora are certainly not what they should be and it is not asked the fault of the school authorities.\n\nDo what you can but write a letter as confidential. I trust you will find a solution.\n\nYours sincerely,\nToronto, Nov. 18th 1925\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir; -\n\nI intended to write you before now concerning some conditions existing in connection with the Kenora Boarding School. I would like this to be treated as confidential and whatever you can do in the matter will be appreciated.\n\nOn the day following my last visit there I again called over to the school to see the principal since he was not present at my visit. I seldom tell them in advance. Kenora school is too close to the children's home and is in urgent need of a truant officer. Unless this is done then I cannot see how the authorities in charge can keep a regular attendance and spirit of work.\n\nAll school authorities cannot be responsible for gathering the pupils and reclaiming runaway pupils. The Indian Agent, say in Kenora, is the one who knows these Indians and where they live. He only has the roll and knows those of school age. He should place these children in residence and so govern their parents that they will recognize the law. The school authorities are at the mercy of Indian criticism and the school looked upon as a jail while the Indian Agent stands aloof.\n\nWhy should this be so? Why should the school have to gather the pupils? Why should the school be placed in the position of a truant officer and seek those that the Department wishes to train and educate? Why should the school authorities have to pay dearly seeking the country side and lakes for runaways when there is a Department meter beat at Kenora which could be used for that purpose. I feel that if the Indian Agent at Kenora had upheld the school authority and show the Indians that he stands behind the school things would not be as difficult in this school. A few years ago when many ran away, I personally knew that Mr. Edwards in deliberately taking the part of a sort of Judge between the truants and the school authorities publically, did more to disrupt the organization of this school than you maybe are aware of. A principle in Education is this. School authority must be upheld. No wonder the Indians have no respect for authority around Kenora. If this school has trouble today it can be traced to its source.\n\nThe only authority the Indian knows is that of the the Agent. Now in the case of Kenora, if he would place the children in residence, go after truants and teach respect for authority the whole situation would be remedied. But when Indians know he will take their part or ignore things what can you expect. Authority and discipline cannot remain in Kenora until these Indians are taught a lesson.\nOttawa, November 24, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards and his relationship to the Kenora Indian Residential School. Your suggestions and recommendations have been noted and will receive consideration when decisions affecting our work at this school are being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Bennett, B.A., M.A.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n47 Browning Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR BENNETT,\ndated March 9th, 1927, on the Kenora\nIndian Residential School.\n\n\"There is another problem that this school\nhas to contend with. Whole families come regularly\nto see children and when they are sick. They squat\nfor days near the school and, considering it to be\ntheir perfect right, they demand to be fed. They\nmust be fed or they are offended and get real mad.\nNaturally, the school doesn't want to antagonize\nthese people or they will lose the children. The\nIndians feel it is Government money that pays all.\nIt is a problem. Have you anything to suggest?\"\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nRev. Fr. J.E. Baillargeon O.M.I., Principal of Kenora Indian Residential School, has requested me to bring to your attention a rather peculiar situation.\n\nHis children are bound to return to school on the 15th inst but it is a certain fact that the largest number of them (if not all) will not be brought back by their parents. The \"blueberry season\" is very late this year and as blueberry picking is the main money earning medium for the Indians of the district during Summer, all hands must be used with the conclusion that none of the parents will agree to bring back their children to school. That reason would seem frivolous in our civilized quarters but, the Indians it is peremptory.\n\nOn the other hand, the Principal cannot afford to lose any per capita grant on account of the many difficulties he has to struggle with. Of course, it might be objected that the Principal should have sent the children home a fortnight later. To this he would answer that he could not foresee the lateness of the season and secondly that the Indians, specially those around large centers were keen to have their children with them in order to allow them to participate in the celebrations attending the Diamond Jubilee of the Confederation.\n\nThe Principal has asked me to respectfully lay the whole situation before you with the request that for this present year the holiday term be extended 15 days for the children of his school, per capita grant being allowed meanwhile. You will kindly communicate your answer to the Rev. Principal and if you think in order to advise me at Gravelbourg.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 12th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nRev.

Poltras, dated 24th June, with enclosures respecting the Roman Catholic Boarding School in course of erection at Rat Portage.\n\nThe plans were submitted to me by His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface on the 18th instant on the train between St. Albert and Calgary. To prevent the money lapsing the plans being suitable I authorized His Grace to direct that the materials be bought and work commenced immediately.\n\nThe amount of appropriation for this school is $2,500 and as the building proposed to be erected as per plans approved by me (copy of which will be forwarded as soon as can be procured) will cost over $3,000, I would recommend that the total sum appropriated for the purpose be paid direct to His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface with the understanding that the building will be completed this summer in accordance with the plans approved by me, the Church assuming the cost over and above the amount appropriated.\n\nThis matter has been mentioned verbally to the Minister in Winnipeg and he has expressed the wish that it be referred to him on his return to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy of\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA 2nd July 1897\n\nMr. [Name],\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st ultimo with enclosure from the Rev.

Boarding school in course of erection at Rat Portage; and in reply I beg to say that Cheque No. 6625 in favor of His Grace, the Archbishop of St Boniface, for the sum of $2500 is enclosed herewith, this being the amount of the appropriation for this school up to the 30th June last.\n\nThe accounts which accompanied your letter above quoted are returned herewith in order that the same be paid by His Grace out of the Cheque sent. Any unexpended balance up to the 30th June last will have to be refunded; it would be well for His Grace to pay for all material purchased and work done up to that date, out of the appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Secretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir Stewart,\n\nThe Cheyenne\nand Kiowa\n\nPotatoe\n\nThe papers herewith?\n\nFrom [signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMemorandum for the Acting Deputy Supt.

There are no funds appropriated for this purpose but as the need of seats especially is very great, I would recommend that part of the grant for maintenance at that school, unexpended, be applied towards such expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, [Signature]\n\nMEMO: Accountant.\n\nWhat do you think of the proposition? Remember &\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n33 June 1905\n\n[Signature]\nOur services, and bearing half the cost of the maintenance of their children's school, also cost of funeral expenses, we are fairly doing our duty.\n\nI consider half cost of keeping, which includes clothing, bedding, victuals, fuel, light and kindred helps, averages at least $500 per day or $600 per month.\n\nNeskota was in our charge from the 10th of February 1901 to 18th January 1902, or 11 months. At $600 per month this makes $6,600. The half of this sum is $3,300 which is the amount I think the Indian Department will contribute towards the keeping and caring of said Neskota, its helper and fostered ward.\n\nI might say that she had been receiving help from the school for a year previous to our taking them in charge.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Agencies\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report to you the death of George Neshtota (aged about 10 years) which occurred on the 16th inst. on the premises of the Rat Portage Boarding School.\n\nSaid Neshtota had been in the keeping of the school since the 10th of February, 1916.\n\nLast winter I reported to yourself and Dr. Hanson the case of this Indian who was ill at the time and had no relatives in the neighborhood, who could provide for him. I was advised by Dr. Hanson to take said Neshtota under my charge, give him the necessary attention and then apply to the Indian Department for compensation.\n\nConsidering the dangerous and loathsome nature of the disease (consumption and violent scrophulous sore), it was necessary to set apart a building for his exclusive use. Clothing and bedding were supplied, a great quantity of which were consumed owing to the necessities of the disease. Light, fuel and victuals were also regularly supplied and skilful nursing performed by the sisters.\n\nAt times, when it was wetter, it was necessary to hire help to attend on him; the hired help was continuous during the last months of his illness.\n\nI consider that by freely giving\nhis reserve to help him wander here some years ago, and until last year was able to support himself by doing chore work, but the loathsome nature of his disease forced him to quit working and he took refuge near the school property where he remained until his death. The amount of compensation viz $75 seems to me fair and most reasonable for carrying to such a case, and would therefore most respectfully recommend the same to your favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Principal and Mr. Indian Agent Edwards both urge the provision of an engine for the Kenora Indian Residential School launch. It is stated that this replacement is most urgent. Funds are available for certain expenditure at this school and I have enquired as to the best and most economical method of satisfying the request. The Consulting Naval Engineer of the Department of Defence recommends the purchase of a 32-40 h.p. Redwing engine from Messrs. R. A. Sproule & Sons, Ottawa. This engine has run from one to two thousand miles and has been lately completely overhauled at the factory. It is equipped in a most modern fashion and is stated by both Mr. Indian Agent Edwards and Messrs. R. A. Sproule & Sons as quite suitable for the school launch. The cost of this engine, new, today would be over $1,400. The one offered can be secured for $500, f.o.b. Ottawa. The only charge, other than carriage, would be for a battery (estimated cost $30.) I have seen the engine running and it appears to be in first-class condition.\n\nSproule & Sons, at my request, offered to properly crate and ship this engine to Kenora, so that it may be placed in the school launch and operated for one week - payment to be made at the expiration of this trial if our officers are entirely satisfied.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your authority to complete this arrangement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell D. Perrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMay 22nd., 1926.\n\nMessrs. Red Wing Motor Company,\nRed Wing,\nMinnesota, U.S.A.\n\nGentlemen,-\n\nWe have just sold our used model \"B\" Red Wing, which you had back at the factory and overhauled after the fire in our boat, to the Dominion Government here, who are taking it to one of the Northern Lakes on trial, after having seen it run on test here. You will recall what model it is and that you recently added Bosch electric starting and complete modern pressure oiling.\n\nWe have been requested by the Department to have you forward proper instructions covering this model to their post and would therefore ask that you comply, sending as complete instructions as possible to,-\n\nThe Reverend Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nBusiness has been dull in the marine trade here this Spring, but you may rest assured prospects developing will be attended to with due to our mutual profit.\n\nThanking you for past favours and you will attend to this promptly,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nfor the firm.\nR. A. SPROULE & SON\nBEECHWOOD AVENUE\nOTTAWA\nCANADA\n\nManufacturers\nSales Agents\nMay 22nd., 1926....\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada\n\nAttention Mr. Ferrier.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nComplying with your request, we shall ship on Tuesday next, C.P.Ry. prepaid, to your agent Edwards, at Kenora, the Red-Wing, Model 32-40 inspected at our plant, while running this morning. It is understood that this is being shipped for acceptance by you, after trial in the boat under average running conditions for one week, when if everything is satisfactory, you will make payment as arranged. On the other hand, if it does not meet your requirements, you are to assume full responsibility for carriage charges and for the return of the motor to us here, undamaged and in the same condition as when it left us.\n\nWe are forwarding you, besides the motor with reverse gear, two unit Bosch electric starting and lighting system attached, your officials in Kenora to attend to the supply and attaching of a suitable 6 volt battery for starting and lighting. Enclosed inside the crate will be the oil gauge, the ammeter panel and ignition switch.\n\nThe base of the engine will be left with sufficient oil, but we would suggest that a close check be kept on the float gauge at rear of motor, which should be half way up the glass for correct oil level.\n\nThe adjustments on the carburetor are made and if the motor is set in the boat without these being disturbed, properly connected up to propeller shaft coupling, etc., there should not be any further trouble. We recommend starting by hand with hand lever being forwarded first few times. See that spark retarded and throttle lever open, prime with good gas in primers and after running have your local electrical man check generator and ammeter for charging of battery.\n\nWe have instructed the Red Wing Company to forward full instructions which should reach Kenora before the engine.\n\nThanking you and awaiting your further commands,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nfor the firm.\nOttawa, May 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the supplying of an engine for the Kenora Indian Residential School launch, I have to inform you that the Department has asked Messrs. R. A. Sproule & Son to ship to you a Redwing, Model 38-40. This engine, run from one to two thousand miles, has received excellent care and has recently been overhauled at the factory and equipped with the latest starting and lighting system. The arrangement with Sproule & Son is explained in the first paragraph of their letter of the 22nd instant, copy of which is enclosed. If, after a week's trial, you and the Rev. Principal are thoroughly satisfied that the engine is suitable and a good bargain at payment will be made.\n\nI wish to refer you to the letter of Sproule concerning the battery, etc. You may purchase a 6 volt battery, after securing prices if necessary. The school authorities are responsible for the installation.\n\nThe engine is as shown on page \"A\" but is fitted with a new cylinder and lighting and starting equipment as shown on page \"B\". Both pages are enclosed. The bed plate for the engine is as shown on page \"C\". Mr. Sproule suggests that allowance should be made when ordering the bed for the gear teeth on the fly wheel.\n\nGiving oiling instructions, etc., are given on the points on the motor which require attention. The Redwing Company are sending you and the Rev. Principal a full set of instructions.\n\nWe are satisfied that this is an excellent engine and would prepare a voucher, in duplicate, in favour of Sproule & Son, certify to it and send it under separate cover by express letter. Remarks concerning the terms are being offered, so that preparations for shipment are received. Sproule & Son, O. P. H., freight prepaid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, May 25, 1926.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the supplying of an engine for the Kenora Indian Residential School launch. The arrangements made by Mr. Perrier are confirmed and you will be further advised when the report of our Kenora agent is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. B. Beallargeon, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Rev. Principal and yourself should determine what repairs to the roof and eaves are necessary and have two or more responsible contractors quote on the work. Quotations should be submitted to the Department, for our consideration. It may be possible to include whatever outside painting is necessary in with this award, as I note that it is one of the urgent requirements. It might be well to include with the cupboards, shelving, chapel seats, etc., (see page 2 of your 108-12 of March 2nd) the repairs to the basement floor, window openings and new doors.\n\nA decision concerning what amount of expenditure can be incurred in connection with the laundry will be reached after it is learned what the improvements at present under consideration will cost.\n\nYou might make a suggestion concerning the disposal of the old engine of the school launch. I am sending the Rev. Principal a copy of this letter, for his information and guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, May 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-12 of the 14th instant, with general reference to repairs and replacements at the Kenora Indian Residential School. You have already received information concerning the engine for the school launch and instructions concerning the purchase of window blinds. I am authorising Mr. Inspector Bunn to purchase twelve beds and mattresses.\n\nYou may accept the offer of Charles Ratchford, Plumbing Contractor, of Kenora, as detailed in his letter of the 19th ultimo (which is returned herewith) viz.: repairing and replacing lavatory fixtures at a total cost of $85. When you are submitting an account in favour of the contractor, return his written offer.\n\nYou are authorized to secure competitive prices for the installation of a suitable hot water tank for the school and award the business to the firm quoting the lowest.\n\nI note that the Rev. Principal has stated that the alterations to the laundry, the installing of a boiler, etc., can be postponed. It is possible that some of these improvements can be done this year, but a decision cannot be reached until the cost of the other repairs and replacements is determined. You should have the Rev. Principal indicate what seats, tables, cupboards and shelves are required, listing the material necessary and indicating the probable cost of the labour that cannot be supplied by the school. Consideration will then be given to authorising the work on a day labour basis, under your direction.\n\nEncl.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\n- The Rev.

However, when the engine is packed again, the principal thinks it will be all right.\n\nHe also says the self-starter does not appear to be very strong, but no doubt this difficulty will disappear with a trifle of wear in the newly babbitted bearings.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the account for the engine be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A\nOttawa, July 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-12 of the 14th instant, with reference to the marine engine lately supplied the Kenora Indian Residential School.

Laying the roof in this manner has caused the galvanized iron roof to rust out from below, while the surface still looks reasonably good, close examination shows it to be full of pin holes. There is however part of the original tin roof that has never been recovered that is in not too bad a condition, but it should at least have a good coat of Asphalium Paint. The other part of the roof\u2014galvanized iron\u2014has been eaten off by the galvanized iron, but to make a first class job we would recommend putting a new \"Keystone Apollo\" galvanized iron roof over the entire main roof. The galvanized iron roofs on the lean-to's can be put in good condition by repairing the soldered joints and repairing the flashings.\n\nThe sewers and rain water leaders also need considerable repairing.\n\nThe cost of covering the entire main roof with 28 gauge \"Keystone Apollo\" galvanized iron, with standing seams, repairing the lean-to galvanized decks and flashings, repairing the sewers and rain water leaders, as well as removing the old roof covering, would be $667.50.\nBERGMAN & NELSON\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS\nAND\nBUILDERS' SUPPLIES\nYARD AND OFFICE CORNER OF FIRST AND CHIPMAN STREETS\nKENORA, ONT.

When I went to the Agency, I took with me the mechanic who was supposed to have made a satisfactory job, and in reply to some questions asked him by the Agent, he admitted the shortcomings already spoken of above, but, of course, in a manner calculated to minimize them. For it is quite natural to his immediate pecuniary advantage to have the whole thing settled and OKed there and then.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that such a mechanic, having just completed a job, would immediately commit himself to any statement which might compromise his chances for settlement; and I felt at the time, as I do now, that I was the victim of circumstances which had been brought about, (1) by the proximate negligence of the vendor whose duty it was, in my opinion, to have sent one of their own men to install such a high-priced engine, and one withal which was guaranteed by them to his satisfaction; (2) the remote negligence of the purchasers who, one would have thought, would have sought to protect themselves by a proper care for the proper installation of such an engine.\n\nFinally, it was left upon me either accept the engine there and then, or to refuse it, and even at that time the engine was still in commission, as I have already stated, it was not giving that degree of satisfaction that inspired any confidence for the future; furthermore, the apparent reluctance of the mechanic to involve himself in any statement likely to give rise to the suggestion that the installation was not all that could be desired, made my position a very undesirable one indeed.\n\nIn conclusion, the only alternative would have been to have the engine returned to the Company \"at my own expense,\" and in the same condition etc., etc., etc., and it was mostly due to the fact that I did not have the engine returned; I am fully aware of the very accommodating nature of the term \"in the same condition,\" and could not afford to run the risk of a refusal by the Co. to accept the engine.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.E. Baillargeon\n\n(J.E. Baillargeon O.M.I.)\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian Residential School,\nKenora - Ontario,\nFebruary 20th, 1927.\n\nSir;\n\nIn accordance with your request concerning the statement of Inspector Bennett as to the condition of the motor in our boat, I herewith append my report on the matter.\n\nAt the time the engine arrived here, I was unfortunate in not having at my disposal, the services of one of our own expert mechanics whom I was expecting. The only alternative therefore, was to hire a mechanic in Kenora, and after making extensive enquiries, a man was recommended to me who undertook to do the work. The installation being accomplished, a trial trip was made on the lake, and I had certainly no reason to be enthusiastic over the result!\n\nIn the first place, neither the self-starter nor the oil-pump ever worked at all. The packing however, is to be considered as the greatest trouble; for, upon the occasion of the trial trip above mentioned, not less than twelve gallons of oil were consumed, and this was a quantity certainly out of all proportion to the distance travelled, and I am unable to say that there was any marked improvement in this respect upon the few other occasions when the boat was taken out.\n\nUpon the few subsequent trips made by the boat, the engine never ran smoothly, and the last occasion upon which it was to be taken out, the engine had barely been started when, probably owing to there being no pin through the lock-nut, some part of the mechanism got out and smashed the oil-pan, with the consequences too well known to require further details.\n\nAs to whether the engine left the Company in this condition, or whether we are to attribute the mishap to the negligence of the mechanic who installed it, I am not in a position to say. Now, I need not add anything about the present condition of the motor, since a representative of the Red Wing Motor Co., Mr. Anderson, who has examined the engine a few days ago, is to make his report concerning this matter.\n\nRemarks.\n\nIn view of the fact that the vendors guaranteed this engine, it seems to me that it would have been both to their own interest, and to that of the purchasers had they undertaken to send a man to install it, and failing this precaution upon their part, that the purchasers themselves would have stipulated for this condition. The guarantee that the engine would give satisfaction is, I presume, based upon the supposition that it would be properly installed, and this being so, it seems incredible that the Company as guarantors, did not take any step to insure this condition, and so it appears that they have not done their utmost to make good their guarantee.\n\nIn view of the above circumstances related in my report, the fact that I accepted the engine may not seem to be altogether consistent with the facts stated concerning the trial of the boat following upon the installation of the engine. I am bound to say that I was unwilling from the start, to accept this\nKENORA, Ont., February 10th, 1927\n\nCapt. F. Edwards\nIndian Agent\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your request I was out to the Indian School and inspected the damage done to the motor in the Indian School boat. I find that one of the connecting rod bolts broke on the big end on the front cylinder and the rod broke through the upper and lower base of engine. This was purely an accident and is liable to happen to any motor. To repair this engine it would be better to ship it back to the factory and have them rebuild it. This of course would be quite an expense and would suggest that for the small difference in the cost for a new motor it would not pay to ship the old one to the factory for repairs.\n\nThe cost of a 40 H.P. Red Wing motor with electric starter generator and storage battery complete F.O.B. Kenora, is $1243.00. This would be a later type motor than the one at present in the boat. If this motor is purchased from us we will allow you $200. for the old motor and make the installation of the new motor free of charge and guarantee the motor for one year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAnderson Boat Works,\n\nper,\n\nJ. Anderson.\nEnclosed herewith please find a letter from the Rev. Principal of Kenora Residential School and a letter from the Anderson Boat Works, both reporting on the motor in the school launch.\n\nYou will note that the principal claims he was not satisfied with the engine when it was installed, but I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that before I certified the vouchers for the engine I interviewed the principal and the mechanic he mentions in my office, and they expressed their satisfaction, so I do not think we can accept responsibility for the breakdown.\n\nIn the circumstances I would recommend that as the accident was beyond their control they should get a new engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nE/A Enc.\nOttawa, March 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 23rd ultimo, with enclosures, concerning the motor in the launch at the Kenora Indian Residential School. I am satisfied that, if the engine had been installed by an expert, a new one would not be required at this time. My advice is that the school authorities make arrangements for a new engine and, if they feel that the Department should bear any portion of the cost, they should make a special plea for a grant in this connection. If this action is taken, you might inform the Rev. Principal of the offer of the Anderson Boat Works, viz.: to install a 40 H. P. Red Wing Motor with electric starter, generator and storage battery, complete, and to guarantee for one year for $1245.00, less $200 for the old motor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

He also states that the plaster is falling off the walls of the boys' playroom, and that one of the new toilets overflows every time it is used. Please furnish a report regarding the classroom accommodation, and the repairs mentioned by the Inspector as being required.\n\nThe Inspector states that there is no more wood on the school property for fuel, and recommends that the Department arrange that the school can obtain the fuel required from the nearby Reserve. You might take this matter up with the Indians, and ascertain whether they would allow the school to obtain the fuel required, and the terms upon which same could be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I should be grateful if you would discuss this with the Rev. Principal and, if necessary, secure the advice of some competent person. A small fee for such person's inspection and recommendation will be paid. I believe that hoarfrost gathers in considerable quantity on the inside of the building and, when there are changes of temperature, the result is most injurious to the stock. Your careful attention to this matter is requested.\n\nYou may also engage the services of a competent expert on steam heating, have him make an inspection of the boiler at the school and also the heating plant generally. The Department wishes to have a report as to what replacements or repairs are required and an estimate of the cost.\n\nAnother matter has arisen out of the visit of the Very Rev. Father Magan, vice Very Rev. Father Beys who has been transferred to Edmonton. I am informed that the kitchen range has outlived its usefulness.

Holman,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Residential School,\nKenora - Ontario\nMarch 30th., 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of your letter to our Indian Agent, Mr. Frank Edwards re the proposed installation of a new engine in the School launch. I refer to your advice however, that the school authorities make arrangements for the purchase of more land. I know that I could not possibly proceed along these lines without the definite assurance that the Department would be willing to defray the cost, or at any rate, a considerable portion thereof. You may therefore accept this as the special plea for a grant in this connection as mentioned in your letter.\n\nOwing to an excessively wet season last year, our crop of hay and potatoes was a failure, and we had to buy both commodities at high prices. Moreover, added to this handicap, we have lost no fewer than five head of stock during the past few months; and as two of these were work horses, we were obliged to replace them immediately by cash and costly purchases. Finally, the amount of sickness in the school during the past winter has been quite exceptional, and this fact in addition to the above mentioned misfortunes does not leave us in a position to contemplate any such expenditure as the purchase and installation of a new engine for the boat would involve us in.\n\nMay I add that I have never, at any time, realized the possibility of getting anything aside out of the grant to this school, which would serve as a standby for such occasions as the present, and indeed I may say that where everything is going all right, it is only with the greatest care and caution that we are able to meet ends meet, and at a time of misfortune like the present, it is more than we can do to entertain any expenditure other than for absolute necessities in the nature of food and clothing, for the children and members of the staff.\n\nTrusting I shall hear from you favourably concerning this matter,\n\nI remain, Sir.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - Ont.\nKenora, Ont.\nApril 2nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 129-1-5 of the 14th inst. I enclose herewith a letter from the principal of Kenora Residential School regarding the engine for the school launch, which I have been asked to forward to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 6th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School with reference to the installation of a new engine in the school launch, and requesting that the Department defray a part of the expense in the supplying of a new engine.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 14th ultimo regarding the offer of the Anderson Boat Works to install a 40 H.P., Red Wing motor with electric starter, generator and storage battery, complete, for $1243.00, less $200 for the old motor. The Department will favourably consider the providing of one-half the cost, viz. $521.50, of the engine referred to, and you may inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the engine and the amount the Department will pay should be forwarded in duplicate, properly certified, when payment of the Department's share will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nKENORA - Ontario.\n\nMarch 17th., 1927.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to apply for authorization to have the following urgent repairs and improvements done immediately in our school:\n\n1) Plumbing repairs; lo) to the pipe from sink to sewer in the girls recreation hall, which pipe is completely obstructed. We have done all we can to clear it, but unsuccessfully.\n\n2) To the lavatory in the boys room. The water runs only with difficulty, owing either to a defect in bowl or to the pipe being obstructed.\n\nWe also need the services of a mechanic to adjust, as soon as possible, our water pump which is going out of order, and to overhaul our electric motor in the workshop.\n\nBesides, I want to notify the Department that the children's lavatory for the summer should, by all means, be removed to a more suitable place; and that, probably, we will need the help of a man to blast the rock where we want to dig at least six or seven feet deep. Moreover, the present lavatory is partly burnt, and has to be rebuilt. Therefore, I ask the Department to kindly authorize me to make the necessary expenses, the amount of which would be almost impossible to determine before we have the work done.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(J.C. Baillargeon, M.I.)\nPrincipal.\nCompression Bibb Tap should be supplied to Laundry Room;\n\nMain Water Supply in Basement needs new\n1\u00bd\" Stop and Waste Cock;\n\nThe cost of these Plumbing Repairs would be\napproximately Seventy-five ($75.00) Dollars.\n\nThe Electric Motor which drives the Water\nSupply Pump requires new Brushes and over-hauling. The\ncost of this would be approximately Ten ($10.00) Dollars.\n\nThe Electric Driven Pump needs to be over-\nhauled, and requires a new Bronze Bushing on the Drive\nShaft. The repairs to the Pump are imperative, and\nwould cost approximately Thirty ($30.00) Dollars.\n\nWe trust this is the information which\nyou require.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CAMPBELL HEATING COMPANY.\n\nPer., [Signature]\n\nDMO/C.\nCapt. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to submit the following report, as requested by you, on the condition of the Plumbing at the Indian Residential School, Kenora.\n\nThe Outdoor Latrine for Summer Use has been partly burned, and is such condition that it is beyond repair. We would suggest that a new Latrine be built, the cost of the Carpenter Work for building would be approximately Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars.\n\nIt would also be necessary to blast out rock for the pit, and this work would cost approximately One Hundred and Fifty ($150.00) Dollars.\n\nThe Plumbing Repairs required, are as follows:-\n\nBoys' Toilet needs Washers in the Flush Tank Supply Valves;\n\nGirls' Toilet needs Washers in the Flush Tank Supply Valves;\n\nGirls' Toilet, Soil Pipe needs cleaning;\n\nGirls' Playroom, Lavatory needs new trap with Clean-out;\n\nBoys' Sleeping Quarters, Self-closing Hot and Cold Water Taps in Wash Basins, need adjusting and small repairs;\n\nGirls' Sleeping Quarters, Self-closing Hot and Cold Water Taps in Wash Basins, need adjusting and small repairs;\n\nHot Water Supply Pipes in Laundry Room have been frozen, and will need to be replaced.\nWe might point out that there is no Ventilating System in the School, and should the Department decide that a Ventilating System should be installed, it would be necessary to design a Complete System before an estimate of cost could be given.\n\nWe trust the information contained in this Report is that which you require.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CAMPBELL HEATING COMPANY,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDMC/C.\nThe Plaster in the Boys' Playroom is in a very bad state of repair and needs to be patched. This Room also require re-decorating. It is impossible to give an approximate price on this work, owing to the fact that the decorating could be done in several different ways, and it would be necessary to know which style of wall finish would be required.\n\nThe Girls' Playroom, which at present has a Seating Capacity of Thirty-five Pupils and a Floor Space of Four Hundred and Fifty Square Feet, is below the Standard size. The Floor Space required for this number of Pupils is Six Hundred and Thirty Square Feet, and the writer would suggest that a General Contractor be called in to report on the best method of increasing the size of this Class Room to the size required.\n\nOn inspecting the Heating System we found that the Boiler is not low enough set to satisfactorily heat the Building with the present one pipe Steam System. Also some of the Mains are too small. Further, some of the arms leading to the Risers are too long, and the water of Condensation from the Radiators is not being properly handled under these conditions. The end of the Mains, where they return to the Boiler are slightly below the Water Line of the Boiler. We do not think it advisable to lower the Boiler in an effort to overcome the present difficulties, because it would be necessary to change the size of the present Steam Main and the cost of this work would be out of proportion to the benefits obtained.\n\nWe would suggest that the present system be changed to a two pipe Vapor Vacuum System of the Dunham Trane or Webster type and a Pump and Receiver be used to handle the condensation. The cost of doing this work and supplying all materials would be in the neighborhood of One Thousand ($1000.00) Dollars.\n\nThe present Heating Boiler was found to be of sufficient size to properly warm the Building - Aime the Radiation was sufficient.\nCapt. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian School.\n\nWe wish to make the following additions to our report of March 24th.\n\nThe present Range is a two oven #A.D.18 Huron Chief, manufactured by the Western Foundry Co., of Wingham. We find this Range needs complete new Fire Box Lining, including Grates. The Damper in the Smoke Pipe needs to be adjusted, and requires a new Towel Rail, a new Fire Door and a new Ash Pit Door - The cost of making these repairs would be approximately Seventy-five ($75.00) Dollars;\n\nAll Window Frames and Door Frames in the School are very loosely fitted, and we would suggest that a good Asphalt Caulking Compound be put in around these Frames, with a proper Caulking Gun - The cost of this work would be approximately One Hundred and Twenty ($120.00) Dollars;\n\nThe Wooded Fire Escape Platforms need to be replaced with new ones at a cost of approximately One Hundred and Twenty-five ($125.00) Dollars;\n\nThe Brick Work on the Chimneys requires to be rebuilt from the Roof, owing to the fact that the present Brick Work has become loose, and this is destroying the draft required by the Kitchen Range and the Heating Boiler. There are two Chimneys on the Building, and this applies to both of them - The cost of this work would be approximately Forty ($40.00) Dollars;\n\nGrates in the present #7-35 A. Empress Steam Boiler, manufactured by the International Heater Co., of Utica, N.Y., require new Connecting Bars and Connecting Links - Also four Grate Bars - The cost of putting these in would be approximately Eighty-five ($85.00) Dollars.\nKenora, Ont.\nApril 6th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to reply herewith to your letter 129-1-5 of the 22nd ult. regarding ventilation of the barn at Kenora Residential School. The principal, in discussion, suggests a \"King\" ventilator costing from $150 to $200, but I have asked for a report from Mr. Andrew Gordon here, who built the barn.\n\nMr. Campbell's report on steam-heating is enclosed herewith. The principal refers me to a report to the Department dated Sept. 14th, 1925. Would you kindly look this up?\n\nThe kitchen range is recommended for repairs in Mr. Campbell's report, at an approximate cost of $75.\n\nWith reference to yours 129-1-5 of the 17th ult. Mr. Campbell suggests that, the available space in the junior classroom being 450 square feet as against the requisite 630 square feet, a general contractor be asked to indicate the best way of achieving an increase.\n\nIf voted funds permit, I would recommend instant attention to the other needs reported by Mr. Campbell. All seem necessary. We would call for the usual tenders, and I would suggest in addition the spending of $640 on inside and outside painting largely as per tender of Messrs. Bergman and Nelson of July 15th, 1926, little having been done in this regard since the Department acquired the building.\n\nI took up with the Town Council the matter of wood as reported by the Inspector, and since they cannot offer enough dead and fallen wood on their lease of part of Res. 30B I have asked the principal to locate the wood needed, when I shall again take the matter up with the Council and the Indians as required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 6th instant, with reference to repairs required at the Kenora Indian Residential School. I note that you will forward a report concerning the ventilation of the barn.\n\nYou are authorised to have the kitchen range repaired by the Campbell Heating Company, at an approximate cost of $75. The repairs required are mentioned in their letter of the 2nd instant. You may also have this firm repair the plumbing in the boys' toilet, the girls' toilet, the boys' playroom, the boys' dormitory, the girls' dormitory, the laundry and the basement (see their letter of March 24th), at an approximate cost of $75. The electric motor and pump may also be overhauled and repaired, at a total approximate cost of $40.\n\nWith reference to the other repairs and replacements needed at this school, you will receive a further communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nI have made a study of the files and I find that the following repairs and replacements, other than what have been authorized, are required at the Kenora Indian Residential School:\n\n1. Painting exterior woodwork and painting and decorating interior - Estimate $800.\n\n2. Repairing walls of the boys' playroom (plaster falling off) - Estimate (?)\n\n3. Replacements to benches and cupboards, etc.\n   - chapel seats\n   - sewing room table\n   - cupboards (bedroom, workroom and kitchen)\n   - bookcase and shelves\n   - clothes closet in principal's room\n   - dining room tables and 1 serving table\n   - box seats and ironing table in workroom\n   - wardrobe in workroom\n   - rack and shelves in the bakery\n   - shoe cabinet\n\n4. Heating alterations: change to 2-pipe vapor vacuum system - $1,000.\n   New boiler grates - $65.\n\n5. Fire escape platforms - $125.\n   Caulking around doors and windows - $120.\n   Brickwork on 2 chimneys - $60.\n   Repairs to partitions in the basement - $10.\n   Melancthon junior classroom - $10.\n   Drying room with steam equipment - $600.\n   Ice house - $600.\n   Clearing - $600.\n   Repairs to wharf - $10.\n   Henhouse roof - $10.\n   Basement floor (no report on this lately) - $10.\n   Pressure tank (no report on this lately) - $10.\n\nSome of the minor repairs will have to be undertaken by the school management. They are getting an increase of $15 in their per capita grant. In July, last, the Campbell Heating Co. and Bergman & Nelson quoted on all the carpentering repairs, painting, benches, seats, cupboards, etc., and these items will apparently cost in the neighbourhood of $5,000.\n\nThere is $2100 in the Estimates for this school. It was voted for painting, replacements to benches, cupboards, etc., and general repairs.\nwhat is to be done, as a guide to those quoting. Only the most urgent interior decorating is to be done. When these tenders are received, they should be forwarded to the Department for consideration.\n\nI wish to refer to the replacements to benches, tables, etc. The Department is satisfied that 14 chapel benches are required, but I should like to know something of the urgency for new dining-room tables and for the various cupboards, box seats, shelves, etc., included in the offer of the Campbell Heating Company and Bergman & Nelson of July of last year. I am returning Bergman & Nelson's tender, which is in detail, with the replacements referred to marked in red. This should be returned to the Department when you are commenting on the urgency of these items.\n\nPlease comment on the relative importance of the other improvements, viz.: fire escape platforms, brickwork on two chimneys, repairs to wharf and henhouse roof, and indicate whether you would have this work done by a responsible labourer, under your supervision, the materials to be bought by yourself. You might also intimate if any portion of these improvements can be done by the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, April 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 108-12 of the 6th instant, the Department is desirous of arranging for the most important repairs and replacements listed hereunder:\n\n1. Painting.\n2. Replacements to benches, tables, etc.\n3. Alterations to heating plant.\n4. Painting playground walls.\n5. Fire escape platforms.\n6. Brickwork on two chimneys.\n7. Caulking around doors and windows.\n8. Repairs to wharf.\n9. New henhouse roof.\n10. Enlarging junior classroom.\n11. Laundry drying-room with steam equipment.\n12. Pigery.\n13. Ice house.\n\nThere is also the ventilation of the barn, concerning which you are to furnish a report; the advisability of clearing more land and two items concerning which there has been no request lately, (a) renewing the basement floor and (b) pressure tank for storing water. In your answering communication, you might refer to the need in connection with the basement floor and pressure tank. I may say that the clearing will have to be postponed, as all the funds available for this school are certainly required for other purposes.\n\nCaulking around the doors and windows, enlarging the junior classroom, the laundry drying-room, the pigery and the ice house will have to stand for the time being, as the funds are limited. A note in this connection, however, has been made for future estimates. I am asking the Department Architect to let me have a recommendation concerning the proposed heating alterations, i.e., a change to a 2 pipe vapor vacuum system.\n\nYou will please ask the Campbell Heating Company, Bergman & Nelson and any others you wish to quote a price on the painting of the exterior woodwork; painting and decorating the interior and repairing the walls of the boys' playroom. You should prepare brief specifications as to\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 21, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Orr,\n\nThere has been considerable difficulty in the matter of heating the Kenora Indian Residential School.

It remains therefore, entirely with the Department as to whether or not we are to have the use of the boat next summer.\n\nThat the need exists, there is no question whatever, and it is a need, moreover, which will be more acutely felt next fall, in view of the fact that the very economical boat service we were fortunate to secure a few times last fall, is no longer available, and as far as I can see, we shall be, (failing the use of our own boat) entirely dependent on the costly services of the companies in Kenora.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.E.

Ferrier,\nJupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy trip to Ottawa has given very little result as far as Kenora School is concerned and I am greatly disappointed. I have made urgent requests in behalf of that School because its needs were greater than those of any four Indian Residential Schools, but to no avail.\n\nThe Agent at Kenora advises the Principal of the School that the Department of Indian Affairs consider their offer to meet half of the cost of a suitable engine for the launch as fair and reasonable. Perhaps it is, but practically it means nothing, the school being hardly able to meet current expenses.\n\nA boat is absolutely necessary to Kenora School, and this year more than ever, the Lake of the Woods being so high that the road between the School and the Town of Kenora is covered with water.\n\nI hope the Department will reconsider this matter and will see his way clear to pay full expenses for a suitable engine.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend J. Magnan, O.M.I.\nProvincial.\nJune 8, 1927.\n\nDear Father Magnan:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, with reference to the requirements at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nRelative to meeting the cost of a marine engine for the school boat, I wish to state that last year the Department supplied equipment which was considered quite suitable. This evidently was not installed by an expert and the school authorities must take a large share in the responsibility for the present replacement need. In view of this, I consider the Department's offer to meet half the cost of a suitable engine is more than fair. I note that the school is hardly able to meet current expenses. I wish to suggest to you that the church authorities do as is done in the majority of Indian residential schools, i.e., provide a grant for special purposes from time to time.\n\nMr. Ferrier has asked me to refer to the first sentence of your letter and to point out that, since your visit to Ottawa, the Department has arranged for proper ventilation of the barn; has made repairs to the kitchen range and to the plumbing; has overhauled the electric motor and pump; has asked for a full report and recommendation from the Dunham Heating Company on the entire heating system, with a view to taking whatever remedial action is necessary; is ready to proceed with the painting and with the repairing of the walls and with the replacement of the church roof, as soon as quotations have been received. I am favourably considering replacing the dining room tables, building cupboards, etc., renewing the platforms on the fire escapes, repairing the chimneys, repairing the wharf and renewing the roof of the henhouse.\n\nYou may rest assured that, whenever funds are available for the purpose, the Department will give favourable consideration to all legitimate requirements. But I am sure you will understand that we cannot replace expensive equipment which, because of improper care, has failed to give service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

Father MacLaren,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour heating of Domestic Hot Water.\n\nAt the present time you have a 80 gal Tank connected with the heating boiler and no Jacket Heater.\n\nI would suggest that, as this tank is about done and has only 1\" connections, that you have installed in basement a 210 Gall Tank with 2\" connections to a Gurney Cottage Heater No. 906, and not have it connected to Heating Boiler.\n\nThis will give you all the hot water that you would use, and will burn 24\" wood and has a large door and capacity for wood.\n\nThe approximate cost of this is:\n\nTHREE HUNDRED & SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS..................$375.00\n\nIf done at the same time.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nThe only practical solution of your heating problem, is to tap all radiators for return, opposite to the steam opening, and in this opening install a Trane or Dunham Radiator Trap. These openings should be tapped as near the bottom of radiator as possible, so as to receive all the condensed water.\n\nA return line of piping should then be installed, connecting all of the traps to a Trane Electric Pump and Receiver located in the basement near the boiler. The Steam Main then would not carry the condensed water from the radiators.\n\nTo provide for the water that would condense in the Steam Main, Steam Traps should be installed to properly drain the Steam Main into the receiver. You have a good dependable and cheap supply of Electric Current, and the operation of this small motor would cost very little. The present steam main would then be used only to supply steam to the radiators, and the steam would be dry.\n\nOne desirable feature of this Plan, is that the work could be done without cutting off the heat or taking out any part of Steam piping, and could be done of necessity in the winter time while the boiler is being used.\n\nAnother desirable feature of this system is that you could admit only what steam is required to each radiator and they would all heat evenly regardless of the amount of pressure on the boiler.\n\nYou would also do away with the use of Air Valves on the Radiators, all the air in the system being eliminated in the basement.\n\nHaving lowered the waterline in your heating system by installing the receiver it would not be necessary to lower the boiler.\n\nThe approximate cost of this would be:\n\nELEVEN HUNDRED & FIFTY DOLLARS.........................$1150.00\n\nYou to supply board for workmen.\n\nIf this is done we would guarantee to heat your building to your satisfaction in the coldest weather.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nYates, Heale & Co.\n\n[Signature]\nAug 18th 1926.\n\nRev. Father Baillargeon,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have inspected the Steam Heating System in your School, and beg to submit the following report.\n\nPlan of the Heating accompanies this letter.\n\nThe amount of Radiation is more than sufficient, and you would have not trouble if all the Radiators got hot.\n\nThe Boiler is apparently of sufficient capacity and the draft I am told is adequate.\n\nThe chief trouble lies in the system of piping which is employed on this job and shown on plan.\n\nAnother source of trouble is in the height of the boiler setting. On account of having rock to deal with, the boiler has not been set as low as it should have been.\n\nIn order to use the present system of piping, the boiler should be at least 12\" lower.\n\nAs at present used, the condensed water will pile up toward the North end of building, while the South end will work fine.\n\nThe branches in the North part are entirely too long and too small and have too little fall to work in connection with the South end, or to work well at all for that matter.\n\nIt is a system that should never be used when any other could be put in because all the condensed water having to come back to the boiler through the same pipe that takes the steam, causes a certain amount of this condensation to be re-evaporated, causing the steam to reach the point of maximum saturation before reaching the Radiators, when the aim should be to supply as dry steam as possible.\n\nAn overhead rain could be used in this building without lowering the Boiler, but to do that now would mean to practically tear out most of the heating in the North end of building.\n\nIt does not appear practical to lower the Boiler because the resulting Pit would have to be drained, and would entail considerable expense.\nOctober 24/21\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find enclosed.\n\nCopy of our report on Heating System at the Indian Board School at Kinawa, Ont., which system is new.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nYATES, NEALE & CO.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThis report left & Father Guy\n\n[Signature]\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\n\nJune 10th, 1927.\n\nThe approximate load in equivalent direct radiation being 2700 sq.ft.\n\nThe Head room in the Basement is only 6'6\" under the joists and to install the new boiler it will be necessary to provide a pit 12\" to 15\" deep to allow room for steam header. While the excavating of this pit will be somewhat difficult owing to the floor of the basement being rock, it is the only way possible under the circumstances.\n\nHOT WATER:\n\nThe Principal, Father Bilgeron advised me that when hot water was needed it was not possible to procure any great quantity at one time. The difficulty, I believe, is due to the boiler being undersized and the manner in which connections are made to the Storage Tank.\n\nWe have included in the specification that Contractor shall run a new steam line from steam header to tank, also specified that tank be provided with Hot Water Regulator, Thermometer and Relief Valve, leaving the connections to Jacket Heater remain as at present. In this way, the School Authorities will have controlled hot water at all times.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nThe piping of the system itself is in fairly good condition and will only be necessary to re-grade mains to conform to the Dunham layout.\n\nThe pipe covering is torn away in a great many places and this will have to be replaced\u2014approximately 50'.\n\nThe present flue is 10\"x10\"x 4b' high. It will be necessary to increase this height 10' to take care of the larger boiler. The School Authorities burn wood throughout the heating season and while a flue height of 8b' would not create enough draft for a coal fired boiler, we believe it will be large enough for this boiler burning wood. The building has good acoustics, being situated on a hill-side amidst open country. We would suggest placing a 10' length of 1b\" diameter galvanized pipe of suitable gauge on top of the present flue, securing same securely.\n\nTrusting our efforts in connection with this job meet with your approval and looking forward to the adoption of a Dunham System in this Building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.A. DUNHAM COMPANY LIMITED\nBRANCH SALES OFFICE NO. 2\n\nE.Fox, Engineer.\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nJune 10th, 1927.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nDominion Government Architect\n(Indian Department)\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRE: INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - KENORA, Ont\n\nWe have inspected the above job and are forwarding to you plan and specification covering the changing over of the present one-pipe steam system to a Dunham Return System, and we wish to make the following recommendations:\n\n**RADIALION:**\nThe writer checked over the radiation and while the building in general checks up fairly well, the top floor is not adequately heated. This floor is used for sleeping quarters and while the radiation needed is less in proportion to the other floors, we would advise adding the two new radiators shown on plan.\n\nThe Principal of the School informed me the two corner rooms on the first floor were cold. We have, therefore, added the necessary sections to the present radiators.\n\n**BOILER:**\nThe boiler at present installed in the building is a No.7-30-A Empress, Manufactured by The International Heater, with a capacity of 2800 sq.ft. of direct cast radiation. With a radiator load of 2164 sq.ft., and in addition a 220 Gallon Hot Water Tank, this boiler is far too small to handle the system.\n\nWe were in touch with the Boiler Manufacturers and they advise us it would be possible to add two new sections, making a capacity of 3600 sq.ft. However, we feel that even a boiler capacity of 3600 sq.ft. will not handle this job to make an efficient system. The present boiler has been in the building a good many years and is not in good shape needing a number of repairs and general patching up and overhauling. We have, therefore, specified a new boiler which will handle the new and old radiation as well as the steam coil in the Hot Water Tank.\nOttawa, June 27, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer further to your 100-12 of April 6th, last, concerning the replacements and alterations to the heating system at the Kenora Indian Residential School. I have had a report from the Dunham Heating Company expert. The only satisfactory remedial action would entail between Four and Five Thousand Dollars and I regret that this amount is not available this fiscal year. I shall arrange for an appropriation for the purpose next year. Please inform the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nSee also Yates report under\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter #129-1-5 of 19th April last re repairs to the Enora Indian Residential School.\n\nThe matters have been left in abeyance until now, owing to the difficulty in obtaining from the Principal what he considered the most needy work, and also his wish that the work should be done whilst the children were on vacation.\n\nThe matter of clearing more land can be left for the present, also the basement floor, and the pressure tank.\n\nEnclose please find tenders for the most important work from Messrs Fielder and Bradley, Conrad Swanson and Bergman and Nelson, although Messrs Bergman and Nelson are the highest tenderers, I would recommend in this case that their tender be accepted as they are in the best position to do more efficient work than the other firms and the Revd Principal is desirous of employing them.\n\nOnly the most important matters have been tendered on, and they are all very necessary.\n\nAs regards the dining room tables, these can be covered &c and so save cost., the cupboards and shelves as tendered for are necessary.\n\nBergman and Nelson has included in their tender the necessary temporary work on the platforms, pig-pen roof, &c.\n\nThe Principal intends doing a certain amount of other work with the school staff, and I would strongly recommend we let the rest of the work to Bergman and Nelson, and that they be instructed to start at once, as the children are now on vacation.\n\nI shall therefore be glad if you will forward authority as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S.

You should enquire into the needs of a further fire escape, and inform the Department as to your recommendations in the matter, stating the type of fire equipment you would recommend be installed, and the approximate cost of same. You should also state whether you consider the fire escapes mentioned by the Principal are satisfactory, or whether you would recommend that any changes be made in them. Please also state the cost of installing a suitable fire alarm system or a gong.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of any refills required for the fire extinguishers at present on hand, and you should see that they are thoroughly overhauled and placed in serviceable conditions.

On the first outward stroke a solid stream of fluid is expelled through the nozzle (3) (not shown in this view), which continues during both thrusts and in pumping, stroking until the entire contents are discharged, leaving the pump empty.\n\nThe piston rod (4) is connected to each cylinder (5) and (7) with an external (6) and (8) leading to the central valve case.\n\nRange\u2014Shoots effective stream about 30 feet.\n\n**FIRE-GUN** IS BUILT FOR SERVICE \u2014 IT PUTS OUT THE FIRE\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nFIRE EQUIPMENT CONTINUED.\n\n... easily prevent anyone from reaching in for same in time of need. A hand chemical should be installed near furnace.\n\nFIRE PRACTICE.\n\nPumping pressure for fire purposes should be checked up frequently, and several persons should be kept posted on this matter; practices with same should be held at intervals. Hose could be tested at these practices and all joints examined for leaks and records taken and turned in to the principal.\n\nFIRE STATIONS.\n\nIf fire apparatus is kept on the premises it is also worth having someone know how to handle same effectively, therefore the boys under a proper instructor should have practices and drills to become familiar with this equipment. Fire axes should be placed in convenient spots and the boys taught how to use them properly; axes are generally kept near to fire house or fire extinguishers. Several stretchers should be procured and one in each ward especially, woollen blankets should accompany same.\n\nLarge bell should be rung in special manner for fire, fire gongs should be installed in dormitories and one near close rooms, with notices for FIRE ONLY. These gongs to be used for fire drills.\n\nFIRE ARMS.\n\nFire drills should be instituted and held frequently both at night and during school hours; this will help to have the children familiarize themselves with all the escapes under a regular system.\n\nFIRE PREVENTION.\n\nThe teachers should give the children useful information on Safety first and what to do in case of fires. Always on fire prevention is the best form of instruction that get results.\n\nWATCHMAN.\n\nOne man should inspect the premises every night and report on same anything found out of place and also be in charge of fire equipment and keep records of apparatus and condition of same.\n\nRespectfully submitted by [Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nCaptain F. Edwards,\n\nThe schools themselves will find the benefit from this instruction. I am sure that to begin with that something like this is along the proper lines to hurry up the safety idea then afterwards they know and can distinguish danger from safety practices and in my past experience the children like these practices and take great interest in it especially if there is a prize in view for their efforts.\n\nFrom yesterday's inspection I wish to submit the following report and suggestions:\n\n1. Fire escape are loose and require new bolts and firmer attachments to the building. Windows on or leading to escapes should all open out in the same manner. Large windows on the South side cut off the escape platform and in hard to open and should be made to open freely. Signs and red lights should be installed for denoting location of escape. Children should use escapes frequently to familiarize themselves with same this can be done in connection with fire drills mentioned elsewhere. Frosted metal is hard on bare hands. On other portions of the body the palms being exposed makes them difficult to handle in the winter months I therefore would recommend a stout form of escape leading from the dormitory to the ground which will accommodate especially the younger children who are hard to handle when once asleep, the present escape would also clip but could be used in emergencies only if depends where the fire is coming from especially when heavy smoke is concerned.\n\n2. Heating Plant.\n\nThe old chimney requires a thorough cleaning out and should be cleaned out at least once a year. When being handled in paper or wooden boxes, a metal ash container should be procured at once. Wood and coal must be kept away from near the furnaces. Basement door should be free to open quickly if kept locked on one side the both sides should be bolted. Laves troughs should not be allowed to leak on entrance steps or fire escapes.\n\n3. Fire Equipment.\n\nEvery extinguisher should be recharged once a year the ones there show no mark of recharging on slip attached for this purpose. Firehose in basement requires a hose rack, connections all require rubber gaskets, all valves should painted red and signs put up denoting for FIRE ONLY. Firehose in basement would better if placed near a door or window leading to the outside of building, smoke will\nTo Captain F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nHonora, Ontario.\n\nRe Inspection of Indian residential school.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI certainly appreciate the opportunity you afforded me in going over this inspection with you, and you can always depend on me anytime that I can be of service to you when life and property are at stake, because by co-operating together I am sure that we can not only remedy the conditions in existence there today but I am sure that our Mayor and Council will also agree to enable us to render you all the assistance possible any time when necessary. It is of course necessary to confer with the Council in order to get things arranged so that we could render you assistance in various ways.\n\nI would also very earnestly advise you to get things going at once because this coming season is the season of fire hazards and the inadequate conditions there today need immediate attention in order therefore to reduce the chances of a fire to a minimum it need immediate attention. I might state that if you went to the proper authorities in charge of Fire Rangers that it would be possible to get two of their small fire pumps which we could use for fire at the school or nearby buildings, these pumps are simple to operate, are light to transport and we have hose that fits these connection they would I am sure render excellent service at a fire out there.\n\nI do not believe that the pump in use there today would supply sufficient pressure for more than one effective hose stream in case of fire in a building that size and if more than one line was used the pressure would be so reduced that it would hardly be of any use, therefore more energy is what is wanted and in my suggesting the Fire Rangers pumps they do good work and are idle during the winter months, we had them for one season and while we did not use them for any actual fire we tried them out in severe cold and they worked in an excellent manner. I will help to institute fire drills for the children and familiarize the boys on fire fighting equipment and how to handle the firehose and chemicals & will assist to get you fire gongs for fire signals and will furnish fire prevention data for class rooms and can also address the children the same as is done in our own schools it helps a lot & I am sure that when the Teachers and Children see that it pays to have system they will take a lot of interest in same. I would also suggest that fire prevention exercises be written on fire and safety and prizes be given to the best ones it instills ideas into the little heads that gets there in no other way and it pays to have them learn this as it comes in useful not only to themselves but...\nKenora, Ont.\n\n10-12\n\nSir:\n\nI refer to my letter 10-12 of the same date.\n\nThe Fire Chief has made a report which I have seen, etc. The Rev.

I have to thank you for the special care which you have given this question. I note that you have arranged with Fire Chief Dubois of Kenora to supervise fire drills, give lectures, arrange the refilling of the fire extinguishers, check up on the fire hose and give other assistance. Your action in having the present fire escapes repaired is approved. The Department will await your further report concerning the price of the proposed enclosed chute type of escape which is recommended by the fire chief for the special use of the smaller children.\n\nThe Department will order 2 - 5 gal. pump tanks and 3 - 1\u00bd qt. size extinguishers from the Pyrene Co. When these arrive, you should see that they are placed in proper positions. Please instruct the Principal to have the chimney cleaned and to see that the furnace room is kept free from inflammable material of all kinds. You may purchase one metal ash container. I regret that the Department cannot authorize the purchase of a special engine and hose for the purpose of throwing a stream of water.\n\nYou may arrange to have the windows leading to the fire escapes properly hung. I do not agree that signs and red lights are necessary as all who live in the building should know where the fire escapes are. You may purchase and arrange for the installation of suitable gongs at an approximate cost of $50. You may secure a hose rack for use in the basement and six fire axes, which should be placed at strategic points.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nA.

These are mostly plumbing repairs for the water closets.\n\nThe water tanks are out of order and occasion a considerable waste of water. In fact, two of them, the water is running almost continually, and would likely need new fittings since these seem to be no good last year. A plumber examined them and done his best to put them in good order, and a couple weeks ago I had a mechanic look at them again whom I hired for the purpose.\n\nThese fittings would cost approximately $15.00 each provided we could get them. (I have been told they do not seem to sell fittings without the tanks at the Hardware store) the cost would be between $25.00 and $32.00 each.\n\nSome parts of the fittings should be replaced in two other tanks, which very often, are out of order. This would cost about $6.00 for each tank.\n\nTwo closets, however, are badly damaged and should be replaced at the cost of $12.00 each.\n\nI also need one new complete water closet outfit for the convenience of some members of the Staff who have to walk down two stairs, when there should be a lavatory on that same floor or, at least, on the next one. From the Catalog I have (J.H. Ashdown, Windsor), the closest combination needed would cost $75.00.\n\nIt would take a number of days to do all of the above in good order, at eight to ten dollars per day, I presume.\n\nThe wood work in this connection would amount to about $10.00 (thirty dollars). Now although I have spent over $450.00 since last summer, for repairs that were not included in the contract given to Bargman & Nelson, I would accept to be responsible for the carpenter's wages, if the Department would furnish the lumber.\n\nI need not say that if so many repairs are necessary today, the cause of it is, in no way, imputable to carelessness on the part of any member of the Staff. We do the best we can, but cannot be everywhere at the same time, and prevent every mishap to happen. Children are children, and the particular class we have to look after are runaways and thieves.\n\nI must add that some of the repairs above mentioned, should have been made a long time ago, but I had no authorization and no money to proceed with the work, and I waited until finally, everyone was after me saying it was more than urgent to have the repairs made.\n\nCould you kindly give this matter your consideration, and also your recommendation to the Department of Indian Affairs, as soon as possible, so that we may have the work done at an early date.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\n\nKenora, Ont.\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 7th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School requesting that certain repairs be carried out to the plumbing of the water closets and stating the new fixtures required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of any new fittings required to place these closets in a satisfactory state of repair and also for the labour in having the work done. You should keep all expense down as low as possible, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job. The Department is not prepared to authorize the installation of a water closet for the use of the staff.\n\nWhen the above work has been completed, you should forward a certified account, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost of any new fittings and for the labour.\n\nIt is noted that any carpenter work required in having these repairs made will be carried out by the school authorities without expense to the Department.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 2nd, 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 4120, amounting to $16.40 in favour of The Campbell Heating Co., Kenora, Ont., for Repairs to Heating System at Kenora Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 129-15 dated 16.11.27.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nSir:\n\nWill you permit me to tell you that I have been greatly disappointed in receiving the answer of the Department to my request of 17th January the 17th, according to which I have been refused the granting of a new toilet for the Staff. Now, as we need this very badly, I will have to have some installation, and as the Department refuses to do anything in this connection, we will have to spare on some necessities and things that make life comfortable to the children in order to be able to meet this expense, which would be an important item for the Government, considering the prosperous state of affairs in the country, according to the recent report of the Minister of Finance.\n\nI am very sorry for this refusal, since the addition asked for is necessary and has to be done by all means.\n\nWould you also be kind enough to obtain for me authorization to spend about \u00a340.00 for a new flooring in the horse stable, which flooring has never been renewed and is completely worn out.\n\nWould you also obtain for me authorization to have washing machine repaired in laundry. Four pieces of wood are completely rotten and must be replaced. I could not tell you what it would cost, because it is impossible for me to know how much work will be required to replace them. Also, the washing machine being surrounded by heavy steel hoops which have to be removed; I should think it would cost approximately \u00a350.00.\n\nA new belt is needed also in the laundry, which would cost about \u00a320.00.\n\nThere are but a few of the essentials required in this school, and permit me, Sir, to draw your attention to the fact that I have spent nearly \u00a3300.00 on repairs and additions which, I believe, should have been done by the Department. The estimates for alterations and repairs were diminished by one half; the other half I had to make up for, or accept the alternative which would have left us in a miserable state. To do this, I had to borrow money and have the work done while the contract was carried on. This, you may sincerely believe, is surely more than enough for my part, and I have reason to expect the cooperation of the Department for some other requisition.\n\nShould you not, Sir, look into this, as our needs are very urgent, and this would be a source of discouragement because it is very troublesome to obtain these essentials which are not costly. I would appreciate any action you might take to have the above mentioned items authorized by the Department.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Bell-Reynolds\n\nSuperintendent\nDept. of Indian Education.\nAttention Mr. R. Ferrier.\n\nKenora, Ont.\nMarch 7th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find letters received from the principal of Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is no question as to the need of new flooring in the stable and of woodwork and a belt for the washing machine. I would therefore recommend this expenditure.\n\nIf you could let me know about what is the amount we would be able to spend on this school in the approaching financial year it would give me some idea as to what we could do for them, since beyond doubt many repairs and improvements are badly needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edward\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nE/A Enc.\nOttawa, March 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 103-12 of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School, with reference to urgent improvements. You may incur an expenditure of $40 for flooring in the horse stable; $50 repairing the washing machine; and $30 for a new belt in the laundry.\n\nI may say that the Department has asked Parliament to appropriate $9,200 for replacements, repairs and improvements at this school during the coming year. This amount has been assigned as follows:\n\n- Ice house - $1,000.-\n- Laundry addition and machinery - $5,000.-\n- Heating alterations - $3,200.-\n- General repairs, etc. - $2,000.-\n\nYou might hand the Rev. Principal the enclosed copy of this letter and, at an early date, make a joint recommendation as to not only exactly how this money should be expended this year, but how the work could best be undertaken.\n\nI should be glad to know how Bergman and Nelson are getting along with their contract, authority for which was sent to you on October 10th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nActing Asst.

I would suggest, therefore, this be remedied at once. I understand that an architect is to be sent from the Department, and I presume that he will note this recommendation.\n\nThe attendance at the School has not been very satisfactory. A number of the pupils leave during the school term and it is difficult to have them return. The launch owned by the School is not in working condition and the School is not in a position to repair it. If the Department could see fit to have the engine repaired it might be used to good effect in bringing the pupils to school in September.\n\nThe school is rather inaccessible during the winter months, and the accommodations are not of such a nature that any pupils who are ill can readily be taken to Kenora. I would therefore suggest that regular dental and medical inspection be put in force.\n\nTrusting this will receive your prompt attention, I have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.J. McDonald\nOttawa, May 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of December 6th, last, relative to fire escapes at the Kenora Indian Residential School, in which you stated that the Fire Chief at Kenora recommended the installation of another fire escape of the enclosed chute type and that he was obtaining a price on same. The Department has received no further information from you regarding this matter, and I should be pleased if you would forward full information regarding this type of fire escape, and the cost of obtaining and installing same. The Separate School Inspector, who recently visited this School, states that the dormitories have insufficient fire escapes, and recommends that this be remedied as soon as possible.\n\nIn further reference to the fire equipment at this School, it is presumed that Fire Chief Dubois of Kenora has been supervising fire drills and has tested the present pump and hose and carried out the other arrangements which you made with him as reported in your letter above referred to in connection with the fire equipment at this School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo\u2014Campbell Heating Company\u2014\nKenora\u2014Ont.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1928 | May 8   | To repairs to Hydraulic pump as per attached account, for the Kenora Indian Residential School | 28 20 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nForm 52.\nKENORA, ONT. 172, 192\n\nM.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE FIRE ESCAPES FOR INDIAN SCHOOL AT KENORA,\n\nWe beg to report the following on Fire escapes, as suggested by Fire Chief Dubois in his recent report to you.\n\nThe photographs which we are placing in your possession are known as the \"Charette Fire Escapes\" and embody all the essential features required by Fire Chief Dubois.\n\nWe found on examining the School and going into this matter more thoroughly, that two escapes were required, one from the Boys' Dormitory on the North side of the School and the other from the Girls' Dormitory on the South Side. The platforms that are there at present can be used by changing their location and altering some of the Iron Work.\n\nThe Department at Ottawa can no doubt get complete plans of this style of Fire Escape from the Patent Department, the Patent Number being 273130.\n\nThis escape, in our opinion, is exceptionally suitable for buildings, such as the Kenora Indian School, wherein the pupils range in age from 5 to 18 years. These pupils sleep in the building, and as pointed out by Fire Chief Dubois, should a fire occur in the night, it is next to impossible to awaken the younger children, and with this style of Fire Escape, they could be thrown into the chute by the older children. The chute platforms are well protected from heat.\n\nIt would be necessary to install a two-flight chute - the cost of doing this work would be approximately $3000.00.\nKenora, Ont., July 7, 1928.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of May 12, 1926, file no.

TO SALES MANAGER.\n\nWTES:GM.\nEncl.\nDecember 15th, 1928.\n\nCapt. F. Edwards,\nIndian Office,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE - Fire Escapes for Indian School, Kenora\n\nFollowing up the visit of our salesmen to your office recently, we take pleasure in quoting you as follows -\n\n1- Chute Type Fire Escape for Kenora School, running from Boys Dormitory to ground. All as shown on blue print of our sheet #23738-1, dated December 10th, 1928, copy of which we attach.\n\nPrice - Five Hundred and Thirty Six Dollars ($536.00).\n\nOn two of these Escapes we would quote -\n\nEleven Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($1,150.00).\n\nFigures named in both cases are f.o.b. Kenora, Federal Government Sales Tax included.\n\nThe last figure named for two Escapes could be taken as covering an Escape from both the Boys and Girls Dormitories. It is not possible at this time to give a definite quotation on that from the Girls Dormitory, but from the information obtained by our Salesmen this price would be close enough for estimating purposes.\n\nIt is our hope that our proposal will be found attractive, and that we shall be called upon to supply the Escapes quoted you.\n\n- over -\nKenora, Ont.\nDecember 19th./28.\n\nSir:\n\nRe. your letter 129-1-5 of the last inst. I visited the Kenora Indian Residential school yesterday to meet Rev. Father Provincial, Rev. Principal, and Brother Gauthier re. estimates for additions and improvements to the school in 1929.\n\nFrigidaire - This is installed, but the school has asked for an expenditure of an additional $70.00 for an ice making coil. This was apparently omitted when the price was quoted before. I enclose letters from the Frigidaire Corporation, which I would be glad to have you return.\n\nRe. Fire-escapes - Enclosed please find quotations and blueprint from the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works, Winnipeg, for $1150.00 for the chute fire-escapes as recommended by the Kenora Fire Chief, and approved by the school authorities.\n\nAddition over Laundry - Enclosed is rough sketch of this addition, made by Brother Gauthier. Estimated cost $3000.00.\n\nBoathouse - Sketch of new boathouse, by Bro. Gauthier is enclosed. Estimated cost $700.00.\n\nLumber Shed - Sketch by Bro. Gauthier of proposed shed is enclosed. Estimated cost $650.00.\n\nBarn - 20' X 36'. Estimated cost $650.00.\n\nClearing land and draining, about 10 acres, estimated cost $1000.\n\nThe Rev. Father Provincial says the wiring in the school is old, and not safe. I am asking the yard inspector to visit the school and give me a report. I cannot give an estimate until he has done so, but as the wires are not concealed I do not think it will be expensive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

[signature], amounting to $21.36, in favour of The Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., Winnipeg, Man., for supplies for Kama Ind. Res. AGNAL.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 129-1-5 dated 17/8/28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed three sketches of improvements contemplated for Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nThe little Addition, 20x30, over the Laundry is most necessary for the following reasons:\n\n1. To give more adequate quarters for the Sisters;\n2. To provide an Infirmary for the girls, Kenora School being the only one having no such infirmary.\n\nOther sketches have been forwarded by Mr Agent Edwards. Hoping you will give this matter a favourable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours devotedly,\n\nJ. Magnan, O.M.I.\nProvl.\n\nMr Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you have kindly accepted to reimburse the expenses incurred by Rev. Dr. Millargeon, Principal of Kenora School, has made for repairing the engine of his gasoline boat, I take the liberty to send you a full statement and vouchers.\n\nI am going to Kenora today to meet Mr. Agent Edwards and have his advice on Kenora School improvements for next year.\n\nRev. Brother Gauthier will go to Pine Creek this week with instructions to draw a sketch of alterations and improvements contemplated for that school. It will be forwarded to you as soon as possible, with information as to cost, labor, etc.\n\nI am glad Mr. Graham did not install a Delco at Pine Creek School this fall. A Delco is not sufficient at St. Philip's; it would be still less at Pine Creek. A year ago we have installed a double plant, Lister-Bronston, at our ecclesiastical College at Lebret, but as they are now served by the Provincial Plant, we could dispose of the bigger one, just the thing that would suit Father Brachet. The Engine is a 20 H.P. and the Generator develops 6K,120V. The cost was $2600.00.\n\nThe Department may prefer to buy a new one, but it is important to install a good one that will give satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Magnan, O.M.I., Provincial.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 7, 1929.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the proposed addition to the Kenora Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that a note has been made for next year's estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magan, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOttawa, January 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 103-12 of the 19th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Iroquois Indian Residential School. The providing of fire escapes and the rewiring of the building are now receiving consideration and a further communication will be directed to you. I regret that a change in the Frigidaire recently installed cannot be authorized by the Department. A note has been taken for future estimates in connection with the addition over the laundry, the boat house, the implement shed, the hogpen, and clearing and draining.\n\nI am returning, as you requested, the correspondence with the Frigidaire Corporation. I am also returning the sketches of the proposed new buildings at the School. The Department has on file blue prints in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank Bisando, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, January 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 106-12 of the 19th ultimo. I am returning the blue print showing fire escape for the Kenora Indian Residential School, with the request that you ask the Campbell Heating Company, of Kenora, to quote on this equipment. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nTop Floor.\u2014The boys dormitory should be rewired. This could be concealed by wiring from attic.\n\nMost of the other defects on this floor are in the bathrooms and toilets. Switches for bathroom lights must be installed outside the door. The rules are very emphatic on this. I would recommend that a red light be placed at fire escape inside room and another light outside.\n\nThe main switch installed on this floor is very unsafe and the wires are not soldered. It appears that there is only one circuit for the whole building.\n\nI would strongly recommend that a new main switch be installed preferably in the basement or ground floor with panel box with fuses to protect circuits on each floor.\n\nIn summing up, the wiring with few exceptions is in a very bad condition especially so for a building of this type. It would be advisable to rewire the whole building. If this is not done the items which I have mentioned should be seen to as early as possible.\n\nI would estimate that a sum of from four to five hundred dollars would cover the necessary overhauling, and a sum of around seven hundred and fifty dollars would rewire the school.\n\nTrusting this report meets with your approval,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. Duncan,\nDistrict Inspector.\nCapt. Edwards,\nIndian Agent\nKenora Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt your request I inspected Catholic Indian School and found the following defects which should be remedied as soon as possible.\n\nBasement in very unsafe condition. Should be rewired and porcelain sockets to replace brass shell sockets.\n\nGround floor\u2014The baking room and kitchen should be rewired as the insulation in some places on wires is all charred and in unsafe condition. There are switches in children's dining room, passage leading to kitchen, class room, Father's sitting room, & Sister's dining room requiring attention or renewal. Lights in Father's dining room & Sister's dining room should be rewired and put in proper shape.\n\nFirst Floor---In the guest room receptacle should be installed for stove & wiring put in shape. Receptacle should be installed in Sister's sitting room, switch & wiring to be overhauled. Sister's dept. wall bracket to be rewired & receptacle for heater. There are several switches on this floor wired with cord. This should be remedied.\nKenora, Ont.\nDecember 27th/26.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reference to my letter of the 16th inst. re. wiring the Kenora Indian Residential school, Mr. J. Duncan, District Inspector of the Hydro Electric Power Commission, has handed me his report, which is enclosed herewith.\n\nI shall be glad to receive instructions as to what should be done at the present time, owing to the danger of fire. The estimates given are only approximate and the local electricians should be required to tender on the job, provided you think it necessary for the work to be done.\n\nThe Inspector's charges are $6.00 for his report. I shall be glad to receive authority for this expense and upon receipt of same, shall send in the vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy A.

Mr. P. M. Macdonald, from St. Boniface, visited here. While there I visited him, with Mr. Steele at the school, to discuss the question for the school for 1923. The discussion was very good, and all agree in the possibility of doing something in the school. We discussed the question of the school grounds, and the possibility of purchasing some land for the school. We also discussed the question of the school building.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 21, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 17th ultimo, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education. You enclosed statements showing the cost of repairing the engine of the boat at the Kenora Indian Residential School. It was Mr. Ferrier's suggestion that you forward these accounts to Ottawa for consideration. A recent study of the balance remaining in the appropriation for Indian Education shows that the funds are completely assigned, and I regret that consideration to reimbursement cannot be given at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In it reference is made to an invoice from the Company for the amount of $1,275.00 for goods said to have been delivered in January.

Will you please advise me of the name of a competent electrician in Kamora who can be employed to make the necessary repairs and alterations to the electric wiring at this School, in order to make the system safe.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM: Dr. Scott.\n\nSome time ago it was reported to the Department that the electric wiring in the R.C. School at Kenora was in poor shape. While at this school I examined the wiring and found same to be in a dangerous condition, and I would recommend that the wiring be completely overhauled, and the necessary repairs and changes made to make the system safe.

Karanda worked 10\u00bd hours on Monday and 10 hours each day the balance of the week. On Saturday the other men did not work but Maranda put in the full day.\n\nThis figures out for him 60\u00bd hours that week. I have seen Inspector Hudson who was in charge of the work at the time, and he informs me that the amount paid Maranda is correct.\n\nTrusting this explains the matter satisfactorily,\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR/S\n\nThe Asst.

G. Orr, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to reports the cement floor recently installed in the Indian School at Kenora, Ont., is very dusty, and it has occurred to us that possibly you would be interested in our DuroLithic Mastic floor covering for this cement.\n\nDuroLithic Mastic is Trinidad Lake Asphalt Mastic properly fluxed so as to give long service without dusting, or marking up, and it is resilient and waterproof. The price is very reasonable when service is considered.\n\nThis Flooring can be had in plain finish or choice of colors, Green, Tan or Brownish Red. We shall be glad to send you samples of these colors if you are interested.\n\nWe are now, through the use of Genasco Hardener, laying floors in Hospitals, Offices, Schools, and Industrial Buildings with entire satisfaction. Although we know that you have used Mastic Flooring, we do not know off-hand that you have used it since we have been making floors with this Genasco Hardener.\n\nTrusting that this may receive your favorable consideration, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVULCAN ASPHALT & SUPPLY CO.

I note you refer to a definite understanding concerning the Department's reimbursement; but I am unable to find that any authority has been directed to you. At the present time, our funds are extremely limited, as very urgent improvements have had to be undertaken at your school.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date, and I note that the implement shed has been blown down. Arrangements have been made to finance its replacement, and I have to authorize you to expend not more than $500 for this purpose. If a saving can be effected, the Department will be glad. It is understood that the work will be done by day labour, under the supervision of Brother Gauthier. You should requisition to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards for the materials required and he will make the purchase.\n\nI should be glad if you would let the Department have a report, showing the detail of the alterations and improvements that you have been authorized to effect under the supervision of Brother Gauthier. An estimate of the cost should be forwarded at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. B.

Among the requests there appears the following:-\n\nA Hog pen for the Kenora Indian Residential School, at an estimated cost of . . . . . . $650.\n\nInside painting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500.\nOttawa, September 7, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Father Plourde, O.M.I., has visited the Department, on behalf of the Provincial of the Oblate Order for your Ecclesiastical Province, and, among other requests, he asks that the Department supply a galvanized granary for the use of the Kenora Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that I am today authorizing Mr. Indian Agent Edwards to expend the amount of $150 in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Baillargeon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, September 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe church authorities have requested the Department to provide a galvanized iron granary for the use of the Kenora Indian Residential School. Please discuss this with the Rev. Principal, ascertain his exact requirements and make the necessary arrangements. $150 may be expended in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSaint-Boniface, Man. September 6th, 1929\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly allow me to write over again about the repairs of the Gas Engine at Kenora School. It is not my intention to trouble you much longer about this matter.\n\nWhile in Ottawa, about two years ago, I asked you if the Department would buy a new Gas engine for the Kenora School Boat, as the one sent by the Department was completely out of order. The cost of a new engine was over a thousand dollars. You told me then that you would pay only half, or a little over five hundred dollars. The School was not in a position to spend any money and this matter was left in abeyance.\n\nDuring summer 1928, the Reverend Principal decided to repair the old engine, and in doing so he was sure to save money. In fact, the total cost of the repairs was only $464.00. It is true that Brother Luthier worked at it for many days, but no salary was charged.\n\nI said the old engine purposely, for it was welded in many places. I have seen that myself.\n\nIn the fall, 1928, I went to Ottawa with R. Fr Guy and I submitted to you again this matter. You seemed to be pleased and you told me you were ready to pay the bill in full. Unfortunately I had not all the vouchers and the payment was delayed. These were forwarded to the Department December 17th. I am glad to say that January 1st, I received a letter from Mr. McLean\u2014No. 13\u20141\u20145\u2014stating that \"funds were completely assigned, and that consideration to reimbursement could not be given at that time.\" I was greatly surprised to receive from Reverend Fr Baillargeon a copy of Mr. MacKenzie's letter\u2014No. 13\u20141\u20145, August 1st, stating \"he was unable to find that any authority has been to him.\" No wonder! He has no written promise, but the oral promise of a high official of the Department is surely just as good.\n\nLast May you paid me a kind visit and you gave me then the same assurance. As I am the loser you will understand easily why I make myself particularly uneasy about this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nProvincial\nOttawa, September 10th, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the repairs to the engine of the launch at the Kenora Indian Residential School. In view of your representations, the Department has decided to make reimbursement and I have to request you to instruct the Reverend Principal to forward receipts showing the expenditure of $467.64. If possible, these receipts should be in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magan, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOttawa, September 16th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the improvements to the culvert at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I note that, as they required a large Johnson Outboard Motor, you have arranged shipment from the Kenora Indian Residential School with the approval of the Church authorities.\n\nAs a small outboard motor is now required for the Kenora School, you may make the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The carpenter is a good painter and they could employ him for the work, providing we supplied the paint. The amount required for this would be about $375.00 for paint and wages.

He makes application for the following:\n\n- 2 dozen beds 6' x 2\u00bd'\n- 2 \" mattresses 6' x 2\u00bd', or material to make them.\n- 1 dozen mattressed 6' x 3' to replace old ones on larger beds.\n- 2 dozen pillows\n- 16 window shades 5\u00bd\" x 2\u00bd\"\n- 10 6\" x 34\"\n\nThese shades are for the new part and for the boy's dormitory.\n\nThey also require 1 dozen new chairs for the rooms. These should not cost more than about $3.00 each. I shall be glad to receive authority for the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nThe Campbell Heating Co.\n\nThrough all our negotiations in reference to the fire escapes it was always pointed out that the present type were useless, and if the writer remembers correctly, Mr. Orr and Brother Gautier were both in accord with this view.\n\nThe Chute type fire escape was advocated by the Kenora Fire Chief and Father Ballargeon and they still seem to favor this type of fire escape. However the one set of fire escape is completed and the pole removed.\n\nWe might also point out that our equipment is on the job, and owing to the delay caused by waiting for information it will be necessary to remove this equipment and replace it again when a decision is made. Therefore we would ask you for a decision at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CAMPBELL HEATING COMPANY.\n\nPer. [signature]\n\nDMC/C.\nKENORA, ONT.\nBRANCH Oct. 8, 1929.\n\nCapt. P. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir!\n\nRe Indian School Fire Escapes.\n\nDuring a conversation with Father Ballargeon this morning he was under the impression that one of the present Fire Escapes be left on the job, that is, the platforms on the North West corner of the Building should be left as they are with the poles left in position for sliding down in an emergency.\n\nYou no doubt remember the suggestions of Mr. Orr and Brother Gautier at the time that we were instructed to figure on a steel stair fire escape in place of the chute type of which we had the contract.\n\nAt that time it was decided that the landings of the present fire escape be moved around to the new addition on the North and that stairs be put in between these landings.\n\nTo refresh your memory we would point out that it was necessary to change the location of the platforms on the South West corner of the school so that the stair could be put in and turned around the corner, landing on the South side of the building - This of course necessitated the removal of the poles.\n\nWhen we estimated on the cost of erecting steel stairs naturally our price was with a view of using the present platforms on the new fire escapes - It is therefore necessary to ask an additional price of Three Hundred and Sixteen ($316.) Dollars if new platforms are used.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Campbell Heating Company re fire escapes at the Kenora Indian Residential School. The Principal now requests that one of the old fire escapes be left so as to make additional protection for the children. The Campbell Heating Company's letter explains the whole matter and if you think it advisable to leave the present fire escape and use additional material for the stair fire escape, namely $316.00, I shall be glad to have the necessary authority.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edward\n\nIndian Agent\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHS\n\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nCapt.

Mr. Orr requested me to get a price from the Campbell Heating Company for installing an extra toilet. Mr. Campbell informs me this would cost in the neighborhood of $88.00.\n\nIn connection with the replacing of closet that was broken by the boys, Mr. Campbell informs me this would cost $42.00 for the outfit and $10.00 for labor.

The bldg rests on 6 piers built with sawed ties 6\"x9\"x 8'0\" long, secured with 1\"x 12 spikes. Outside ones, at the front, are in II feet of water.\n\nBetween the piers, to support the frame, timbers 6\"x8\"x26' reach the middle of each pier, and the frame is trussed so as to carry the weight to the center of the piers. The end nearest the shore rests on a timber 6\"x8\"x20' and is trussed the same way. There are two windows on each side, one door 3'x 7' in the middle at shore end, one 2'6\"x 6'6\" at the far end of the south side and the large door on the lake 10'x 12', and is hung on track and slides to a right angle against the side.\n\nFive feet from each side two timbers 8\"x8\" serve to carry the walks and principally the trussed arches to raise the boat. Red pine siding is used on outside of frame, and B.C. cedar shingles on roof.\n\nAddition.\n\nThe addition to the school, over the laundry, has been carefully built to make it cold proof as much as possible. The frame is of 2\"x6\" studs, 16\" center with one outside and inside sheeting of 1\"x6\" tongued and grooved red pine well seasoned, and two plies of paper each side, in and out. The paper used is one ply of first quality tarred, and one ply of Barrett roofing lapped 4 in., and strapped over. The paper was placed horizontally on both sides. Outside it was strapped only horizontally, but inside it is strapped vertically, 16\" center with 1x2 and horizontally between vertical straps on every lap.\n\nThe outside is finished with brick veneer to match the rest of the building as well as the roof and cornices. Here at the cornice special care was taken to bring the two ply of paper without any break around the cornice and over the roof under shingles. Cornices are also painted to match. Metal 26 galvanized has been used on flat part of roof and wet troughs of proper size have been installed.\n\nThe inside is finished with three coats hard wall plaster or metallic lath, and good work to match adjoining rooms. Joists 2\"x12\"x20' are fitted with 3 rows of bridging here used to carry the weight without settle in laundry; the upper joists are 2\"x12\". Floors are double thru knot, using 1x8 red pine very dry, for finish.\n\nThe ceiling in dormitory is metallic to match the adjoining, and the other below is plastered.\n\nHeating, plumbing and electric wiring in conduit have been carried on with the construction, and in accordance with the laws of the Province. Other changes in old buildings have been made as per plan.\n\nThe first space at the south end is already finished, and the other at the north side is under construction.\n\nImplement Shed.\n\nAn implement shed 10'0\"x 34'0\", on cement foundation, has also been built, but the doors are not made yet.\n\nNovember 30th 1929\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find return of labour sheets in duplicate received from the Principal of the Henora Indian Residential School for work done on the new buildings and additions.\n\nAlso enclosed please find the Principal's report as to the progress of the work, which was authorized by Mr. Orr.\n\nYou will note there is a balance due the Principal for labour paid of $643.37 and he requires an additional advance as the work is not yet completed. I asked him much more he would require, but he said he could not give me any estimate. I informed him you would require this information, but promised to send his request on, and await a reply from you.\n\nThe work done has been well done, and I do not think the cost is excessive, but it appears to me when we get all the accounts in, it will amount to more than the Department originally intended spending, although I have not the exact figures of what was agreed to be spent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Globe Bedding Co., Limited\nWinnipeg, Kan.\n\n| DATE       | DESCRIPTION                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov.16-29  | To account rendered per vouchers attached        | $414.00|\n|            | Beds and Matts. for Kenora Indian School         |        |\n|            | Pillows                                          | 22.20  |\n|            |                                                  | 436.20 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nForm 59.\nGLOBE BEDDING COMPANY LIMITED\nMATTRESSES, COMFORTERS, CUSHIONS, PILLOWS\nBEDS AND SPRINGS\n\nCOMFORTER DEPT.\nWINNIPEG, CANADA\nNov. 2nd, 1929.\n\nSOLD TO\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nPurchasing Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nSALES TAX LICENSE:\nNO. 900\n\nTERMS\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n13 pr.\nDowny Pillows.\n\n19x26 1.85 22.20\n\nTOTAL\n\n22.20\n\nShipped to: Capt.

Kenora, and could make delivery for motor in about three days. It would take us approximately ten days to get delivery of the automatic starter.\n\nThe above motor, I can fully guarantee, as I installed the same outfit complete in the Stone Boat orke approximately two years ago and it has given every satisfaction.\n\nHoping to receive your valued order, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n...........H.Cheyne...........\n\nCopy\n\nOrdered 2/15/29 as\nto be marked old stock\nas per Mr. H. Cheyne.\nKenora, Ont.,\nDecember 2nd, 1929.\n\nSt. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 129-1-5 of the 25th ult., enclosed please find copy of quotation by H. Cheyne, Electrical Contractor, Kenora, for 10 H.P. motor, 220 volts, 3 phase, for Kenora Indian Residential School (RC).\n\nThe Principal has been in to see me this morning and informs me he must have this motor at once as his old one has played out. I have, therefore, instructed Mr. Cheyne to supply the motor and the starter at a price of $165.25 as it must be supplied immediately. This is the cheapest that could be purchased locally and I trust what I have done meets with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nCapt. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Septic Tank at Catholic Indian School Kenora.\n\nThe above Septic Tank is in poor condition. It has for a load the wastes from all the toilets, baths &c., as well as the discharge from all laundry and kitchen fixtures. It is at all times overloaded with grease, which appears to be carried to the disposal bed with the very large amount of flush water. This tank is kept working at this time by using large amounts of solvent chemical. The staff at the school have for the last few years to clean out the different compartments every few months.\n\nThe siphon equipment is not in working order, and there is no way provided for emptying this part of the system to make inspection or make repairs.\n\nThe filter beds and distributing nozzles need attention, and the outlet from field tile and underdrainage is at present emptying on open ground about ten feet from the shore line where it runs in a rotten stream above grade into the lake. The point where this sewerage enters the lake is not more than ten feet from where the drinking water line is taken to the pumps, although this water intake is said to extend some distance out in the lake. I would say that provision should be made to have it carefully examined as soon as the weather per-\nKenora, Ontario,\nDec. 3rd., 1929.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from C. Ratchford, in connection with the septic tank at the Kenora Indian Residential School, (R.C.). This School has had considerable trouble with this tank and we have had Mr. Ratchford put it right temporarily. On the last occasion I asked him to make a report on this trouble, hence the letter. It would be an expensive matter to do anything this winter, but perhaps the Department might put in an amount in the estimates next summer. I understand the septic tank was built under instructions of the Department about ten years ago before I was appointed Agent. Dr. Ferguson informs me that the water is tested occasionally and there does not seem to be anything wrong with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc:l.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Chas.

When these recharges are received, it is expected that the principals will see that they are installed and each extinguisher placed in good condition and ready for immediate use in case of fire.

Indian Residential School\nKenora, Ont.\nFebruary 18, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 27th last, I beg to say that I do not understand the statement it contained. It is true that I have received from the Department:\n\n- \u00a31000.00 in July 1929.\n- \u00a3600.00 \"Sept.\"\n- \u00a31000.00 \"Dec.\"\n\nBut what about all the wages I have paid, which are not mentioned? For instance, what about the \u00a3779.96 I have spent for clearing land? Your letter shows only the \u00a3600.00 I have received in this connection.\n\nI was authorized \u00a3500.00 to have an Implement Shed put up; I have paid for wages and material concerning same \u00a3205.30 and have not as yet received a cheque accounting for this.\n\nThis confusion arises from the fact that what I apprehended has occurred! I had taken all possible care to keep the different items separated, and they have been mixed up.\n\nI might say that the \u00a31643.37 had nothing whatever to do with the clearing of land nor with the building of the shed; that sum was solely for wages paid by me for the building of the new addition and the boat-house. A cheque of \u00a31000.00 had been received from the Department at the time the said account was sent, which left a balance of \u00a3643.37 to be paid yet. Later on, another cheque of \u00a31000.00 was received which then left on hand \u00a3356.63. But we had to keep working at the addition to the school-house during past December and January, as per request of Labor force enclosed.\n\nSo, instead of having on hand the sum of \u00a3751.33, I have only \u00a356.33. Now, as there is a sum amounting to \u00a3205.30 due me by the Department re Implement Shed, and \u00a311.95 material for new addition, the sum of \u00a3131.92 is the balance owed me at the present time.\n\nPlease give this statement to the Department, and let them know that I am in need of the money owed me.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.E. Baillargeon, O.M.\nCaptain Frank D'Arde\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter #129-1-C of the 20th January last, I enclose you herewith for $11.95 in favor of the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School (R.C.) for materials for the new addition to the school, authorized by Mr. Orr. Also time sheets for $271.30 for wages and a letter received from the Principal accounting for the monies spent in answer to my letter to him of the 20th January. You will no doubt be able to reconcile the Principal's letter and accounts with your files. He appears to be a poor business man and has his accounts all mixed up.

One 2\u00bd\" single belt. The Pump to replace the existing Keyers-Bulldozer Pump - The existing suction line is 2\u00bd\" and as pointed out formerly, is much too small;\n\nThe cost of replacing the existing Pump as set out in proposal Five is Three Hundred and Forty-Seven ($347.00) Dollars.\n\nFather Ballargeon also requires a new Toilet Tank in the Girls' Playroom Lavatory and some further plumbing repairs, one of them being a leak in one of the soil stacks which is badly staining the wall.\n\nIt is impossible to give you a figure on this class of work but the approximate price, including labor would be Thirty ($30.00) Dollars.\n\nWe trust that the information contained in this letter will be sufficient for the Department to act quickly as the state of affairs existing at the Indian School at the present time is not only dangerous but exceedingly inconvenient to the Residents and we are being urged for speedy action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CAMPBELL PLATING COMPANY,\n\nPer. [Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nThe Campbell Heating Co.\n\nThe electric work to be done in the approved manner with entrance switch, pressure switch and starting switch.\n\nThis proposal is the proper and thorough way to install this job -\n\nThe cost of carrying out the work according to this proposal would be Two Thousand and Seventy-three ($2073.00) Dollars.\n\nSPECIAL PROPOSAL -\n\nOne 1500 Gallon per hour Fairbanks-Morse Pump with 2 Horse Power Motor, the pump to be chain driven - Install 1000 feet of 3\" suction line with proper foot valves and relief valves as set forth in proposal one - Friction loss 3.8 feet per thousand in 3\" suction line;\n\nThe cost of doing this work would be One Thousand Five Hundred and Sixty-six ($1866.00) Dollars.\n\nGENERAL PROPOSAL -\n\nOne 2500 Gallon per Hour Fairbanks-Morse Pump, belt driven from the present shaft and motor with tight pulley only and one 17\" x 4\" clutch pulley on the line shaft - Supply one 4\" Leather Belt - Install 1000 feet of 4\" suction line, as laid down in first proposal;\n\nThe cost of doing this work in this manner would be One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-six ($1776.00) Dollars.\n\nSPECIAL PROPOSAL -\n\nOne 1500 Gallon per hour Fairbanks-Morse Pump, belt driven from the present shaft and motor with tight pulley only and one 10 x 4 friction clutch pulley on the line shaft - Supply 1 - 3\" leather belt - Install 1000 feet 3\" suction line with foot valves etc., as in first proposal;\n\nThe cost of doing this work would be One Thousand Three Hundred and Twenty-six ($1326.00) Dollars.\n\nWith the four preceding proposals the present pump and suction line could be put into shape at an additional cost and could be used as an auxiliary outfit.\n\nMay we point out to you that an auxiliary pumping outfit is very necessary in a Building of this kind. Not only could it be used as an auxiliary outfit, but in case of fire both pumps could be put into service.\nKENORA, ONT\nBRANCH April 30, 1930.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nc/o Capt. F. Edwards,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs requested by yourself and Father Ballargeon we have inspected the present Water System and Pump Outfit in connection with this School and wish to report as follows:\n\nThe Lake level is about 22 feet below the Pump and this requires a Pump in first class condition to handle water with a lift of this distance. The present pump could be put into condition if it were possible to remove it for a period of from six to ten days, but this is impossible because it would leave the School without a water system of any kind or fire protection; in fact this has been one of their difficulties, that every time a repair was made to the pump, they were left without fire protection of any kind, as well as the inconvenience of being without water.\n\nWe find that the suction line into the Lake is only 2\u00bd\". The suction line is approximately 1000 feet into the lake and the pump itself is not capable of taking care of a great deal more than the resistance created by the friction in a line of this size. The suction line should be 4\".\n\nWe have five proposals which we wish to set forth,\n\n1. Install a 2500 Gallon per hour Fairbanks-Morse Pump connected on the same base with a Three Horse Power Motor, the pump to be chain driven. Install 1000 feet of 4\" suction line into the Lake; friction loss at this suction line would be 2.20 feet per hundred. On this suction line it would be necessary to place a 4\" foot valve and also on the pump installation a relief valve along with the check valves and globe valves required.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the Indian Residential School at Renora has been having a lot of trouble with the water system. As a result, the school has been without water. I requested the Campbell Hartin Co. to examine the water system.\n\nAs we are including in this report herewith, it seems that the water system is pretty well worn out and very old. To the best of my knowledge there is no way to supply for their needs, so there is no way to get anything done should be done.\n\nI shall be glad to receive instructions as to what should be done in this matter and also instructions as to the new toilet tank in the girl's playroom lavatory and the further plans required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMay authorize Campbell Heating Co., proceed with first proposal water supply Kenora School.\n\nDUNGAN O SCOTT.\nOttawa, May 14, 1930.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to conversation with Mr. Perrier when you were in Ottawa a few days ago.

MacKenzie,\nActing, Assistant Deputy Secretary.\n\nCAPT. FRANK EDWARDS,\nKENORA, Ont.\nI have long delayed to answer your letter of May the 14th because, at first, I did not know what recommendation to make to the Department.\n\nWe were sorely disappointed, the Reverend Father Principal of Kenora School and myself, to hear that the greater part, if not all, of the allowance of \u00a34,000.00 already incurred for the many improvements and repairs contemplated for years past, would be expended on repairs to the water supply and sewage disposal systems. Naturally, these unexpected repairs must be done without delay, but we hoped that an additional grant could be granted for this purpose.\n\nWe will drop, if necessary, the hoeing, land clearing and repairing to the barn, though it is fast decaying and the level of the lake being low, it could be raised in order to have it repaired this summer, but we insist on having the land fenced, the warehouse enlarged and lined with galvanized iron sheets and the walls of the school strengthened for the following reasons: As there is no fence at all, the cattle wander far away from the stable in the bush and a great deal of time is lost every day in looking for them; the warehouse is very much too small and groceries, flour etc must be protected against rats; the school having been enlarged and the wiring changed, the walls are, in many places, in a very poor condition and need to be patched. We figure that the total cost will be about \u00a32,500.00.\n\nWe believe that the Kenora School, being located in a city and many visitors asking to see the building, should be kept in a good condition, in the same condition as the other Kenora School.\n\nWe hope the Department will consider favourably our requests.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Will you please secure an estimate of the cost of this work and let me have your recommendation at an early date. It should be kept in mind that the appropriation for this school is limited and no unnecessary expense can be incurred this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nKenora, Ont.\nJune 12th., 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHere we are nearing the middle of June, and nothing has been heard of our requisitions of May 6th. and May 22nd., in which, amongst other articles, screens for the windows and doors of the new addition were asked for. These are urgent for; the most troublesome little insect, the mosquito, is unceasingly molesting the Revd. Sisters and the children.\n\nWe presume that Captain Edwards sent our requisitions to the Department. It may be due to his absence from town that we have not, as yet, received a reply. Since his absence will continue for a couple weeks more, we can not wait until his return for a permit to have these screens made. Besides it will take time before they will be ready to be put in, and the screens are an absolute necessity just now.\n\nOn May 6th., I also reported to Captain Edwards that we were lacking of four cows, telling him that we had not a sufficient supply of milk for our children, and that it was urgent to have more cows. The situation is still the same after over a month, and I have not heard anything concerning the matter.\n\nNow, just as I was writing this letter, an accident has occurred in the boys' toilet, where one of the boys has accidentally dropped a piece of wood over the bowl smashing it to pieces. The bowl will have to be replaced at the cost of approximately $30.00. I hope you will kindly see that authorization be given for this.\n\nPlease take our urgent needs into consideration and have the necessary expenditure authorized as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. Russell T.

Very little painting was done last autumn because my painter left me after a few days of work. I presume that it is right for me to have the work done now.

Ratchford.\nKenora, Ontario, Nov. 28, 1929.\n\nCapt. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Septic Tanks at Catholic Indian School Kenora.\n\nThe above septic tank is in poor condition. It has for a load the wastes from all the toilets, baths, etc., as well as the discharge from all laundry and kitchen fixtures. It is at all times overloaded with grease, which appears to be carried to the disposal bed with the very large amount of flush water. This tank is kept working at this time by using large amounts of desolvent chemical. The staff at the school have for the last few years to clean out the different compartments every few months.\n\nThe syphon equipment is not in working order, and there is no way provided for emptying this part of the system to make inspection or make repairs.\n\nThe filter beds and distributing nozzles need attention and the outlet from field tile and underdrainage is at present emptying on open ground about ten feet from the shore line where it runs in a rotten stream above grade into the lake. The point where this sewerage enters the lake is not more than ten feet from where the drinking water line is taken to the pumps, although this water intake is said to extend some distance out in the lake. I would say that provision should be made to have it carefully examined as soon as the weather permits as this pipe has been in use for a long time and is likely rotted out.\nAccordingly, I would recommend that a pipe line be laid to outlet the waste from the laundry and kitchen into the lake, but that a grease trap be constructed to remove greases and fats. Having these removed it might be possible to convince the Health Authorities that little or no bacteria is being passed into the lake and we remove the unsightly skim of grease and fat which frequently\u6d6e on the surface of the water in the vicinity of the pipe outlet. No other solution of the problem of disposing of this laundry and kitchen waste presents itself owing to the rocky formation and lack of suitable soil to make a large laundry sump. I would recommend that the present septic tank and filter chamber be removed to make way for a new septic tank and siphon chamber similar in size and design to those erected at the Caribou Jeffrey Indian School, Kenora. The siphon chamber would overlap the sub-irrigation disposal bed. The space available for this bed is very limited and the nature of the ground is such that excavation will be necessary to provide for the laying of a gravel bed about fifteen inches deep, but depending upon the nature of the soil. The four inch tile would be laid upon this gravel bed and the whole covered with an 18 inch layer of sand and clay mixture.\n\nIt is difficult to make an estimate of the probable cost of this work owing to the uncertainty of the size of the disposal bed obtainable. The preparation of this bed would be costly. However, in my opinion the probable cost of the work recommended would be as follows:\n\n1 - Laying of new pipe line for disposal of laundry and kitchen waste with grease trap.......................... $ 400.00\n\n2 - Removal of present septic tank, filter chamber & disposal bed........... 200.00\n\n3 - Construction of new septic tank complete.................................. 1,000.00\n\n4 - Laying of sub-irrigation disposal bed... 1,600.00\n\nTotal estimated cost............... $ 5,200.00\n\nAs previously mentioned this school was apparently located without regard to the present requirements of a sewerage disposal system that will permit of no contamination of the water supply from the Lake of the Woods, so the conditions are unfavorable and to overcome these conditions and install an satisfactory disposal system will be expensive. The work should be done in July or at such time as the school is closed for the summer.\n\nEngineer in Charge,\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJune 14th, 1930.\nIn operation, not only the sewerage but all waste from the laundry and kitchen is passed into the septic tank. Without any screen in front of the outlet to the tank, old clothes, boots, etc., pass into the tank, block the overflow pipe and syphon and have at times caused overflowing of the tank through the syphon chamber manhole. The passing of the laundry and kitchen waste through the septic tank and filter chamber results in the soaps and greases rapidly plugging the filter beds, rendering that part of the system useless so that the filter chamber has merely become a cesspool. If there is any disposal bed it is probably useless owing to the nature of the soil in which the tiles were laid. The septic tank is not sufficiently large to take care of the waste from the toilets and baths alone, not to mention the additional burden of the laundry and kitchen wastes and in any case the laundry and kitchen wastes should not be passed through the septic tank and disposal beds.\n\nThe chief complaint the Principal of the school had to make of the present installation was that they had to clean out the tank two or three times a year, that it occasionally overflowed and that there was a disagreeable odor from the outlet. However the situation is probably more serious than that. The new water intake main about to be installed extends out about 1,000 feet to what is supposed to be a channel of slow moving current towards one of the lake outlets. The intake of the Kenora Water Supply is downstream some distance from this point and the Ontario Department of Health are now taking measures to compel summer campers on the lake to cease polluting the waters by passing untreated sewerage etc. into the lake. Dr. Ferguson, Medical Health Officer for Kenora, and also for the Department of Indian Affairs, when interviewed by the writer stated he could not agree with my suggestion that we pass the laundry and kitchen wastes from the Indian school directly untreated into the lake and doubtless he would strongly object to the passing of dangerous bacteria into the lake as is now being done through the present system.\n\nIt was my intention to recommend the placing of a new pipe line from the school direct to the lake to carry the laundry and kitchen wastes and to clean out and put into condition the existing septic tank and filter chamber and eliminate the disposal bed for the disposal of the sewage from the toilets and baths. With the existing system this would probably not eliminate the passing of some col\u00e9n bacilli germs into the lake, but the contamination would be slight and would not affect the water supply for the school and the town of Kenora's water supply is chlorinated anyway. In view of the probable attitude of the Health Authorities I do not believe this recommendation could be carried out.\nREPORT ON SEWERAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM\n\nROMAN CATHOLIC INDIAN SCHOOL,\nKENORA.\n\nOn May 30th the undersigned visited the Kenora Roman Catholic Indian School and insofar as conditions permitted made an examination of the sewage disposal system. The plans of the school were not there when the system was installed but he kindly loaned me a set of plans of the sewage disposal system but could not say whether the system was actually installed in accordance with the plans. I also saw Captain Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, and secured from him a copy of a report made November, 1929, by Mr. Chas. Matchford, a plumber at Kenora, on the condition of the sewage disposal system. A copy of this report is attached.\n\nEvidently this school was located without thought of the installation of a system for rendering the sewerage harmless. The school is located in close proximity to the Lake of the Woods in such a way that the natural drainage into the lake. Solid rock is exposed in many places and the soil covering is generally shallow. The present location of the septic tank, filter and disposal bed is the only place where conditions permit unless expensive rock excavation was resorted to. The available area for the sewage disposal system is too limited for satisfactory results.\n\nAccording to the plans the septic tank is constructed of concrete, with inside dimensions of five feet by ten feet and eight feet deep, divided into two chambers, each accessible by a manhole. The siphon discharges through piping to a filter about 20 feet distant. This filter chamber is nine feet by fifteen feet and six inches inside dimensions, built of concrete and provided with a manhole. This filter outlets to a disposal bed 20 feet by 50 feet extending to the lake. The septic tank and filter were filled with sewerage and no examination was possible. There was some flowage into the lake from the disposal bed area, this flowage having a very obnoxious odor and doubtless containing dangerous material. I am unable to learn whether there actually is or is not any disposal bed installed, but I doubt whether there is such a bed.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIn further reference to your letter of May 15th regarding the condition of the sewage disposal system at the Kenora Roman Catholic Indian school, I enclose herewith a report received from Mr. D.B. Gow, our Acting District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, dated the 14th instant. This report is based upon information obtained during a visit to the school on May 30th and Mr. Gow states that before deciding upon a definite scheme for improving conditions at the school it will be advisable to have borings to ascertain depths to rock and space available for disposal beds, etcetera; also a definite understanding is required with the Ontario Board of Health so that the proposed works will meet their requirements with respect to Lake of the Woods water supply.\n\nThe estimates of cost given in this report are accordingly provisional and subject to revision if borings are taken and conditions not confirmed as assumed in making the report.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs desire to have this work undertaken during this summer along the lines recommended in the report, we will arrange for one of our engineers to make a thorough study of soil conditions, and also take up the matter with the representative of the Ontario Board of Health at Kenora to learn what is necessary to satisfy their requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 24, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th and to thank you for the report on the condition of the sewage system at the Kenora R. C. School. There are no funds available at the present time to carry out the recommendations made by the District Chief Engineer, but an item of $5,500 is being placed in next year's estimates. I will be glad, however, if you will ask your District Engineer to report what he thinks absolutely necessary to be done at the present time in order that the system will function until next year, also an estimate of the cost. When this information is received I will again communicate with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nJ. T.

Father Baillargeon,\nPrincipal R. C. Indian School,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to quote you our several estimates for the following work to be done at the School as per your specifications:\n\n(1). $16.50 for material only for 8 screen windows, one screen door and screen door hardware.\n\n(2). $210.00 for material required and labor in lining warehouse with iron and screen wire, putting in one new door, building steps and fixing platform.\n\n(3). $362.60 for material and labor for extending and iron lining.\n\n(4). $18.00 for material for building two partitions for toilet.\n\nMaterial and labor for inside decorating and outside painting required will cost about $1,000.00.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\nLindstrom & Nilson.\n\nAN.AM\nDear Sir,\n\nThe office has received instructions from Mr. Wilson for work to be done at the Kenora R.C.

Paragraph (4) Dept. letter 126-1-5 June 13th. informs that there are no funds for this.\n\nParagraph (5) according to Dept. letter 126-1-5 June 13th. principal stated material was supplied.\n\nWe shall be obliged for your confirmation of these matters.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 11, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to repairs at the Kenora Indian Residential School. You have already been authorized to arrange for 8 screen windows and a screen door. I note that the partitions for the toilet will cost only $18. You may therefore arrange for them.\n\nIt appears that over $560 is required to enlarge the warehouse and to put it in good condition. This estimate appears rather high, and I have to request that you will put the present building in good condition, lining it with iron and screen wire, etc., at an estimated cost of $210. If a saving can be effected, please do so. The extension to the warehouse will have to stand for the time being.\n\nI regret that the amount of $1,000, which is suggested for material and labour for decorating and painting cannot all be allowed this year. Have the Rev. Principal submit the cost of what is really urgent at the present time and let the Department have a further recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND HYDROMETRIC BUREAU\n\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nJuly 7, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nRe R.C. Indian School, Kenora.\n\nI have received your letter of June 26th with reference to the above mentioned subject. I note that the Department of Indian Affairs state there are no funds available now to carry out the work as recommended in my report dated June 14th, but that $3,500.00 is being placed in the estimates for next year and that in the meantime a report is asked for as to what is considered absolutely necessary to be done now in order that the system will function until next year.\n\nAs pointed out in my report of June 14th, the Principal of the School complained principally that it was necessary to frequently clean out the septic tank and that there was a very disagreeable odor from the outlet. However, the main faults of the present system were fully covered in that report. The system is not properly designed, is inadequate, and a sludge on the surface of the lake in the woods is resulting. No temporary measure will relieve these conditions and it is therefore recommended that no work be done this year. Conditions for the coming year will be no more serious than for the past two or three years and the system will function unsatisfactorily of course.\n\nWhen in Kenora recently, I explained to the School Authorities and to Captain Edwards, Indian Agent, the Department's position as regards lack of funds, their decision to make provision for doing the work next year, and explained that under these conditions I considered it inadvisable to make any alterations in the existing system this year, and was so reporting. They expressed approval of this attitude.\n\nAt some convenient time this summer I plan to have one of our engineers carry out a detailed survey of the school grounds, so that a more accurate estimate of what is required may be made. The site is rocky and it is planned to draw up plans and estimates of costs covering the work outlined in my previous report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) D. B.

From this you will notice that he recommends that no work be done this year as it is proposed to reconstruct the system next year, and no temporary measures are available which will materially relieve the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 18, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th and note Mr. Gow's recommendation with reference to the sewage disposal system at the Emma Roman Catholic School. I also note that Mr. Gow is going to prepare a detailed estimate of the cost of the work, and if this could be forwarded to the Department sometime in the early fall the exact amount could be provided in next year's estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nActing Assistant Deputy Secretary.\n\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nKenora Ontario,\nJuly 16th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter dated July 12th, 1930, regarding the amount of money required to purchase a new Indian residential school.\n\nThe Principal is now on his vacation, but informs us it is absolutely necessary to receive at least $500.00 for the work.\n\nThere is no doubt there is an urgent need for a certain amount of lighting at the school, and if the amount of $500.00 is available, we shall be grateful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 23, 1920.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the painting that is absolutely necessary at the Kenora Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $600 in the purchase of paint and other material required and for the labour. Either yourself or the school authorities should arrange for the purchase of the paint and also for the labour that may be required. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified by you, should be forwarded, covering the cost of the materials and for the labour. It is considered that the school authorities could provide part of the labour in having the painting performed.

School would not supply water to the school owing to the extremely low level of the lake. I asked what he would suggest and he informed me he had a representative from the Fairbanks-Morse Company, who supplied the motor, and had also had Bro. Eugene Gauthier down, and it was not the fault of the pump, but was on account of the high lift. He suggested a new pump house be built near the lake, and the pump placed there so that the water could be pushed up instead of drawn up. In that case the pump would have ample capacity.\n\nI do not like authorizing any further expenditure and got in touch with Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power Branch Winnipeg. He came down on Saturday morning and went to the school with Mr. Campbell and myself. He returned to Winnipeg and will make a report, and I trust you will receive this shortly, as the weather is commencing to get cold and something must be done before the ice forms. The old pump is at present operating, but is liable to stop at any time.\n\nIt was also suggested that some material, either straw or gravel would do, be placed over the intake to prevent it freezing. As soon as you receive this report I shall be glad if you will send me instructions as it is important that this be done without delay otherwise the school will probably be without water during the winter, in which case it would have to be closed down.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent\n\nWater losses this year than for many years will be lower still during winter months.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept.15-30 | To account rendered as per vouchers attached | $6.00  |\n|            | Chargeable to Kenora (R.C.)

I would set the motor and pump as low as possible but resting on a concrete platform, say 4\" or 6\" above the concrete floor.\n\nThe 4\" pipe line should have been laid at least 3' below the lowest anticipated water level of the lake. It has been laid only about 1' below the water level prevailing in April and May, and at the present time, for a considerable distance from the shore. The fact that the old pipe line never froze, is no reason to assume that the new one won't, especially since the old pipe is set nearly 3' lower and appears to be ensconced within an outer pipe. The only safe measure for ensuring that this new pipe line will not freeze, is to lower it so that there is five feet of solid earth covering out to the point where the water is now 4' deep. I would not care to recommend any other course. It might be possible to so cover up the pipe line as it now rests, in shallow water, so as to prevent freezing, but I have no suggestions to make along these lines. You know what the consequences would be should this pipe line freeze up, so no expense should be considered too great to ensure interrupted water service.\n\nI expect that Mr. J. T. Rose of this staff will be proceeding to Menora this week to carry out some investigations in connection with the proposed new sewerage disposal system for the R.C. School, and I have instructed him to accurately measure the suction lift, as the pump is now located, also in the recommended new location, also to determine the profile of the pipe line as laid. Mr. Rose's services will be available to you for any further investigations you wish made and for consultation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gray,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSeptember 16, 1930.\n\nCaptain Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Captain:\n\nFollowing our examination of the new pump and pipe line installed at the R.C. Indian School at Kenora, I have studied the Campbell Heating Company's proposals, made in writing to you under date of April 20, 1930. This firm reported that the lake level was about 22 feet below the pump, and recommended their \"First Proposal\" as \"the proper and thorough way to install this job\", and \"For the reason that this pump motor and suction line are of the proper capacity to do this job thoroughly\". Acting upon their report and recommendations, I understand you advised that the work be proceeded with. Later, this Company demanded and secured, an additional $600.00, above their original offer for doing the work. The Campbell now states that the lake level is 8' below the pump. I would here like to point out that on September 13th, the lake level was 1055.90, and on no day during the month of April, 1930, did the lake level reach this elevation; it was always lower. Had the suction lift been only 22 feet and had the 4\" pipe line been properly laid below the frost line, and otherwise properly laid, in all probability the system would have worked, but however, with little margin or safety. I am now assuming that the suction lift has been found to be nearly 25 feet. The Campbell Heating Company, acting in the capacity of Advisory Engineers, as well as Contractors, have therefore, the responsibility of seeing that the system is made to work in a \"thorough way\".\n\nAssuming the suction lift to be 25 feet, I am of the opinion that taking into consideration friction losses in the pipe line, and the possibility of still lower water in the lake, that the new pump, as installed, cannot be made to serve satisfactorily, and that no time should be wasted in attempting to make it do so. The pump and motor are efficient, but not dependable against a suction lift in excess of 25 feet, when there are several friction losses. The remedy is obvious, and to increase the suction lift by lowering the pump, being as it is necessary to move the pump, it would be advisable to lower it sufficiently to ensure efficient operation. I would suggest that a new pump house be erected immediately over the check valve now installed below the old pump house. This pump house should be 8' x 10', with an 8\" wall, with an 8\" concrete floor slab resting on gravel with wooden trap door giving\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Friday the 12th instant, Mr. Campbell informed me the new pump installed at the Kenora (R.C.) School would not work. I got Mr. Gow, Acting District Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch to come to Kenora and go to the school with me. I enclose a letter received from him today.\n\nHis suggestion is that we build a new pump house at a cost roughly of $250.00 and also that the only safe measure for ensuring that the new pump line will not freeze is to lower it so that there is at least five feet of solid earth covering out to the point where the water is four feet deep. He says it might be possible to cover up the pipe line in shallow water so as to prevent freezing, but he has no suggestions to make along these lines, and no expense should be too great to ensure uninterrupted water service.\n\nI have seen Mr. Campbell today and he informs me that the old pipe is only cased from the pump house to the check valve, and not in the lake. The new pipe when it strikes the water and from there on, is lower than the old one. He believes that if we were to cover the pipes which lay alongside each other until they strike deep water there will be no chance of them freezing. I would recommend the pump house be built and the pipe either covered or lowered and I should like to get instructions along these lines and in view of Mr. Gow's letter, should like to know who is to pay for the pump house and the work on the pump line. The water is lower in the lake than it has been for many years and the old pump is liable to give out at any time. I shall be glad, therefore, to receive instructions as soon as possible as cold weather will soon be setting in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.1\nKenora, Ontario,\nSeptember 22nd, 1929.\n\nAssistant Deputy Inspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference my letter of the 18th., which was held back until today, awaiting estimate from Kelly and Kimberly.\n\nThis firm now write me it would cost $249.00 to erect a pump house, and $650.00 to extend present crib over pipe line twenty five feet, filling same and existing sixty feet of old crib to depth of six feet over pipe line.\n\nThis is a large expenditure, but I think it should be done if possible, as I am afraid of everything freezing up this winter, owing to the excessively low level of the lake.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDUPLICATE, FOR DEPARTMENT.\n\nBank of Montreal,\n\n$9625\n\nRECEIVED from\n\non account\n\nthe sum of $9625/100\n\nDollars, which amount will appear at the RECEIVER GENERAL'S credit with this Bank.\n\nSigned in Triplicate,\n\nPro.

This road is in bad shape, and the school authorities apparently do very little work on it. We could probably obtain cinders from the C.P.R., and if the school authorities or the Department would pay for the labour of hauling, a passable road could be made at much less cost than estimated by the Principal.\n\nI also enclose letter re the heating system. This was put in good shape a short time ago by Heale and Yeats of Brandon, and the heating of the new addition was done by the Campbell Heating Co., of Kenora. Mr. Campbell informs me that he thinks the reason is, the school authorities put a fire on, then do not keep it up, hence the trouble; so I am writing the Principal requesting him to have Brother Gautier make a report, as any previous reports we have received from him, always seem reasonable and honest.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS                  | CHARGES | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|------|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 25   | 4 PLAYGROUND BALLS          | 1.20    |         | 4.80    |\n|      | ORDER NO. 199-1-4           |         |         |         |\n|      | KEMORA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL |       |         |         |\n\nCertified correct, supplies furnished.\n\nP.

The Principal has immediately instructed Mr. G. Ratclifford of honour to investigate and do what he could to remedy same. I went to the School this morning with Mr. Ratclifford and it appeared that the main Septic Tank and Filter Tank are apparently blocked as is also the overflow pipe to the lake, and the tile pipes are broken.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Rose, of the Dominion Water Power and Irrigation Bureau, who I met on long distance telephone and Mr. Ratclifford explained the situation to him. Mr. Rose assured me to carry out all suggestions of Mr. Ratclifford, and as this is the best that can be done as a temporary measure, I have accordingly instructed him to carry out the work as recommended in his letter, enclosed herewith, as otherwise, if nothing is done, the School would have to be closed.\n\nI understand there is an appropriation of about $3500.00 recommended for a new Sewage disposal next Spring at this School.\n\nI know I have received instructions to give this kind of work to Kelly & Kinneir, Mr. Smith, or Mr. Brown, but as the Principal\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor R.C., Indian Residential School on Rat Portage\n\nReserve In: KENORA Agency\n\nDate January 23rd, 1931\n\n| Articles                  | No. on Hand | Date of Last Receipt | No. Required | No. Authorized | Remarks                                      |\n|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Single School Desks       |             |                      |              |                |                                               |\n| \"Rear\" Desk               |             |                      |              |                |                                               |\n| \"Front\"                   |             |                      |              |                |                                               |\n| School Desks              |             |                      |              |                |                                               |\n| \"Rear\" Desk               |             |                      |              |                |                                               |\n| \"Front\"                   |             |                      |              |                |                                               |\n\nMay be had at:\nThe GLOBE FURNITURE CO.\nWaterloo, Ontario.\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial schools.\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\n---\n\nNote - To avoid delay and correspondence in filling requisitions, the teacher should give full particulars regarding each article required.

No. 5.\nThe Roman Catholic Indian School is located close to the shore of a small bay of Lake of the Woods, about three miles from Kenora. It is accessible with difficulty by automobile and readily accessible by boat during the open water period. This report deals with the present condition of the existing sewage disposal system and outlines alternative systems that might be installed to provide an adequate sewage disposal system. Plans and profiles of the proposed works, together with estimates of the cost, are included in the report. The elevations given on the plans and profiles are to Geodetic Survey of Canada datum and the surveys were made by an engineer of this staff.\n\nThe school was erected by the Church and was located without regard to the difficulty of installing an adequate disposal system as later became necessary, due to the enlargement of the school and the necessity of preventing pollution of the water of the lake. Originally all sewage was piped directly into the lake, but later a disposal system was installed. This system consists of a septic tank with inside dimensions of 5' x 10' and 8' deep, divided into two chambers, each accessible by a manhole. The tank is constructed of concrete. The septic tank is connected by a pipe to a filter chamber with inside dimensions of 9' x 15' and 8' high, constructed of concrete and provided with a manhole. The filter\noutlets to a disposal bed 20' x 50', the particulars of which are unknown. All sanitary, laundry and kitchen sewers in the building are connected to the system. It is quite apparent that the system is not functioning properly, the siphon frequently becomes blocked; the filter bed requires replacing and the disposal bed is apparently completely out of order. The effluent can be seen running out into the lake and gives off a very obnoxious odor.\n\nPROPOSED SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe school is located about one half a mile above the intake of the Kenora Water Supply System. This system is located above the town of Kenora, so that none of the town sewers discharge above the intake. However, along the shores of the mainland and on many of the islands there are located many summer homes that are also polluting the water of the lake. Kenora's water supply is being sterilized to such a degree as to render it very disagreeable to drink and still the Ontario Department of Health is not satisfied as to its safety. Steps are now being taken to prevent the pollution of the water of the lake and this Indian School is considered to be a very great offender in this respect. Any proposed alteration to the sewage system at the school will evidently have to meet with the approval of the Ontario Board of Health. Accordingly, in this report two alternative schemes for a sewage disposal system are outlined, varying considerably in cost. It is hoped that if the cheaper scheme will not meet with the approval of the Health Authorities that the more expensive scheme might. It is\nRealized, however, that neither scheme will prevent some pollution of the water of the lake.\n\nA - Scheme No. 1.\n\nThis scheme provides for making use of the existing septic tank and the filter chamber and the entire reconstruction of the disposal bed. Also, it is intended to pass all sanitary drainage from the school through the disposal system as is done at the present time.\n\n(a) Septic Tank.\n\nIt is proposed to partially remove the existing partition, thus converting the structure into one compartment to be utilized as a settling chamber. Some minor changes will be required in the outlet pipes of the tank. A new 4\" vitrified pipe line will be necessary to connect this tank to the filter tank.\n\n(b) Filter Tank.\n\nThis tank will be cleaned out, leaving only the walls. A siphon chamber will be built in, thereby converting the structure into a septic tank. An Anthee siphon will be installed. The siphon will discharge into the feeder line of the disposal bed.\n\n(c) Disposal Bed.\n\nThe old disposal bed will be entirely removed and a new bed built up in accordance with the design for Disposal Bed No. 2, as shown on accompanying plans. This disposal bed, 36' x 120', will provide in excess of 1,000 lineal feet of tile drainage, or about 15 lineal feet per capita. The disposal bed, being built up of gravel and sand, should be very efficient. The disposal bed is entirely above the high water level of the lake, yet in close proximity to the shore.\nScheme No. 2.\n\nThis proposed scheme provides for a more complete disposal system and more in conformity with modern installations. It involves the complete scrapping of the existing disposal system and for separate disposal of the laundry and kitchen waste. No use will be made of the old septic tank; the filter tank will be partially demolished to make way for the disposal bed, and the old disposal bed will be entirely removed.\n\n(a) Septic Tank.\n\nA new reinforced concrete septic tank will be constructed as shown on the accompanying plans. This tank will be similar in type to the septic tank built at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Kenora. Each siphon will discharge into separate disposal beds.\n\n(b) Disposal Beds.\n\nTwo disposal beds are provided, each 36' x 120', adjoining each other but constructed on different levels to conform to the steep slope of the ground. No. 1 bed is built up of the natural earth excavated from Bed No. 2, while No. 2 bed is to be built up of gravel and sand. The beds will be terraced and made attractive. The accompanying plans give details of both beds.\n\n(c) Laundry Drain.\n\nDisposal of the laundry and kitchen drainage presents a difficult problem, as all natural drainage leads directly to the lake fronting the school grounds. It is very undesirable to have a greasy film covering the water surface in any conspicuous area. Accordingly, it is\nproposed to lay a drain from the laundry end of the school to a small sheltered bay of the lake, well away from the school grounds. The location of this drain is shown in red on one of the accompanying plans. As the depth of soil overlying the rock is shallow and in the vicinity of the shore there is no covering, it becomes necessary to build up a covering for the drain throughout almost its entire length and to protect the outlet with crib-work and filling. The drain will be 6\" vitrified piping and that portion projecting into the lake will be cast iron pipe. Alterations in the plumbing system in the school will also be necessary to convey the laundry drainage to the proposed drain.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations.\n\nThe sewage disposal system designated as Scheme No. 1 has the disadvantage in that the laundry drainage is not separated from the other sewage and results in overloading the whole system on certain days so that bacteria is very likely to be passed through the disposal beds into the lake. The great advantage of the scheme as compared with that designated as Scheme No. 2 is the difference in cost. Scheme No. 2 offers the objectionable feature that the laundry and kitchen waste is drained directly into the lake, a feature probably objectionable to the Ontario Department of Health. It does, however, provide a very efficient method of treating the sewage from the school and preventing dangerous bacteria from reaching the lake.\n\nTaking into consideration the fact that this Indian School is an old structure and has almost\nreached the end of efficient usefulness, the writer cannot recommend that any such elaborate or expensive drainage disposal system as Scheme No. 2 should be proceeded with... Should, however, the Department of Indian Affairs contemplate utilizing the present school for an additional term of ten years, then the writer would urge that consideration be given to the construction of a new disposal system in the summer of 1931 along the lines outlined in Scheme No. 1.\n\nD.

Campbell Heating Co. accounts $18.40 and $9.80 for installing Hot Water Coil in Kitchen Range and the necessary material for the new Pump House. Williams Hardware Co. $25.50 for Heater for the Pump House.\n\nAll these expenditures were absolutely necessary.\n\nMr. H.

Cheyne, Kenora, Ontario, for Repairs to Compressor of Frigidaire, Kenora R.C. School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 129-1-5 dated March 27th, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDepartment of the Interior, Canada,\nUnion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nWinnipeg, Sept.16th. 1930\n\nCaptain Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Captain,\n\nFollowing our examination of the new pump and pipe line installed at the R.C. Indian School at Kenora, I have studied the Campbell Heating Company's proposals made in writing to you under date April 30th, 1930. This firm reported that the lake level was about 22 feet below the pump, and recommended their \"first proposal\" as \"The proper and thorough way to install this job\", and \"For the reason that this pump motor and suction line are of the proper capacity to do this job thoroughly.\" Acting upon their report and recommendations I understand you advised that the work be proceeded with. Later, this Company demanded and secured an additional $600 above their original offer for doing the work. Mr. Campbell now states that the lake level is 24'8\" below the pump. I would here like to point out that on September 13th, the lake level was 1055.90 and on no day during the month of April 1930 did the lake level reach this elevation; it was always lower. Had the suction lift been only 22 feet and had the 4\" pipe line been properly laid below the frost line, and otherwise properly laid, in all probability the system would have worked, but however, with little margin of safety. I am now assuming that the suction lift has been found to be nearly 25 feet. The Campbell Heating Company, acting in the capacity of Advisory Engineers, as well as contractors, have therefore, the responsibility of seeing that the system is made to work in a \"thorough way.\"\n\nAssuming the suction lift to be 25 feet, I am of the opinion that taking into consideration friction losses in the pipe line, and the possibility of still lower water in the lake, that the new pump, as installed, cannot be made to serve satisfactorily, and that no time should be wasted in attempting to make it do so. The Pump and motor are efficient, but not dependable against a suction lift in excess of 22 feet, when there are several friction losses. The remedy, therefore, is to decrease the suction lift by lowering the pump. Being as it is necessary to move the pump, it would be advisable to lower it sufficiently to ensure efficient operation. I would suggest that a new pump house be erected immediately over the check valve now installed below the old pump house. This pump house should be 8' x 10' with an 8\" wall with an 8\" concrete floor slab resting on gravel with wooden trap door giving access to the check valve. I would set the motor and pump as low as possible but resting on a concrete platform, say 4\" or 6\" above the concrete floor.\nthe 4\" pipe line should have been laid at least 3' below the lowest anticipated water level of the lake. It has been laid only about 1' below the water level prevailing in April and May, and at the present time, for a considerable distance from the shore. The fact that the old pipe line never froze, is no reason to assure that the new one won't, especially since the old pipe is set nearly 9\" lower and appears to be encased within an outer pipe. The only safe measure for ensuring that this new pipe line will not freeze, is to lower it so that there is five feet of solid earth covering out to the point where the water is now 4' deep. I would not care to recommend any other course. It might be possible to so cover up the pipe line as it now rests, in shallow water, so as to prevent freezing, but I have no suggestions to make along these lines. You know what the consequences would be should this pipe line freeze up, so no expense should be considered too great to ensure interrupted water service.\n\nI expect that Mr. J.T. Rose of this staff will be proceeding to Kenora this week to carry out some investigations in connection with the proposed new sewerage disposal system for the R.C. School, and I have instructed him to accurately measure the suction lift, as the pump is now located, also in the recommended new location, also to determine the profile of the pipe line as laid. Mr. Rose's services will be available to you for any further investigations you wish made and for consultation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) D.B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nKenora, Ontario\n\nSeptember 18th, 1930\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Friday the 12th instant, Mr. Campbell informed me the new pump installed at the Kenora (R.C.) School would not work. I got Mr. Gow, Acting District Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch to come to Kenora and go to the school with me. I enclose a letter received from him today.\n\nHis suggestion is that we build a new pump house at a cost roughly of $250.00 and also that the only safe measure for ensuring that the new pump line will not freeze is to lower it so that there is at least five feet of solid earth covering out to the point where the water is four feet deep. He says it might be possible to so cover up the pipe line in shallow water so as to prevent freezing, but he has no suggestions to make along these lines, and no expense should be too great to ensure uninterrupted water service.\n\nI have seen Mr. Campbell today and he informs me that the old pipe is only cased from the pump house to the check valve, and not in the lake. The new pipe when it strikes the water and from there on, is lower than the old one. He believes that if we were to cover the pipes which lay alongside each other until they strike deep water there will be no chance of them freezing. I would recommend the pump house be built and the pipe either covered or lowered and I should like to get instructions along these lines and in view of Mr. Gow's letter, should like to know who is to pay for the pump house and the work on the pump line. The water is lower in the lake than it has been for many years and the old pump is liable to give out at any time. I shall be glad, therefore, to receive instructions as soon as possible as cold weather will soon be setting in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ontario.\nSeptember 22nd, 1929.\n\nAssistant Deputy Inspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference my letter of the 18th., which was held back until today, awaiting estimate from Kelly and Kimberly.\n\nThis firm now write me it would cost $249.00 to erect a pump house, and $650.00 to extend present crib over pipe line twenty five feet, filling same and existing sixty feet of old crib to depth of six feet over pipe line.\n\nThis is a large expenditure, but I think it should be done if possible, as I am afraid of everything freezing up this winter, owing to the excessively low level of the lake.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nCopy of Telegram, night letter\n\nMilitary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nReference my letter 22nd Sept re erecting pump house extending spelling civil over water intake Kenora School.

C. Indian School and the Cecilia Jeffrey School at Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI am indeed surprised to hear of the unsatisfactory condition of the laundry sump at the Cecilia Jeffrey School as upon the occasion of my last visit to Kenora, some two months ago, Captain Edwards informed me that owing to his recommendation efforts have been made to deepen the laundry sump in order to reach a gravel bed and that these efforts have been successful and that the sump was operating satisfactorily. I will write Captain Edwards and ascertain from him further particulars as to the condition of the laundry sump.\n\nThere is no doubt that Captain Edwards will be more or less worried by the efforts of the Sanitary Inspector at Kenora to have the proposed new work at the R. C. Indian School carried out as the town authorities are making a drive to stop the pollution of the lake of the Woods water by summer campers and permanent inhabitants bordering the waters of the lake. However, the conditions at the school are not any more serious, in my opinion, than they have been for some years past so far as pollution of the lake water is concerned. Eventually if this R. C. Indian School is to be carried on in its present location the sewage disposal system will have to be remodelled and in view of the possibility of the Ontario Department of Health taking drastic action, such as closing down the institution, I would strongly advise that you submit the proposals forwarded from this office to you in January covering the proposed sewage disposal system at the school to the Department of Health at Ottawa for their approval of the same. Rather than have the institution closed down I believe it will be necessary for you to proceed with the remodelling of the sewage disposal system during the present summer when the school is closed down for the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

This should have been\ncharged against the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Indians' identity, culture, and way of life are threatened by the proposed plans (21 routes in all) which would destroy a great deal of their land and resources.\n\nIn order to protect these lands, the government has proposed a plan which would require a reducing valve on each pipeline to control the flow of oil and gas from the source. This plan also calls for additional storage tanks and pipelines, an essential part of any oil and gas development project.\n\nOne major concern will be the impact on the environment. The oil and gas industry is committed to minimizing its environmental footprint, but the potential for damage cannot be ignored. The government's responsibility is to ensure that the industry operates within acceptable limits and that the environment is protected.\n\nThe government has already implemented several measures to address these concerns, including the establishment of strict regulations and the implementation of advanced technology to reduce emissions and minimize waste.\n\nIn conclusion, while the proposed plans may have significant benefits, they also pose serious threats to the environment and the way of life of the Indians. It is crucial that we find a balance between economic development and environmental protection, ensuring that both the Indians and the environment are protected for future generations.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested I have immediately dispatched this note to Mr. Smith in connection with your request regarding the matter.\n\nThe present situation calls for a thorough examination of all possible solutions. It is evident that the current approach is not sufficient to address the complexities involved.\n\nI am confident that we can find a solution that will meet your requirements. Please let me know if there are any further details you need.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address]\nKenora, Ontario.\nMay, 14th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 129-1-5 of 6th inst. re Heating etc. at the Kenora, R.C.School.\n\nEnclosed please find report of Brother Gauthier who apparently thinks the Bakery chimney is the most dangerous.\n\nHe also informs us that he has the opinion of Mr. Yates of Neale & Yates of Shandon, the contractors who installed the present heating system, and he concurs in the Brother's recommendation.\n\nThis letter should be read in conjunction with our letter to you of 18th ultimo.\n\nLet us have your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Brother Gauthier, regarding the condition of the bakery chimney at the Kenora Indian Residential School. In view of this report, regarding its present condition, the Department will approve of your making arrangements with Kelly & Kimberley, of Kenora, to rebuild the bakery chimney at the same time as they are carrying out the work in connection with the main chimney of the school building. The Department will rely on you to see that all costs in the rebuilding of this chimney are kept to the lowest possible point, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job. It is noted, in your letter of the 4th instant, that you estimated the cost of rebuilding these two chimneys to be approximately $800.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Under the circumstances I would ask you to please advise me if it would not be possible to make some temporary arrangements until such time as funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

F. MacKendrick,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThese people contracted the disease by drinking Lake & River water. It is for this reason that I am calling the Departments to your attention to the defective tank of January 15th in the Chlorination plant at the pump house. Should I fail only in a few hours there is a danger of an epidemic of fever. If the public were aware of the conditions existing at the Industrial school they would no doubt blame us all at all possible. I hope the Department will try to remedy the conditions.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nDr. A.D. Ferguson\naggravating the condition. Last spring Mr. Ralphsfield, a local plumber made some temporary repairs which consisted chiefly in placing an obstacle between the breaks and the shore line. This obstacle was in the shape of a dam & consisted of rocks, clay, gravel, and sand and it was expected to act as a filter for the sewage before entering the lake. Formerly there was bound to be currents through this dam and raw sewage went its way into the lake.\n\nThe Town of Kenora with a population of 7,700 has its intake pipes for its water supply 5/8 of a mile below this obstacle; hence it is important that the water used about the intakes should be as clean as possible so that all septic tanks situated above the intakes, should be in good working order. The more waste matter getting into the water the more chlorine will be needed to neutralize it in any way that can have had 4 cases of Typhoid fever in the hospital since spring & that these cases are thereof innocent.\nCapt. L. Edwards,\nIndian Agent\nKenora.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Mr. McKenzie's letter which you showed me referring to the sewage system at the Little Norway Indian School I would like to inform you of the situation as it exists today. The septic tank was installed at this school situated on the face of a hill and was installed in an unlined manner. It had a capacity to take care of about 50 people. Since then the population at this school has increased gradually until there are about eighty people. The wash water and waste from kitchen also passed through the tank with the result that the system was carrying too big a load so there has been an overflow occurring for some time which runs down the hill into the lake. The overflow is practically raw sewage. The past winter the pipe became frozen and there they burst.\nKenora, Ontario.\nJuly 21st, 1931.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nReplying to your letter 129-1-5 of 10th inst. re sewage disposal system at the Kenora R.C. Residential School.\n\nInclosed please find a letter from Dr. A.D. Ferguson, our Medical Officer, also Town Medical Officer of Health, which explains itself.\n\nOn the 16th inst. I was in Winnipeg on other business and saw Mr. Gow, of the Dominion Water Power Branch who informed me that he had written to the Department in May that the work that had been done was only a temporary repair, and that something should be done this Spring.\n\nWe would be glad therefore, if you possibly could do something immediately, when the children are on holiday, so that the School would not be closed up.\n\nThe School is just above the Town water intake and there is much complaining.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 6, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st ultimo with further reference to the sewage disposal system at the Kenora R.C.

Indian Residential School at Kenora.\n\nOwing to the limited funds available this year it was hoped that the work could be postponed until some future time, but on account of the many complaints being received of the polluted condition of the water of the Lake of the Woods, it will be necessary for the Department to take action immediately, and I would ask you, therefore, to kindly instruct Mr. Gow to proceed with the necessary alterations to the sewage disposal system, as outlined in Scheme No. 1 of his report, in which it is noted that the cost will be approximately $1,600.00.\n\nIt would be well to ascertain if the Ontario government will approve of scheme No. 1, before the work is commenced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.
