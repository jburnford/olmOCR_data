The Government had a majority of 24 on the 26th of February, and four more supporters have been elected since then. In Algoma, and for British Columbia, and when the remaining elections have taken place Sir John's majority will be over thirty.\n\nRemember Tuesday Next!\n\nElections of Saskatchewan, remember the date you owe to yourselves and to your country on Tuesday next! Rally to the support of a fellow settler. Rally to the support of a man who has given liberally of his means for the development of Saskatchewan. Remember the appeal of a man who makes his living in your midst, who will prosper if the country prospers. Away with party spirit. We have a common race, a common home, a common interest. As pioneers of the Northwest, rally behind Mr. Macdonald, the only man who is worthy of your support. Rally to the support of a fellow pioneer, remembering the while that if the development of our common home depends upon anyone else but Mr. Land's stamp it would not have emerged from its primitive state, and we would not be standing today in comparative peace and prosperity as the result of the Great North-West war.\n\nRally to the polls therefore, on Tuesday, and woe unto those who disapprove the interference of an outsider and a bachelor in the affairs of the House of Commons. Fight your own battles. Your enemies will not fight them for you.\n\nTHE LAST WORD.\n\nTuesday next, the 15th of March, 1887, will be a memorable day in the history of Saskatchewan. On that day the people of the province will be called upon, for the first time, to elect representatives to the House of Commons. For years now the people and the people of the Territories have been knocking at the doors of the Dominion Parliament for representation. For years they have claimed, and with good reason, that the interests of the Northwest would be neglected by a government elected in the House of Commons by men whose hopes and interests were centered in this eastern part of the Dominion. In view of that right, it is our duty to put in practice the doctrines we have been preaching, and to elect Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Macdonald alone, to represent us at Ottawa. Such representation as we are obtaining by the Liberal party is not so good, nor so safe, nor so certain as that which we had before. It certainly is not our idea of Northwest representation, nor do we believe that the people of any other district, none of them have been doing anything outlandish. We, above all others, desire that Liberalism should be accorded to whate'er doctrine we have espoused so long and so earnestly with our presentation. We also, through our Liberal friends, have gone a begging to the Atlantic coast, for brains to represent us in the Commons. We could have done better by ourselves. We are residents of Manitoba, because, no matter how far away we may be different from the rest of the world, we feel that Northwest interests would be looked after by a Prince Edward Islander in view of the fact that the interests of the latter would not be allowed to interfere with those of the former. As matters stand, however, we must make the best of things.\n\nTo make things worse, Mr. Land has a penchant for breaking loose from the party line. He was elected in 1878, and he is liable to do again if he has the opportunity. He is opposed to Mr. Macdonald, and he is opposed to the party line. He is opposed to the party line, and to their English-speaking neighbour, Mr. Macdonald. This is not the man to be supported. Mr. Macdonald is a political trickster of the worst stamp. Pray God he has not. His record is repugnant to every thinking man. He represents nothing. He is nothing, he is a political trickster of the worst stamp. Pray God he has not. His record is repugnant to every thinking man. He represents nothing. He is nothing, he is a political trickster of the worst stamp.\n\nMr. Macdonald will at the South Branch, and will visit Saskatchewan before he returns to Prince Albert.\n\nReports from the different settlements show a large majority for Mr. Macdonald. All his friends have to do is to go to the polling stations and vote for him.\n\nMr. Clink skill telegraphs from Ritterfield as follows: \"You can assure the people of Prince Albert that Mr. Macdonald is the man best fitted for the abilities of the respective candidates and on polling day will show that Mr. Macdonald does not interfere with their choice of the best man for the whole district.\"\n\nMr. Macdonald's knowledge of the wants and interests of Ritterfield and the Northwest is most desirable. As far as can be judged at present he will obtain very handsome majority, who, the polling takes place, will be able to hold his seat for many years to come.\n\nMr. Macdonald's ability and long experience, has come out square for Mr. Macdonald and will secure a large majority. Mr. Clink skill is evidently one who, while he holds his party name, loves his country and his fellow man.\n\nVote for Mr. Macdonald and a resident member.\n\nInformation to Electors.\n\nThe following is the qualification of electors as prescribed by the Parliament Act:\n\nEvery person qualified to vote at the election from the male resident and householder of the constituency, or any portion thereof, who is of the age of twenty-one years, or of the age of eighteen years and of sound mind, and who has been registered in such constituency or division thereof for at least six months immediately preceding the day fixed for the election, shall be entitled to vote for that constituency, or division thereof, at the election.\n\nEvery elector, after having voted, shall give his name and address to the returning officer, and shall declare for which candidate he votes.\n\nA further reduction of 10 cents, will be made if ordered.\n\nFERRY'S SEEDS\n\nRem.\n\nCamp Steves and Co.\n\nJAMES JAMES\nADDRESS\n\nTo the Electors of Saskatchewan.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN.\n\nOn behalf of a number of electors in the District of Saskatchewan, I beg to offer myself as a candidate for your suffrages at the coming election of a member for the Federal Parliament. If elected, I shall use every endeavor to secure the local interests of the District, and shall urge on the Government the necessity of aiding the railway community at Prince Albert, Battleford and Saskatoon.\n\nThe building of a bridge across the South Saskatchewan River; The granting of assistance to the island at Hudson's Bay; The school education of the aboriginal children of Halfbreed bands of families from the Territories between 1879 and 1883.\n\nThe two amendments of the permit system by repealing the liquor question. The privileges given to the Indians.\n\nA speedy passage on a liberal scale of all just claims against the Government for losses.\n\nThe introduction of a graduated land grant system under the most favorable circumstances possible.\n\nThe purchasing of supplies for public purposes within the district affected by the election.\n\nThe removal of a Legislative Assembly for the exclusive use of the Legislature of which the electors of Saskatchewan shall have full voice and part.\n\nAs a local man whose interests are closely identified with the future of Saskatchewan, I appeal to every elector at this important, for support.\n\nI am, gentlemen,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Macdonald.\n\nAVIS D'ELECTION\n\nDistrict Electorali d'Saskatchewan.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN.\n\nAVIS public : est par le present donn\u00e9 pour recueillir les voix des \u00e9lecteurs de cette province sur
