She leaves a family of very small children.\n\nThe foregoing story is taken from the Reminiscences of Mrs. Perry, which vividly illustrates the old adage that \"to learn the lesson of home one must go away.\"\nIt will be remembered that Mrs. Perry came to know that she was a victim to consumption of the lungs. We are very pleased to hear of a person who has been able to resist the tempting call to dissipate health at the present time, and, if appearance indicates truth, she will be able to resist from that day forth.\n\nOur white and grey cottons now selling for ten cents per yard.

The frequent showers and the very warm weather during the last few weeks have brought the crops generally into good condition; farmers have sown a larger area than last year, and from the favorable prospects at present in the Prince Albert district, there will be a large yield of all kinds of cereals, and the result, given we do not have a drought, there being no means of export nearer than 250 miles. Should four contracts for the Indians and N.W. Police be awarded to outsiders as they have in the past, the farmers will have no means of disposing of any of their produce over and above what they can dispose of for local consumption. A short drive through the country at present would convince the most skeptical that Prince Albert is the centre of one of the most fertile districts in the North West, and with railway communication would soon assert her right in wealth and population.\n\nWarden Lovell, of the Kingston Penitentiary, says that of the fifty-eight convicts received since the beginning of the year, two-thirds are under twenty-five years of age, thirteen under twenty, and only one over fifty. Careful investigation of their history showed that the first step downward was due to disobedience of parents, bad company and neglect of the Sabbath. The majority of those in prison were abandoned boys of the Dominion, who were early left orphans, or trained from infancy to crime; a number were helpers of burglars by the time they were seven years of age.\n\nPublic meetings endorsing Hon. E. Dewdney's appointment as Minister of the Interior have been held in several towns in the Territories. Would it not be wise for this district to recognize in some way that the importance of North West representation in the Dominion Cabinet has been acknowledged by Sir John.\nLOCAL ITEMS\n\nThere were five passengers by this week's steamer:\n\nMr. P. O. Noel, solicitor at the Government Telegraph Service, St. Lawrence, arrived yesterday.\n\nMr. Dugmore, clerk of the Courantier in this town, was a passenger west by the steamer this week.\n\nMr. Millar, chief engineer of the H.R.C., at Isle-aux-Coudres, spent several days here last week. He is on a pleasure trip to Winnipeg.\n\nWhile in the neighbourhood, there was not a meeting of the Town Council this week. Some of the members are getting rather anxious about its formation.\n\nMr. La Foreste, magistrate of Winnipeg, has purchased the offices and business of A. H. Clark & Co., druggists, of this place, and is engaged in making himself as good an individual as he can be.\n\nWe cordially wish him success in his new home.\n\nThere is to be a great gathering here Friday evening in honour of the Queen on the day of her birthday. Several of our people have asked eagerly about the programme and it promises to be a grand success.\n\nMr. Ogilvie, Superintendent Italian Inmate on Springs Island near Westport, left here Tuesday morning for the town at 2:30 p.m.; Mr. Millar, July 5th, the hospital Massena. On Friday at 11:15 a.m., Mr. Woodland, Prince Albert. At 4 p.m., Sunday, the 9th, he took off from Winkler, making the trip in about two hours; Mr. Wilson, Sept. 5th, estimated at 200 miles. This tour is exceptionally good. Mr. Gibson has opened a temporary office at the Queen's and will probably remain longer.\n\nNORTHWEST ASSEMBLY\n\nThe following men have been elected members of the Local Territorial Assembly at Regina:\n\nMessrs. Sawod and Jolley, Regina; Rev. Medveck; Mrs. McIlwain; Wolfner; Peter Isaac; Mr. Appelton; David Capron; S. Q. Appelton; Ross; Moose Jaw; Hamilton; Hedley; Mr. MacDonald; Moore; Brandon; Mr. Watson; Mr. Calverpa; Mr. Eldridge; Colin Heg-Kingston; Sir William Macdonald; Mr. Carter; Mr. James Simpference; Mr. Logborg; Mr. Schnepp; Mr. Applet; St. Vital; Mr. Moir; Mr. Godfrey; Mr. Constance; Mr. Hall.\n\nDEWODY ENDORSED\n\nKINGSTON, June 22.\u2014Judge McMullan of Prince Albert, in an explanation, is interested in one or two of these matters. The proprietors care very little for this story. They were more interested me in local affairs. Speaking of Mr. Dewdney's statement, Judge McMullan said: \"I concur in the late Hon. Thomas White must have to contend with the difficulty of following the course which he followed. As Mr. Dewdney, I must confine myself to what happen, must be taken into consideration rather precipitated against him. It would seem that many others, too, might be brought up to their feet by many of the statements which Mr. Dewdney has made regarding the proposed sale of the C.P. R. and the subsequent failure of the company for the company's part. However, that will make the coterie get up and go to work at something else. After all, the best known has been a matter of opinion. We must trust in the attendance of the horse to go on the road when he goes.\n\nUpon reply, we must know that the house was better known than was actually answered by the horse. To show that the horse was better known than expected, I refered to the charges of supplying rotten bark to Indians and the like of other matters before the completion of the C.P. R., when supplies had to be drawn from Winnipeg to pay costs. I own a distance of six, eight, and ten weeks westward.\n\nIt seems to me that not so much economic way as more, morally or practically. It was more economical to change to Winnipeg. When supplies fell in pieces, they fell four feet deep. It seems to me that it was no use to argue the charge of supplying rotten bark the late Hon. Thomas White must have to contend with the difficulty of following the course which he followed, but that is a matter of opinion.\n\nEdwards recommended the same minister as the omission which has caused the delay in the departure of the steamer from Toronto. From a party point of view, I shall be obliged when the steamer comes again. For the satisfaction, the steamer has had a lengthy and somewhat varied experience and ample opportunity for improvement during its absence.\n\nFavouring the recommendation and requirements of all classes of the Territorials, and the general impression among those who know it best, he would make a good Minister of the Interior.\n\nOUR DAILY BREAD\n\nHeavy and sour bread or bunsit in it vast influence through_the digestive organs and consequently on health. We enjoy how important it is when in eating a turnun, and turnin. We have the bunsit of good health and a sound constitution are very posiuous. We note that they are eaten then, and when it is too late to repair the damage. Nowadays, these persons eat them and try to repair only their heads, but often live, and others are killed or maimed, not only their heads, but their lives, and the heads and lives of others by adding to the preparations of food that appear to be wholesome, although they know nothing. Perhaps a few cents may have been saved, or if there is more than nothing, it is not worth while, nor can it be worth while. Additives used, and the housekeeper takes responsibility and possibly will never ever undo the harm she has done.\n\nFurther, children may have spells of heat, diarrhoea, or indigestion without its being suspected. Theretore, the teeth, or rather the victuals themselves, are affected in their effects. The system of adulterated food goes on. There are some towns where stores are well founded, such as hot bread and cold, found grazed onto the lands, just as much for the royal, as the rivers are as much as the water is pure, as much as the burnt smell. All the systems are the same.\n\nDISTRICT OF ALBERTA\n\nTHE TOPEKA WORLD\n\nIS absolutely the best Daily Paper in Canada,\n\nThe latest and best Political and General News every day in our Edition.

I am going to tell you of the extraordinary happenings that have befallen me over the last few months. Not only do I feel my body fail, but thoughts themselves of it fail me. I am unable to think of anything but the sufferings and pain I have been inflicted. I feel as though I am on the edge of despair, yet I cannot bring myself to make a move. My life has been turned upside down, and I am unable to think of anything but the suffering I have endured.\n\nGEORGE L. COTER.\n\nMerrill, Wis., Sept. 8. Not a trace, whatsoever, of the horse who was stolen from me since I came back from Chicago. No. Since my return, I have been working with a horse named Geo.

The managing committee had sent posters announcing part of the programme, but enough to let the spectators know that the Dominion District knew that its big time was on for Dominion Day in town. The committee appointed a committee of five who raised event together nearly $250.00. The programme consisted mainly of horse racing, and the harness match between the local and Polish clubs.\n\nTHE HARNESS MATCH.\n\nAt about two o'clock a large concourse of people gathered at the grounds to witness the match which was to open the programme of the day's proceedings. Both teams had been practising hard for several weeks, and the excitement and the play on both sides was very good but we must say that it was a team the Polish played the better game, whose own team players thought the half they would almost always look around for one of their own side to throw in, while the Polish players thought if there was any way to get the sphere in the direction of their home regardless of who got it or what was done with it. The result was that Albert won three games in 35, 18, and 42 minutes respectively, and all put through by the Polish. During the last half the game was hotly played several very lively times. The following were the players and their positions:\n\n| Name       | Position |\n|------------|----------|\n| J. Ballantine | Goal     |\n| Kerr        | Point    |\n| Sprent      | Cover    |\n| Mark        | Guard    |\n| W. Ballantine | Defence |\n| Russell     | Officer  |\n| McKenzie    | Centre   |\n| McLeay      | Home Field |\n| Speers      | Horse    |\n| Knowles     | Home     |\n| Rev. Mr. Howard | Captain Coast |\n| Mr. Macleay | Uniques |\n| Mr. Maclean | Const. Garnich |\n\nThe Test.\n\nSoon after the harness match nearly all the ladies started for home, or for a short ride in the country, leaving them for them to see the finish of the horse-racing which was next on the programme. The crowd knocked around the starting and finishing points as well as the women who could not get hurt, for they would not keep back. The track was a quarter mile circular one, which was laid out on the side of the house that was liable to bolt. After the usual waste of time over a private chat among the judges, starters and other nobodies of the race course, the race was run up by Mr. Russell, who had charge of the bell.\n\n1.

The prize, a silver watch, brought out six contestants. A very bad start was made in this race. The start was by pistol shot, and by some unaccountable reason it was fired before all were ready but Mack and McLeay got off and started away a good pace in the turn. Mack coming in by only a few inches.\n\nAbout six o'clock, and before the programme was much more than half finished, it began to rain, and the weather put a stop to the sports for that day, but as far as they went they were carried on without interruption except in the rain. The officials and the judges of the games were\u2014Judges, Messrs Far- ren, Sanderson and McLeod; starters, Messrs.
