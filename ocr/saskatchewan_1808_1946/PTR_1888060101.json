Mr. J. C. W. Field, Johnson's Lincolnsay Farm, Manitoba, writes us as follows:\n\n\"We are growing Russian Six weeks wheats for their early ripening qualities and no one can say that we are not giving every opportunity to have the fact most fully demonstrated. The Winnipeg Board of Grain Examiners, condemned these varieties on the ground that they were soft wheats. They have been called as No. 1 hard, in Russia, Italy, and France, imported nearly all hard wheats for market purposes. A large firm of corn merchants in St. Petersburg has also reported very highly of the same wheats. We quote the following extracts from the Mark Lane Express, London, Eng.:\n\n\"Our fresh harvest in the last five years has been sent to South Africa, which came mostly in small parcels by steamer. This wheat is of high quality, and is preferred by the millers, and the expert trade from the Cape Colony.\"\n\nProfessor W. Streif, of Hohenzollern, Germany, has been making some tests on various wheats, and has found a way to determine their relative protein content. He says that the flour the gluten contents were highest in the Russian wheats, ranging between 20 and 21.5 per cent.\n\nWe are pleased to learn that the Russian Six weeks and Kalakusa wheats sown in this District are growing well. We will be glad to receive crop reports from farmers and others every week.\n\nIn the debate in the House of Commons on the Northwest Assembly Act, Mr. Watson, Marquette, Manitoba, reminded the Northwest members what their constituents had warned him was very properly said on by Mr. Perley. Mr. Watson undertook to show that the member for North Dakota had given his seat to the Senator before he had been elected by the Crown Prosecutor here to French half-breed claims, and made some silly statements about the good grace, hospitality, and other fine characteristics, but it was evident that he had been misled by his own belief in the spirit of the speech by Mr. Macdonald.\n\nMr. Watson then proceeded to explain why he had been elected to the seat, and the reasons and all the advantages of the latter in question were alluded to. The charges of a corrupt election, however, were answered by the words, \"But Watson and his friends succeeded in making themselves thoroughly unpopular by their attempt to secure a point against the Government who showed himself to that degree, so as to be able to hold his own on the floor of the House with the best of the Northwest members. We are convinced that this Mr. Macdonald will also speak strongly against the present liquor laws in force in the Territories, which he characterizes as arbitrary and unconstitutional. It is a matter of common knowledge that when the people who have hitherto voted for him are not represented in Parliament. He advocated leaving the matter to the people of the Northwest. This is what we have always advocated for a long time, and there is every reason to believe that in another year the people will be called upon to decide whether they will have liquor or prohibition. We have already heard that the Local Assembly Act, but have not yet received the Bill, and are anxious to see it passed into law at an early date.\n\nThe Town Council held a regular meeting last night. Mr. Watson, Mayor Bains presiding. The council present were McPhail, Stewart, Knowles, Davis and Knowles.\n\nThe Finance Committee recommended the expenditure of $250 for the purchase of the new Town Hall. The committee present were McPhail, Stewart, Knowles, Agnew and McPhail.\n\nA motion was made for the Board of Works to take up the sidewalks building as a backup plan was declared for the vote being a tie.\n\nBy Laws.\n\nSeveral by-laws received their first reading and ordered to be signed, sealed and returned to the Town Clerk.\n\nMr. T. N. Campbell was appointed Street Surveyor, with the magnificent salary of $100 per month.\n\nCain Davis gave notice that he would purchase by law the purchase of the property on Church and right of way on Church street.\n\nBefore the council adjourned Mr. McPhail moved that the Town Council should have the power to purchase land for the purpose of widening the streets. Mr. Knowles said they had let him believe they would purchase a number of copies of the Saskatchewan Herald, but when the order was complete, it was now buried, he said, and that the Town would have to pay at least five cents per copy.\n\nIt was unanimously resolved that the Town Council may order the distribution of newspapers.\n\nThe Council then adjourned.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Rifle Association are making arrangements to have their new range in good repair for the meeting which takes place along the middle of the range in the Territories. The cup presented by D. H. Macdonald, Esq., M.P., will also be shot for in a separate match.\nA Dead Drop!\n\nPRICES\n\nJ. M.
