May I suggest that the requirement of the supplementary return be dispensed with, and that payment of the shortage be made upon the returns already in the possession of the Department? Hay River is quite a distance, and is beyond mail communication. Letters have to await the carriage of Hudson's Bay people or other traders. The requirement of a supplementary return would mean that payment could not be made until the first mail is received from Hay River next Summer. His Lordship has already stated, as you will observe on reference to the copy of his letter of the 29th ultimo which the Commissioner enclosed to you on the 10th instant, that the children were all at the school and had to be fed and cared for just the same as if they were attending the classes. It is quite evident from the returns and the correspondence that in this school the returns are made up from the registers kept in the class-room, in which failure to attend the class is noted as absence.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwould be very difficult in a country so circumstanced as Hay River to return the pupils to their homes when ill, indeed their illness would be an additional cause for keeping them in the institution where they can be properly cared for. I trust the Department will be able to concur in my suggestion and promptly meet the shortage in the payment to the Hay River school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 27th ultimo, in further reference to the payments made to the Church of England Boarding School at Hay River during the year 1902, and in reply I beg to say that in view of your statements as to the difficulty of obtaining supplementary returns to account for the shortage made in that year, the Department has forwarded a cheque covering the balance of the grant to the Rev. Dean Griswold, Winnipeg.\n\nAs this payment is irregular the supplementary returns will be required as soon as they can be conveniently obtained. The following statement shows how this balance is made up:\n\nBalance due Sept. Quarter /02 $248.40\n\" Dec. Quarter /02 110.40\n\" Mar.

Dean Griswold, Winnipeg. I am afraid this is not the proper address, as up to the present Mr. George Grisdale, of Winnipeg, was receiver of Government funds on behalf of the Bishop of McKenzie.\n\nAs to procuring supplementary returns, I will attend to same without delay, but it will take a considerable amount of time before they come to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 14th October, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant I beg to say that the mistake in the name of the payee of the cheque issued in favor of the Hay River boarding school, covering a balance due for the fiscal year 1902-3, was noticed immediately after the latter of the 3rd instant was sent you and a private note was sent the Assistant Indian Commissioner asking him to substitute the name of Rev. D. Grisdale for \"Griswold\" in that letter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.:\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending off to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs the Annual Report from School for the year ending June 30th/06, which has been waiting a chance to mail for some time since. I trust it will reach the Department in safety and be of interest. There is no regular mail going south from here after the 30th of June until December and as I know it would be too late for last year's publication I have taken my leisure and am sending it in time for this year. Owing to work at Midsummer, quite prevents my having it ready to send back with Mr. Courvoisier after treaty payment and that especially our only chance with winter.\n\nI received a circular in January from the Assistant Secretary dated October 25th/06, saying that a Cash Book and forms had been sent me and requesting that I shall keep a strict account of all receipts and expenditures in connection with our Mission. The Book and forms...\ncan hardly reach here before the 8th or 10th of July next when the new regular mail passes our door. I have to say that owing to the facts that there is but little cash in circulation in this locality, our being on the most Northern border of the Treaty Limit, and that all the settlements for goods bought, freight charges, for white help, children's passage etc., etc., are made by the Bishop of the Diocese, who resides at Athabasca Landing, which is more than nine hundred miles south of us, I am unable to give you even an approximate fair estimate of our expenses, which I know runs up somewhere between four and six thousand dollars annually. I have already written the Bishop on the matter and trust you will get some statement from him in the near future.\n\nI have been led to believe that the Government is likely to take over this work from the Mission Society. If such is the case I feel sure that the change will be for the good of the work which to my mind is a most promising one and well worth the expenditure if rightly directed.\n\nWe have always been cramped for want of sufficient means to fit up buildings and carry on the work as it really needs. We also bear under special disadvantages in having to secure all our necessary imported provisions in quantities large enough to meet all chance requirements of a whole year as there is no place within\nthree hundred miles from where we could possibly secure any considerable quantity of flour, bacon, beans, rice or any staple food, at any price, and the selling price in the country here is always well up to and beyond the high water mark of ordinary profits. In another particular we are peculiarly situated; to receive our goods in September we must order them previous December and anticipate every need for a year from the time when they are delivered. To be safe we have also to anticipate how many new scholars we can secure in the ensuing summer between the time that we write out our order and receive our goods. Some seasons we can only secure two or three and last summer we might have secured thirty had we been able to accommodate them, as it was we could only take eleven. Again our great isolation makes it very difficult to secure suitable men and women for moderate remuneration who are willing to endure the privations and lack of social enjoyments for years at a time. Our Missionary term holds us for five years unless in cases of broken health which is a long period to be bound to a ceaseless round of tedious toil with little or no diversion other than we can make for ourselves.\n\nI have taken the liberty of drawing your attention to these facts for your information and consideration in case the work is taken over by your Department. These are some of the things that are likely to be\nIV\n\noutlooked in the first instance and which are amongst the drawbacks with which we have yearly to contend and for which we have to prepare. For my part I am expecting to withdraw from the work this coming July after fifteen years service, owing chiefly to my wife's broken health which has been brought out to a very great extent by overwork and the anxious care of nine years in this Institute.\n\nHoping that the statement of these few facts may be of interest as well as some small value to your Department in planning for the future, in case you take the work over.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Principal)\nOttawa, April 23, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 15, last, with reference to the Hay River Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that the matters referred to therein will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

The receipt of it was acknowledged, and I was told that it would be brought forward in due course; but I have heard nothing more about it.\n\nI shall be thankful to hear from you re the above as soon as possible, and am\n\nvery sincerely yours,\n\nW. B. Reeve,\nBishop.\nOttawa, March 13, 1906.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 4th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the last payment to the Hay River Boarding School was for the quarter ended December 31, 1906. The cheque was for $354.00 and was sent on September 24, 1907, to Mr. George Griswold, Synod Office, Winnipeg, Man., to whom all cheques for this school have been sent.\n\nThe reason that the grant has not been paid since the above date is that the quarterly returns have not been received from this school. Upon receipt of the returns the grant will be promptly paid, but the Department can make no payment till the returns are received.\n\nThe matter of a grant for a school at Whitefish Lake will be dealt with in another letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sirs,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Both the Principal (Rev. T. Johnson) and the schoolmistress (Miss Fette) have left, but I understood from the latter that the returns up to June 30 had been sent as usual.\n\nIt will take a long time to get them now.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThey cannot be obtained until next September or October. I could, however, within a week or two obtain a list of the names of those who have been in regular attendance during the last year, or at all events during the first six months of this year, and perhaps under the circumstances, as we are badly in need of the grant, you would be willing to accept that. The returns for the last six months are probably now on the way. This I know is somewhat irregular, but next September is a long way off, and it will be doing us a favor if you can thus help us out of the difficulty.\n\nWith very kind regards, and great respect,\n\nI am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW. D. Reeve,\nBishop.\nOttawa, April 1, 1908.\n\nRight Reverend Sir\u2014\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 16th ult., in reference to the non-receipt of the quarterly returns from the Hay River Boarding school since December 31, 1906, and in reply I beg to inform you that, for the reasons stated in your letter, an advance on the grant due for the year 1907 is being sent you.\n\nI have to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to instruct the Principal to have the quarterly returns of this school from December 31, 1906, to March 31, 1908, forwarded to the Department at the earliest possible opportunity, so that any further amount of grant due can be paid. A supply of blank forms is sent you herewith to forward to the school, in order that the Principal can make out the returns in the manner called for by the Department.\n\nI beg also to forward you a return received for the September quarter, last, made out on a wrong form, on account of which the amount of grant due\n\nRight Rev. W. D. Reeves, D.D.,\nThe Alexandra,\nUniversity Ave., Toronto.\nfor the quarter cannot be computed, as the data furnished is insufficient.\n\nThe Principal should be instructed to forward in future all returns promptly at the first opportunity, as the Auditor General takes exception to grants being paid after the fiscal year in which the money for that purpose is voted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(Signed) J.

Reverend Bishop Stringer,\nC/o Rev. C. C. Owen,\nChrist Church Rectory,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDuring the year 1909 I visited Mackenzie River District as far North as the Arctic Coast, crossing over the mountains from Fort McPherson and going down the Porcupine River by way of Rampart House and Fort Yukon to Dawson.\n\nOn the way I was able in the month of July to visit Hay River School, and since that time I have had several reports from the Principal, Rev. A.J. Vale. I now desire to give the following brief report concerning the Indian Boarding School at Hay River:\n\nDuring 1908 - 1909 there were 35 children in attendance at the school, 15 boys and 20 girls. In addition there were 9 day pupils.\n\nIn 1909 - 1910 there were 38 boarders, 16 boys and 22 girls.\n\nThe health of the pupils has been uniformly good with the exception of a few minor ailments. No deaths have occurred in the school during the last two years - up to March 1910 which is the date of the latest news received. The management and discipline of the school seem good.\n\nThe children were taught with a view of their returning to their former homes in most cases. The practical side was therefore emphasized. The boys were given ample instruction in gardening and fishing. They were also given opportunities to learn properly the use of an axe and other tools used in carpentering.\nThe girls received practical instruction in cooking, sewing, housekeeping etc.\n\nOne of the teachers also gave instructions in wood carving, and several of the children made good progress in this art. The ordinary school work has of course been carried on regularly.\n\nI had occasion to notice the marked improvement shown in the cases of a number of children.\n\nOne young man who left the school last summer accompanied me on a winter journey from Fort McPherson to Rampart House. I observed that he had made good use of his term of schooling. He was moreover persevering in his endeavours to teach others.\n\nThe Hay River School has done good work, and under its present management continues to exert a beneficent influence, not only directly amongst the children, but also through them among the tribes to which they belong.\n\nIsaac O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon\n\nJune 4, 1910.\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDeputy Sup't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI wish to ask if the grant of $2000.00 towards Hay River Indian School, Mackenzie River District, was paid last year. If not would you please have it paid to the Imperial Bank, Athabasca Landing, to be placed to the credit of the account of the Diocese of Mackenzie River, which is held in the name of Archdeacon J.R. Lucas. I shall be glad if you will send me notice of the payment, and also notify Archdeacon Lucas at Fort Smith, Mackenzie River District.\n\nI enclose you herewith a short report of Hay River School which I visited last Summer. When in Ottawa about a year ago you asked me to send in a report concerning the school. Up to a short time ago I have been travelling ever since I was in Ottawa, and only now am I able to send you this statement.\n\nLast year you kindly gave a grant of $100.00 each for 20 pupils, or $2000.00 for the school. I wish to make application for a grant for 30 children at $100.00 per\ncapita, or $3000.00 in all.\n\nYou can readily understand that the expense of carrying on a school in a place like Hay River is great. We have to keep continually begging from friends to make ends meet. I think the school is well worthy of further support, and it would be a great relief if your department could increase the grant to at least $3000.00 per annum.\n\nI expect Bishop Holmes will visit Hay River this summer, and if you desire it he will be able to give further information concerning the progress of the school. I expect he will be back at Athabasca Landing by August.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon.\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant in reference to the grant earned by the Hay River Boarding School during the past fiscal year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that at the time of Your Lordship's visit to Ottawa last spring the question of an increased grant to boarding schools in the West was under consideration. The proposal then was to close the Elkhorn Industrial school and distribute the funds expended annually in its maintenance among the different boarding schools under the auspices of the Church of England. In this redistribution provision was made to pay a per capita grant for 20 pupils at the rate of $100.00 each at the Hay River school.\n\nThe Department was unable, however, to carry out the proposal to close the Elkhorn school and consequently the funds to increase the grant at Hay River and other schools were not available.\n\nA reference to official letter of May 4th, 1909, will show that the Department had in view the redistribution referred to above when Your Lordship was advised that an increased grant would be paid the Hay River school.\n\nIt is regretted very much that Your Lordship's\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer,\nBishop of Yukon,\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\nrequest could not under the circumstances be complied with, but you will readily recognize the impossibility of making an exception in the case of the Hay River school when there are other institutions operating under similar conditions.\n\nThe total earnings of this school for the nine months ended December 31st, 1959 were $1020.00. The grant for the June quarter was paid direct to the Principal, who acknowledged the same, while that for the September and December quarters was paid to His Lordship the Bishop of Athabasca. The earnings for the March quarter will be paid upon receipt of the usual quarterly return and the cheque will be sent, as directed, to the Ven. Archdeacon J. R. Lucas.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 3rd., 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith an Agreement, in duplicate, between Your Lordship and His Majesty the King, represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for the future maintenance and management of the Hay River Boarding School, and I have to request that you will be good enough to sign this document in the presence of a subscribing witness and affix your official seal, returning same to the Department at your earliest convenience, as this Agreement goes into effect on the 1st. of April next.\n\nOn the return of this document the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General will be affixed and one copy will then be returned to you. Certain alterations and improvements may be necessary at Hay River to bring the buildings up to the required standard. The Inspector of Treaty No. Eight when at Hay River during the coming summer making treaty payments will be instructed to inspect and report on the improvements needed. A reasonable time will be granted by the Department to allow you to have these improvements made, and in the meantime the increased per capita grant will be paid for 35 pupils at $126.00 from April 1st. next, provided this Agreement is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Frank Oliver,\nSept. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing upon your kind suggestion to no when we had the pleasure of meeting you, I am venturing to approach you regarding the grant allowed by the Indian Department to the Hay River Protestant Boarding School.\n\nHitherto the Department has given a grant of $75.00 for 20 pupils. This year, the grant was increased to $100.00 per capita.\n\nThe Pupilage has for some years reached a total of from 55 to 60. Taking the minimum number of children actually in residence the whole year round as Thirty-five (35), I would respectfully urge that the Grant from your Department should be so increased as to cover that number. This would involve a total outlay of $3500.00.\n\nThe children are drawn from the Chipewyan, Slave, Hare, & Tukudh, (or Loucheux) tribes.\n\nThe cost of the upkeep of this School is very great in consequence of the heavy freight charges on imported goods.\n\nYour Honor was pleased to warmly commend the farming operations undertaken by the staff at Hay River, assisted by the boys of the school.\n\nHoping your Department will extend its grant so as to cover a pupilage of Thirty-five (35) Boarders,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. R. Lucead\nArchdeacon & Diocesan Sec., Trois.\n\nThis seems to be met by the charge made in the School report. Since this letter was written.\n\nGeorge Athabasca.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 7th, 1911.\n\nEX'D.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to the enquiry of Archdeacon Lucas with reference to the Hay River School, I have to state that Your Lordship is correct in supposing that this School will benefit by the recent increase in the per capita grants. It was understood however that the Bishop of the Yukon had this school under his charge and the Contract for the Hay River School was forwarded to him for execution. I trust that this action was correct. If not, the mistake can be rectified. In the meantime the Hay River School will receive the increased grant from the 1st. of April under the prescribed conditions.\n\nIt is noticed that the attendance has been from 35 to 40 pupils, and if the building can accommodate that number under the new regulations I think we would be disposed to pay for the increased number, but it should be distinctly understood that there must be no overcrowding and that more pupils are not in the building than it can accommodate with a proper care for sanitation. Inspector Conroy will be asked to report on this phase of the subject when he is at Hay River next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Right Revd Geo. Holmes, D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca,\nAthabasca Landing, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nIn reference to the extract from a letter addressed to you by Mr. Alfred J. Vale, Principal of the Hay River Boarding School, Great Slave Lake, I beg to say that it is not the practice of the Department to acknowledge the receipt of quarterly school returns; the sending of a cheque for the earnings constitutes a receipt. Mr. Vale's return for the September quarter reached the Department on the 7th of February, last, and a cheque for the earnings due, amounting to $360.00, was sent on the 8th of that month to the Imperial Bank, Athabasca Landing, to be deposited to the credit of the McKenzie River Diocesan Fund, and the cheque was acknowledged by the Treasurer of the Diocese. The December quarter return has just come to hand and a cheque is being sent to the bank.\n\nWith regard to the school supplies. In September, 1909, a requisition for stationary was received and promptly filled. Some of the material did not reach the school till January 6th, 1910, and on that date the Principal acknowledged the receipt. Since that date there has only been one\nrequisition received. It came to hand on February 7th, last, and the Department has held it, as it is impossible to send in supplies by mail at this time of the year. The order will be sent to the Stationery Office shortly and the goods will go forward as soon as navigation opens.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSaint Peter Mission,\nLesser Slave Lake,\nAlberta.\n\nApril 10th, 1911\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 7th, 1911, I would say that the Ven. Archdeacon J.R. Lucas is in charge of the Diocese and School affairs. As regards the contract for the Hay River School, I would suggest that you send the document to Archdeacon Lucas, as he is on the spot and also in charge of the finances.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nBishop Holmes\n\nper W.H. Tackett (Act)\n\nP.S. The address of the Ven. Archdeacon J.R. Lucas is Fort Simpson, Mackenzie River.\n\nW.H.T.\nOttawa, May 6, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Lordship that the Department is advised that the agreement regarding the Hay River Boarding School forwarded to Your Lordship for execution should have been sent to His Lordship the Bishop of Athabasca. I would ask Your Lordship, therefore, to return it so that proper action may be taken.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of March 3rd which reached Dawson during my absence on a visit to a distant tribe of Indians. I wish to acknowledge also your enclosure of two copies of a Form of Agreement regarding Hay River Boarding School. Bishop Holmes is this year visiting Hay River and other places along the Mackenzie River route, and he has the oversight of Hay River for the time being, he and I having the supervision of Mackenzie River Diocese between us. However it is impossible to reach him till the Autumn, and in order that the matter may not be delayed, I am signing the two Forms of Agreement on his behalf as well as for myself, and herewith enclose them to you.\n\nIn signing this agreement I wish to bring to your notice several points in which some alteration seems to be required, or at any rate a liberal interpretation in the practical application of the rules.\n\nFirstly, in Section One, Sub-Section One in order that a per capita fee be obtained for twenty-five children, only one pupil for every twenty or fraction of twenty, is allowed to remain in the school at any one time. This would mean that only two extra could remain in the school at one time, or in other words, twenty seven is the maximum limit. You are probably aware that the children are received from many different points in the Northern District, and practically the only time that they can be brought to the school is for a short period in the Summer. Supposing twenty-seven are taken in during the Summer, and through an epidemic of illness or for any other reason, a number of them either die or have to be sent home, it may be practically impossible to procure other children till the following Summer. In the meantime the cost of the school is going on at almost the same rate as if the full number of children were in school, and the management is handicapped for lack of funds. The only remedy I can suggest, that in a remote school like Hay River the number of pupils allowed to remain at one time in excess of twenty-five should be increased.\n\nSecondly\u2014Under Section One, Sub-section Two (a) The rule regarding the school age of seven or over, if rigidly enforced, may be sometimes a hardship. It is our experience\nthat sometimes we are asked to take orphans, or children who have no one to care for them, and sometimes these may be under the age of seven, and yet it might be an advantage all around to receive them into the school. The maximum limit of twenty-seven children, however, might forbid this. If the management were permitted to receive children of five or at any rate six years of age, under exceptional circumstances, or were even allowed to receive such, without being counted in the matter of the excess number of pupils, it would I think be a reasonable relief.\n\nThirdly\u2014Section One, Sub-Section Four (a) requires that no child shall be admitted unless he or she be a duly enrolled member of Hay River band of Indians residing at Hay River and vicinity, Indians now under the supervision of H.A. Conroy Inspector Treaty No. 8. I am not sure how far North Mr. Conroy's inspector-ship extends. When I passed down the Mackenzie River in 1909, a number of Indians at Simpson, Wrigley, McPherson, Norman and other places, requested me to have their children taken to the school. The same is, I believe, true every year. The Boarding School was established for the purpose of providing the Indians connected with the Church of England in the whole of the Mackenzie River Diocese or District, and I thought that was the understanding with the Department. I think it is reasonable that the Northern Indians should have the advantage of the school even though not under a formal treaty. I trust you will find some way to overcome this disability.\n\nFourthly\u2014Section One, Sub-section four (b) states that no half-breed child shall be admitted unless permitted by the Supt. General, and that in any case, no grant shall be allowed for such child. It would seem reasonable that in a remote region like Mackenzie District, some latitude should be allowed the management in admitting such children as it is impossible as a rule to consult your Department beforehand. The Bishop or Archdeacon Lucas in the Annual Summer visits to the Coast, may be asked to take such children. Often there is no way of finding out beforehand what children are available, and at least a year would have to elapse if the consent of your Department must be first obtained. Then again some half-breed children are practically Indians, and in some cases also it might be a difficult task to prove whether a child were Indian or half-breed. I presume this rule would apply only to half-breed children, whose white parent is providing for his or her support.\nFifthly\u2014In Section Two Subsection One, certified returns are required for each quarter before the grant is paid. This regulation in the case of Hay River will cause a long delay especially at certain seasons of the year. I would suggest that the payments be made at least one quarter in advance. They could be based on the returns of the preceding quarter if it be found that these returns can reach Ottawa in a reasonable time.\n\nI can assure you that the management of the school will endeavor as far as possible to carry out the instructions of the Department. But I know you will recognize the difficulties with the Hay River school. I hope you will be able to give the matter special consideration, and that you will endeavor to give such relief from the strict reading of the general regulations as the circumstances require.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac A. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\n\nP.S.\u2014When you return me a signed copy of this agreement, will you also please send the blank copy to Bishop Holmes, addressed to Athabasca Landing, Alberta, so that he may receive it on his return from Mackenzie River in August. I expect to meet Bishop Holmes in London, Ontario, on the 6th of September. In the meantime, I shall be glad to hear from you regarding the above suggestions.\n\nL.O.S.\nOttawa June 9, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nIn reference to your Lordship's letter of the 11th ultimo, I have the honour to enclose herewith the duplicate agreement relating to the future maintenance and management of the Hay River Boarding school duly executed by the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIn reference to the several points in the agreement which you note, I beg to state in reference to the number of pupils for which the per capita grant is authorized, that if the building can accommodate a greater number of children under the requirements as called for by the new regulations, I think we would be disposed to pay for an increase in number, but it should be understood that there must be no overcrowding and that more pupils are not in the building than it can accommodate with proper care for sanitation. Mr Inspector Conroy has been instructed to report on this phase of the subject when he is at Hay River during the present summer.\n\nThe regulation regarding the age of admission will be adhered to. The Department cannot pay the grant for any pupil under seven years of age.\n\nThe clause in the agreement limiting the recruiting ground to Hay River and vicinity has been changed to include the Indian bands residing in the MacKenzie River.\n\nRight Rev. I.O.Stringer, D.D.\nBishop of Yukon\nDawson, T.T.\nDiocese. The Department must adhere to its ruling that no grant will be paid for halfbreed children.\n\nAn Indian agent has recently been appointed for the district embracing Hay River, and no difficulty or loss of time should be occasioned to the school authorities by the requirement of the Department that all quarterly returns and applications for the admission of pupils be certified before transmission to the Department.\n\nA blank copy of the agreement will be forwarded to His Lordship, Bishop Holmes for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary\nOttawa June 9, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir-\n\nAt the request of His Lordship the Right Reverend Issac O. Stringer, Bishop of the Yukon, I have the honour to enclose herewith for your information a copy of the agreement between His Majesty the King represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and Bishop Stringer relating to the future maintenance and management of the Hay River Boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Correspondence was had with His Lordship Bishop Stringer, who was informed that the Department would be disposed to pay for an increased number of pupils at this institution provided the accommodation is adequate. Mr. Inspector Conroy has been instructed to report fully as to this accommodation after his visit to the school this summer and should his report show that they have sufficient class-room and dormitory space I think we should grant an increase in the pupilage from 25 to 35.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAthabasca Landing,\nAlberta.\n\nAug. 7th, 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of June 9th, File No. 170 367-1, addressed to Bishop Holmes, and enclosing copy of agreement as indicated in your letter, has been forwarded to me.\n\nBishop Holmes is away at present travelling in Mackenzie River Diocese, but he is expected to return in about three weeks time, when I shall have pleasure in submitting your letter to him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchdeacon.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\nJuly 10, 1911\n\nChurch Missionary Society\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to thank you for your letter of March 27, referring to the grant made to the Hay River Boarding School.\n\nWith regard to the future management and maintenance of the above school, we shall endeavor to carry out the conditions called for under the terms of the Agreement with your Department, to the utmost of our ability.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear dear Sir,\n\nI am sincerely,\n\nJas R.

Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to the Quarterly Returns of the Hay River Boarding School, I beg respectfully to point out that hitherto such Returns have been signed by the Clergyman in charge of the Mission. According to the Agreement made with the Right Rev. I.G. Stringer by the Indian Department, dated April 1st, 1911, I note that the Returns ought to be signed by the Indian Agent.\n\nI have instructed the Principal of the Hay River school to forward the Returns to Mr. A.J. Bell, the Indian Agent at Fort Smith, N.W.T. for certification.\n\nAs Mr. Bell lives 250 miles distant from the school, he has not been able to visit it, and therefore has no direct knowledge of the management, but as the instruction given in the Agreement is plain, we shall conform to it unless otherwise advised by your Department.\n\nI am,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchdeacon.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report upon the condition of the Indian (Anglican) Boarding School at Hay River, Great Slave Lake, which I visited on September 6th and 7th, also upon September 9th and 10th, accompanied by Dr A.McDonald, the Department's Medical Officer.\n\nThis School is under the immediate charge of the Rev. A. J. Vale, with Miss Page as Matron.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe Buildings, which are of Log, are situated upon the river bank at the mouth of Hay River, and are surrounded by a large garden, in which a variety of vegetables and flowers are successfully grown, showing no signs of frost at the date of my visit.\n\nPupils\n\nThere are 25 pupils receiving the Government Grant.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThe accommodation appears to be somewhat cramped, but is sufficient for the needs of the above stated number; there are, however, a staff of older boys and girls, who are retained as house and farm helpers, who should have more accommodation provided for them.\n\nThe children all look healthy and bright; I examined their handwriting, which is excellent and asked them, individually, a number of\nquestions; their replies were most intelligent and they have evidently been well taught.\n\n**Health and Sanitation**\n\nThere was one child ill; Dr Macdonald, who examined her, stated that there was nothing serious the matter.\n\nThe water supply is not as good in the fall as it should be; the samples observed contained Anamolae in large numbers. The river from which it is taken is very sluggish at this point and vegetable matter appears to accumulate in it. I would recommend that the drinking water for the establishment be brought from Great Slave Lake, which is a comparatively short distance from the School, this should at least be done during the summer months.\n\n**General**\n\nI am informed by the Rev. Mr Vale that arrangements are being made for the erection of additional accommodation. The building at present occupied as his dwelling and the staff mess-house has a portion, which, when completed, can be used for isolation purposes in case of contagious disease occurring.\n\nMuch outdoor relief appears to be given to the Indians by Mr Vale in the way of medicines etc., and both he and Miss Page and Miss LeRoy, who constitute the present staff are doing excellent work.\n\nAn additional teacher is required as the male teacher employed left this summer.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.

A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of today, asking what stock the Hay River boarding school has on hand, I beg to say that they have one stallion, one steer, two cows and a couple of young stock. They were cultivating the ground, and working the potato crop with the horse, apparently successfully. They had between seven and eight acres broken, which was put under crop. They raise a large quantity of potatoes and a fair amount of garden truck. The new building is under construction, and should, I think, be finished this year. The curriculum follows along the lines prescribed by the Department, besides which considerable attention is given to outside work which will be useful to the scholars later on. Discipline is excellent. Heating and ventilation arrangements were as satisfactory as the old building would allow, and adequate fire protection was installed. The water supply is excellent and easily accessible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Conroy -\n\nWhat will it cost to supply this school with a yoke of oxen?\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nTwo 4 year old steers, of about 1400 lbs. would cost not less than $250.00; I might get cheaper stock, but it would not pay. They would not be serviceable, and the freight is so expensive that it is better to send in the stock that will be of the best use. They could be sent to the end of steel for about $50.00, and then it would cost not less than $225. from McMurray to Hay River.\n\nThis would bring the total cost to\n\n| Cost of animals | $250.00 |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Freight         | $275.00 |\n\n$525.00\n\nInspector Treaty 6.\nOttawa, February 29, 1916.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nWith reference to the cost of supplying a pair of oxen to the Hay River Mission, I am of the opinion that the estimate quoted hereunder is approximately correct, but there would be a considerable risk at the present time in delivering these animals in good order at their destination. From my own knowledge of the conditions at Hay River I am of the opinion that the interests of the Mission would best be served by postponing the departure of these animals until such time as the transportation facilities have become improved on the Peace River and Slave River sections; the journey is long and has considerable attendant risks, and it would not seem to me to be wise to forward these animals when there does not seem to be a pressing need for them.\n\nH.J. Bury\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWhen Bishop Lucas was here last week, I discussed this matter with him, and he thought it would be well to wait until the railway reached McMurray and not to send the oxen in until next year.\n\nD.

I hope you will extend this help to us in the case of those whom I took to Hay River last year, and of the four who have gone there this Summer, all of whom were medically examined.\n\nI shall be pleased to know also that this help will be continued in the future.\n\nHoping you will give the above your most favourable consideration,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nJas R Lucas.\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\nDiocese of Mackenzie River\n\nJuly 13th, 1916.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is a matter I wish to bring to your notice concerning the conveyance of Indian children to the Hay River Boarding School.\n\nThe above school serves the whole of the Anglican Diocese of Mackenzie River, and the children attending it are brought from their homes by steamer at distances ranging from 250 to 1200 miles. This involves the Mission in a very heavy expenditure yearly for fares. I venture to approach your Department therefore with the view of obtaining help towards meeting this heavy and inevitable outlay, and would respectfully call your attention to the following:\n\nThese children are in several cases, orphans, and even when such is not the case, their parents are unable to defray the expense of sending them to the school.\n\nThe children are all promised to the school for periods ranging from five years and upwards, so that the expense incurred would not be asked for in any particular case under that time.\n\nNo child has been taken to the school for many years past without having been thoroughly inspected and examined by the Government Doctor. This precaution, I consider, is of the utmost importance, and as a consequence we have enjoyed a perfectly complete bill of health, and immunity from death.\n\nIt has been reported to me that the fares of some children who\nwere sent to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Fort Providence last year, were paid by the Indian Department through your Agent at Fort Simpson. I hope you will extend this help to us in the case of those whom I took to Hay River last year, and of the four who have gone there this Summer, all of whom were medically examined.\n\nI shall be pleased to know also that this help will be continued in the future.\n\nHoping you will give the above your most favourable consideration,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nJas R Lucas.\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application from the Right Rev. J. R. Lucas, Bishop of Mackenzie River, for a refund of the expenses incurred in taking children to the Hay River Boarding School I beg to say that the Bishop bases his claim on the increased cost of maintenance and management of the school and states that it has been reported that the fares of some children who were sent to the Roman Catholic boarding school at Fort Providence last year were paid by the Department.\n\nI can only find that the fares were paid in one instance for a girl going to this school, that was from Fort Simpson to Providence and amounted to $5.50.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Bury about this matter and he does not think the Department should assume responsibility for the transport of any of these pupils, as there are plenty of children in the vicinity of the schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 23, 1916.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 13th ultimo asking the Department to pay the expenses incurred in taking children to the Hay River Boarding school and stating that it has been reported to Your Lordship that the fares of some children who were sent to the Roman Catholic boarding school at Fort Providence last year were paid by the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot pay the cost of the transport of any children to these schools. I may inform Your Lordship that through an oversight last year the fare of one girl going from Fort Simpson to Providence was paid, but this will not be done again.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(Anglican.)\n\nAt the time of my visit to Hay River the new school building was in process of erection. As will be seen by the photograph it is a commodious structure and compared with the old building is a great improvement. It is expected that the new school will be ready for occupancy about the month of June next.\n\nUp to the present time the school work has been considerably handicapped owing to the lack of accommodation.\n\nThe measurements of the school are 94 ft. x 30 ft. and it will be two storeys in height.\n\nThe usual classes were held during my stay at Hay River and I was especially struck with the proficiency of the pupils in reading and writing. Several Eskimo children receive tuition here and exhibit great aptitude for learning.\n\nThe class work was generally well up to the standard and the boys appeared to thoroughly enjoy their outside work. The pupils, both boys and girls, appear singularly healthy and vigorous.\n\nI was able to secure from the school principal a Mr. A. J. Vale, a statement or record of the doings of ex-pupils of the school. This statement is attached.\n\nSgd. H. J.

R. Lucas, D.D.,\nBishop.\n\nThe Hon. Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is with much pleasure I have to report that the new Indian Boarding School at Hay River, Great Slave Lake, N.W.T., is now completed, and was formally opened by me on June 28th, last.\n\nIt has since been visited by Inspector H.A. Conroy of Ottawa and G. Card, Esq., the Indian Agent living at Fort Smith, and in whose district the school is situated. They have probably presented their reports to your Department. I beg to enclose three photos of the building but hope to obtain better ones for you during my next visit.\n\nI am also enclosing a list of children at present in the school, who are eligible for the Indian Department's Per Capita Grant as from July 1st, 1917. All these children have been medically examined, and the list itself scrutinized by Mr. Conroy with the one exception of Oso, Elsie Edward, who arrived at the school by a later trip.\n\nIn addition to the 42 names of children thus given, there are three others under six years of age, concerning whom Mr. Conroy has promised to report to you. I trust your Department will consent to give the per capita Grant for these also, as they are orphans, and on account of their tender age require more care and attention than those who are older.\n\nMay I be allowed to express my gratitude to your Department\nfor the ready and generous help it has given in connection with the supply of equipment for the new school, and the hope that all may result in an increase of usefulness and benefit to the Indian Children who may be sheltered within its walls.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\nOttawa, September 21, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a list of the children at present in attendance at the Hay River Boarding School and who are eligible to receive the per capita grant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the building at this school has now been completed and furnished, the Department will provide a grant for 45 pupils from the first of July last, an increase of 20 in the number for which the grant was previously paid. The admission of the 42 children, whose names and register numbers are given, is approved. The Department cannot, however, allow any grant for the three orphan children mentioned by you, as they are under the age limit for admission as grant earning pupils.\n\nThe Department concurs in the hope expressed by Your Lordship, that the new boarding school at Hay River may result in an increase of usefulness and benefit to the Indian children who may be sheltered within its walls.\n\nI have to thank you for the three photographs of the building which were enclosed in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRight Rev.

Will you kindly let me know how it came that you were not able to give any service to the school at this trying time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. L.

In July we received by SS \"Mackenzie River\" a little girl from Arctic Red River who was reported to be suffering from Diphtheria - the whole of the new pupils were isolated in the Isolation Hospital (built last summer) - the little girl placed in a tent with a nurse. The new pupils, however, were infected and had to stay in the hospital six weeks. They were cleaned up - all things burned - and moved over to the large school. One week later it was found that the Indian girl that had been helping Mrs. Hunter (nurse) had the disease - the school was quarantined - no one being allowed to visit from the village. In all forty-three (43) boys and girls had the complaint. Through the faithful work of Mrs. Hunter and the Matrons, assisted by Mrs. Bowring (a trained nurse) no deaths occurred from the disease, though all were worn out by the tremendous strain.\n\nDr. MacDonald visited us, but could not stay as requested.\n\nI have to report the death of one pupil from Laryngitis. At present all the pupils are exceptionally well. The strict quarantine regulations kept the disease from spreading to the village. The rooms are splendidly ventilated - the furnaces are a great success - each boy and each girl has a separate bed - and all are cheerful and happy.\n\nWater is supplied from Hay River and the Great Slave Lake.\n\nGeorge W. Bowring.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour letter of April 13th received June 2nd. Re the outbreak of diphtheria at Hay River Mission. I beg to enclose the following extract of the latter from my report to the department dated Aug 18, 1917.\n\nThe \"hasty party\" arrived at Hay River on the 18th July and met the S.S. Mungo River on her way back from Fort McPherson. She had on board several children for the mission school at Hay River, and one of the children, a little girl, had been isolated on board the boat for diphtheria. She was in charge of Dr. Doyle of the R.M.W.M.C. at Fort McPherson, and Mrs. Hunter, one of the staffs of the Hay River Mission, who was on board took charge of the patient as nurse. On their arrival here the patient seemed quite recovered from the disease, but as a precaution I advised that all the children should be isolated from the children at Hay River, and as they have an isolation building separated from the school and the immediate surrounding buildings, it suited the purpose well as an isolation hospital. Mrs Hunter undertook to look after the case of the patient and the whole number until past time as all danger of the disease was over. All precautions were taken, and instructions given as to the care of treatment of the patients in case it should break out again. The patient at no time had...\nbeen seriously sick, although the wound showed quite a patch of false membrane at first.\n\nMr. Inspector Conroy, who was also on board, instructed me to proceed down to Fort Simpson as there was an Indian brought up from Fort Norman to the hospital at Simpson suffering from a diseased foot; which in his opinion required to be amputated to save his life, he however had to return to Fort Resolution to finish up paying treaty to a portion of the Indians who were not present when treaty was paid them a few days ago. They were delayed by ice so could not get into the fort in time.\n\nBoard the H.M.S. Northland at Resolution the night of July 24th and arrived at Hay River on the 26th. Two more patients had developed the disease (two more of the children which were brought up from the lower Mackenzie district.) The cases were of a mild form but distinctly diphtheritic in character. They were responding favourably to the treatment ordered except not suffering very much.\n\nProceeded to Simpson & arrived there on July 30th where I found the Indians on Blythe Francis aged 65 years suffering from cancer of the foot. Amputated the foot returned to Hay River arriving there on Aug 6th Mr. Hunter informed me that already 14 of the children had died of diphtheria, up to that date out of the 17 annuals there were now only three more which had not been affected so far. They were all recovering nicely. No complications following they were all to be kept in isolation until all danger\ncommunication of the disease was ever before they will be allowed among the other children in the school. Most of their clothing will be destroyed and they will be thoroughly disinfected and all precautions taken to confine the disease.\n\nThere were no deaths following the outbreak, and I know nothing that I could do further than what was done. I trust the above explanation will be satisfactory.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S.

I mentioned having heard the report that the fares of some children who had been sent to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Fort Providence had been paid by the Department through your Agent at Fort Simpson, and expressed the hope that you would extend the favour to us.\n\nIn your reply of August 23rd, 1916, No. 170367, you stated that the Department could not pay the cost of transport of any child to the schools, that it was through an oversight the fare of a child going to Providence was paid but it would not be done again.\n\nI regret to trouble you again on this matter, but last July (1918), I was informed by your Agent of Fort Simpson, himself, that the Department was paying the fares of the children who were going up to the Providence School. He stated this quite frankly and openly to me in the presence of Inspector H.A. Conroy, and seemed surprised that I was not receiving the same benefit. These being the facts, I feel I must again bring the matter to your notice in the hope that you extend to us the help asked for as in the case of the children attending the Roman Catholic Schools in the Mackenzie River District.\n\nI am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n170, 367-1\n\nOttawa, February 27, 1919.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the Rt. Rev. J. R. Lucas's letter of January 18, last, regarding the transportation of Indian children to the schools, I beg to say that, if the Department pays such fares in the Mackenzie district for one mission, I would recommend that they pay them for the other mission as well.\n\nInspector, Treaty No. 8.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nOn referring to the Fort Providence Mission school file I find that the Department paid for the transport of eleven children from Fort Good Hope, two from Fort Macpherson and one from Arctic Red River to that school, amounting in all to $349.00. These children were rounded up by the Royal Northwest Mounted Police and their transport was paid for out of the vote for destitute Indians.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company have sent in an account for the transport of the children referred to by Bishop Lucas from Fort Macpherson to Hay River, amounting to $218.25.\n\nI agree with Mr. Conroy that the Hay River School is entitled to the same consideration as was shown to the Fort Providence school, and the schools can hardly be expected to pay the cost of bringing pupils from such a distance, if it is necessary that they be taken in.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 14, 1919.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 13th of January, last, enclosing an account for $218.25, covering the cost of the transportation of Indian children from Fort McPherson to the Hay River Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that this account is being paid, and a cheque for the amount is being sent to the Imperial Bank, South Edmonton, Alta., for deposit to the credit of the Diocese of Mackenzie River.\n\nThe Department considers that there should be sufficient children available without going to such remote points for recruits.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lucas, D.D.,\nBishop of Mackenzie River,\nBishop's House,\nChipewyan, Alta.\nDiocese of Mackenzie River.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your letter of March 14, informing me that your Department had forwarded a cheque to the Bank for $218.25, to cover the cost of the transportation of children from Fort McPherson to the Hay River School.\n\nIn reply to your observation that the Department considers there should be sufficient children available without going to such remote points for recruits, I would respectfully say, that after very careful consideration, the school has been established in the only place where fish and potatoes can be procured in sufficient quantities to ensure an adequate supply of food for a large number of children. Also, that if a School were established further North, the increase of freight charges on all imported food and material would throw a much heavier burden of expense upon the Department and Mission for equipment and maintenance.\n\nI might add that the Roman Catholics who have a larger number of children to consider, have no School further North than Providence which is only 80 miles from Hay River, and they gather recruits from Arctic Red River only 35 miles distant from Fort McPherson, whence our children were drawn.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJas R.

I wish to advise Mr. Vale as early as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames R. Lucas\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\nOttawa, April 24, 1920\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 21st instant, enquiring in regard to the quarterly returns of the St. Peter's Boarding School at Hay River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the September return for that school was received on March 24th, last, but the December quarter return has not yet been received. The grant due for the September quarter amounts to $1,586.66. The Department has already made an advance of $2,000.00 on the September and December quarters and in addition the sum of $319.80 has been paid the Militia Department for supplies purchased for the school.\n\nI would be pleased to receive the December and March quarter returns at an early date so that the balance of grant due the school may be paid.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Rev.

I have noted the matter for the 1923-24 Estimates.\n\nThe Bishop also asked for an increased pupilage.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to Ottawa I discussed with\nthe Superintendent of Indian Education, the question of an\nincreased per capita grant for the school at Hay River, but\nwas informed that this could not be done without placing on\nthe Department the additional financial responsibility of\nincreasing the per capita grant for other schools belonging\nto other religious bodies in the McKenzie River valley.\nWhile it is not the desire of our Society to add unnecessarily\nto the heavy financial burden already being borne by your\nDepartment, I should like to make it quite clear that the\npresent per capita grant of $145. for the Hay River School,\nplus $20. bonus, is not sufficiently large in the opinion of\nour Society, to help to meet the requirements of this School,\nand I have been requested to refer this question to you for\nfurther consideration.\n\nFor your information I may state that our Society,\non assuming responsibility for the maintenance and administra-\ntion of this School from Jan. 1st of this year, has been\nobliged to meet a deficit of over $2,600., and as the estimate,\nsubmitted by Bishop Lucas, for operating this School for the\ncurrent year, leaves our Society liable to a grant of nearly\n$4,000., you will see how serious the situation is from our\npoint of view.\n\nCommending this matter to your favourable consideration,\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nTRW/PEO.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Feb. 26, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you request an increased per capita grant for the Hay River Indian Boarding School.\n\nI wish to assure you that careful thought has been given to this matter, and I regret to state that, until Parliament provides funds for a general increase in per capita grants to all Indian residential schools, favourable consideration cannot be given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

September 23, 1924.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nThe Board of Management M.S.C.C. at the annual meeting last week, gave very careful consideration to the tentative proposals which have been laid before you with regard to:\n\n1. The educational and medical needs of the Anglican Indians and Eskimo of the MacKenzie River Delta, and the adjoining Arctic Coast.\n\n2. The future, in relation to the foregoing, of the existing Hay River Residential School.\n\nThe Board decided:\n\n1. That the pressing need is the provision of a residential school for Eskimo, with a small hospital attached; the same to be located at Herschel Island or some other suitable point on the Arctic Coast.\n\n2. That the existing Hay River School should remain at its present general location.\n\nI am leaving this evening to attend, at London, Ont., the Triennial Session of our General Synod. On the conclusion of the latter, in about ten days time, I shall hope to visit Ottawa and consult you, personally, on the above important decision of the Board of Management.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\nMay 29, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nMr. Moran, of the Northwest Territories Branch, Department of the Interior, has shown me their files with reference to hospital wings in the Fort Resolution and Hay River Indian Residential Schools. That Department has refused to designate these schools as hospitals; the Department of Health having advised them that it would be \"an extremely dangerous situation to set up. Children are potential subjects of all of the infectious diseases, and having such a focus near a school seems to me to be contrary to all the recognized principles of health protection. I certainly think a hospital (separate building) is required and should be insisted upon.\" On these grounds, the Interior Department are not paying grants for the hospitalization of patients being treated at the Fort Resolution or Hay River Indian Residential Schools.\n\nOur Department is allowing grants for patients at both schools (Files Nos. 74-139 and 50-139). The Department has written to Dr. Bourget, the Indian agent, regarding the advisability of keeping a patient with an infectious disease at the Hay River School. As a matter of policy, should we allow hospital patients in our residential schools? There is no question but what the authorities of the school were prompted solely by charity, as they have kept this patient for 24 years without grant.\n\nI presume that the Interior Department will probably cooperate with us in the provision of funds and in the erection of hospitals which may be found necessary in the Northwest Territories. The present discussion leads me to believe that a hospital, to be conducted either under Protestant or State auspices, should be established at Hay River, where the land is suitable for gardening. Further, it appears that Fort Resolution requires a hospital and this fact was brought to our attention by His Lordship Bishop Breynat in October, 1923 (134-4-5). There is a physician at Resolution but not at Hay River. Bishop Breynat's scheme was a combined residential school and hospital, which was changed eventually and which would certainly not be a proper arrangement.\n\nIf funds are provided by either the Department of the Interior or this Department, or by both, the Department of Health would submit plans for suitable buildings.\n\nThis memorandum has been written, following Mr. Moran's visit, in the interests of the health of the Indian children in residential schools and in the interests of all members of communities who require hospital treatment.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 1, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that this Department and the Department of the Interior have compared reports which have been received from the Bay River Indian Residential School and I regret to state that there has been duplication of the grants.\n\nThe Department of the Interior has been paying a grant of $400 per annum for the conduct of a day school for children that are not wards of the Indian Department. This grant is conditional upon the regular attendance of such children, and it is my duty to point out that on the list of names directed to the Interior Department there are not ten who are not enrolled as pupils of the Bay River Indian Residential School.\n\nMore serious than this has been the duplication of maintenance grants in the case of three Stockerson children. The Department of the Interior has been allowing maintenance grants since April 1st, 1923, and their names have also been included on the returns to this Department and our grant has been allowed for the June and September quarters, 1923. These three names were included on all subsequent quarterly returns showing the enrolment at the Indian residential school; but, as the average attendance was more than 50 in each quarter - and grant paid for only 50 - it cannot be said that there was duplication of grants since October first, 1923.\n\nI feel that an explanation for this action is due to the Department. The geographical situation of this school makes it difficult for us to refuse to admit children when applied for by the Rev. Principal on the grounds that they are not wards of this Department and therefore ineligible. We have to rely on the school management to deal fairly, and the facts mentioned in this letter are such that I feel our confidence has been misplaced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It is possible, of course, that when the Department of the Interior undertook to make this grant to the Diocese of Mackenzie River, this condition was imposed, and that our Society was not informed of its existence at the time that the school was transferred to its control. I have examined all available correspondence in this connection, but having failed to locate any mention of this condition, I am writing to the Diocesan authorities, and also to the Department of the Interior for further information in this connection.\nWhen this information has come to hand I will communicate with you again.\n\nIn the meantime I beg to state that as this grant was payable by the Department of the Interior upon receipt of their own official forms which contained full information from the Principal about the pupils who were receiving this tuition, I am at present unable to understand how those responsible for the management of the School could be thought to have acted unfairly.\n\n(2) With regard to the receipt of a maintenance grant from both your Department and the Department of the Interior for the Storkersen children for the June and September quarter of 1923, I have to inform you that no maintenance grant was received by our Society in this connection from the Department of the Interior before April of the present year. That grant did indeed cover maintenance for these children as from April 1st 1923, but as it has so recently been sanctioned and received, I am unable to understand how it could be thought that those responsible for the management of this School have been acting unfairly.\n\nThis School, as you are no doubt aware, did not come under the control of our Society until January 1st, 1923, and as the instruction which has been given to the Principals of all of our Society's Schools, to furnish me with a copy of their quarterly returns to your Department, did not come into operation at the Hay River School until after my visit to that institution in July and August of 1923. I am not in possession of the information which those forms contained for the March, June and September quarters of that year. The grants paid by you, however, and the number of children on the returns forwarded to you for the June Quarter 1923, and up to the end of the December Quarter 1924, so far as I have received them, are as follows:\n\n| Quarter | Year | Average attendance for which grant was paid | No of pupils on Register |\n|---------|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| June    | 1923 | 48.82                                      | (not available)          |\n| Sept.   | 1923 | 46.53                                      | (not available)          |\n| Dec.    | 1923 | 50.                                        | 57                       |\n| March   | 1924 | 50.                                        | 57                       |\n| June    | 1924 | 50.                                        | 56                       |\n| Sept.   | 1924 | 50.                                        | 63                       |\n| Dec.    | 1924 | 50.                                        | 58                       |\n\nFrom these figures it is quite clear that your Department was not providing our Society with a maintenance grant for any pupils over the sanctioned number of 50 for the period mentioned, and as the grant from the Department of the Interior has but recently been sanctioned and paid, it is obvious that the maintenance expenses of all pupils above that\nnumber, were being met from another source, namely from the funds of our Society.\n\nHad our Society been receiving a regular quarterly maintenance grant from your Department for more than 50 pupils for the period in question, and at the same time another regular quarterly maintenance grant from the Department of the Interior for any pupils over this number, our integrity might justly have been questioned. In the light, however, of the information which I have set forth in this letter, and it is the only information which I have available at present, I see no reason why it should be questioned, and the facts as I have given them will, I believe, fully vindicate it.\n\nSince receiving your letter I have written to the Principal of the Hay River School requesting him to furnish me with copies of the returns he forwarded to your Department for the March, June and September Quarters 1923, and when these have come to hand I will communicate with you again.\n\nIn the meantime, and before closing this letter, I should like to state that if there is any further information which you desire, and which you think I may be able to furnish, I shall gladly forward the same on receipt of your request.\n\nI should also like to state that, in a work such as this in which we are engaged, where so many numerous details have to be attended to, and where distances between our respective centres are so vast as to prohibit more frequent meetings for conference and counsel, misunderstandings such as this one now before us, are very liable to arise. But these should not, I think, be allowed to affect our confidence in each other, and I very much hope that the explanations which have been set forth in this letter may furnish you with an assurance that your confidence in those responsible for the management of the Hay River School has not been misplaced.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nWith very good wishes,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nTORONTO, ONT., June 13th, 1925.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Westgate, in accordance with our standing arrangements, has forwarded to me a copy of a letter to him (No. 139-2-1) dated June 2nd, from Mr. J.D. McLean, Assistant Deputy Secretary, together with copy, dated June 9th, of his reply to the same.\n\nThe tone of Mr. McLean's letter, together with his charge of unfair action, and by implication, of deliberate dishonesty, on the part of the \"school management\" of the Hay River Indian Residential School, reflect so severely upon the honour of the Church that I have no course open before me than to refer the same to you for your kind consideration, and such action as, I trust, will remove from the management of the Indian Residential Schools administered by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, all charges and imputations of unfair tactics or dealings in the financial relationships existing between the Church, as represented by the Missionary Society, and your Department.\n\nWhile, as noted in Dr. Westgate's reply, the matter under discussion, will be carefully followed up and investigated; I feel that the facts and considerations set out in that reply, are such as to immediately clear the \"school management\" of the charges or imputations made in Mr. McLean's letter, and such, I trust, as will enable you to take the action which I very respectfully, but officially, request.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, June 17, 1925.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to official communication of the 2nd concerning the Hay River Indian Residential School. I hasten to assure you that the letter in question was unfortunately worded and that the Department certainly did not intend to leave the impression that there is not the fullest confidence in your Society. When this communication was prepared, the Department was aware that the responsibility for the returns rested, of course, with someone at Hay River; and the only reason that the Rev. Principal was not addressed was the expressed wish of your Society to have critical letters directed to the general office. It was expected that Dr. Westgate would ask the school management at Hay River to furnish an explanation, and the officers of this Department regret exceedingly the misunderstanding which must not in any way destroy our confidence in each other or affect our cordial relationships.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

He will return to Toronto in the Fall and you can easily get in touch with him and the whole situation I am pers aded will be made quite clear and show we have not attempted to misrepresent the pupilage at this school and the attendance has been rendered according to instructions.\n\nUntil receipt of your letter I was not aware of any irregularity I have made out the Report for the last Quarter ending June 30th had it signed by the agent and am sending it with this.

Finnie, Esq.,\nDirector,\nNorth West Territories.\n\nDear Mr. Finnie:\n\nAs the time we may have together during your visit to Hay River may be very limited, I have written down in brief statement an answer to your letter of enquiry.\n\nAccording to a letter received from the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa, there appears to be some confusion regarding the names sent in our reports to your Department and to his.\n\nI have in each case reported all the names on the Register in the Class Room. That was done according to the instructions given me by Bishop Lucas.\n\nWhile in your Office in March 1924 you very kindly told me arrangements had been made to pay for the Half Breed and other destitute children in this part. I then informed you we were already in receipt of such from the Department of Indian Affairs. You expressed pleasure that such was the case. On my arrival in Winnipeg May 1924 I told Dr. Westgate of the application for a grant for the Storkerson Children in addition to the Grant allowed for 50 children in our school as we had more than that number in residence at the time. This led to considerable correspondence, as there appeared to be some difficulty to locate certain Blank Forms to be filled in before such a grant could be made. Unfortunately some part of this correspondence took place during my absence on furlough and I could not get the necessary Blanks in time to forward same to you and to Dr. Westgate at Winnipeg.\n\nDuring the interval consumed by this correspondence under our limited Mail Service much time...\nwent bye. Our School met with a serious loss of six pupils by death and in one of my letters to Rev. Dr. Westgate I advised him, the number now would not total the number allowed by the Indian Department namely 50 pupils, and in order that the full number might be retained I told him of my action in putting the names of the Sterkerson Children again on the list for the Grant from the Department of Indian Affairs. This I think was in the Spring of 1925 or late winter. Up till that time the only information I had was to the effect they could not receive the Grant from the North West Territory until the Blanks had been filled out and been received in Ottawa.\n\nIn the meantime a letter was sent to me saying the Grant had, through the kindness of your Office, been allowed on the Understanding such Blank would be forth coming in due time. The Blanks have since been sent and I understand a grant was made.\n\nI sincerely regret any confusion my action may have led to, and at the same time desire to assure you I have faithfully tried to carry out to the best of my ability the instructions received from all Parties concerned both in Ottawa and Dr. Westgate in Winnipeg.\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Alfred J. Vale\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 17, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the pupils at the Hay River Residential School for whom this Department should pay grant, it has been learned that you have informed the Department of the Interior you are not sending the Indian Department to pay grant for #038, Martina Storkerson; #039, Ada Storkerson; #062, Essie Storkerson; and #60, Charles Cassell and that you have recently applied to that Department for grant for #028, Polly Carter. The names of the above five children have, therefore, been struck off the June quarter return received from the Hay River School and their names should not appear on future returns to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWe understand that an adjustment, made necessary by the duplication of grant for the June and September quarters, 1925, will be made by the Department of the Interior.\n\nIt is noted that #049, Margaret McDonald; #072, Violet Cardinal; #076, Annie Fitzgerald; #46, Alfred Horn; #47, Henry Horn; #66, Richard Blake; and #67, Edward Blake, are stated to be half-breeds. This Department has a ruling which permits the admission as grant-earning pupils to Indian residential schools of those half-breeds who are living the Indian mode of life with Indian communities. If you do not ask the Interior Department to pay grants for these seven children, you should forward to me applications and certificates of health for them, also full particulars regarding where they have been living, in order that this Department can decide if these children come within the terms of the ruling regarding the admission of half-breeds. In the meantime, we are allowing the grant requested for them on the June quarter return.\n\nIn future, when a child is presented for admission, you should forward an application to whichever Department you believe should be responsible for his maintenance. If it is found that the application has been directed to the wrong Department, it will be transferred to the correct Government office. If it is decided that the applicant is a ward of either Department, grant will be allowed from the date of entrance to the school.\n\nI enclose a supply of the forms required for the children for whom this Department pays grant. I understand that you have already received a supply of forms from the Department of the Interior for those children for whom they are responsible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I have by this same mail forwarded to your Indian Agent at Fort Resolution the blanks filled in to the best of my ability. I regret not being able in all cases to give the full information as the children are far from their home and I cannot get the information sought.\n\nI have asked the Agent at Resolution to be good enough to sign and forward same to you by the first chance.\n\nI wish to thank you for the efforts you have made in getting this matter righted as far as we can. I will follow out the instructions given when making out the next report which will be for Quarter ending Mar 31 for the others had gone forward before your letter reached me.\n\nI am yours sincerely,\n\nA.J.

As soon as the steamer service serves after his arrival, the Rev. Canon A. J. Vale, the retiring Principal will be leaving the school. It is expected, however, that he will have some considerable time with Mr. Singleton to advise him with regard to all the departments of the work and place the same under his supervision.

T. B. R. WESTGATE, D. D.,\nFIELD SECRETARY, M. S. C. C., 39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man., dated April 3, 1928.\n\nOwing to the inadequate Grant which is given by your Department to meet the operating costs of this school so remotely situated, these costs fall heavily on the funds of our Society. Our Society, however, has always met the same, but I should be glad if your Department gave further consideration to the question of the Grant for this school, and take steps to have it advanced sufficiently so as to cover more nearly the operating costs which must be met from year to year.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 11, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the supply of wood at the Hay River Indian Residential School and concerning an increased per capita grant.\n\nI wish to point out that the Indian residential schools in the North have been very generously dealt with in the matter of increased pupilages and per capita grants, as shown in the undermentioned tabular statement, which has reference to the Hay River School. I regret that there are no funds available for an increase in the per capita grant at the present time. I might state that, in addition to the larger grants, the Department has dealt as generously as possible in connection with the supplying of equipment and the effecting of repairs.\n\n| Date       | Pupilage | Per Capita Grant | Earning Power |\n|------------|----------|------------------|---------------|\n| Mar. 31, 1917 | 25       | $125.            | $3125.        |\n| April 1, 1917 | 25       | 125.             | 3375.         |\n| July 1, 1917 | 45       | 125.             | 6075.         |\n| April 1, 1919 | 45       | 145.             | 6525.         |\n| April 1, 1921 | 45       | 165.             | 7425.         |\n| April 1, 1923 | 50       | 165.             | 8250.         |\n| April 1, 1926 | 50       | 180.             | 9000.         |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: The Per Capita Grant for Hay River School\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst. (139-2-1) relative to the per capita Grant for the Hay River School, and to thank you very cordially for the same.\n\nIn writing to you again in connexion with this important matter, I desire first of all to assure you of our Society's deep appreciation of all the financial help your Department has given towards meeting the operating expenses of this institution. The gradual and substantial increases in the pupilage and per capita rates between the years 1917 and 1926 as set forth in your tabular statement have also been noted with much satisfaction. The situation, however, from our Society's point of view is still difficult, and our Commission desire me to lay the following statement of cash receipts and disbursements for the year 1927 before you for your information and sympathetic consideration:\n\n| Average attendance | 1st. Quarter | $30.91 |\n|---------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Grant received      | Do.         | $1390.95 |\n| Average attendance | 2nd. Quarter | $32    |\n| Grant received      | Do.         | $1440.00 |\n| Average attendance | 3rd. Quarter | $36.41 |\n| Grant received      | Do.         | $1638.45 |\n| Average attendance | 4th. Quarter | $45.33 |\n| Grant received      | Do.         | $2034.85 |\n\nAverage attendance for the year $36.16 & total grant received...........$6504.25\nIn addition to this, certain grants are receivable from the Department of the N.W.T., and although these have not been received in full for the year 1927, it is expected that they will total approximately $1300. Neither this total, nor that set forth above as received from your Department, includes the Grant towards the Nurse's salary, as the medical work is looked upon by our Society as quite distinct from the educational.\n\nThe total cash receipts, therefore, during 1927 may be reckoned at $7804.25 or in round figures, say, $8000.00\n\nFor the same period the cash disbursements made by our Society, as set forth in the Report of our Commission's auditor, amounted to $12,152.67, leaving a cash balance of over $4000, which our Society had to provide.\n\nThe capacity of enrollment is fixed by your Department at 50 pupils, and consequently, the per capita rate should be $240, to meet an annual expenditure of $12,000.\n\nAs the greater number of the children in residence are recruited from districts around the lower parts of the MacKenzie River, it would appear to be a safe and wise policy to have the Hay River School transferred to a suitable location somewhere in that part. So long, however, as it remains where it is, our Society will be faced with an annual heavy deficit unless a capacity enrollment is maintained and the per capita rate substantially increased.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nResolution, N.W.T.,\nMarch 5th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe gardens at both missions, Hay River and Providence were fair this fall, an average of potatoes and vegetables being harvested, but it seems to us that if a certain amount of money could be spent in making land and clearing a large tract and help these Missions in making much more extensive gardens, with the help of artificial watering or more by pumping water on the gardens, splendid crops could be raised and give a food to these children that can not be substituted by imported goods. It can be done, once the land would be cleared, even fifteen to twenty acres at each place devoted to that purpose, and we intend to do that ourselves when we can clear that twenty acres patch of the agency, and have our Indians work at it themselves. We believe it would be a life saver to them. They like vegetables and are very fond of potatoes.\n\nC. Bourget, M.D.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Bourget, in a communication to the Department, recommends that more extensive gardening operations be carried out at the Hay River Indian Residential School, and that, for this purpose, a certain amount of clearing should be done. He states that good crops of vegetables and potatoes could be raised, and that they would be of great benefit in the diet of the pupils. He also states the children like vegetables and are fond of potatoes. I shall be pleased to have a report from you as to the extent of the gardening operations you can arrange to carry out this coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. B. Singleton,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nHay River, N.W.T.\nWinnipeg, Man. July 22nd, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI very deeply regret to have to report that during my recent visit to the Hay River School I learned of the death by drowning of the boy pupil Benjamin Martin. This took place on July 3rd, just one day before my arrival, when Benjamin, along with about 19 or 20 other boys from the school, and under the supervision of Mrs. Singleton, wife of the Principal, were bathing in their customary bathing place. The water rested on a sandy bottom, and was not over three feet deep. As the pupils had used this spot for bathing for many years, and had previously bathed there this year, not even the slightest accident or misadventure was anticipated. The boys were all in the water at the same time, and Benjamin was not missed until they were dressing to return to the School. As soon as his absence was discovered, a search was made for him among the bushes along the shore, but failing to find him, the supervisor sent one of the bigger boys to call the Principal and men agents, and also to notify the local detachment of Mounted Police. Shortly after these arrived Mr. Boxer, General Assistant on the school staff, discovered the body lying in the water face downwards, and only about 30 feet from the shore. A determined effort was made to restore respiration but without effect. As there was no mark of any kind on the body the conclusion formed by those present was that death was due to \"either cramps or heart failure\". Corporal Cook who is in charge of the local detachment of the R.M.P., conducted an investigation, and informed the Principal that he did not attach any blame to the school management. The loss of this promising pupil is the more deeply to be regretted as it was the fond hope of his father that he should be prepared for the sacred Ministry of the Church, and arrangements were being made to accomplish this end.\n\nDuring my visit I arranged with the Principal that in future he himself should accompany the boys when they went bathing. Messages of very deep sympathy were sent by me and the Principal of the School to the bereaved father, and I also arranged for Bishop\nwho was at Hay River at the same time on his way North, to furnish him with a detailed account of his son's death. The School management were deeply grieved over the whole affair, but after receiving the information set forth above, I reached the same conclusion as the head of the local Mounted Police detachment, and feel that no blame can be attached to the School management.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, July 26th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, reporting the death by drowning of Benjamin Martin, a pupil of the Hay River Indian Residential School. The Department regrets the sad death of this boy. It is noted that it was accidental and that no blame is attached to the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I ran right over and found Mr. Boxer trying artificial respiration. I found that the boy had been in the water almost an hour, and on the arrival of Corp Cook a few minutes later, we decided that further first aid was useless.\n\nThe Body was taken to the Mission and thoroughly examined for marks or bruises by Corp Cook and myself, but there were no marks at all.\n\nI know that this boy's health was good generally, MMH apart from colds he has had excellent health during the past year while I have been stationed at Hay River.\n\nEnds\n\nMinnie Hackett R.N.\nRay River N.W.T.\n\nJuly 5th 1929\n\nStatement of Mr Eric Calrow.\n\nBegins.\n\nI, Eric Calrow, am employed by the Anglican Mission at Ray River N.W.T., as Farm Instructor.\n\nLast Wednesday Afternoon, July 3rd 1929, I was working in the field when Miss Sowden, the Matron-in-charge came to me at about 5.30 P.M., and told me that one of the Boys, Ben Martin, was missing. The rest of the boys had come out of the water where they were and commenced to dress, when they discovered that there was a set of clothes without an owner, and on looking them over found that they belonged to the boy Ben Martin. I ran over to the beach and saw Mr Boxer, our evangelist, in the water searching, and Mrs Singleton searching along the shore; the boys were still dressing by the smudge. I found that the boy must have been missing for almost half an hour, so decided to get a canoe, as neither Boxer or myself can swim.\n\nI returned quickly to the school, passing Mr Singleton, the Principal running to the beach. I returned with the canoe, but found that Boxer had recovered the body out of the lake at a distance of about 25 or 30 feet from the shore. Corp. Cook was then sent for, and in the meantime artificial respiration was tried, but was of no avail. The body must have been in the water well over \u00bd of an hour, so Corp. Cook and Const. Salkeld decided that the body should be taken to the Mission.\n\nThe wind was blowing on shore and the water felt cold to me, but the day was mild, and I have known the boys to go in to swim on days very much worse than last Wednesday. They never go alone. Mrs Singleton, the Principal's wife was in charge that day, and some of the older boys are quite good swimmers.\n\nEnds\n\nEric Calrow.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nStatement of Albert Boxer.\n\nBegin.\n\nI, Albert Boxer, am employed by the Anglican Mission at Hay River N.W.T. as Engineer.\n\nLast Wednesday Afternoon between 3:15 and 5:30 P.M., I was called by the Chief Patron to go quickly to the Boys Bathing Beach; none of the boys could not be found. I was over there in a very few minutes and immediately went into the water and began to search with my feet and watching all the time as the waves broke almost to the bottom in the shallow water. I cannot swim so I went back to the Mission for one of the life jackets, so that I could get up into the deeper water. I had great difficulty in keeping my feet as the ground swell was strong. This beach is only very shallow on calm days, and you have to go about 200 yards before you get three feet of water.\n\nAfter searching for about half an hour I saw the boy Ben Martin face down on the sand and each wave lifting up the body, and only about 25 or 30 feet from the shore, and close to a drift log that the boys play around. I would judge that this log was in about 2 feet of water on a still day.\n\nI carried the boy ashore to the smudge fire, and with Mr. Singleton commenced artificial respiration. The boy was sent to the police barracks which are over two miles away from the beach, and we worked on the body until the arrival of Corp. Cook and Sgt. Salkeld. I knew the boy had been in the water at least \u00bd of an hour, and the first aid rendered was of no avail. There was no marks or bruises on the body. Our Nurse, Miss Hackett and Corp. Cook decided that further First Aid was useless, so the body was carried back to the school.\n\nEnds\n\nAlbert Boxer\n\nAlbert Boxer.\nHay River N.W.T.\nJuly 5th 1929\n\nStatement of Albert Horriscy.\n\nBegins,\n\nI am seventeen years old, and live at\nthe Anglican Mission School at Hay River.\n\nLast Wednesday afternoon July 3rd, I\nwent to the beach with the boys to swim; but I did not go into\nthe water as I made the fire for them.

Singleton, of the Anglican Residential School, Hay River N.W.T., was in charge of the older boys of this school on Wednesday July 3rd 1929. I took them for their usual afternoon swim on the lake shore, a distance across the portage from the school of about three quarters of a mile.\n\nThere were twenty-one boys in the group. We left the school at 4:30 P.M. The boys lit a fire on the beach to protect them from mosquitoes, undressed and went into the water. They bathed in a group, playing together. They were in the water about twenty minutes. I was seated by the fire all the time watching. Until the boys had partially dressed, no one noticed that Ben Martin's clothing was untouchable. Immediately we called and searched the beach and near the lake, but could not find him. I then ran to the Mission to give the alarm, and returned quickly to the beach with Mr. Boxer, the engineer, having sent word to Mr. Singleton who was in the village, and to Mr. Calrow working in the field. Mr. Calrow followed us almost immediately.\n\nHe and Mr. Boxer searched in the water but did not find the boy. I returned to the school with three boys for a canoe and met Mr. Singleton coming to the beach. I returned again to the beach with the boys and found that Mr. Boxer had found the body of Ben Martin in the water and he and Mr. Singleton and Mr. Calrow were giving first aid. I returned again to the school for the horse and brandy.\n\nEnds.\n\nMartha Singleton.\nStatement of Miss Helena Sowden.\n\nBegins.\n\nI, Helena Sowden, am the Matron-in-Charge at the Anglican Residential School at Hay River N.W.T.\n\nFor almost the whole of the past six years I have been in charge of the Boys of the school, and it is custom each day, between the hours of 4 and 6 P.M., for the boys to engage in some kind of recreation.\n\nEvery Wednesday I take relief duty in the kitchen, and on these days some other member of the Staff takes charge of the boys for their recreation.\n\nLast Wednesday afternoon it was arranged for the Principal's wife, Mrs W.B. Singleton, to take the boys bathing at the usual place on the lake shore. Before they left I handed each boy his towel and bathing suit, and watched them leave the school grounds about 4.30 P.M. in Mrs Singleton's charge.\n\nAbout three quarters of an hour later Mrs Singleton returned and said that she could not find the boy Ben Martin and requested me gather the men at once, and send them over to the beach. I did this, and all our three men were over in a very short while, and soon after received the very sad news that Ben Martin's body had been recovered from the lake drowned.\n\nBen Martin is a Treaty Indian boy, aged eleven years, and his parents live at Moherson.\n\nThe practice of the boys bathing in the lake each summer has always been carried on whilst I have been on the Staff of the Mission, and no thought of danger ever occurred, as the beach is very shallow, and has been considered quite safe even for the smallest children.\n\nEnds\n\nHelena Sowden\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHey River N.W.T.\n\nJuly 5th 1929\n\nStatement of Rev.

I have followed the usual routine and customs which were in effect at the time of my assumption of duty.\n\nIn the past, the boys have been allowed to bathe in the lake, but always in charge of a member of our staff. I myself being an efficient swimmer, very often take the older boys for their swim.\n\nLast Wednesday July 3rd 1929, the boys were under the charge of my wife. At that time I was doing parochial work in the village, our Indians having just returned from their winters hunt.\n\nWhile returning to the school from the village at about 5:30 PM, I met the Head Matron, Miss H. Sowdon who informed me that a boy named Ben Martin was missing from the bathing party of boys on the shallow beach across the portage. I hurried to the beach, and a few minutes after my arrival there, our engineer Mr. Boxer found the body and carried it ashore. During the next half hour we employed the method of artificial respiration, but without avail as the boy had already been in the water for at least half an hour. Our Staff Nurse, Miss M. MacKett was at the shore rendering and doing the First Aid attempted.\n\nI was aware that the boys were going to bathe at the beach that afternoon. Knowing however, that the boys had often bathed there before, I did not think that there could be any danger on such a shallow beach.\n\nThis boy came to the school with his brother Robert a little over two years ago. He is a Treaty Indian of the Tukudh Band and a son of the Rev. John Martin, Anglican Missionary at Morhosen. He is eleven years and has always enjoyed good health while at the school.\n\nEnds\n\nW.B.

Balkeld I left immediately for the boys bathing beach, and found that the body had been recovered from the lake.\n\nFirst aid was being tried by the nurse stationed here and Mr. Bozner, the engineer from the mission, but without any result. Investigating I found that the boy had been in the water for almost an hour, so it was useless to carry on with artificial respiration. Cook Balkeld and I took the body over to the mission and washed it, and examined it very thoroughly with the Nurse for any marks or bruises, but there were none. Cook Balkeld and I made a coffin and got it ready for burial, which took place here the next day, July 4th 1929.\n\nI have taken statement from all the persons concerned, which I attach herewith.\n\nThe bathing beach is quite safe under all ordinary conditions, as there is only 3 feet of water at a distance of 500 yards out. It slopes gradually and there are no holes, the danger arises when the sea is breaking on the shore, and in a ground swell coming. At the time this accident occurred the wind was from the east, but had died down considerably since the morning. Mr. Singleton, the principal of the school, had no idea that there could be the least danger in allowing the boys to bathe that day; they have apparently gone into the water when the sea has been quite as bad as on Wednesday last. The boys were in the care of Mrs. Singleton, and though she cannot swim, several of the older boys are quite good. I think the boy drowned was simply swept off his feet and the back wash kept him down, no call was heard by Mrs. Singleton or any of the boys, and twenty out of the twenty-one in the group were in the water; he was not missed at all until his clothing was not claimed.\n\nFort Smith N.W.T.\nJuly 4th 1929\n\nThe Officer Commanding\nGreat Slave Lake Sub-District\nFort Smith N.W.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 31st July, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccidental Drowning of Ben Martin,\nHay River, N.W.T.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of report of Corporal F. Cook of this force, dated at Hay River, North West Territories, 5th July, 1929, with regard to a drowning accident at the Anglican Indian Residential School at Hay River, N.W.T. Territories whereby a Treaty Indian boy named Ben Martin lost his life.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHAY RIVER, N.W.T. July 16th, 1929.\n\nMr J.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of inquiry of April 2nd, concerning the extent of the gardening operations which we can arrange to carry out during this present summer, I would reply as follows.\n\nAs a result of a remeasurement made by us of our present available garden space at this school we find the area to be approximately 4\u00bd acres. This acreage is sown as follows:\n\nPotatoes and vegetables.................. 3 acres.\nOats ........................................... 1 acre.\nHay ............................................ \u00bd acre.\n\nThis amount of available garden is different from that reported to your office last year. We then broke and sow-ed to hay about an acre and half of land nearer the lake which has proved to be too shallow for favorable growth. Last year also we used a half acre of land belonging to the police which is not at our disposal this year. Lastly, being inexperienced in the estimation of land at sight I gave a too generous measurement of our fields.\n\nBesides the 4\u00bd acres at present in use we have a half acre of newly broken soil which will be ready for use next summer. Until this year, we have not possessed the necessary machinery for adequately breaking up new soil for favorable growth.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\nDue to the rush of work here during each summer and fall and also to shortage of help, we are unable to clear and break more than one half acre of new land each year. This summer the amount will be even less as our men are to be responsible for the erection of our new hospital building.\n\nI quite agree with our Indian Agent, Dr Bourget, that this school needs a much larger supply of vegetables, and accordingly much more garden space. Last year our garden crop was a partial failure due to late spring and early frosts, also through the winter there was a shortage of fish. The staple foods for the children for the greater part of last winter therefore were bread, rice, beans, dried peas, oatmeal, tapioca, sago, jams and deer and caribou meat. Our children are enjoying good health and looking very fit.\n\nOur wood problem is a heavy one. Due to the incapacity of a team of oxen to haul it down the river during the winter we must endeavor to raft it during the summer months. This along with other urgent duties makes it impossible for us to do much breaking of new land of which we need at least ten acres more for garden purposes. I am confident that twice this amount could be cleared along the River bank.\n\nYours Sir, very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 7, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, concerning gardening operations at the Hay River Indian Residential School. I note the difficulties you are having in the matter of breaking up new land, and I am pleased to state that the Department will allow a grant of $400 to be expended this year in this connection. Under separate cover an accountable cheque for this amount is being directed to you, and, before the end of the calendar year, you should forward to the Department labour returns, in duplicate, showing the receipts of the men employed. A supply of these returns is also going forward by separate mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. B.

Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that at the request of her father, Mrs. Storkerson and her two children who were living at our Hay River School have moved to Vancouver. Their travelling expenses were met by her father, and Mrs. Vale, wife of the Principal of the Chapleau School, escorted them over the railway lines after they left the river steamer at Waterways. They left Hay River on the 1st of October, and their connection with that school terminated on that date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nHay River.\n\nVery little news has come through from our Indian Boarding School at Hay River this winter. The number of children in residence this winter has been smaller than usual, partly due no doubt to the fact that there were several deaths at the school last winter. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get the parents at Fort McPherson and other points far away from Hay River to send their children to the School. This is accentuated somewhat by the presence of the large Roman Catholic School at Akaitcho in the Mackenzie Delta. If the Roman Catholic Church can provide such an institution at Akaitcho where they have practically no people, why cannot our Church provide a School for the relatively large number of Indians of our Faith at Fort McPherson, is a question our Indians often ask.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nIn my letter of October 22nd last, I laid before the Secretary of your Department all the information in my possession about the pupilage at our Hay River School, and the per capita grant for the same. This school has an official capacity of 50 pupils, and there are 53 Treaty pupils in residence at present and 5 Non-Treaty, but the Secretary when replying to my letter on November 10th (No. 139-2-10) stated that \"at the present time it is not possible for the Department to allow grant for more than thirty (30) pupils\".\n\nThis decision has given me and our Commission one of the severest shocks we have had for some years, as we are charged with the heavy responsibility of keeping our expenditure within the sanctioned appropriation, and this is absolutely impossible of achievement if the grant for the Hay River pupilage is reduced from fifty to thirty pupils. As the Bank overdraft of our Society on account of our Indian Residential Schools, stood, on May 31st last at $26,960.81, you will realize the critical nature of the situation which will confront us at the close of the current calendar year, and I most sincerely trust your Department may yet be able to afford some help in relieving us of the heavy load of anxiety which rests upon us at the present time.\n\nIn making this request I am not unmindful of the difficulty your Department may have before April 1st of next year of providing the full per capita grant for fifty pupils, but as five of the pupils are Non-Treaty and the grant for them should be paid by the N.W.T. Branch of the Department of the Interior, our Commission will endeavour to carry 50% of the cost of the remaining 15 pupils. If your Department will agree to provide a like amount, this arrangement to stand until the end of March next only, when it is expected provision will be made in your estimates for the year.\n1935-36, and for all subsequent years for the per capita grant to be paid for fifty pupils.\n\nIf you will kindly give this urgent and important matter your own personal attention, and arrange with the Honourable the Minister of the Interior to provide the grant for the five Non-Treaty pupils from the mid-summer holidays 1934, and for your Department to provide the grant for the same period for half of the fifteen Treaty pupils, our Commission and our Society will be duly grateful.\n\nI may say that I had purposed making this matter one of the subjects of discussion when I visited Ottawa as an Anglican member of the joint-delegation from various churches to confer with the Rt. Honourable the Prime Minister, but as the arrangements for that delegation have not yet been completed, and as the end of our financial year is so close at hand, the critical nature of the situation has made it imperative for me to write to you at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDecember 18, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nA request has been received from Reverend Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, Winnipeg, Man., that grant be provided for an increase of 20 in the pupilage at the Hay River Indian Residential School, North West Territories. At present, grant is allowed for 30 pupils at $200 per capita, less 15%. During the past summer, the Anglican missionaries at Aklavik and northern posts recruited some 23 additional children and sent them to Hay River. Dr. Westgate now urges that per capita grant be provided for 20 additional pupils.\n\nIn August, last, Dr. Westgate forwarded an account for $1,045, from the Hudson's Bay Company's Mackenzie River Transport System, for the transportation of the children from Aklavik to Hay River. Before these children left their home, the Department wired Dr. Truesdell, Indian Agent, Aklavik, that we would not be responsible for their transportation. Dr. Westgate was also informed, and further, he was advised that it would not be possible for the Department to allow grant for an increased number of pupils.\n\nI quote from Dr. Westgate's reply:\n\n\"This decision has given me and our Commission one of the severest shocks we have had for some years, as we are charged with the heavy responsibility of keeping our expenditure within the sanctioned appropriation, and this is absolutely impossible of achievement if the grant for the Hay River pupilage - is reduced.\"\nis reduced from fifty to thirty pupils.

T.B.R. WESTGATE, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C., 39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Man., dated Mar. 18/35.\n\nWhile dealing with matters pertaining to this school, I desire to direct your attention to the statement made at the top of page 9 of my letter of the 19th ultimo, namely, \"Failure to receive from your Department any grant for twenty of the pupils in our Hay River School has inflicted a very severe hardship on our Society...........\"\n\nDuring my visit to your Department on December 20th, last, I discussed this matter with the Deputy Superintendent General; and also with the Acting Superintendent of Indian Education, and received the impression that it would receive consideration. Previous to my visit I find from our records that I had placed the whole situation before the Deputy Superintendent General in my letter of December 7th of last year, and he replied to the same on December 19th, No. 139-2-1, stating that he had placed my request before the Honourable, the Superintendent General, and would advise me later of his direction. On January 8th of this year I wired the Deputy Superintendent General again in this connection, and he replied by wire on the same date stating the Minister was withholding his decision pending approval of estimates which were then before the Treasury Board.\n\nFrom all the facts of the case so far as they have reached our Commission, the members are unable to see any substantial reason why the grant for these twenty pupils should not be paid in full, but they are prepared to adhere to the generous offer made in the third paragraph of my letter to the Deputy Superintendent General on December 7th last, namely, to carry half the cost of tuition and maintenance of the fifteen Treaty children, if your Department will carry the cost of the remaining fifteen and the North West Territories Branch of the Department of the Interior will carry the cost of the five non-treaties.\n\nI cannot refrain from repeating, Sir, that failure to receive any grant for these children has inflicted a very severe hardship on our Society, and I earnestly hope the matter may now receive the sympathetic consideration it deserves, and that our generous offer may be immediately accepted.\nOttawa, March 25, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 18th instant, renewing your request that a grant be provided for an increase of 20 in the pupilage at the Hay River Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would say that this request has been given careful consideration. The Department is opposed to bringing children from Aklavik, Fort McPherson and other far northern posts, approximately 900 miles, and the consequent cost involved in their transportation, and is unable to give favourable consideration to providing a per capita grant for them. If there are, in the neighbourhood of the Hay River School, more than 30 Indian children - the number for which the grant is allowed - who are of school age and members of the Church of England, the Department will be prepared to favourably consider the providing of a grant for an increased pupilage. It is regretted, however, that the Department will be unable to provide a grant for an increase in the pupilage for the children who were brought from northern posts last summer; neither can transportation expenses be paid to bring these children to the school and in returning them to their homes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In the event of the residential school at Hay River being continued for approximately 15 children from that neighbourhood, the Indian pupilage that can be provided for at the new school at Aklavik will be 35 children, or, the total number for which grant can be provided at both schools is 50 pupils. Payment of the grant to Aklavik could begin as from the time the pupils now at Hay River have been transferred to that school.\n\nThe Department would favourably consider continuing the residential school at Hay River for the benefit of the Anglican Indian children in that neighbourhood and provide grant for approximately 15 pupils - it being understood, however, as all the buildings in question at this point are owned by your Society, that the Society will be responsible for the entire cost of any reconstruction or repairs.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nor repairs that may in future be required.\n\nRegarding the request that a grant of $2,000.00 be provided towards the equipment of the new residential school at Aklavik, I would say, while no funds have been specially provided in our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year for this purpose, it will, no doubt, be found possible to grant some assistance towards the cost of furnishing the building.\n\nThe Department agrees that the senior Indian pupils from the lower Mackenzie Valley, now at the Hay River School, remain and complete their education and that the others from that district be transferred to the new school at Aklavik during the summer of 1937.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAROLD W.

The closing of this school would have left the Protestant Indians from the Arctic Circle to Fort Chipewyan without a school for their children. I know how delighted our missionaries and the Indians will be to hear the good news that it will not be closed. I trust that its continuation will be justified by the use which will be made of it, and that it will continue to be a great blessing to man, children, in mind and body and soul.\n\nAs Bishop of the Diocese of Athabasca and as one trying to help the Indians of the Mackenzie Valley in every way, I wish to thank you sincerely. May I assure you of my loyal co-operation in every way.\n\nWith every good wish to you in this new year of 1936.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[A.W.

The Principal informed me that he was more or less in the dark as to what would take place, as when the McPherson children were taken to Aklavik they would not have enough children to keep the present school going, and he thought His Lordship, the Bishop, intended making different arrangements so that the children remaining there would receive some training.\n\nI saw all the children that were in residence there, and was very well pleased with their appearance and also with their work.

I note that the children who were present at the time of your visit are in good health; that, in your opinion, they receive a very good training at this school; and that the effort and money expended have been justified by the results achieved in the training of the children at this school.\n\nThe church authorities are transferring the pupils from the more northern districts to the new school at Aklavik, but it is understood that they will retain approximately 15 children from Hay River and neighbourhood and carry on the work at this school. The Department has agreed to provide a grant for 15 pupils at Hay River and 35 at the new Anglican School at Aklavik from the date it is opened - this being the grants provided for these schools during the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary Alta.\nOttawa, August 31, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th instant and also copies of telegraphic communications that have passed between you and the Reverend H. G. Cook, of Fort Simpson, enclosed therewith.\n\nI note that it is your intention to operate an Indian day school, rather than a residential school, at Hay River, on the understanding that the Department will pay per capita grant on an enrolment of 50 pupils at the Aklavik Residential School. This is the first intimation we have had of this change. We would like to have a letter indicating the exact date on which this change will take place.\n\nI can see no serious objection to the payment of a per capita grant for 50 pupils at Aklavik, if the school at Hay River is operated as a day school and if the pupils in attendance at Aklavik are drawn from the immediate neighbourhood of the school. I cannot convince myself that the practice of transporting Indian children hundreds of miles to a residential school is a wise one. In addition to this, I am not at all satisfied with the course of instruction provided at Indian residential schools in the North West Territories. F. W. Head, M.D., Indian Agent, Fort Norman, in a letter to the Department dated July 9th, states:\n\n\"The one complaint of the Indians that I have to draw to the attention of the Department is the question of school instruction. They claim their children are taught nothing useful to them in their mode of living and that when they come home they are useless for work in the bush. Some even go so far as to state that they will not let their children return to school.\"\n\nRev. T.H.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.B.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nIt is my understanding that certain church authorities have given this matter a great deal of study and hope to submit to the Department for consideration a revised curriculum for their northern schools in the immediate future.\n\nIn view of these comments, I can only express regret that it was considered necessary to send the Grossetete children to Aklavik. I do not know that there is anything we can do about it now that they have been sent, other than ask that these children be returned to Fort Simpson at the end of the school year.\n\nThe records indicate that we are making a contribution of approximately $600.00 to the salary of a teacher at Fort Simpson.\n\nThe mother of these children, it is true, may experience considerable difficulty in providing them with the food and clothing necessary to enable them to take advantage of the local day school facilities. In this respect, however, the children do not differ from hundreds of other children throughout the Dominion. The appeal of an Indian agent for relief allowances for a family such as this is always sympathetically considered by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 31st ultimo has come to hand, and I am forwarding a copy of the same to the Rev. Canon S. Gould, General Secretary of our Society, in order that he may communicate with you direct in the matter of the operation of an Indian Day School at Hay River instead of the Residential School which closed on August 31st last. Your statement that you had not received any indication of this change until you received my letter of August 26th last, came as a surprise to me, as I had concluded from the following information embodied in Canon Gould's letter to me on March 23rd last that the proposed change had been mentioned and approved. His letter reads in part, as follows:-\n\n\"When in Ottawa a few days ago, I talked over the situation with Dr. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs; he agreed that, under the circumstances, we would be justified in sending at our expense the few pupils at Hay River, whose parents might not be satisfied with a Day School, down to the Alkivak Institution.\"\n\nAs Anglican Indian Day Schools do not come within the jurisdiction of our Commission, but are operated by the Diocese in which they are located, in collaboration with your Department, the Rt. Rev. Dr. A. H. Sovereign, Lord Bishop of Athabasca, proposed calling on you on his way to and from the recent meetings of our General Synod in Halifax. Through his visit and the further information you will receive from our General Secretary, any oversight on our part or misunderstanding in the matter, will, I feel sure, be fully and satisfactorily cleared up.\n\nYour opinion that it is not wise to transport Indian children hundreds of miles to a Residential School, is shared by our Commission, and this is the chief reason why our Society\nI have noted the complaint of the Indians, as reported by Dr. Head in his letter to your Department on July 9th, and beg to state that I am quite unable to accept their statement that, \"their children are taught nothing useful to them in their mode of living, and that when they came home they were useless for work in the bush.\" The question is one of \"vocational training\" to which our Commission has given a great deal of attention, and while some progress has already been achieved in this direction, the facilities required have not, for lack of funds, been provided. Similar criticism to that embodied in Dr. Head's report was investigated by our Commission some years ago, more particularly with regard to the Indians in the northern areas of the country, and we were emphatically informed at that time, that the biggest catches of furs brought to the trading posts were brought by boys who had graduated from our Society's Schools. In the light of the information we received at the time of our investigation of this matter, we are unable to attach any great significance to the complaint Dr. Head reported.\n\nOn March 14th, 1925, your Department in a letter of that date, No. 1-1-10, advised us of four regulations recently adopted by the N.W.T. Council regarding the age limit for the discharge of pupils from Residential Schools in that part, and in those regulations provision was made for boys, 12 years of age, and in good physical condition, to be granted leave of absence during the hunting and trapping season. This regulation was made known to the principals of our Schools concerned, and has not, I feel sure been ignored, and any further regulations your Department may see fit to adopt along the same line will likewise be carefully observed.\n\nI have noted your request that the two Grosstete children recently sent from Fort Simpson to Aklavik, be returned next year, and will submit the same to the members of our Commission at their next meeting.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, September 9, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI may state that a number of representatives of your Church have expressed a desire to call at the Department and discuss various matters with the officials on their way home from the meeting of the General Synod. It is my hope that I shall have an opportunity at that time of discussing with them certain matters to which you refer in your communication.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

It is our plan to have the present Principal, Rev. W. B. Singleton, B.A., B.D., to remain in charge of this School, and also through the present nurse to keep the Hospital open.\n\nI hope to be in Ottawa about Wednesday or Thursday of next week and will plan to see you personally.\n\nWould you kindly send to Mr. Singleton a supply of the official quarterly Report Forms.\n\nMay I also ask for information as to the amount of stipend which the Department will allow Mr. Singleton, and if it is in accordance with your usual policy, may I ask you to send it direct to Ven. Archdeacon Little, D.D., Athabasca, Alta., Treasurer of the Diocese. I believe that your Department usually sends this stipend in quarterly portions. I believe that your Department also makes an allowance for fuel.\n\nI trust that our general plan and policy, as outlined above, will receive your commendation, for it is our wish, and I know it is your wish also, that our Indian wards should receive a proper education to fit them for their life and work in our North Land.\n\nI hope to see you soon. With every good wish, and with many thanks,\n\nBelieve me,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\nSeptember 24, 1937.\n\nEXD.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the operation of the Day School at Hay River to replace the Hay River Residential School, which has been closed.\n\nI would appreciate your advising the approximate number of children that would attend if a Day School were established.\n\nIf a reasonable number of pupils are available, the Department is disposed to allow a salary for the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Earl Richards is leaving by the first boat and will arrive at Hay River on June 14th and will be with Mr. Singleton for three weeks. May I recommend to you the appointment of Mr. Richards as the Teacher at this station. He is from Wycliffe College, Toronto, and is thoroughly dependable and efficient. Mr. Singleton will have three weeks in which to train him. I trust that it will be possible for you to appoint him in place of Mr. Singleton.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 28, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant nominating Reverend S. Earl Richards as teacher of the Hay River Day School. The appointment of Mr. Richards is approved.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we have made arrangements for a salary of $650.00 for the teacher at this point. This amount will be paid on the basis of 10 months in the academic year. A supply of quarterly return forms will be forwarded to Mr. Richards and at the end of each quarter he should send a return giving the information requested on the form regarding the Indian children only who are attending this school.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that Mr. Richards will commence duties about July 7. I presume that the school will be conducted during the summer and that the two months holiday period will be taken during the winter. I would appreciate, however, if you would definitely advise me on that point. Mr. Richards should forward his first return at the end of September, 1936.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. A.H.

S. Eric Richards as teacher. (His second name is Eric, not Earl; it was my mistake in my letter to you)\n\nI also wish to thank you for the appropriation of a salary of \u00a3650 for Mr. Richards on a 10-months basis in the academic year.\n\nI feel sure that he will give faithful and efficient service.\n\nIn regard to the period of year in which the 2-months holiday will be observed, I will write you later when I have heard from him.\n\nMay I again thank you for your kindness and attention concerning the above matter.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.B.

McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nAnglican Day School at Hay River,\nN.W.T.\n\nFollowing the closing of the residential school at Hay River the Anglican Missionary authorities have operated a day school. The return for the quarter ended 30th September, 1935, showed 18 children in attendance, 16 of whom were Indians and 2 half-breeds. The December return indicated the 2 half-breeds had moved to Providence early in October but 2 additional Indian children were in attendance, making 20 Indians in all. The Northwest Territories Administration pays a grant to the day schools for the tuition of white, half-breed and Eskimo children when the average daily attendance is 5 or more but as the pupilage at the Hay River school is now exclusively Indian, our grant cannot be paid. Before notifying the Missionary authorities I would be pleased to know whether your Branch is in any measure responsible for the grant claimed by the Mission.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nLands, Parks and Forests Branch\nRe: Anglican Indian Day School,\nHay River, N.W.T.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of February 3 regarding the above school I may say that when the Hay River Indian residential school was closed this Department agreed to allow an amount of $650.00 a year toward the salary of the teacher who would conduct an Indian day school at Hay River. It is our intention at the present time to continue making this payment.\n\nDirector.\nMay 5, 1939\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill  \nDirector  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario  \n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nre Hay River Day School, N.W.T.\n\nI have received word from Ven Archdeacon Little, Athabasca, Alberta, that he has not received any payment on the Grant which the Indian Department makes to this Mission for the School conducted by Rev. S. E. Richards, our missionary at that point. As you are aware, the Residential School has been closed and the pupils transferred to the Aklavik school. In its place, in conformity with the policy of the Indian Department, a day school has been regularly conducted for two years, ending June 1939\u2014one year under Mrs. W. B. Singleton, the wife of the missionary at Hay River for 1937-38 and for the past year 1938-39 under the personal supervision of Rev. S. E. Richards. The Grant for this work was to be $650.00 per year but Archdeacon Little tells me that he has not received any payments whatever on this account. The records for the attendance have been sent regularly to your Department and show a large attendance.\n\nWould you please investigate this matter for me and let me know at your early convenience.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that the plans for the erection of the Hospital at Fort Norman are progressing favorably and according to time-table. We are cutting all material in Edmonton and putting all the pieces together in bundles so that at Fort Norman the building will be put together very quickly\u2014a kind of knock-down house. This will save much in the way of freight charges for sawed-off ends and also in the time for actual building operations.

Salary of teacher, Indian School, Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of May 10th, I at once wrote to Rev. S. E. Richards at Hay River as above and he wrote to me a brief note saying that he would at once check on the matter of his reports.\n\nI also looked up my files and I find a copy of the report for the quarter ending December 31st, 1938, which I enclose.\n\nYou will note that there have been 20 pupils in attendance with an average daily attendance of 10.6. I will obtain for you the reports for this year just as soon as possible.\n\nI trust that the payment for the quarter ending December 31st, 1938 may be sent to me, made out to the Diocese of Athabasca.\n\nWith every good wish and with many thanks,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nDiocese of Athabasca\n\nBISHOP\nRIGHT REV. ARTHUR H. SOVEREIGN, M.A., D.D.\nPEACE RIVER, ALBERTA\nCANADA\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI have just returned from a month's journey down north as far as Fort Norman. I wish to speak to you about the Day School at Hay River.\n\nYou will remember that it was agreed that the Diocese of Athabasca should receive $650.00 per year, provided that there were sufficient pupils, for the teaching of this school by the resident missionary. This Day School was to take the place of the Indian Residential School as far as the Indians of Hay River and vicinity were concerned.\n\nThis School has been faithfully and efficiently carried on from the time the school was closed,\u2014from September 1st, 1937 to June 30th, 1938,\u2014and from September 1st, 1938 to June 30th, 1939,\u2014but we have received no returns whatever for this work. You will remember that I wrote to you about it and you intimated that your Department had not received the reports from the principal of the School through Mr. Meikle at Fort Smith. I have taken the matter up with Mr. Meikle when I have in Fort Smith and he states that the reports of attendance, etc., had been sent to your Department regularly,\u2014in fact, he showed me the files. Then I took the matter up with Rev. S. L. Richards, Hay River and he assured me that he had faithfully sent all the reports to Mr. Meikle and Mr. Meikle confirms this.\n\nI cannot understand therefore, how the reports from Mr. Meikle to your Department have gone astray.\n\nI trust that it will be possible for you to discover these reports and to send to me an representative of the Diocese of Athabasca, the $1,300.00 which we represent the grant for the two years. The work has been loyally and carefully done and I know that your Department would wish to see that the remuneration was made to the Diocese. I know that you will do all in your power to see that this is done.\n\nWith every good wish and with many thanks,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 24, 1938.\n\nMy dear Bishop Sovereign:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 17, in which you inform me that you have not yet received the $650 per annum grant payable by this Branch for the operation of the Hay River Indian Day School.\n\nThe officials of the Welfare and Training Division inform me that they have recently secured returns from the Hay River school, through the North West Territories Division of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, and that immediately following the receipt of these returns the Treasury Division was requested to send forward cheques to the amount of $1,300, less one month. It would appear that the Hay River Residential School received per capita grant for the month of September, 1937.\n\nMr. Meikle, to whom you refer in your communication, is not an employee of this Branch and it is difficult to understand why the Hay River Indian Day School returns were sent to him. There is no reason whatever why they should not have been sent direct by the teacher to this Branch. This is the practice followed by other teachers in outlying sections of the Dominion and in districts where the Department is not represented by an Indian agent. Mr. Meikle, no doubt, sent all these returns to the\n\nNorth -\n\nRight Rev. Arthur H. Sovereign, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca,\nPeace River, Alberta.\nNorth West Territories Division, but the officials of that Division, not being seized with the importance of such returns in the payment of grants and looking upon their receipt as a routine matter, did not forward them to this Branch. This will explain to Your Lordship the delay that has resulted in the payment of the teacher's salary. The teacher in charge of the school should be instructed that in future all returns should be sent to the Indian Affairs Branch regularly and that no payments can be made until these returns are received and approved for payment.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDiocese of Athabasca\n\nPEACE RIVER, ALBERTA\nSept. 18th, 1939\n\nDr. Harold W.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMany thanks for your letter of August 3rd just received re Hay River Indian School.\n\nI feel that Rev. S. E. Richards must have written those lines when he was badly discouraged. I do not agree with him at all in regard to these statements. As a matter of fact, as you are well aware, it is the policy of the Indian Department more and more to emphasize the policy of Day Schools. It is true that so many of these Indian families are nomadic during the winter but it is also true that more and more, families are remaining at central points. I still feel that the Residential School is the ideal but I also know that Day Schools also may do effective work.\n\nYou and I know quite well that the Indian children of today will be forced to go out into the world to compete with their white brothers as they grow to maturity. The fur-bearing animals will be forced further and further north and trapping will not be the source of sustenance for our Indian Wards. It is therefore the responsibility of the Government and of every citizen in Canada to do his and her part to see that these children receive an education according to their capacity,\u2014reading, writing and arithmetic. They cannot be good citizens without it.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Richards at Hay River and have asked him to give greater attention to this Day School. I have tried to point out to him its importance and I feel quite sure that he will do his utmost to see that this School is kept up to a high standard. I have even suggested that he should in the mornings go to the Indian huts and wake up the families and literally take the children to school. I know that has frequently\nbeen done in other parts of the North. The Indian parents do not realize how important education will be to their children in days to come. I will await an answer to my letter from Rev. S. E. Richards and will report to you at once on receipt of his letter.\n\nMay I ask for my own information if your Department will allow the half-breeds and white pupils to attend the School at the same time. Will your Department make any special grant towards this school work on behalf of the whites and half-breeds? Our Government, which includes us all, surely should be responsible for the education of children, whether white, half-breed or Indian, within the Northwest Territories. For example, at Fort Smith a grant of $500.00 per year was given to our Church towards the salary of a qualified teacher who would teach the white children as well. Would not this come under a similar plan?\n\nMay I thank you for writing to me in regard to the above School.\n\nWith every good wish and with many thanks,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAHS:BR\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nAugust 14, 1942.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the Hay River Day School.

As you know, that is a common characteristic in our Northland. As a matter of fact, the children do what they wish and come and go as they please. There is practically no discipline whatever in the Indian homes. However the fact that seventeen children have been reached is most commendable. As the wave of development moves Northward, more and more these children have need of education; otherwise the results will be disastrous. They should be taught to read and write and do common arithmetic and should also have a knowledge of Canadian geography and democratic institutions.\n\nYou are quite right in your statement that Nurse Neville is in charge of the little outpost Nursing Home at this point and serves these people faithfully in time of sickness and accident. Might I humbly suggest to your Department that an honorarium might be paid to Nurse Neville of one-half of that which was paid to Rev. S. J.

Later en route to Providence I again visited Hay River and made a further investigation. On this occasion the mission priest assured me that if a day school was established he would co-operate fully in seeing that the children of his faith attended, provided that provision was made for religious instruction. I informed him that such provision would be made.\n\nMr. Rogers, manager of the airport, offered to assist in setting up a school by supervising the repair of one large room in the existing unused vacant school building and wiring same for electricity. This room is approximately 36 feet by 24 feet, and has six large windows on the south side. It also is equipped with a large blackboard on two sides, and there are some desks available.\n\nIn view of the religious factor involved, it would be advisable for the Government to either purchase the existing school building from the Anglican authorities, or lease the building and install a teacher of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nAs there are approximately forty children who...\nare potential attenders, the proposed school-room can readily be partitioned into two rooms, if required. Provision has been made in the 1947-48 estimates for the employment of two teachers and the supplying of necessary classroom requirements.\n\nIt is emphasized that the above is to be regarded only as a temporary expedient to meet the immediate requirements of the residents and until the situation has clarified.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nHay River Post,\nHudson's Bay Co.,\nSept. 12, 1946.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools,\nC/o Mr. Fraser,\nMining Recorder,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached please find a list of the children 16 years and under residing at Hay River at the present time. I included the children under six years of age as they are potential school material. This only includes the people of Hay River and not the native people of Providence that are working here at present and may if conditions warrant it become permanent residents. There are about ten children in this group and they would all be Catholic.\n\nAfter discussing the matter with various residents, I have come to the conclusion that a public school is what is needed and for the present in the old townsite of Hay River. As the new townsite develops there may be more White people come in and the white children population would probably be enough to warrant another and separate school for the White children which could be erected in the new town site. Until this time comes there are only a couple of children that would not have to cross the river every day to a school in the new townsite.\n\nIn my opinion and I am speaking as a resident and not as an employee of the Hudson's Bay Co., a school would be a very good thing for Hay River and should be started as soon as possible.

A.

In view of this fact there should be no difficulty in operating the school along non-denominational lines.\n\nIn talking this over with you on the telephone this morning you informed me that the situation was going to straighten itself out shortly because all teachers are going to be full time employees of the department and contributors under the superannuation scheme.\n\nR.

A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 10, 1947.\n\nMr. W. P. Earle, Acting Indian Agent,\nFort Resolution, Northwest Territories.\n\nHay River Day School\n\nThere formerly existed at Hay River a residential school, operated by the Church of England. This school has now been closed for some years and it is now our intention to re-open it as a day school. Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Inspector of Schools for the Northwest Territories, recently visited this school. After discussing the situation with Bishop Sovereign, of the Church of England, and Bishop Trocellier, of the Roman Catholic Church, the following proposals were sent to each of these gentlemen as the basis for the operation of this school:\n\n(a) That the Indian Affairs Branch operate this school.\n\n(b) That whites and half-breeds also attend with the payment of a per capita grant being made for them by the Bureau of Northwest Territories and Yukon Affairs.\n\n(c) That whilst this is a one-room school, the teacher should be chosen on the basis of qualifications and experience, the school to be conducted along non-denominational lines.\n\n(d) That if this becomes a two-room school, it might be advisable to choose a second teacher from the other religious denomination.\n\n(e) That religious instruction can be conducted by a Church of England minister or a Roman Catholic priest or by any person duly authorized by such\nclergyman or by a teacher when so authorized during the last thirty minutes of the teaching day.\n\n(f) That if school accommodation does not permit of the pupils being placed in separate rooms for the purpose of religious teaching, provision shall be made by the Inspector of Schools whereby the time allotted for religious teaching of Church of England children shall be carried on during the prescribed period of one-half of the teaching days in each month, and the religious teaching of the Roman Catholic children shall be carried on during the prescribed period of one-half of the teaching days of each month.\n\n(g) That no separation of pupils by religious denominations shall take place during the secular school work.\n\n(h) That no pupils shall be permitted to be present at any religious teaching unless the parents or guardians of such pupils desire it. If the parents or guardians do not desire the attendance of pupils during such religious teaching, then such pupils shall be dismissed before the religious teaching is begun, or shall remain in another room.\n\n(i) That Bishop Sovereign of the Diocese of Athabasca be approached regarding these proposals and the amount of rent he would wish for use of the former Hay River Residential School.\n\n(j) That Bishop Trocellier, Vicar Apostolic of Mackenzie, be approached regarding the above proposals.\n\nBoth Bishop Sovereign and Bishop Trocellier were written in this regard and I attach for your information copies of the answers which have been received from both these Bishops.\n\nIt is now our intention to proceed with the opening of this school. From Mr. McKinnon we have the information that Mr. Roger of Hay River is willing to have the necessary repairs...\nand alterations made as soon as possible. We are informed that Mr. Roger is a Department of Transport employee at Hay River and that he is anxious to co-operate in every way with the operation of this school.\n\nIt is intended that the Indian Affairs Branch will operate and pay for this school. This is because of the fact that the majority of the pupils will be Indians.

Missions of Mackenzie, on behalf of Bishop Trocellier. As both denominations have agreed to the proposals set forth in my letter of February 14, we have now written to Mr. W. P. Earle, our Acting Indian Agent at Fort Resolution, requesting that he prepare an estimate of the cost of labour and materials to put this school into operating condition.\n\nAs most of the children will be Indians, it is our intention to operate this school and to charge tuition costs to white and half-breed children attending it. Due to the present shortage of building materials, it will not be possible to erect a new school at Hay River at this time. It has been proposed that we use, temporarily, the former Hay River Residential School. We would like to have your concurrence in this proposal and a letter from you as to the amount of rent which you would wish.\n\nI do appreciate your co-operation in this regard and hope that we can provide suitable educational facilities at Hay River for all those who require it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend Arthur H.

I also note that the Roman Catholic Church has agreed to the proposals.\n\nI note that it will be very difficult to obtain materials for the erection of a school at that Post, and we therefore agree to the temporary use of the school-room by your Department for school purposes. The main building of the former Hay River Residential School has been largely dismantled, but the former school-room, actually used for the school-teaching, is in good shape, though it may need a check-up, but the last time I saw it it was in good order. It is well-built, and is conveniently situated.\n\nI believe that a fair rental value would be twenty-five dollars per month, and I trust this will be satisfactory to your Department.\n\nI assure you of our full and sincere co-operation in this wise and practical plan to provide educational facilities for the boys and girls of that important and unfolding community. As you know, it will be the terminal of the Great North Road from Peace River to Great Slave Lake, and will rapidly grow and develop.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.W.

This is a right which we cannot set aside for any consideration. Therefore, this firm attitude on our part must be remembered by all your officials in any scheme of schools which they propose for the Territories in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O.

Signals Radio Station,\nHay River, N.W.T.,\n9th April, 1947.\n\nMr. J. W. MacKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been in receipt of your letter of the 25th February for some time now and it has been my intention to write to you earlier but this has been impossible for reasons I shall outline below.\n\nThe four copies enclosed with your letter of the St. Johns Ambulance magazine have been forwarded to the school and should prove quite useful.\n\nNow for a short report on the school and its progress. The school opened immediately all the lesson plans and texts were received from the Dept. of Education, Alberta. These, I wish to point out, came via C.P. airlines very promptly and additional lesson plans and texts have been received since from time to time.\n\nThe last two weeks of January saw the school in operation and it has been steadily maintained since five days weekly from one to four o'clock P.M., giving the pupils a 15 hour school week plus their home study assignments. To date I have supervised the work and the marking of all test papers and very satisfactory progress has been made. Only seven (7) pupils are attending as it has been impossible to consider a larger number due to the limited accommodation and the absolute lack of fuel.\n\nMr. Camsell of the Dept. of Mines and Resources, whom I understand you met whilst you were here, has loaned one room of his house for the school and provides the fuel for heating purposes.\n\nFor the last five weeks I have been unable to carry on with the work due to pressure of my own work. A new radio station building was shipped in over the winter road and erected at the end of February. This has necessitated the move of the complete station, plus redecorating, etc., and has been a great drain on my available time.\nIn this connection I was very fortunate in securing the services of Mrs. Amy Kraus, a housewife of this settlement, who has carried on in a very satisfactory manner for this last mentioned period. She is a woman of about forty years of age and has, herself, a reasonably good education which she has apparently supplemented with reading and discussion. She has shown a natural flair for teaching work and is well liked by all the children. She has good control of the classes and is especially capable with the younger children.\n\nMrs. Kraus has asked me to approach you with regard to her opportunity to secure a permanent teaching position with the Department when the school is erected here this coming fall. Or, should a school not be erected, (which would be very unfortunate in view of the groundwork we have both put in), she would be willing to carry on this same type of school next year at a salary.\n\nShe is so interested in the work that she is willing to go \"outside\" this summer and take a course in teaching methods in Edmonton. I would be very pleased if you would write to me suggesting any such course that may exist. Mrs. Kraus is willing to undertake such a course entirely at her own expense if given any encouragement with reference to teaching employment here in the future. I have no hesitation whatsoever in fully recommending this offer for full consideration.\n\nThe seven children attending the school have set up an attendance record which rivals that of any school I have ever seen. Only about two absentee days have been recorded both due to sickness.\n\nIt has been quite a problem grading these children as some are of Grade 6 standing in Reading and Writing and only Grade 3 standard in Arithmetic. The next will be an exactly opposite case. However, we have now succeeded in grading them all and they are progressing quickly since, due to the small number involved, instruction almost amounts to personal, private instruction. The teacher appointed to teach school here should find his or her work much easier for this.\n\nAny suggestions you may have to offer will always be appreciated and I would like to hear what you think of the offer made by Mrs. Kraus so that I may pass the information along to her. We are both going to carry on when I get back to the school shortly until the end of June. However, due to construction work and the installation of new equipment planned for this radio station in the coming year,\nit will be impossible for me to carry on the school work on any basis other than supervision next year.\n\nI hope that this interim report of how this venture is going will prove both interesting and informative to you and that you will take the trouble to reply to my questions in the near future. In the meantime, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) T. D. Hodnett W.O. 2\nR.C. Signals,\nHay River, N.W.T.\nOttawa, 3rd May, 1947.\n\nColonel B. F.

McKinnon has addressed to you with copy to me. Apparently the message did not reach you, so I am sending you a copy of what I received.\n\nIt is evident that Mr. McKinnon finds an even greater need of a school at Hay River than there was when he visited the point last year. There is apparently a contractor who would be willing to construct the building. No doubt the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, who has engineers supervising construction in the Mackenzie District, would be able to give you useful advice as to whether the contractor who made the offer is reliable and also whether the price he has quoted is fair and reasonable. It is certainly a great deal larger sum than we would have paid for such a building before the war, but of course the cost of constructing buildings, particularly in remote districts, has increased a great deal. If you want a report from our agent at Yellowknife on Peter Matson please advise me.\n\nAs we agreed over the telephone, I discussed the subject tentatively with our Department Minister who says that he is now sending to our Acting Minister the list of items for consideration in connection with the supplementary estimates. He is prepared to receive a recommendation from you about the Indian School at Hay River which the Northwest Territories Administration would support to the extent of participation in the benefits by other than Indian children.\n\nWill you please let me have a copy of the memorandum you send to the Deputy Minister on this subject.\n\nR.

Payton\n\nHAY RIVER SCHOOL\n\nPlease be advised that our Surveys and Engineering Branch approve the allotment of the following site for the above school:\n\nLot 9, Block H., Hay River Subdivision.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtracts from letter received from Mr. J. W. McKinnon, written at Edmonton, July 22nd.\n\nHay River School\n\n\"I have wired Ottawa indicating that there are about 70 children of school age at Hay River and a school is greatly needed. I indicated that Mr. Peter Mattson, head foreman of the new Yellowknife Hotel, was at Hay River and said he would provide the materials to build a 4-roomed school and residence at a cost of $50,000. The reply from Colonel Neary was that a supplementary estimate of $50,000 had been approved.\n\n\"The plans arrived at Yellowknife on Friday, July 18th, and were discussed with Mr. McNiven and Mr. Lindstrom. Mr. McNiven had a little time to spare, hoping to scan the plans, and he expressed the opinion that Mr. Mattson should not get a cent more than $35,000. Following this, I spent five or six hours with Mr. William Lindstrom, engineer and superintendent of the new Yellowknife Hotel, and, in Mr. McNiven's opinion, the finest and keenest builder in the country.\n\n\"There are approximately 300,000 cubic feet in the new Yellowknife School, which means that it is costing about 50\u00a2 per cubic foot. We expect to follow the plans as submitted, but to eliminate the basement, as has been done with the new Yellowknife school. The building will be placed on cement pillars sunk to permanent frost level. The building will be lowered 12 inches off grading, and the stairs and halls will be eliminated from the basement.\n\n\"The capacity of the school is about 36,000 cubic feet, which at 50\u00a2 per cubic foot would approximate $18,000. The residence is about 16,000 cubic feet, which would approximate $8,000; thus the total cost would be about $27,000. However, Mr. Lindstrom felt that, should the building cost $51,000 or $32,000, we would be getting it done reasonably and that at that price the following features should be included in the contract:\n\n1. School placed on cement pillars at least 9' down in the ground and 18\" above ground;\n2. Eliminate the fireplace in the residence;\"\n3. Place accordion doors and false studding between the two rooms, making them convertible into an auditorium or community hall;\n\n4. Put in a pressure system, i.e., a well under the building with a 2,000 gallon tank and feed water to the school for flush toilets, sinks and hot water system;\n\n5. Supply Delco light plant - 32 volt D.C. and 110 volt A.C.;\n\n6. Install cess-pool and two inside toilets;\n\n7. Put built-in cupboards in each room and supply table for each;\n\n8. There should be maple flooring in the rooms.\n\n\"Peter Mattson will be sending me in tomorrow's mail, I expect, a letter promising to do the above at $32,000. We have agreed that this is fair.\n\n\"He has also promised at that price to install sand boxes and ice-slide, swings, testers, etc.\n\n\"It is imperative that this school get under way as the people at Hay River were ready to rebel when I landed - they thought the plans had fallen through.\n\n\"We must speed it along and get Mattson going this next week, if possible. He could have the school opened by September.\n\nFort Rae School\n\n\"On Thursday, July 17th, I visited Fort Rae to discuss the proposition suggested in Colonel Neary's wire regarding renting the Buffam property at $50 per month with the option to buy. This Mr. Buffam agrees to, providing the government guarantees to purchase the property by the 1st May. This should be done.\"\n\"The residence alone is worth $8,000 today. The store would make an ideal classroom. The Roman Catholic priest intimated that hospital space could be used as dormitory facilities for perhaps twelve children during the first year. George Burfam is honest and promised to hold the property for a week or so. If the property is leased, the government should take the 55 cords of wood, which would heat all the buildings for the first winter. Oil cannot be had. The school supplies and equipment for about thirty children should be forwarded, together with a 45-gallon drum of naphtha oil, as the wind charger is not always sufficient for the lights. Radio batteries are also required.\"\nOTTAWA\n\n28th July, 1947.\n\nR. A.

In the evening I was invited to attend a meeting of all the Indians at this settlement. They requested that they be provided with a government-operated day school, informed me that there were over 70 children of school age in the vicinity, and stated that it was possible there would be over 100 by the fall of the year.\n\nI visited the homes of the community which, in many instances, left much to be desired. There is need of a housing programme at this settlement, together with considerable adult education.\n\nAs Hay River is in a good farming area I am of the opinion that considerable emphasis should be placed on agriculture. The Indians here are trying to make gardens by means of dog power which is not any too suitable. If a small gasoline tractor could in some manner be made available for their use, it would materially assist them in their efforts.\n\nJ. W.

R.A. HOEY\n\nRe - Conversation with Bishop Trocellier and Father Plourde\n\nThis morning I talked with these two gentlemen for an hour and a quarter, chiefly about conditions in the Northwest Territories.\n\nAt a suitable moment in the conversation I brought up the question of the Hay River school. They expressed the opinion that there are really not enough children in the Hay River district to justify the building of a two-roomed school. They said that most of the Indian children who constitute the greater majority would be with their parents forty or fifty miles down the highway during the winter. On being pressed about the proposed arrangement for a single school with a Catholic and a Protestant teacher and with a period assigned at the end of each day for religious instruction they said:\n\n(a) That this is contrary to the policy of the church, but\n\n(b) That they would be willing to accept it as a temporary expedient on the understanding that the senior teacher would be a Catholic. They base their argument on the assertion that three-quarters of the children would be Catholic. They did not insist that the children be divided vertically into two classes.\n\nIt seems to me that the necessity for building a school should be re-considered, but if it is deemed that such a necessity exists, then we should go ahead with the plan as at present envisaged, with the understanding that an effort will be made to find a senior teacher of the Catholic faith to act as principal.\n\nIn the course of the discussion Bishop Trocellier asked that a new residential school be built at Fort Resolution, or if this should be impossible, that a four-roomed class-room building be erected. He asked for a second fire escape on the school at Providence. (This in my opinion should be provided at once). He also asked for a new four-roomed class-room building at Aklavik.\n\nH.L.

We have no objection to a project of this nature if provision is made for a school for Catholic Indian and white children of the locality. It is unnecessary for me to remind you of the legal rights of Catholics in the Northwest Territories in the matter of education and I shall not, therefore, insist on them in this letter.\n\nIt will be of interest to you to have on hand a complete list of the children of Hay River, both Catholic and non-Catholic. This list also gives you the racial origin of each child of school age.\n\nIt would be unfortunate for the Department to attempt, at Hay River, the setting-up of a school system which Catholics could not approve of, and to which they would not be authorized by their Church to send their children.\n\nHoping, therefore, that you will be kind enough to bear the above in mind when arranging school accommodations for Hay River, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEncl. 1\nOttawa, November 3, 1947.\n\nProposed Day School at Hay River, Northwest Territories.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find attached a letter which has been received concerning the above school from the Reverend Father J. O. Pleurde, O.M.I., Superintendent of the Indian Welfare and Training Commission of the Oblate Order.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A.

It was decided to go ahead with the construction of the school as planned.\n\nIn this connection we have in mind the expression of opinion contained in the penultimate paragraph of your memorandum of the 27th ultimo and the possibility that it may be feasible to work out some arrangement that will be accepted as satisfactory by the interested parties.\n\nThe question of what should be done about the schools at Aklavik, and Bishop Trocellier's request that a new residential school be built at Fort Resolution, were allowed to remain in abeyance.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch is building a fire escape for the school at Providence.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nChief Treasury Officer\n\nFor your information\n\nWT\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 30, 1947.\n\nMr. H. L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter mature consideration, I must rectify the position which I took during the interview which you gave Reverend Father Plourde and myself regarding the proposed establishment of a school for Catholic white and Indian children at Hay River. I did not then intend to discuss that question and I may have left you under a misconception as regards the elementary requirements concerning the education of Catholic children.\n\nIt must be understood that all Catholic children are to be under the exclusive care or direction of Catholic teachers and placed in separate class-rooms. All text books in use in all schools must be approved by the Catholic Church authorities. Therefore, it now appears clear to me that your project cannot be implemented.\n\nIt has always been and will always be the policy of the Catholic Church to provide special and separate schools for the children under her care, and I see no other way of safeguarding the principles of the Catholic Church in matters of education. She has never abandoned any of her rights in this sphere.\n\nTherefore, Catholic schools having been guaranteed by law for the Northwest Territories I cannot accept any substitute for them for the children under my spiritual guidance and I hereby ask the Northwest Territory Council to provide such schools whenever they are needed. The combination which you suggested cannot be thought of and must not be implemented in any part of the Northwest Territories.\n\nHoping that the above statement will clarify my position in the matter of Catholic education, I remain, dear sir,\n\nKeenleyside,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe attached is a copy of the letter which His Excellency Bishop J. Trocellier, Vicar Apostolic of Mackenzie, wrote to Mr. Keenleyside on October 30th last to clear up any misunderstanding as to the position he had taken in regard to the erection of the day-school at Hay River, and his stand in connection with Catholic education.\n\nBoth the general principles of the Catholic Church on education and his own personal opinion on the same point are expressed in such clear terms that it is not necessary for me to enlarge upon them.\n\nWe hope that your Department will be favourable to the policy which has been in force in both the departments of Indian Affairs and the Northwest Territories for close to a hundred years.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nHay River\n\nIt is expected that the village of Hay River will, on the completion of the highway from Grimshaw, become an important community. Fishing at Hay River is exceptionally good, the people always have sufficient to eat. Because of the good fishing several companies offer employment to Indians during the winter months. Up to the present additional employment with highway construction gangs has been available but I understand that since the Indian is not a reliable worker, there is a growing tendency to import white labour.\n\nThe Indians at Hay River have called for less action on my part than those in any other settlement. Miss Neville of the Anglican Mission attends to most of their medical problems, although she can do nothing about the Tuberculosis situation. There is a need, however, for a new modern nursing station at this community. Constable D. Allan of the R.C.M.

It is designed to handle not only the present but the future school population of Hay River. This town, it is anticipated, will grow rapidly when the new Grimshaw Highway is completed from Peace River. Hay River will be a northern terminus of this highway and will be on the main line of communication to Yellowknife.\n\nWe have introduced a new salary schedule recently, to become effective 1 September, 1948, with considerable increases over the salaries of 1947.\n\nIn the event that you are interested in further details of this position, I attach for your completion a copy of one of our application forms so that we can be brought up to date on your latest teaching experience.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nYour letter of 22nd inst. received and contents noted. Until the receipt of your letter I have not entertained any idea of returning to Indian Day Schools. However, I think I would like further information regarding the above reference.\n\nAt present I am the principal of a two-room school in this company town. Our accommodations are such that we have every convenience, electric lights, water, and the benefit of social life in a white community. I teach grades V to X and my wife handles the Junior room. Thus we are both gainfully employed.\n\nHowever, I am of an adventurous spirit and your frontier position has aroused my interest. In this connection would you advise me of the following:\n\nAre there any other whites in the community besides the school staff? Is there a store or trading post in this community? Is there a Mission Church in the community? What are the present means of transportation and communication with this outpost? Is there a resident doctor at Hay River or near there?\n\nIf you can give me further information as to the future development of this new community, I may consider applying for the position. But, please understand, I would have to first break my contract if possible with this school section.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph R. Douglas\n\nP.S. Kindly send me a copy of the new salary schedule.\nAugust 3, 1948.\n\nHay River Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Douglas:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 27 and wish to advise you that we would be prepared to hire both your wife and yourself. There is a considerable settlement of Whites in the Hay River community besides the intended school staff; in fact there is a Royal Canadian Signal Corps station and the headquarters of trucking firms who are using Hay River as the northern terminus of the Grimshaw highway. Transportation is by this new highway from Edmonton or by air from Edmonton.\n\nThere is a Roman Catholic Missionary at Hay River, but I cannot advise you as to whether he is permanently stationed there. However, in view of the fact that it is anticipated that Hay River will be the second largest town (next to Yellowknife) in the Territories, it is presumed one will be stationed there permanently.\n\nI cannot advise you with regard to the Doctor but hospital facilities are available at both Fort Resolution and Fort Providence. While the school will be a four-roomed one, we do not expect to have more than two teachers for the first year. As the town grows, other members will be added to the staff. Our salary schedule for teachers with first class certificates runs from $1,500.00 to $2,220.00 for the 10 month academic year and from $2,280.00 to $3,000.00 for the 12 month calendar year (Welfare Teachers).\n\nIf the school becomes a three-roomed one, you would be entitled to classification as a Principal Grade One.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

This refers to plumbers, heaters, electricians and sheet metal workers for hot-air furnace and duct installation. This has resulted in having to keep the carpenter crew at a smaller force than would otherwise be the case. However, all these tradesmen have either recently been at that point, or are engaged there now, so that it will be possible shortly to add more carpenters to the labour force. An estimate was given by Mr. Mattson on September 22nd, that with the crew then engaged, the project could be finished in January. However, as soon as it is practicable to do so, I am adding as many carpenters as appears reasonable for the size of the job, so as to be assured of completion during the present calendar year.\n\nShipping instructions as follows:\n\nTo reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Northern Transportation Company.\nDecember 7, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. M.

In fact, Roche River should be completed by that time and I would be pleased to recommend you for transfer to that school.\n\nI would ask you to write me further about this matter in May, when we will probably have more definite\ninformation concerning the progress made in its construction.\n\nIf there are over 40 children, we will certainly try to hire another teacher. If this is not possible, then I would ask that you have the primary children come in the morning and the older children in the afternoon, or vice versa. Many provincial schools are being run on this staggered system, due to the present shortage of teachers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. R.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCapitol Theatre Building,\n220 Queen St., Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Situation Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nA few days ago I forwarded to you a copy of Mr. Fred Fraser's report of January 20th regarding the school situation at Hay River, Northwest Territories.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner has written to Dr. P. E. Moore, Director of Indian Health Services, concerning an X-ray survey of all school children and the need of more frequent visits to Hay River by the Medical Health Officer of Fort Resolution.\n\nWe are writing to Fred Fraser for information regarding accommodation of a second teacher.\n\nI would suggest that you send a copy of Mr. Fraser's report of January 20th to Mr. W. J. Johnston, District Engineer, Department of Public Works, Edmonton, for his information and necessary action.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 2)\nFebruary 9, 1949.\n\nMajor MacKay\n\nAttention - Colonel Neary\n\nAdverting to discussions over the telephone with Colonel Neary, I may say that I referred to District Administrator Fred Fraser the report which Reverend Father Plourde had sent me about a discussion which Mr. Fraser had with the Hay River Board of Trade. A copy of Mr. Fraser's personal and confidential reply is attached.\n\nI called Father Plourde on the telephone and gave him the substance of what Mr. Fraser had reported to me. Father Plourde expressed regret that Mr. Fraser should have seen fit to discuss with the local Board of Trade a matter which was obviously controversial, without first referring to the department and getting direction. Father Plourde then went on to say that the Roman Catholic Church is of the opinion that it would not be an acceptable solution of the situation to have Roman Catholics taught in one room of the public school and the Protestants taught in another room. He considers that a separate building is required. I explained the difficulties of the situation at some length and said that it seemed to be the opinion of the departmental officers concerned with education in the Northwest Territories that children could be taught together, irrespective of religious persuasion, provided there was a time reserved at the beginning or the end of the day - or at some other convenient time - for the giving of religious instruction, and also that the principal of each school was of the religious denomination of the majority of the children and the other teacher was of the faith of the minority. However, I indicated that the subject would be discussed again at a meeting of the Subcommittee on Education which will be held tomorrow. Father Plourde asked me to have read at that meeting the recent letter written by Bishop Trocellier.\n\nColonel Neary and I have been discussing this matter and we believe that, as there is only a limited time for the discussions of the Subcommittee, it is quite unnecessary to go into\nthe argument about what Mr. Fraser said to the Board of Trade. We believe that we should spend our time deciding what instructions should be given to the school teacher who has written you for direction. As the school has been established by your branch, I would suggest that either yourself or Colonel Neary lead the discussion on this subject. Mr. Lamberton has been asked to put an item on the agenda.\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, February 7, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F.

A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached, herewith, are monthly Day School returns for the Hay River Indian Day School. You will note that one copy is for the Northwest Territory Administration files and the other two copies are to be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch for their information and retention.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Believance listed on the attached form all Indian children as being absent and the reason for same is given as their desire for a separate school on the island. In this connection, you might refer to my recent report on the Hay River Indian Day School. It should be borne in mind that initially the Indians of Hay River asked for the organization of the new school and indicated their desire for same by a signed petition. I am inclined to the view that both Mr. Believance and the local Priest are the parties desiring the separate school on the island and not the illiterate Indians.\n\nHad Mr. Believance desired the attendance of the Indian children, he would have visited their homes and solicited their support. There is absolutely no need for a separate school in Hay River as the present building\n\n........2\nwill meet the needs of the community for at least many years to come. There is a need, however, of implementing compulsory attendance within the Hay River Local Administrative District Unit, and, for the enforcement of same, a truant officer.\n\nThere are some 60 children living within the Hay River Local Administrative District and a number is being added each week. Therefore, there is only one method of operating the school efficiently, that is by the enforcement of regular attendance of those living in the immediate vicinity of the settlement. When children live permanently in a settlement, I can see no good reason for irregular school attendance and this is the case at Hay River.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n'sgd' J. W. McKinnon,\n\nJ. W.

W. McKinnon, together with two copies of the Monthly Day School Return for the month ending June 30, 1949.\n\nYou will note Mr. McKinnon's remarks regarding the question of providing for the education of the Indian children of the Hay River community. He is of the opinion that there is no need for a separate school at Hay River, as the school accommodation is quite ample. Also, he draws attention to the need of implementing compulsory attendance within the Hay River Local Administrative District Unit.\n\nWe should be pleased to have your views concerning these matters.\n\nR.

At the end of this time we will get a report from the Principal as to the care taken of the building during the time it is used as a community centre.\n\nIt is felt that the projector could then be kept in the school rather than in the community hall.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, 5 August, 1949.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources\n\nFor your information and comment, if necessary, I am attaching herewith copy of letter dated August 3d from District Engineer W. J. Johnston concerning the rates of wages paid to Mr. Obermuller, caretaker at Hay River school, up to July 22nd.\n\nR. BLAIS\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nIn the construction of the four-classroom day school and teacherage at Hay River, N.W.T., during the past year, it was necessary to retain the services of a janitor who would also act in the capacity of watchman. This arrangement became effective February 22, 1949, when work was suspended under Mr. Peter Mattson, contractor. Mr. Frank Obermuller had been engaged on the job for some time under Mr. Mattson and his services were continued in this joint watchman and janitor service. The rate of wages for workmen under the contract had been approved while the project was under the control of the Department of Mines and Resources, and the same wage scale was continued during the time (after June 1, 1948) when the Department of Public Works had supervision of the work. Mr. Obermuller was willing to remain on duty after the contract had been terminated, providing he received approximately the same pay as he was receiving when work was proceeding under the contractor. During the time the work was going on under the contractor, Mr. Obermuller received the benefit of board deductions at $1.25 per day.\n\nSince February 22, 1949, Mr. Obermuller has been engaged as follows:\n\n- Watchman - rate per month: $150.00\n- Board Allowance - per month: $75.00\n\nTotal: $225.00\n\nThis is the equivalent of $2,700.00 per year.\n\nSchool session started on July 15th, and Mr. Obermuller has temporarily terminated his services with the Department as of July 22nd. Mr. Obermuller has been in the office and advises me that the teacher at Hay River informed him he would only be allowed $2,300.00 per year if he remained as watchman of the school when the administration was taken over by the Department of Education in the Northwest Territories. He is unwilling to lose this $400.00 per year, but states he would continue at work if he received the same pay as he had received from this Department (Public Works).\n\nOur carpenter forces are completing work on the school project at Hay River, and it is expected work will be finished before school opens, presumably around September 1st. Thus, within the next month this school project will not be under the control of this Department, and its administration will, presumably, be under the Department of Education.\n\nI am writing at this time to draw this situation to your attention as the school buildings at Hay River are rather important structures and it is very necessary that a competent watchman with some general mechanical knowledge be available in order to operate the oil furnace, electric generator and other mechanical equipment.\nMr. Obermuller claims to have worked for some years as a journeyman electrician, although I have only his own word for this. His services while under this Department at Hay River are reported to be satisfactory.\n\nI would suggest this matter be brought to the attention of Col. Bernard F. Neary, Department of Education, Indian Affairs Branch. If I should have drawn this letter to the attention of someone in the Northwest Territories rather than to Col. Neary direct, I would be glad to be supplied with the name of the party concerned.\n\nW. J.

It is understood that the proposed projector is the 16 mm Visual Sound Educator priced at $665. The Northwest Territories Administration is prepared to contribute 50% of the cost.\n\nThis contribution will be made to the Hay River Community Society on the understanding that educational films will be shown to the children of the area, and that the projection equipment will be made available to the principal of the school for film showings as and when required.\n\nYour Society might wish to consider utilizing the Hay River school as a community centre for its various activities including film showings, handiwork classes, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, etc., in which event the projector could be kept in the school rather than in the community hall. The Indian Affairs Branch has intimated that it is prepared to have the Hay River school used as a community centre for a trial period ending June, 1950, at which time a report would be obtained from the principal as to the care taken of the building during the time used for community activities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn I.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, September 15, 1949.\n\nMajor MacKay, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nAs promised in our telephone conversation this morning I am sending you herewith:\n\n(1) A copy of a letter dated the 6th instant received from Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education for the Mackenzie District, to which is attached a copy of one dated the 29th ultimo written him by Mr. W. A. Bowerman, Principal of the Indian Day School at Hay River on the subject of religious instruction.\n\n(2) A copy of a letter dated the 26th of July written to me by Mr. McKinnon to which is attached a copy of one dated the 5th idem written him by Archdeacon D. B. Marsh.\n\nAs you are aware the Northwest Territories Council has approved of a manual of instructions to school teachers and mimeographed copies of this manual are being mailed now. This manual does not deal definitely with the matter of religious instruction although this subject has been discussed at a number of meetings of the sub-committee of the Northwest Territories Council on education. I am under the impression that the reason why no definite instruction was issued about religious instruction is because the Indian Act seems to contemplate religious instruction of some kind whereas the Northwest Territories Ordinance is not so definite on the subject and, in fact, there was an opinion that a child should not be compelled to take religious instruction against the wishes of the parents. In fact it was proposed for the Northwest Territories schools that there should be an alternative to religious instruction in the form of some non-religious but cultural study or exercise.\n\nThe records of the sub-committee seem to indicate that the opinion about religious instruction in the schools run by the Northwest Territories Administration could be summed up about as follows:\nShould any element of a community desire it, the last half-hour of the school day can be devoted to religious instruction. The parents of a child will determine whether the child shall receive instruction from a Roman Catholic Priest or a Protestant Clergyman, or, for that matter, no religious instruction whatever. The principal of the school will make arrangements for the convenience of the reverend gentlemen who will conduct the religious exercises. Those children who are not being given religious instruction will remain at school but their time will be occupied with special studies prescribed by the principal and in this connection musical appreciation, current events, visual education, handicrafts, vocational training and subjects in related fields are suggested for consideration. All teachers will remain on duty until 4 P.M. each day.\n\nHowever, as I said before, no definite order has been issued and no doubt there will be further discussion on the subject. The fact that religious instruction is one of the features that will probably be dealt with in the Indian Act to be considered at the present session of Parliament, seems to indicate that the issuance of an item for the manual of instructions to teachers might be delayed for a while. However, I take it that when Mr. Bellevance was acting as Principal of Hay River School you gave him some instruction on this subject although it is possible that he did not leave these instructions on file for his successor.\n\nNo doubt you will be discussing this subject with our Deputy Minister and I shall be glad indeed to receive a copy of the letter you write to Principal Bowerman so that we may advise Superintendent McKinnon and also have the information available for the next meeting of the sub-committee on education.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nBox 117,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\nJuly 26, 1949.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached herewith is copy of letter from Archdeacon D. B. Marsh.\n\nIt appears that there would be considerable value in dismissing school at 3:30 p.m. for purposes of having the children go to the Church for religious instruction. This policy is followed at Fort Rae and could easily be put into effect in the Mackenzie District as the Church is in the centre of most settlements. This policy would remove the common criticism that there is too much religion in the school.\n\nThis letter is submitted for your information and in the hope that there may be some future solution to this problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) J.

A cheque will be issued in favour of the teacher for the four months in these two quarters.\n\nHowever, I wish to draw your attention to circular letter of May 10th, 1940, a copy of which is enclosed. You will note from this that between April 1st, 1940, and March 31st, 1941, provision is made for only nine months' salary for each teacher of an Indian day school. Mr. Richards was paid for three months in the June quarter and four months in the September and December quarters, making a total of seven months for which he has received salary. Consequently, we can only pay for two months in the March quarter.\n\nIf Mr. Richards so desires, the school may be closed for either the month of February or March, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. J.

H. Sovereign, Bishop of Athabasca, wrote to the Department on August 10, 1944, suggesting that Miss Neville could teach the school and requesting information regarding what amount we could allow her for her services. In reply to that communication he was written as follows on August 24:\n\n\"I have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the day school at Hay River.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your suggestion that Nurse Neville be allowed some remuneration for teaching the school for a short period during the past few months. I regret that as Nurse Neville is paid salary as a full-time nurse, present regulations do not permit our making a separate payment for her services in operating the school.\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6472)\n\nFile 904-1, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Norman Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1914 - 1922\n\nFile 904-1, part 2\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Norman Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1936 - 1949\n\nFile 904-3, part 1,\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Norman Day School -\nTeachers' Salaries-General Administration.\n1915 - 1947\n\nFile 904-5, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Norman Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1947 - 1949\n\nFile 905-1, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Residential\nSchool - General Administration. 1898 - 1935\n\nFile 905-1, part 2\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Residential\nSchool - General Administration. 1935 - 1949\n\nFile 905-2, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nQuarterly Returns. 1938 - 1944\n\nFile 905-3, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1938 - 1945\n\nFile 905-4, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nSupplies. 1939 - 1951\n\nFile 905-5, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Residential\nSchool - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1912 - 1930\n\nFile 905-5, part 2\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nEstablishment (plans). 1931 - 1948\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | P.A.

Requisitions marked \"Indian\" should be forwarded immediately to Colonel B. F. Neary, for purposes or being filled by their Branch. I would suggest that the remaining requisitions be placed by our Branch as there are over one hundred White children attending the above school. You will note that there are four classrooms in operation at Hay River which accounts for the size of this requisition. There is also the possibility that some two hundred children will be enrolled at this school after the summer vacation.\n\nAs this is a new school, there is great need of plenty of reference material and reading books. All supplies should be forwarded to\n\nW. A. Bowerman,\nHay River Indian Day School,\nHAY RIVER, N. W. T.,\nVia Mae's Transport, Edmonton.\n\nBy using this address, it will be forwarded to the Principal of the Hay River school via the Mackenzie Highway.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n'sgd' J. W.

These lists were forwarded to this Office by Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education for the Mackenzie District, Northwest Territories.\n\nWe attach a copy of Mr. McKinnon's letter in this connection.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nMarch 2, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Grantham:\n\nMr. W. Bowerman, teacher, Hay River Indian Day School has requested certain school supplies which it is felt would be used by non-Indian children as the highest grade in which Indian children are graded is Grade 2.\n\nI am forwarding to you the request for materials required for teaching typewriting which is not intended for use by Indian children, also a request for certain science equipment and blackboard work supplies.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Grantham,\nBureau of N.W.T. & Yukon,\nNorlite Bldg.,\nOttawa.\n\nEncl:\n\nMFT/HM\nMarch 2, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Bowerman:\n\nIt is indeed unfortunate that you did not see fit to read and follow the instructions in the February 1, 1949 issue of the Indian School Bulletin in connection with the library books available to Indian schools.\n\nAs in previous years the only library books available to schools are those listed in the Bulletin annually and only these books will be supplied.\n\nOur stock is almost depleted and we are not able to give you a choice of books available at this late date, and no action is taken on your latest request as shown on the form mimeographed in green ink.\n\nTo help your school out we are arranging to send you a quantity of books, but this favour will not be extended again unless a requisition is submitted for books that will be listed in the Bulletin annually.\n\nYou might be interested to know that in the next issue of the Bulletin, March 1, 1950 there will be a new list and full instructions on Supplementary Reading books for the academic year 1950-51.\n\nI expect that you will be taking advantage of the offer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Conroy on the Boarding Schools in Treaty No. 8 and Mackenzie District. Dated December 18/11. Original on File 160370-19E.\n\nHAY RIVER.\n\nThe Mission is situated on the east bank of the Hay river, about a quarter of a mile from its mouth. It is far enough back from Great Slave Lake to escape the sweep of wind and is further sheltered by a varied growth of fair-sized timber.\n\nThe school is an old building, the original log house has been added to from time to time to meet the steady increase of attendance. The result is not all that might be desired. The ceilings of the first two stories are low, the lighting is insufficient and the ventilation poor. The third story, however, is very much higher, having for ceiling the gable roof and the lighting and ventilation are extremely good. The ground floor of the original building consists of a large class room 22 x 17.7 x 8.5 a bedroom, study and rather dark stairs leading to the upper floor.\n\nThe accompanying snap-shot will show the locations of the several additions. A is the original main building, B containing kitchen and pantry, joins the main building at C. This latter contains a dining room 21.8 x 15.7 x 7; a pantry and small bedroom. The upper floor is one large room, used as an annex to the main dormitory. D is a single story lean-to, 22 x 18 x 8 at the low end, and is used as the main\nHay River, cont.\n\nschool room. It is well lighted and fairly ventilated.\n\nIt will be seen, however, that the numerous additions to the main building do not tend to make a convenient boarding school. I understand that Bishop Holmes intends tearing away the additions next summer, and erecting a new building adjoining the main one. When the new building is finished it will afford greatly increased accommodation; and I think the school will be entitled to a materially increased grant as soon as the wing is in operation. The present buildings will accommodate, in the class rooms floor space 785-49 pupils: cubic space 6478 - 25 pupils: and in the dormitories 1375 feet floor space, and cubic space 12,000 ft. 24 pupils. The present average attendance is 32.\n\nThere are four cellars, one 10 x 10 x 5.6, floored and walled in planks, one 8 x 8 x 5.6, walled in logs: one 9 x 9 x 5 walls and floor of planks: and one 10x 10 x 6, also walled and floored with planks. These serve as store rooms for vegetables etc.\n\nThe foundations of the buildings are wooden blocks. The walls are of substantial logs, lime plastered. The main building has a plank roof/ but the additions boast metallic shingles.\n\nFive stoves are used for heating during the winter, oil lamps for the staff and candles for the pupils.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from the river; a pump is used in summer/ but two large holes are dug through the ice in winter. Barrels for storing water are conveniently situated.\n\nThere are no fire extinguishers, but pails are always kept filled and ready, and axes for emergencies are placed near the doors. In summer the garden hose is kept attached to the pump: a fire bell, is so situated that it can\nbe rung from either outside or inside the building, and can be heard as far as the Hudson's Bay store. Fire drill is regularly practised, and an excellent record has been established. In summer every pupil is outside the building in less than a minute. In winter the pupils, attired in sufficient clothing, are outside the building in less than three minutes. The older children are trained to assist the younger ones.\n\nThe class work follows pretty closely the regulations laid down by the Department. Besides this, there is considerable attention paid to the general practical knowledge so essential to the Indian boy or girl. The boys are taught the use of saw, axe and plane, and are kept at work until they are capable of erecting a house. They learn to haul and square logs, and set them in place. They learn general farm work; are proficient at breaking ground and tending it, and learn to milk and tend cattle. The Mission deserves to be highly commended for its practical and efficient work.\n\nThe latrines, three in number are all outside. New holes are dug every year. The outbuildings include a house for cleaning fish; for storing fish, with a cellar for ice; a shop, a tool house/stable, warehouse\u2014a new building 2\u00bd stories high; two woodsheds; staff's dwelling; church; 2 sled stores and an interpreters house. The stables are well away from the dwelling houses. All the outbuildings are in good repair.\n\nThere are nine or ten acres of land under cultivation as garden. This year the crop of potatoes amounted to over 1,000 bushels.\n\nThe Mission owns two milch cows, one bull, three calves. Young heifers are to be sent in in the spring. A horse formerly used for ploughing and hauling wood has strayed into the woods and has failed to be located.\n\nI would recommend that the Department send in a few\nHay River concluded.\n\nfire extinguishers. The school room needs some wall maps of Canada, and particularly of the North Country. A Globe would be very beneficial and Ogilvies and McConnell's charts of the North would be also useful.\n\nTwo dozen more slates, with pencils are needed. I would mention in connection with all the schools in my district, that when occasionally the annual reports from the Principals go astray, or are delayed, it is on account of the difficult and unreliable mail service.\nDear Sir,\n\nI now write to ask you to furnish me with full details required to proceed with the erection of a new Indian Boarding School House at Hay River Great Slave Lake, to replace the one now in use.\n\nI believe the late Bishop Holmes was in possession of such details, but owing to his death in England, they are not available just now, and as we can have things imported but once a year it is necessary for us to act at once or a year's delay must ensue.\n\nMay I therefore ask for an early reply to enable me to take immediate steps to secure the needed articles to be imported?\n\nI am\n\nYours obediently,\n\nRev. Mr. J. Dale\n(Principal of School now at home on furlough)\nOttawa, April 4, 1912.\n\nRev., Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo asking to be furnished with full details necessary to proceed with the erection of a new Indian boarding school at Hay River, Great Slave Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before the Department can deal intelligently with this matter it should know how many pupils you contemplate providing for and what amount of money will be available for the erection of the building. As the Department has no details as to the style of building the late Bishop Holmes contemplated putting up it would be glad if you would give full particulars as to what you think would be required and the Department will then endeavour to prepare plans which will meet your needs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Alf. J. Vale,\n627 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 170367/5 under date of April 4, 1912, I beg to say I also have no details as to the style of building the late Bishop Holmes contemplated putting up for the Indian Boarding School at Hay River.\n\nWe are anxious to erect a building which shall comply with the standard of Government requirements for such a school as will accommodate at least (40) forty children, male and female. We expect it to cost from $3,000.00 to $5,000.00. Much of this money will have to be paid out in freighting the necessary building materials into the country.\n\nWe are limited to frame or log building as no other material is within reach, and shall greatly appreciate any help you can give us by suggesting a plan or outlining the required air space in Class Room.\nand dormitories for such a school.\n\nMay I also ask you to mail me two copies of the Agreement Circular, so that I may forward one to Archdeacon Lucas and have one for my own use.\n\nTrusting this letter may enable you to furnish us with the desired information.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nAlf. J. Vale\nOttawa, April 30, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply I beg to say that, under separate cover, you are being sent two copies of the Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nThe Department realizes that owing to the difficulty of transporting material it is not possible for you and others similarly situated in the northern country to erect modern buildings. It is necessary, however, to have the required air space both in the class-rooms and dormitories, which is 250 cubic feet per pupil in the former and 500 cubic feet in the latter. There should also be hospital accommodation for the isolation of pupils ill with infectious diseases. Outside water closets should be kept in a sanitary condition.\n\nIt is also possible to provide a certain amount of ventilation even in the most simply constructed buildings. In the class-room this can be provided by running a six or seven inch pipe, either galvanized iron or ordinary stove piping, from the stove pipe down to within six inches of the floor to sit on, say, three supports. This will draw off the foul air from the floor and it will be carried away in the smoke pipe through the chimney. This vertical pipe can be placed at any convenient Rev. Alf. J. Vale,\n627 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-5, part 1)\nconvenient position between the stove and the chimney. The dormitories and other rooms may also be ventilated to a certain extent, provided there is a large chimney from the ground floor up. If openings are made into this chimney near the floor and shutters provided so that they can be closed if necessary it will be found that a great deal of the impure air will be carried away by this means through the chimney. All the windows should be made so that they can be lowered from the top as well as raised from the bottom.\n\nFrom the above information in regard to the cubic air space you will be able to calculate the dimensions of your building for forty pupils. I am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of a plan prepared last year for a boarding school for forty pupils on the Sarcee Indian Reserve, Alberta. This plan was not used, but it may be that from it you can get some ideas as to the laying out of your building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nAthabasca Landing, Alta.,\nMay 23, 1912.\n\nJ.

You will remember that these girls were on their way to the Hay River Boarding School, but were quarantined at Chipewyan by Dr. Macdonald on account of measles, and were sent back to their home. Under these circumstances, I hope the Department will see its way to refund this amount to the Diocese, and will ask that the cheque be sent to the Imperial Bank at Athabasca, to credit of the Mackenzie River Diocese account.\n\nMay I also remind you of your promise to speak to Mr. Scott respecting the supply of at least 50 feet of lumber for the Hay River Building.\n\nI hope to see you shortly in Ottawa before leaving for England.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJas.

Lucas,\nBishop of MacKenzie Diocese,\nFort Chipewyan, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 29th ultimo, addressed to our Home Office in Toronto has been forwarded to us at Regina as business for the West is transacted through our Regina Office.\n\nWe are sending you under separate cover one of our General Catalogues, in the front part of this you will find a good description of our Windmills. These Windmills come in different sizes. The size which is used for Pumping Water is usually an 8' Wheel or a 10' Wheel. The size of the Wheel depends to a large extent on the depth of the well from which the water is to be pumped. The height of the tower depends to a large extent on the location of the well. If there is a considerable amount of brush or trees near the well, it is, of course, necessary to have a higher tower. However, if the land is fairly open it is not necessary to have a Tower of as great a height as where the brush or trees are in evidence.\n\nThe regular price of an 8' Wheel is $47.00, this includes the large galvanized wheel and also the Gearings and Pump Rods. The price of a 30' Galvanized Steel Tower is $63.00 making a total of $110.00 F.O.B. Regina. The price of a 10' Wheel is $62.00 and a 30' Tower for a 10' Wheel is $65.00, making a total of $127.00. Should you require a wheel only which you could use when you erected a wooden tower the price would be $47.00 for an 8' wheel and $62.00 for a 10' wheel. This price would include everything except the tower.\n\nAs we have no Representative in your part of the country we would be willing to allow you a wholesale discount off the above quotations and also in view of the fact that this will be used for School purposes we would allow an extra discount of 5% or in other words a total discount of 25% from the prices quoted.\nBishop's House,\nChipewyan, Alberta\nJanuary 15th, 1917\n\nThe Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs the new Boarding School at St. Peter's Mission, Hay River, Great Slave Lake, N.W.T., is approaching completion, I beg to submit the following Requisition for School Material, which you kindly promised to supply when needed.\n\nSCHOOL DESKS for 50 pupils, with shelf underneath for books.\n50 Iron Beds, complete, for children, with Mattress if possible.\n4 Full-sized Single Beds for the Staff, with Mattress.\n1 Full-sized Double Bed\n\nThe question of supplying Beds for the Staff was not brought up by me last Spring. I hope the Indian Department will make the Grant for this purpose. Whether or not this is possible, I will ask you to be kind enough to write to Miss K. Nelson, Dorcas Sec. W.A., 249 Albany Avenue, Toronto, Ont., and inform her of your action respecting the same, as I have prepared her for a letter from you on the subject.\n\nIf it is not customary for the Department to place orders for Desks and Beds, with firms, I shall be grateful if you will send particulars of what may be ordered on account of the new School, to Miss Nelson, who has had much experience in procuring such things for other Schools, e.g., \"The Pas\" in Saskatchewan. This will avoid several months delay. The goods should be shipped in knock-down condition, and forwarded, freight paid, to the Hudson's Bay Co., Peace River, Alta., and addressed,\n\nThe Indian School,\nHay River, Great Slave Lake, N.W.T.\nC/O H.B.Co., Peace River, Alta.\n\nWINDMILL.\n\nYour Mr. Bury informed me last Summer that your Department would be willing to supply a Windmill Outfit for the use of the School. This will prove a great boon in many ways, and I hope therefore, you will consent to its purchase and erection this year. We have provision for the erection of a large water tank at the top of the new building, to hold from 500 to 1000 gallons. This will serve as a protection from fire, and also for necessary uses in the school. The Windmill will be used in connection with the above.\n\nAs a good PUMP will also be needed, I would ask for this, together with piping necessary to reach from the river to the cistern. #350 feet of piping will be required for this purpose.\n\nIf you will please send your reply to this by the 22nd or 23rd of the month, it will reach me by the mail leaving Athabasca on March 1st.\n\nI enclose two letters from Firms dealing in Windmills. As the depth to be reached will be less than 30 feet, the 8 feet wheel will be large enough. The Tower should be 30 feet high.

Will you please see that these are included.\n\nI have asked the Indian Department to furnish us with an Acetylene Gas Outfit. This, I think, they will do. I shall be glad therefore if you will get some information respecting this light which will prove useful in the future. The R.C. Bishop says the light is satisfactory, but he has had some trouble with the automatic \"shut off\" which does not shut off, automatically or otherwise, and so much Carbide is wasted. His generator is installed in the basement, and I suppose ours would be there also. I do not know what is the usual method adopted by the Department in respect of such plants, whether they choose to order direct with any particular Firm, or leave that to the grantees. It would save much valuable time if you would kindly inquire at the office of the Indian Department as to what has been done in this matter.\n\nMr. Bury knows all the facts connected with this matter. If you are able to communicate with the Firm which is to supply the Plant, you will need the Plan of the Building showing what piping and fittings would be required. This I am enclosing for your guidance. Should it become known to you that the Plant will not be installed this year, I should advise you to order some Coal Oil for your own use.\n\nI have also asked the Department for a WINDMILL, Pump, and 350 feet of Piping. The size of the pipe has just reached me from Hay River, viz., 1\u00bd inch. Of course connections and elbows will be needed. Mr. Vale has sent the following illustration of the \"LIFT\" of the pump, thus,\n\n\"Lift will be about 25 feet. Distance from River about 225'.\"\n\nI suppose it would be better for the Firm which supplies the Windmill to furnish the piping, also the pump. Otherwise, the Marshall-Wells Alberta Co., Edmonton, would do it as well as anybody as they are shipping a lot of material for me to Hay River. I hereby authorize you to act for me in procuring the material necessary for the above if the Grant has been made by the Indian Department for the Gas Plant and the Windmill. It will be wise to get \"spares\" of parts easily broken. It all will have to be shipped C/O H.B.Co., Peace River Freight, prepaid to that point. If not prepaid, then, C/o H.B.Co., Edmonton. I hope this will not burden you too much. We expect this to be the last mail but for the winter, hence the urgency to get this out.\nFreeze & Dobbin,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\n200 feet of 1 inch gas pipe with wrot. couplings\n36 tee fittings for \u00bd inch pipe with 3/8\" drop\n100 feet of \u00bd inch pipe with wrot. couplings\n125 elbows 3/8\" pipe\n36 tees 3/8\" pipe\n200 feet of 3/8\" gas pipe with wrot. couplings\n50 caps for 3/8\" pipe\n10 half inch tees with 3/8\" drops\n60 feet 1\u00bd\" gas pipe with 6 tees for 1\" branches\n350 feet of 1\u00bd\" threaded galvanized iron water pipe with wrot. couplings.\n\nThe material to be shipped addressed Indian School,\nHay River, Great Slave Lake, N.W.T. in care of the Hudson Bay Company, Peace River, Alberta, freight prepaid to that point.\nOttawa, April 26, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nOn February 12th last the Department wrote the Rt. Rev. J. Lucas, Bishop Of MacKenzie Diocese, Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, authorizing him to purchase from you for the Hay River Boarding School the water and gas pipes required there as per the accompanying list. If this has not already been supplied per his order, I have to request that you will at once forward the material listed prepaid to his address. The account for material and freight to be sent to the Department in duplicate for payment.\n\nAs it is necessary that the supplies should be forwarded at once that they may be taken in with the other supplies already sent forward, this should have your immediate attention, and as there is a rather difficult portage to make the parcels should be such that transport will be as easy as possible. The material should also be cut to length with threads, etc., on pipes so as to facilitate erection as much as possible before leaving your premises, the goods to be shipped as per address on the material list.\n\nThe list of piping etc. and sketch plan of lights is inclosed in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMessrs.

Deputy and Secretary.\nApril 26, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn my letter to you of February 12th last in reference to water and gas pipes, etc., for the Hay River School, you were advised to purchase the material as listed from Messrs. Freeze and Dobbin of Edmonton, provided these had not already been installed in the building. As it appears from your letter of the 9th ultimo addressed to Mr. Hunter, that you had not at that time been in receipt of mine and that the necessary material may go forward as soon as possible, I have sent the list direct to Freeze and Dobbin requesting them to have same shipped at once (if not previously ordered) addressed to the Hay River School as per your instructions. The other goods supplied by us have already gone forward and will no doubt be received in due course.\n\nThe acetylene burners and fixtures necessary have been delivered to your Mr. Hunter here and will be shipped by him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRt.

No two wells present the same pumping problem; distances the water must be piped vary, and the water supply demands in terms of size and quantity is different in almost every installation; therefore, a system that is not especially planned to meet each peculiar condition cannot be expected to give efficient service. It is too much like trying to stop a square hole with a round peg.\n\nIn spite of the fact that each Hoosier System is planned separately, you will find their first cost is no more than other systems and their operating expense is far less. You will find that Hoosier Systems are easily within the financial reach of those of moderate means. We have outfits ranging in size from hand outfits suitable for the smallest home to those which will supply an entire village with an abundance of water under high pressure.\n\nOn this page a number of Hoosier Systems are illustrated. In our catalogue a great many more are shown. These, however, are shown simply as examples, and are only a few of the many combinations and arrangements that are possible with Hoosier Systems. They are all operated by hand windmill, gasoline engine, or electric motor. We will gladly place at your disposal any one that will insure the most satisfactory service and lowest cost. The cost of these outfits will run from $50 up and considering this small cost there is no longer any reason why every home should not enjoy all the convenient and sanitary features of running water under pressure.\n\nFlint & Walling Manufacturing Company\nKendallville, Indiana, U. S. A.\nHOOSIER Pneumatic Water Supply Systems bring to the country home the greatest convenience enjoyed by city residents\u2014running water under pressure throughout all parts of the home and over the premises. This was a time when this was looked upon as a great luxury in country homes; but now, higher standards of living, recognition of the vital importance of the sanitary conditions secured through the modern water supply system, and the great amount of labor saved, have brought us to a point where running water under pressure, is considered a necessity in the home.\n\nWITH a Hoosier Pneumatic Water Supply System you may have running water throughout every room, sleeping rooms and laundry; you may have hydrants about the premises for filling stock tanks, sprinkling the lawn and garden and for flushing the stables. In case of fire there is a large supply of water under pressure ready for instant use; and in such a case a Hoosier System will be worth many times its cost.\n\nFLINT & WALLING MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nKENDALLVILLE, INDIANA, U. S. A.\n\nYOU may not be familiar with the great progress that has been made within the last few years in improving and simplifying water supply systems; if you will now look into this carefully, you will find that Hoosier Systems are simplicity itself and that any one can learn in a very few minutes all that is necessary to know about operating them. When once properly installed it is automatic, simple, odorless and trouble-free to run them. A great many Hoosier Systems are entirely automatic and will furnish an abundant supply of water without you going near them for weeks at a time.\n\nWE want you to send for our catalogue, which tells all about Hoosier Pneumatic Water Supply Systems; how simple, efficient and inexpensive they are, and how they make life more pleasant for every member of the household. Reading this catalogue will undoubtedly open your eyes to a great many facts about water supply systems that you have been overlooking. Send for it today.\n\nTHINK of the steps and work it will save when washday comes 'round\n\nYOU\u2019ll have hydrant connections for flushing the stables and for fighting fires\nThe Model 12 Star Windmill 2 has won its own way into the favor of the windmill buying public. It has proved for itself that it has no equal. Star Windmills found their way to the world's market almost half a century ago and more than a million have since done service in the various civilized countries throughout the world.\n\nThe Model 12 Star is perfectly aligned, has a direct centre lift, and is perfectly equalizes its load. Where there is perfect alignment, direct centre lift and perfect equalization of load, there can be no unequal strains. Where there are no unequal strains there can be no undue friction. Where there is no undue friction there can be no uneven wear. And finally, where there is no uneven wear there can be no unwarranted breakages with the consequent repair bills and the inconvenience of being without water when water is most needed. All this means that the Model 12 Star is designed and manufactured to whirl on smoothly and silently long after the average windmill has outlived its usefulness.\n\nAlmost two windmills in one\n\nThe Model 12 Star Windmill 2 is almost two windmills in one; not only in the matter of lasting efficiency but in design and construction, too.\n\nIt has two pitmans, two gears, two pinions, and two wrist pins. Each one of these parts bears only one-half the strain borne by the single parts on mills so constructed. Moreover, each two of these parts, as found in the Model 12 Star Windmill equally divide all loads and strains and distribute them squarely and evenly. This \"double construction\" is largely responsible for the Model 12 Star's extreme responsiveness, its unusual durability and its all-round efficiency.\n\nThe pitmans are truss-shaped to give them extra strength; they are well braced and ribbed and capable of many times the load they would be compelled to carry; fitted with heavy ball-bushed bearings, easily and quickly removable, and have an extra big key well. Without these pitmans, even though there were two gears and two pinions, the load could not be so equally distributed.\n\nThe two gears are extra wide and are attached so as to make it impossible for them to bind with the pinions after the mill has been in service a year or two. The pinions also, are extra wide so as to give added strength to the main shafts, and are securely keyed to the shafts. It will be noted that the bearings are supported on both sides. This construction prevents the pinions from wearing out of mesh reduces to the minimum the strain within the bearings.\n\nThe wrist pins are big and powerful, made from the best grade of steel and furnished with castellated nuts which cannot possibly work loose to impair the efficiency of the mill.\n\nAn extra long cold-rolled, polished steel drive shaft of liberal diameter is easily able to bend all weights and strains upon it and makes possible extra long bearings\u2014mighty factors toward durability.\n\nFlint & Walling Manufacturing Company\n\nManufacturers of the famous Star Windmills for almost half a century\n\nKendallville, Indiana, U.S.A.\nBecause it is big and powerful, smooth and silent running.\n\nBecause it is perfectly aligned and stays perfectly aligned.\n\nBecause it has a direct centre lift and it perfectly equalizes its load.\n\nBecause it is a frictionless windmill.\n\nBecause it is almost two windmills in one\u2014two sets of gears, two shafts and two pinions.\n\nBecause it has a shock absorber, also a swinging cone-shaped brake which applies gently but firmly.\n\nBecause it has extra long removable machine finished babbitted bearings.\n\nBecause it has a big, solid one-piece main frame which is designed not to be tilted out of alignment; an extra long cold-rolled polished steel drive shaft.\n\nBecause in the Model 12 Star there is an efficient system of oiling.\n\nBecause it has a strong compression steel governor.\n\nBecause it has a powerful galvanized after-completion wheel.\n\nAn end to oiling troubles\n\nWith a Model 12 Star Windmill it is no longer necessary to mount the lower every few days to oil the mill.\n\nAt each wearing point there is an extra big grease cup. The mill is packed with cotton waste or wool thoroughly saturated with a good clean windmill oil which does not congeal or become gummy, will keep the bearings lubricated for months, even for weeks. An occasional oiling is about the only attention the Model 12 Star requires. The Model 12 Star's lubrication has done much to make it popular the world over.\n\nPerfect equalization of load\n\nA glance at the above illustration makes plain that in a mill so constructed there must be perfect equalization of load.\n\nThe crosshead, to which the angle iron pump rod is bolted, is directly over the load. It is not concealed, rather it is the walking beam which first takes the load and applies it smoothly and evenly to the pitmans.\n\nThe walking beam is nothing more than a combined guide and oil well. Neither the pitmans nor the pump rod connects to the walking beam. This is exclusive Star construction which prevents from 30 to 40 per cent excess friction.\n\nStar rudders never droop. The rudder hinge is not made in one piece and is constructed so as to form an almost perfect square. It is flexible enough to soften the shocks of strong winds. The rudder stem is V-shaped. It connects the rudder to the rudder hinge and is strong enough to always hold the rudder in its proper position.\n\nFlint & Walling Manufacturing Company\n\nOperating the largest factory of its kind in the world\n\nKendallville, Indiana, U.S.A.\nS.

I hope therefore that you will confirm this.\n\nWith this reservation, I gladly confirm the arrangement you have outlined in your letter.\n\nIn reply to your letter of Feb. 12th, No. 170367-Sty, I have not placed the order for piping, so am sending your requisition for\nsame to Messrs Freese & Dobbin, Edmonton, by this mail, and shall carry out your instructions respecting the forwarding of the account to your Department for payment after certifying to the receipt of the goods.\n\nI note that nothing has been said regarding a pump, and am therefore instructing Freese and Dobbin to supply a pump for use with the windmill, as the latter will be useless without it. Will you please let me know if it will be in order to charge this against the Department also. I sincerely hope it will, but in any case the pump must be procured even though we have to bear the cost.\n\nGratefully acknowledging the help your Department is giving in connection with our school,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\nJune 5th, 1917.\n\nMost Rev.

I think it much better to allow the church authorities to arrange this transportation and pay for it in the first place, as they will no doubt obtain closer prices than the Department would.\n\nWith reference to the pump I have to inform your Lordship that this was ordered from a firm in Regina at the same time as the wind-mill, and will be paid for by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRight Rev.

Vale, asking for details, upon which I could base a report. Not having received any reply, I have again written him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nSt. Peter's Mission\nHay River\nMackenzie District, N.W.T., Canada\n\nNovember 25, 1918\n\nG. Carl Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of Sept. 10 which reached me too late for the last mail I now have pleasure in sending by chance passerby to Fort Resolution. I trust you will get it a month sooner in that way.\n\nRegarding the food given last year to the village children as per account rendered by Bishop Lucas, would say this means a full meal given as per Boarding pupils. When the children attend the school they are invited to sit down at the table with the regular Boarders and fare the same. This food generally consist of such food as we can secure in the country e.g. Fish and country meat, potatoes and vegetables grown on our farm. During my absence on furlough last year a new system a food was established giving a much larger proportion of food imported such as Flour, beans rice butter bacon rolled oats etc. Some of the flour cost as high as $20.00 per hundred lbs as it was secured in the country to augment the former supply. When these things are placed before the Department I feel certain they will see at once the charge was not too high. Our usual custom is to feed the children as much as possible along the lines they are likely to be able to secure on their return home. This we consider wise for the following reasons. The change of food will be less severe on their constitutions and they will be more readily satisfied with their lot again among their own people. Furthermore we have in the past found too much heavy food does not agree\nwith them physically. Trusting this will convey the desired information.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMrs. Vale joins in sending very best wishes to you and your family for a very MERRY CHRISTMAS and A HAPPY NEW YEAR.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSir,- I beg to herewith attach a report received at this office since writing on the 19th Inst.

Manager.\nLIGHTING OF THE SCHOOL.\n\nAgain I quote from Canon Vale's letter.\n\n\"The Acetylene Gas has not been so satisfactory as in other years, and has given signs of possible danger of explosion. One slight explosion did occur when under repairs. No damage done. The plant is showing signs of need for repair. What do you think of a new system? I think you broached the subject one time. I am inclined to think well of what is known as the Delco Light. It is an Electric system and Automatic by means of a small gasoline engine. Said engine could be used for the Laundry and Ironing, etc., would be very convenient, clean and cool in the summer.\n\nYou will notice I have not ordered any Carbide. That was really an oversight, but if you think well of it may be a good miss. I suppose it had better be laid before the Commission. Will you take it up with them. We have never had enough light for the year and have to be very careful over it and stint the staff under the present system. They have approached me with a suggestion that they contribute some of their money and get a larger supply that they may have a good light all the Winter. I have had to ask them to economize and they are nearly out as it is. With the new system I have suggested the initial cost would be heavier but in the course of, say, five years it would be saved and the cost then would be a very small fraction of the present. In addition, it could be extended to the Church House, stable and hospital.\"\n\nRegarding the above, I had intended bringing the matter to your notice during your visit. The present system was installed by the Indian Dept., but I was never greatly encouraged with it. Its annual cost is nearly $200.00 and as explained above, does not meet all the requirements of the school and staff (though I have never sought to stint the latter and have ordered whatever was requisitioned by the Principal. I expect he thought the cost was already too high and so placed this restriction upon it).\n\nAs to any new system proposed, I feel that you have had so much experience in this direction that you will be able to deal with this matter effectually. If you decide to act this year, it would be well to advise Mr. Vale at once as to the particulars which will be needed before any order can be placed for the material.\n\nIf not, will you please send the usual order to Marshall Wells Alberta Co., Edmonton for 1400 lbs FBA CARBIDE.\n\nThe cost of Gasoline would have to be taken into account if used in connection with any proposed system. You might reckon it at about $1.10 per gallon, cost landed at Hay River.\n\nHoping the above will not add unduly to your burdens.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(signed) Jas R. Mackenzie River.\nToronto, Ontario, April 13, 1923,\n41-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith an extract from a letter from Bishop Lucas dated February 20, 1923, concerning the lighting system at the Hay River School.\n\nFrom what the Bishop has written, and this is confirmed by Canon Vale, the Principal of the School, you will see that the present acetylene gas system, which has already had one slight explosion, and appears now to be in a positively dangerous condition, should be removed, and another system installed.\n\nIf you will kindly give this matter very careful attention I shall be deeply obliged. I am endeavouring to arrange to visit the Hay River School during the coming summer and would be glad to be able to inform the Principal and his staff at that time that you are going to provide them with the comfort and safety which a new lighting system would afford.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-5, part 1)\nOttawa, April 23, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to a lighting system for the Hay River Indian Boarding School.

The total amount which I have paid in this connection is $476.25.

You should have one receipted account, properly certified by yourself or the principal, for each of the four items, attached to one of the vouchers in your favour.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe present building, standing as it does on a point of land built up of sedimentary deposit, has begun to subside, with a result that the side walls have bulged out, the apex of the roof has curved in, the floors have lost their level, neither doors nor windows fit their frames. All efforts to prevent the subsidence have failed, and a new main School building is considered necessary.\n\nA suitable site can be found about three or four miles further up the Hay River. Building stone could be procured for the basement, but timbers and lumber would have to be secured. Suitable timber can be found on the banks of Hay River, and as the Society have men on the school staff who could manage the engine and saw-mill, they hope that these may be provided next year, in order that timbers and lumber may be prepared for the building of the new School not later than 1925.\n\nIt is thought that a plant similar to the one installed at Lao la Honge would meet the purpose. Should this be thought too expensive it should be born in mind that (a) the engine should not have less than 25 horse power, (b) the rip-saw, which should have inserted teeth, and not be less than 36 inches in diameter, and, (c) that the outfit should include carrier planer and all other appliances required for converting logs into dressed lumber.\nRev.

The foundations are getting weak and are spreading and the whole structure should be raised and put on solid blocks, so as to save the frame which could be used later on either as hospital or farm house, in the event of a new construction being made. Some of the apartments should also be fixed with steel ceiling and one dormitory lined with beaver board. The whole cost of these repairs asked for by Mr. Stoddard would amount to approximately two thousand dollars - the work to be done by a local contractor from Resolution, who has the equipment to raise the building. The work would be done as soon as your approval would be obtained. There is no doubt that the foundation requires some immediate attention as the whole construction is caving and the work would be a difficult proposition to make a permanent success, being on quick sand and no rock.\nLIST OF KITCHEN UTENSILS, ETC., BOXED\nAND LEFT AT ST.

We have found out that the ox was only two years old when it left here, and we believe this animal alone should be worth at least $200.00 to you at Hay River. The other equipment cost over $1100.00 without any freight, and we hope that the whole equipment as stated above will be worth at least $700.00 to you at Hay River.\n\nIf you wish to accept this offer we should be very glad to hear from you immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEMPIRE ENGINEERING & SUPPLY CO., LTD.\n\nPER.

Brenner.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my visit to your Department last month I mentioned the fact that the White Beaver Oil Company had left in storage at our Hay River School a motor launch, a canoe, an ox, and certain other things as per enclosed list, which they were prepared to sell to our Society at a great reduction on cost. At the time of my visit I was given to understand that your Department would favourably consider an application to help in the purchasing of these articles when a statement was received setting forth the minimum sum which the Oil Company would accept. I have just received the enclosed letter pertaining to this matter, from which you will learn that they will sell the articles, etc., in question for $700., and I shall be obliged if you will let me know at the earliest date possible if you will authorize our Society to purchase these articles for this amount. In my opinion the list of kitchen utensils should be purchased and paid for by the Society, but in view of the very heavy expenditure to which our Society is subject in providing fish and vegetables for their school at Hay River, and for which they receive a per capita grant of only $165., I am of the opinion that the motor boat and parts, and the canoe, and the ox should be purchased and paid for by your Department. An early reply will oblige,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-5, part 1)\nOttawa, April 4, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you request the Department to give favourable consideration to the purchase for the Hay River Indian Residential School of a motor launch, a canoe and an ox, which your Society can secure at a reasonable price from the White Beaver Oil Company. Before intelligent consideration can be given to this request, I should be pleased if you would support it with a statement concerning why the launch, etc., are considered necessary for the conduct of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of April 23, 1923, No 134-7-5, with regard to the installation of a lighting system in our Society's Residential School at Hay River, I now beg to call your attention, in accordance with the request expressed in that letter, to the undertaking you have given in this connection.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 8, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you refer to the Department's promise to give favourable consideration to an electric light plant for the Hay River Indian Residential School. I have to inform you that in the first draft of the Estimates for 1924-25 there was an item in this connection. Upon receipt of your recapitulation of the requirements for this year of the institutions under M. S. C. C. auspices, the item was struck out in view of your urgent request that a new site and a new building be secured at Hay River at the first opportunity. It is considered inadvisable to undertake improvements to plant when a new building may be erected in the not very distant future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:-\n\n--Re Motor Launch &c. for Hay River--\n--School--\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, and with further reference to my letter of March 31st respecting the necessity of purchasing the motor launch, canoe, motor boat parts, ox &c. left by the White Beaver Oil Co. at our Society's Hay River School, I beg to state that this necessity arises chiefly, but not solely, in connexion with the provision of food and fuel.\n\n1. With regard to food. The staff and children at this school subsist largely on fish, both in summer and winter. These are mostly secured from a point several miles out in the Great Slave Lake, and consequently several miles away from the school. In the summer regular trips have to be made to the nets almost daily for the purpose. In the past the \"Komba\", a steam propelled boat belonging to the school has been of service in this connexion, but the hull and machinery have now got so much out of repair as to be practically useless. When I visited their school last summer it was in \"dry-dock\", and I recommended the Acting Principal, for his own safety, to leave it there! In the autumn several thousands of fish have to be brought in quickly, dried on the fish stages, and put away ready for winter use and emergency. Last autumn the number thus put away was about 7,000. Thus, in the procuring of fish the motor launch would be of very great assistance, as trips could be made to the nets quickly, even with small barges or lighters in tow.\n2. With regard to food or fuel. In a report just received from the Acting-Principal and dated Jan.10,1924, he devotes one paragraph to this question and begins with these words, \"The wood has been a serious problem\". His reference is, of course, to a supply of dry wood. Green wood abounds, but not close up to the school and much of this has to be towed in from the lake shore, or through three or four miles of \"dead water\" at the mouth of the Hay River. Thus, for the procuring of both dry and green wood for fuel purposes as well as for securing logs for lumber, the motor launch would be of very great assistance.\n\nThe canoe, motor-boat parts, and gasoline should be included with the launch.\n\n3. The ox is very necessary for gardening and hauling purposes, and his purchase should be included with the rest.\n\nThe maintenance of this School cost our Society last year over $15,000. The amount your Department allows us by way of per capita grant is for fifty pupils at $165 each, or a total of $8,250. Some time ago, during a visit to your Department I pointed out that I did not consider this grant either adequate or equitable, and I am still of this opinion. I shall be obliged if, in addition to purchasing the equipment referred to in the letter, you will carefully and sympathetically consider the question of increasing the per capita grant for this School.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nApril 11, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nDr. Westgate has urged that the Department purchase for the use of the Hay River Indian Residential School a motor launch with spare parts, a barrel of gasoline, a canoe and an ox, all of which can be secured by the H. S. C. C. from a local Oil Company for the very reasonable price of $700.\n\nI consider that the motor boat is necessary for the conduct of the school. It would be used for bringing in fish and towing wood. I wish to recommend that Dr. Westgate be instructed to purchase the equipment mentioned above and submit a receipted account and that the Department then give a grant of $500 towards the cost. This amount represents what I consider the value of the motor boat concerned.\n\nRussell Reiner\nDept. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 11, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to a motor launch and other equipment for the Hay River Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has given favourable consideration and the Department will give a grant of $500 if you expend $700 in the purchase of a motor boat and parts, a canoe, gasoline and an ox from the White Beaver Oil Company at Hay River. You should submit to the Department a receipted account showing your expenditure in this connection and the Department will make arrangements to reimburse the M.S.C.C. to the extent of $500.\n\nI have noted that the maintenance of the Hay River Indian Residential School is a heavy drain on the finances of your Society; but I regret to state that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to an increased per capita grant at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It reads as follows:\n\n\"The present building, standing as it does, on a point of land built up on a sedimentary deposit, has begun to subside, with the result that the side walls have bulged out. The apex of the roof has curved in; the floors have lost their level, and neither doors nor windows fit their frames. All efforts to prevent this subsidence have failed, and a new school building is a necessity.\"\n\nAs I have gathered from correspondence which has recently passed between our Society and your Department that the building of a new school cannot be undertaken in the immediate future, a good deal of repair work must be undertaken this summer on the present main school building to render it habitable until the new institution has been provided.\n\nIn addition to the paragraph quoted above from my own letter I beg to quote a paragraph from a letter dated Hay River, Feb. 11 and written by the Rev. D.A.B. Stoddart, M.A., B.D., the present Acting-Principal. He wrote as follows:\n\"We are facing rather a peculiar position. Both chimneys leading from the furnaces are practically in a state of collapse. The one leading through the boys' dormitory is particularly dangerous. I am securing from the Pure Oil Co.'s stock up the river, two pipes which we will place in position and make into the necessary chimneys. Our stock of stove piping is completely exhausted.\"\n\nIt is obvious from the above quotations that some steps towards the improvement of this situation should be undertaken without further delay, and I am writing to solicit your assistance in this matter.\n\nIn a letter from Mr. Stoddart dated March 21, he adds the following postscript:\n\n\"Dr. Bourget (the Agent and physician representing your Department at Fort Resolution) has asked for an authorization to spend the sum of $1,000 in repairs on our school during the coming summer\".\n\nThis sum, if granted, would be a very considerable help in meeting the cost of the repairs necessary, but I do not think it would be sufficient to make the school reasonably comfortable for the staff and the children for another two, possibly three, years.\n\nTo jack up the building, it is estimated that not less than ten 10 ton jack-screws would be required. In addition to this four iron rods would be required to draw the walls back to the perpendicular, making them secure. This heavy work, along with the regular school work, would over-tax, I fear, the capabilities of our staff there, and some extra labour would be required. An expert could, I believe be secured, either at Fitzgerald or Fort McMurray.\n\nAs the boiler attached to the little engine in the saw-mill is leaking beyond repair, it is now quite out of the question for any lumber to be made on the spot, and this, along with the other items mentioned above, incline me to the opinion that $1,000 will scarcely meet the expenditure which will be necessary if the school is to be sufficiently restored as to make it safe for occupation and a few years' further service. The sum of $2,000 would probably do this, and I should be glad to know at your earliest convenience if instructions may be issued to the Rev. Canon Vale, the Principal, who will shortly return to take charge of the school, to effect repairs, the cost of which your Department will meet, provided they do not exceed the sum I have suggested.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K.\nJune 30th, 1924.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHON. CHARLES STEWART.\n\n---\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, has drawn attention to the condition of the building in connection with the Hay River (N.W.T.) Indian Residential School. The present building, standing, as it does, on a point of land built up on a sedimentary deposit, has begun to subside, with the result that the side walls have bulged out; the apex of the roof has curved in; the floors have lost their level, and neither doors nor windows fit their frames. Both chimneys leading from the furnaces are practically in a state of collapse. It is urgent that steps be taken to have the necessary repairs carried out this season to make the building habitable until such time as funds can be provided for the erection of a new one. Dr. Westgate states that it will require the sum of $2,000 to carry out the necessary repairs. Our appropriation for Indian Education could, no doubt, stand the expenditure of the amount required.\n\nI would recommend your approval of authority being granted to have the repairs required to the building undertaken during the present summer, and also that the amount mentioned, viz: $2,000, be allowed for the purpose.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHON.

You may, therefore, arrange with Rev. Canon Vale, the Principal, to undertake the repairs.\n\nIn the purchase of all material competitive prices should as far as possible be obtained. Accounts, in duplicate, from the firms from whom the material is purchased should be obtained. The Principal should certify thereon that the material has been received and that the prices charged are fair and just. The accounts should then be forwarded to the Department when payment will be made to the firms from whom the material is obtained. Time sheets, in duplicate, properly certified, for the labour other than that which can be performed by the school should be forwarded. Receipts should also be obtained for any freight charges on material.\n\nThe jack screws which you state will be required could, no doubt, be borrowed from some firm of contractors.\n\nThe above mentioned sum is the full amount which this Department can provide towards carrying out the repairs enumerated by you as being required to place the building in a habitable condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Besides the launch the other supplies mentioned comprised a canoe, a barrel of gasoline and an ox. The ox was required for farming and hauling purposes. The price paid by the school for this equipment, viz., $650, is considered a very reasonable amount, and below the real value of the supplies.

Dr. T. B. R. Westgate.\n\nIn reply I have to say that a voucher to the amount of $166.96 has been received from the Hudson's Bay Company, covering the first item mentioned in your memo. This has been paid. The other accounts will, no doubt, be received in due course.\n\nWe note that you are negotiating with a contractor to carry out the work of the repairs, but that you will be unable to secure his services until next spring. The Department would like, if possible, that accounts be received for the material and labour, not exceeding the amount authorized, viz.: $2,000, before the end of the present fiscal year ending March 31st, next, as the money for the purpose is provided in the Estimates which lapse on that date. It is noted that you will have the chimneys put in good repair this fall and will furnish accounts, properly certified, covering the cost. Your explanation regarding the price charged for the dressed lumber has been noted. The total amount the Department can provide towards the cost of material and labour for the purpose of carrying out the repairs cannot exceed the sum authorized in our letter to Rev. Dr. Westgate, viz.: $2,000.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nSt. Peter's Mission,\nHay River, N. W.

Your letter No. 134-7-5 dated November 26, 1923 states that the Deputy Superintendent General had directed that favourable consideration be given this account provided a receipt from the Crown Timber Agent was furnished for the use of the Auditor General. We forwarded the account to Fort Smith on receipt of your letter but have only just received it back with a letter of apology from the District Agent stating that it had been overlooked.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nThe present building standing as it does on a point of land built up of sedimentary deposit has begun to subside, with a result that the side walls have bulged out, the apex of the roof has curved in, the floors have lost their level, neither doors nor windows fit their frames. All efforts to prevent the subsidence have failed, and a new main School building is considered necessary.\n\nA suitable site can be found about three or four miles further up the Hay River. Building stone could be procured for the basement, but timbers and lumber would have to be secured. Suitable timber can be found on the banks of Hay River, and as the Society have men on the school staff who could manage the engine and saw-mill, they hope these may be provided next year, in order that timbers and lumber may be prepared for the building of the new School not later than 1926.\n\nIt is thought that a plant similar to the one installed at Lac la Ronge would meet the purpose. Should this be thought too expensive it should be borne in mind that (a) the engine should not have less than 25 horse power, (b) the rip-saw, which should have inserted teeth, and not be less than 36 inches in diameter, and (c) that the outfit should include carrier planer and all other appliances required for converting logs into dressed lumber.\nDr. Bourget,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Resolution, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your request for an estimate of the cost of the needed repairs to our school during the year 1925, I beg to forward the following account.\n\nTo cost of putting a new foundation under the warehouse, used to store food in, $100. This will include the moving of the house to a better location.\n\nTo build a new Ice House $400.\n\nTotal ......................$500.\n\nThis is to be understood to be in access to the grant for the repair of the foundation and re-fitting of the school, part of this work has been undertaken and the other will be completed in spring of 1925.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to send you, under same cover, a letter received from Canon Vale, Principal of the Hay River Boarding School; in which Mr. Vale gives us the estimates of costs for repairs and extensions to the School Buildings.\n\nI was told unofficially that that School had been transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs for administration, but not notified by the Department, so I could not give Canon Vale any information regarding these repairs, except to transmit the letter to the Department for consideration.\n\nThese repairs have not been mentioned in the estimates, as Canon Vale was away at the time, and if the school is not the property of the Department they would not be mentioned; but not knowing if the school has been transferred or not I may be allowed to remit the correspondence as received.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

In reply I have to inform you that the Department has not acquired this property, but a grant of $2,000 has been made for the purpose of putting the main building in condition for a few more years' service. I regret that the Department cannot make a grant for the addition and repairs mentioned in the principal's letter of the 7th of October, which you enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of an account from the Department of the Interior, North West Territories Branch, for lumber supplied by their district agent at Fort Smith on the order of the Principal of the Hay River Indian Residential School. As this lumber was, no doubt, used in carrying out the repairs which were authorized in our letter of July 7th, last, I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have the account properly certified. If you can certify this account without forwarding it to the Principal, I shall be pleased if you will do so and return it to the Department at an early date in order that it can be paid. I may say that in a letter from the Principal dated September 23rd, last, containing a memorandum of the expenses to date to be charged against the grant authorized by our letter to you and which is referred to above, he acknowledges receipt of the lumber and drop siding mentioned in the enclosed account. It may, therefore, be that you could certify this account, and, if so, it should be attached to proper voucher forms, in duplicate, and certified in the usual manner.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will instruct the Principal that future accounts covering the cost of any material or labour should be properly certified by him before they are forwarded to the Department. If these requirements are carried out it will save delay in the payment of accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

We will send you a cheque under separate cover covering these amounts.\n\nThe Department would prefer, in future, that all accounts covering the expenditure of the $2,000 which was authorized for repairs to this school be forwarded through your office and certified by you.

We are forwarding a cheque in payment of these accounts to Rev. Dr. Westgate. We note that John Cameron who supplied the logs has given a guarantee that he will complete the work on the foundation in time to carry out the other repairs in the spring.\n\nIn connection with accounts for repairs which are authorized, I should be pleased if, in future, you would forward all such accounts to the Rev.

I gave him these instructions after I gathered from the Superintendent of Indian Education at the time of his last visit here, that it was the wish of the department to have payments made direct to firms for goods supplied, instead of having them first paid by our Society, and then for our Society to be reimbursed by you.\n\nIt would now appear that these instructions should not have been issued by me, and I shall gladly certify any further accounts which may be presented. It is quite possible however, that others will reach you before your letter to Canon Vale can be delivered, and if you find it necessary to have these also certified by me I shall gladly do so on receipt of the same, believe me Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 2, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you refer to the payment of accounts which are being incurred at the Hay River Indian Residential School. With reference to the procedure when submitting accounts, I have to inform you that my letter of this file number of the 21st ultimo referred only to the accounts that are now being presented from Hay River. This school is so far from the lines of communication, that an exception is being made. It is the Department's wish to have payments made direct to firms for goods supplied, instead of having them first paid by your Society. When an expenditure has been authorized at Indian residential schools generally, the principal should certify to the accounts and should submit them to the local Indian office for our representative's signature and for forwarding to Ottawa for payment. Cheques will then be issued direct to the firms who supplied the material or performed the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

I have examined the file and I have learned that over $900 has been paid for repairs at this school since the original letter of authority was directed to you. I regret that there are no funds especially provided in this connection for the current fiscal year. If, however, there are repairs that are of an imperative nature, you may submit an itemized list, giving an estimate of the cost, and consideration will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Canon Vale, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Hay River. This letter explains itself, and I also beg to enclose two certified copies of the invoices referred to therein. May I request that this matter be given favourable consideration and a cheque issued in due course to the Department of the Interior.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-5, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am very deeply obliged to you for your letter of the 4th instant (134-7-5) in which you undertake to give consideration to an itemized list of repairs of an imperative nature required at our Society's Hay River School.\n\nFrom the statement attached to my letter of October 30th last, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, it will be seen that the erection of a new School building on a different site, is a matter which can not be postponed indefinitely. However, until this can be accomplished it is essential on account of the long and cold winters which prevail in the northern latitude in which this school stands, that the heating and lighting systems should be maintained in an efficient state. The repairs, therefore which are of immediate urgency are as follows:\n\n1. New Furnaces,\n2. An electric lighting system,\n3. Enlargement of dormitory space for the girls.\n\nWith regard to the furnaces when I visited this school in the summer of 1923 I examined them carefully and concluded that they would soon have to be replaced by new ones. In a letter recently received from the Principal and dated Mar. 21st last he asks for new furnaces to be sent in this year. The Hudson's Bay Co., inform me that they can supply two at $400.00 each or a total cost of $800.00\n2. The Acetylene gas plant now in use is in much the same condition as the furnaces. The cost of carbide even with the best of plants is very expensive, and where the plant is defective this cost is increased. The cost of this item alone at this school last year was approximately $200.00 and is not likely to be any less this year. An electric lighting system would add both comfort and safety to the school, and reduce our Society's operating expenses which at present are exceedingly high. This system could be removed to another building at a later date.\n\n3. A third and very urgent requirement is more dormitory space for the girls. There are more girls in residence at present than boys, and as this is always likely to be the case, in the opinion of the Principal, he suggests that an upper story be built above the Kitchen. This suggestion has my own approval. A window from the present dormitory could be enlarged to make a doorway, and the heat from the Kitchen would help to keep it warm. He estimates the cost at $300.00\n\nAny assistance which you may be able to render in providing the above requirements will be greatly appreciated by our Society.\n\nAs the per capita earnings of this school for 1924 were only $8,250.00 and the maintenance expenses, as given in our Auditor's report, amounted to $15,622.94, you will see that our Society had to raise the sum of $7,373.94 to keep it in operation.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JF\nMay 13, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nDr. Westgate has urged the Department to undertake certain improvements at the Hay River Indian Residential School. There is an item of $3,000 in the Estimates to care for urgent repairs and to supply sawmill equipment for this institution. We have been requested from time to time to abandon this institution and rebuild on another site and I cannot recommend that any major improvements be undertaken. I wish to suggest, therefore, that the request for electric lighting and for a small addition to the girls' wing be refused.\n\nDr. Westgate's third request is for two furnaces, which are badly needed. The cost in this connection will be $800 and I wish to recommend that he be allowed to purchase two furnaces considered suitable, after securing competitive prices, and have them shipped to the school.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 14, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to urgent repairs at the Hay River Indian Residential School. As it is not the intention to use the present building indefinitely, the Department cannot agree to undertake capital expense unless absolutely necessary. I regret that I cannot authorize the installation of an electric lighting plant nor an addition to the girls' dormitory. I am pleased to inform you, however, that the Deputy Superintendent General has approved of replacing the two furnaces. You are authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices, two furnaces that will be suitable for the school. Your estimate of $800 should not be exceeded in this connection. A properly certified voucher, in duplicate, in favour of the firm awarded the business, should be directed to the Department for payment. Support it with a statement showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJune 23, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your 134-7-5 of the 8th January last in which you enclosed your cheque for $76.04 in payment of account which was submitted from our Fort Smith Office for lumber supplied to the Indian Boarding School at Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nI am enclosing your departmental cheque No. 740 for $94.73 which has been forwarded to this office by our District Agent at Fort Smith who has explained that through an error your Department had been forwarded a second account for this lumber and charged at ordinary rates instead of mill cost plus cost of handling which accounts for the difference in the two accounts rendered.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.S.

I am pleased to inform you that $1,000 is available for repairs and replacements at this institution, and, in view of your proposal that one-half the items mentioned be provided by the Department, I have to authorize you to purchase 1000 ft. of lumber, at an estimated cost of $60. The account, in duplicate, properly certified by yourself or the Rev. Principal, should be forwarded to the Department for payment. Your Society should supply the hot water tank, without cost to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the scow for transporting wood, hay, fish, etc., the estimated cost of which is $400, I am pleased to state that the Department will give a grant of $200 for the purpose.

As the total cost of the requirements mentioned is not likely to exceed the sum of $1,000 and as this amount is available from your Department for repairs and replacements at this institution this year, it will be a very great help to our Society if your Department will undertake to meet the total cost of these requirements provided, of course, that they do not exceed the total appropriation for this institution. Quotations have already been received for the hot water tank, the lumber, etc., but the orders have not yet been placed, and as it is a matter of great importance that the orders should be placed in the very near future, so that the materials may reach the school before the end of the short navigation season, I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with your decision in connection with the meeting of the total cost at the earliest date possible.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, July 25, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to improvements at the Hay River Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will meet the total cost of effecting the improvements mentioned in my letter of May 16th, provided that the total does not exceed $1000. You may make arrangements for a hot water tank, 1000 ft. of lumber and a scow for transporting wood, hay and fish. In due course, properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the activity, should be forwarded to the Department for payment.

The most serious feature of the Institution at present is the great shortage of wood cut in the woods, much bigger than usual, but unfortunately it was burnt during the forest fires, and it left Mr. Singleton the new principal, in the very bad position of having two men employed, working every day cutting wood and hauling a relatively long distance with one team of oxen, just bringing a day supply ahead. This is a serious condition because were the men to fall sick, or the oxen to have accidents, it would leave the school without wood and no help to be procured from the Fort, the Indians being away in the woods. This year this condition was exaggerated from the wood burning in summer, but as a rule the supply is never sufficient and is a drawback to the school. The only possible course and recommendation would be to make the necessary expenditure to have a supply cut by special wood cutters so that there would be a supply of a year in advance. This would give better wood, save the situation, time and money in the long run and leave the employees able to attend to fishing and other works, clearing land for vegetables etc. The wood cut in advance on the river is very good but needs a year to dry, the same thing applies to the drift wood, which is far better if given a few months to dry and does not create so much creosote in the chimneys, eliminating a danger of fires.\n\nC. Bourget, M.D.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith for your information copy of the report of Mr. Indian Agent G. Bourget on his visit to the Hay River Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would take up with the school authorities the question of having an adequate supply of wood on hand. You will note the Agent's recommendation that, in order to have a supply of wood, the services of special wood cutters should be obtained and that a year's supply be delivered at the school in advance, in order that it can be thoroughly dry and ready for use. If this arrangement were carried out it would relieve the school employees of this extra work, and they could devote their time to better advantage at other work needed at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Resolution relative to the wood supply at our Society's School at Hay River. The difficulty in this connection, and the shortage of wood cut in the woods referred to by Dr. Bourget, were not unknown to our Commission, but this shortage was due to a bush fire which destroyed nearly 200 cords of wood in the bush last Summer. Previous to that disaster, I had never heard of any shortage of wood fuel, and am very doubtful if any serious shortage ever existed. I quite agree, however, with Dr. Bourget's suggestion that there should be a year's supply always cut in advance. This has been the policy which has been adopted at all our Schools situated in the wooded areas and steps will be taken during the coming Summer to have a sufficient quantity of wood cut at this School to carry it through the winter of 1929-30. Owing to the inadequate Grant which is given by your Department to meet the operating costs of this School so remotely situated, these costs fall heavily on the funds of our Society. Our Society, however, has always met the same, but I should be glad if your Department gave further consideration to the question of the Grant for this School, and take steps to have it advanced\nsufficiently so as to cover more nearly the operating costs which must be met from year to year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nFUR TRADE\nWHOLESALE DEPARTMENT\nHAY RIVER, N.W.T.\nDecember 31st, 1927.\n\nM ST.

(139-2-5) I beg to state that the Principal of the Hay River School has presented to our Commission an urgent request for a small portable Engine for sawing wood to help the School management in providing the school's wood supply. I am informed by the Fairbanks-Morse Co. that a 3 H.P. engine will cost $146.00, with a discount to our Society of approximately 15.5%. I am also informed by the Hudson's Bay Co. that the freight from Waterways to Hay River would amount to approximately $30.00. The freight from Winnipeg to Waterways would be approximately $18.50, the rate being $3.35 per 100 lbs., according to information received from the C. N. R. freight Department, thus making a total cost to deliver the engine at Hay River of approximately $175.00. The purchase of a belt, if required, would probably bring the total up to $200. or $225.\n\nAs $2,000.00 is available for improvements at this School this year, a part of which will be required for the Isolation Ward referred to in my letter of March 26th., I shall be glad to know if your Department will grant authority to have this engine purchased and forwarded, and pay for the same out of the appropriation mentioned.\n\nWhile writing, I beg to state also, that the Principal has advised our Commission of the necessity of having a rat-proof store-room built for flour and other supplies, the total cost of this will not exceed $400.00.\nI shall be glad to know, therefore, if your Department will authorize this expenditure, provided the total expenditure for the Isolation Ward, the purchase and delivery of the Engine, and the building of the Cache, does not exceed the total sum available for improvements at the School this year.\n\nAn early reply will oblige.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 1, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Hay River Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 3rd ultimo, $2,000 is available for this activity. Provided that the entire expenditure for the isolation ward, the engine for cutting wood and the preparation of a rat-proof store room for flour, etc., does not exceed the total amount available, the work may be proceeded with. I should be grateful if you would place the order for the engine and arrange for shipment. I note that the total cost, including that of a belt, is approximately $200.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of May 1st, #139-2-5 authorizing the purchase of a gasoline engine for our Society's School at Hay River, I beg to state that after despatching to you my letter of April 26th., I learned from the Rev. A. J. Vale, Principal of the Chapleau School, and for some years Principal of the Hay River institution, that a 6 H.P. Oil-burning Engine, Brantford make, was for sale by a Company which was boring for oil on the banks of Hay River about 10 or 12 miles from the Hay River School.\n\nHe informed me that this engine cost originally $420.00 and was practically as good as new last year. Before purchasing therefore, the engine sanctioned in your letter of May 1st. I beg to state that I am asking Mr. Singleton, the present Principal of the Hay River School, to examine this engine and report to me as to its condition and the lowest price which the Company would accept for the same.\n\nI have also learned since writing to you on the 26th. of April that while the 3 H.P. engine would be strong enough to operate a pile-saw, it could not drive a circular-saw in the saw mill for converting logs into lumber. A 6 H.P. engine could be used for this purpose where small logs are concerned, and for this reason I am persuaded that it would be advisable to purchase the 6 H.P. engine referred to, even though the cost should exceed the $200.00 you have sanctioned.\nIt is fully understood that only the sum of $2,000.00 is available for improvements, etc., at the Hay River School this year, and I shall be glad to have authority from you to purchase the O.M.F. engine to which I have referred, upon receipt of Mr. Singleton's recommendation, and provided the price is considered fair and just.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nOttawa, June 13, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the authority granted for the purchase of a gasoline engine for the use of the Hay River Indian Residential School. It is noted that a 6 H.P. oil burning engine can be obtained from a Company which was boring for oil, and that this engine would be more satisfactory for the purpose for which it is required.\n\nIf, after an inspection of the engine to which you refer, it is found to be in serviceable condition and satisfactory for the purpose, the department will approve of the purchase of this 6 H.P. engine. It should be obtained as cheaply as possible, and the cost should not be greatly in excess of the sum of $200, which was authorized for the purchase of the 5 H.P. engine. A certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded in due course covering the purchase price of the oil burning engine referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

FRENCH\n(Sgd) J.G. Woollison\nFUR TRADE COMMISSIONER.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Saw Mill for Hay River School\n\nSome time ago our Commission received a request from the Principal of their Hay River School that the saw mill at that institution be placed in a satisfactory working condition, and I find that I made reference to this in a letter addressed to you on the 10th of August last. (see also my letter of June 7th. last.) Our Commission have given a great deal of careful thought to this request, and have come to the conclusion that in order to keep their expenditure as low as possible, without impairing the School's efficiency, the saw mill should be made capable, not only of cutting lumber, but also of cutting the School's supply of wood. As gasoline costs a great deal when delivered to so remote a centre, they have decided that the wood-burning engine on their steamer the \"Komba\", should be placed ashore, as the hull of the \"Komba\" is no longer seaworthy, and made to operate the mill. This action would eliminate the necessity of purchasing the engine referred to in my letter of June 7th. last.\n\nTo put the saw mill in order, however, for cutting lumber and wood, certain iron fixtures are essential, and acting on the request of the Principal, our Commission have endeavoured to secure quotations which they might submit to you in this connection. As the list of fixtures submitted by the Principal was not sufficiently specific for the purpose of the Commission it has been referred back to him for further information. In the meantime, and as there will be considerable delay in receiving his reply, the Commission instructed me to submit to you the enclosed letter from the Hudson's Bay Co., as a guide to the cost of some of the fixtures which...\nare likely to be required. They felt that this action should be taken now as your estimates for the ensuing fiscal year are under preparation, and would beg to suggest that an appropriation based on the enclosed figures be included in the same.\n\nAs soon as the information requested from the Principal has been received, I will communicate with you again, but beg to suggest, in view of the urgency of the need, that provision be made in your estimates for next year to meet the cost of the fixtures required to place the saw mill at this School in a satisfactory working condition.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nP.S. In connection with the above, I am sending you under separate cover catalogue No. 25, supplied by the Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd. T.B.R.W.\nOttawa, January 8, 1929.\n\nRev.

In his letter of Jan.11th, last, setting forth his application for this very necessary item of equipment, he writes, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"What we require is an adequately large and strong boat suitable for big lake fishing. Our staple meat diet is fish, the daily school requirement being 100 fish. The Northern climate being subject to almost daily winds, and this lake being of very shallow depth, and extremely so within two miles of the River mouth, the waves rise up very quickly. Last fall due to almost constant wind, we could reach our nets on an average of only twice a week. Then generally it was with much misgiving as to the safety of our fisherman and boy helper, who were out a mile and a half in the Lake from three to five hours at a time, in a small canoe skiff. Frequently I went out with a boy myself, and due to the distance, the slowness and difficulty of travel, and the quickly rising winds, I realized that we have not adequate equipment for fishing on a large scale. Both the size and speed of the boat have to be considered for regular and successful fishing for a school like this. This model or a boat which I describe is based on one owned by a neighbor fisherman, who declares it capable of easily enduring a rough lake. This design, improved upon to greater strength according to his advice, is as follows:-\n\nDimensions. Length 25' bottom, 30' top.\nWidth 5' bottom, 8' top.\nRibs 2\"x 4\" and 16\" apart.\nPlank Material 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\".\"\nStern built for outboard motor.\nEstimated cost of boat $85.00.\nSuggested boat builder, Mr. Mercredi or Frank Conibear.\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\"\n\nIn a later letter dated Feb. 8th, he further writes,\nin part, as follows:\n\n\"The fish scarcity continues to be serious in this community.\nAll the people are experiencing it alike. Eight large nets\naltogether yield an average of twenty to thirty fish every\ntwo days. With much labor we have moved part of our nets\nfive miles out into the Lake from a three mile point with\na little better result. We may place some of them two or\nthree miles further still.\"\n\nThe boat at present in use, was bought in 1924 for\n$700.00. of which amount your Department provided $500.00. and our\nSociety the balance. It was a second hand boat when purchased,\nbut the service it has rendered seems to me to have fully justified\nthe expenditure. Now, however, it is not sea-worthy, and the\nPrincipal states that \"the engine is worn out, and not worth the\ngreat expense needed to repair it\". He suggests that a new boat\nbe provided of the dimensions set forth above, and that it be\nprovided with a 6-8 h.p. Kermath engine, which would cost,\naccording to the attached price list, approximately $425.00. To\nthis would have to be added the cost of freight. The Principal\nstates that this engine was recommended to him by the engineer\non the Hudson's Bay Co's Liard River steamer, who \"insists that\na fairly heavy and strong engine is necessary for freighting\npurposes on large waters such as Great Slave Lake where the force\nof contrary winds is so great\". He also states that \"this engine\nis popular in Northern waters\".\n\nAs the boat and engine I have described are undoubtedly\nan urgent necessity at this institution, not only for procuring\nthe daily and annual fish supply, but also for hauling a large\nwhen collecting the wood and hay required, our Commission have\ninstructed me to apply to your Department for authority to purchase\nthe same in time to go forward by the first steamer going North\nfrom Fort McMurray this summer.\n\nAs the saw-mill required at this School is not to be\nprovided this year (see your letter Jan. 8th, 1929, 139-2-5), and\nas the engine sanctioned in your letter of June 13th, 1928,\n139-2-5, is not being purchased, I trust that you may be able to\ngrant the authorization requested, or place the orders direct for\nthe boat and engine specified by the Principal.\n\nI have the honour to Be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 25, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to a motor launch for the Hay River Indian Residential School.

May I request that cheque covering the amount involved may be forwarded to the Hudson's Bay Company, Fur Trade Commissioner's Office, Winnipeg, in due course.\n\nAs the Company's financial year ends on the 31st of May it would be much appreciated if your cheque could go forward in order to reach them by that date.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secy-Treas.,\nIndian Residential School Commission\nM.S.C.C.\n\nEnclos.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:- Re - Motor Launch for Hay River School.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of March 19th last re a motor launch for our Society's School at Hay River, N.W.T., and your reply to the same on March 25th, 139-2-5, I beg to state that it was only on the 3rd instant that I received a reply from the boat builders at Fort Smith to my letter of April 2nd, desiring to know if they could build a boat according to the dimensions given, and at an approximate cost of $85.00. Mr. Mercredi in his reply states that he could not build a boat for the sum specified, and advised me to apply to a boat builder at Waterways. I have already written to a boat builder at Waterways, but do not expect to hear from him before I leave here at the end of this week to visit Hay River. I am, moreover, somewhat doubtful about the ability of small boat makers to install a valuable engine satisfactorily in a boat of their own make, and feel that it would be better to pay a little more and have a boat properly made, and the engine properly installed.\n\nActing on the recommendation of the district manager of the Hudson's Bay Company for the Mackenzie River district, I wrote to the Alberta Motor Boat Co., Ltd., Edmonton, to ascertain if they could build a boat according to the dimensions given by the Principal of the Hay River School, the cost of the same, and the earliest date at which they could have it ready. Their reply was just received here yesterday, and you will find the same enclosed herewith for your information. From the description of the boat recommended in this letter, I am in doubt as to whether it would be the most suitable model for the Hay River School's use, as the boat required is largely for fishing purposes. I am satisfied, however, that the boat required could not be built for the sum of $85.00 as suggested by the Principal, and as I expect to be in Edmonton on Monday, June 17th, on my way to Hay River, I should\nlike to have authority from you to place the order with the Alberta Motor Boat Co., for a boat which will meet the requirements of the Hay River School. I am of the opinion that after I have talked the matter over with the Alberta Motor Boat Co., that I can persuade them to build a suitable boat for less than $475.00, but am unable at present even to estimate what the amount would be. I should be glad, therefore, to have authority from you to place an order with this Company for the most suitable boat I can get, and on the best terms I can secure, it being understood that the price will not exceed $300.00 or $350.00 at the outside. If I can secure it for less I shall certainly do so. There can be no question whatever about the urgent necessity of this boat, and where the health of the staff and pupils depends so largely on an adequate supply of fish, I consider it would be well worth while to spend the extra amount, and provide them with a really serviceable boat and engine to assist them in procuring the same. A letter from you in reply if written immediately would reach me at Edmonton by June 17th if addressed in care of Bishop Gray, 10049 - 103rd St., Edmonton.\n\nThanking you in advance for any help you may be able to give in this important matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JF\nOttawa, June 13, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to a motor launch for the Hay River Indian Residential School. The Department will allow a total grant of $600 to assist your Society in this connection. You will make whatever arrangements you consider advisable at Edmonton and pay the freight. You should then forward to the Department a receipt, in duplicate, showing the expenditure, and a grant of $600 in reimbursement will be made. I am returning the Alberta Motor Boat Company's letter to you.\n\nENCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S.

Dr. Westgate with further reference to the boat required for our Hay River Indian Residential School. Your letter of June 13th, sanctioned the sum of $600.00, but in view of the present report received from Dr. Westgate who has gone exhaustively into the whole matter, I am instructed to enquire whether your Department cannot see their way to increase this grant to $900.00.\n\nThe total cost of a boat guaranteed by Captain Matheson who is the agent for the Kermath engines, is as follows:\n\n- Kermath 6 - 8 H.P. engine ................. $425.00\n- Cost of boat & installing engine ....... $300.00\n- Freight to Waterways ..................... $105.00\n- \" to Hay River ......................... $100.00\n\n$930.00\n\nThe boat recommended would have the following dimensions:\n\nLength 25': Breadth 7': Depth 3'6\"\nOak ribs 1\u00bd\" x 1\" on 8\" centres\nThe hull to be built of edge-grain fir, 1\" plank\nThe bow to be covered in and steering wheel, rudder, seat, etc. complete.\n\nCaptain Matheson reports that a boat of this type would last for twenty years, and the Commission, therefore, earnestly request your sympathetic consideration of this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst.

The posts can and will be secured locally, and the labour undertaken by the school management, but the wire must be supplied from this part. The Principal states that the most suitable wire to be used in that known as \"Fox-Fencing\". The corral should be 8' high, 100' long and 50' wide, making the total length of wire 300' by 8' high. At this school the dogs are used in securing the wood supply, in visiting the fish nets in the lake during the winter time, and also in the garden work.

March 10th, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe:- Electric lighting plant for Hay River School, C. of E.\n\nFor some years past our Society has included in its list of requirements for the Hay River School an electric lighting plant to take the place of the acetylene plant which has been in use so long that it is quite worn out. In a letter written by Bishop Geddes from Hay River on Feb. 16th, 1933, he states that the plant has developed so many leaks which they cannot locate, that it has become more of a menace than a help to the school. He further describes its condition in the following words: \"But the plant to my mind is in much the same condition as the rifle of the man who said that if he had a new lock, stock and barrel, he would have a good gun.\"\n\nTwo years ago I secured from the Principal a rough plan of the buildings to be served by the electric light plant, with a list of the lights required for the various buildings. I submitted these plans, etc., to the Mumford & Co. Ltd., successor to R. A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Ltd., who are established at Wall St., and Portage Ave., Winnipeg, and asked them to furnish me with a quotation on a plant which they considered would meet the requirements of the case, and I enclose herewith a copy of their reply, along with the original of the plan of the buildings as prepared by the Principal.\n\nYou will please note that the prices quoted are f.o.b. Waterways. It is estimated that the carrying charges from Waterways to Hay River will be approximately $200.00.\n\nIn view of the great urgency of the need of this plant, I beg to recommend that the quotation for the Used Demonstrator LISTER BRUSTON Fully Automatic Light Plant, quoted at \u00a31,190.00 f.o.b. Waterways, be accepted, and that an authorization be issued by your Department for the purchase and delivery of the same.\nOur Society will undertake to meet the cost of installation, including expert labour, cement for the foundation on which the engine and generator will rest, shell for the batteries, etc., etc., we cannot undertake to meet any part of the initial cost of the plant itself.\n\nYour prompt and sympathetic consideration of this pressing need will be greatly appreciated by our Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.C.S.C.\nPOPULATION AT HAY RIVER HAS INCREASED TO ABOUT SEVENTY CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE STOP THEREFORE CLASSROOM IN OLD ANGLICAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL INADEQUATE STOP ALSO CLASSROOM WOULD BE IN GREAT DANGER OF FIRE AS OLD BUILDING IS ATTACHED THERETO STOP LOCAL OPINION ESTIMATE NUMBER OF SCHOOL CHILDREN WILL REACH EIGHTY OR MORE BY FOLLOWING YEAR STOP DEPARTMENTALLY OPERATED SCHOOL FAVORED HERE STOP IMPERATIVE THAT NEW FOUR ROOM SCHOOL BE OPENED BY THIS FALL STOP PETER MATSON WHO WAS HEAD FOREMAN OF THE NEW YELLOWKNIFE HOTEL IS WILLING TO SUPPLY MATERIALS AND ERECT BUILDING IMMEDIATELY STOP WOULD TAKE THE CONTRACT FOR A FOUR ROOMED SCHOOL AND SEPARATE TEACHERS RESIDENCE AT A TOTAL COST OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS STOP THE LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE ANXIOUS OF AN EARLY ASSURANCE THAT THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS HERE WILL BE ATTENDED TO STOP SHOULD YOU APPROVE OF THE PLAN PETER MATSON WOULD BEGIN WORK IMMEDIATELY UPON THE RECEIPT OF OUR DEPARTMENTAL SCHOOL BUILDING PLAN STOP PETER MATSON IS AWAITING REPLY AND PLEASE MAKE SUCH REPLY DIRECT HIM STOP ADDRESSED MR R A HOEY COPY FOR INFORMATION TO MR R A GIBSON J M MCKINNON INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\nJune 17, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe - Indian School at Hay River.\n\nAt your request I sent a wireless message to Mr. Fred Fraser, Mining Recorder, Yellowknife, asking him whether Peter Matson, whom School Inspector McKinnon recommends be given a contract to build the School at Hay River, was reliable in every way.

I don't know why the dope wants other blue prints and perhaps they are not needed. You could discuss this with Col. Neary and do as you see fit. McNiven, Lindrom and myself at Neary's and Gibson's request have followed the course suggested. The blue prints for the Yellowknife school were not followed exactly - the cellar was eliminated and position of the doors changed. Similarly we would follow exactly the blue prints for the Hay River school with the only exception the elimination of the basement and raising of the door and eliminating of the (window or transom) above it.\n\nGet copy of the prints and study same. Whatever you do tie him down to the suggestions listed in my letter previous which I discussed fully with him and he agreed to. If you haven't any other prints of the building, perhaps you could either have them drawn up or else wire him that the plans submitted were the ones to be followed and if interested to submit his offer - if not to notify us to that effect, so other interested parties might be contacted.\n\nFraser says he is an excellent contractor and honest - but find out how much money must be submitted. It is hoped we could advance payment either through the Yellowknife Bank which would be the best - and have the bills submitted there for payment. Perhaps $8,000 could be submitted and when one-quarter completed another $8,000. They have the accounting system already set up. Mr. McIlroy of the M & R there could attend to it and issue the cheques as the bills were submitted.\n\nMatson would have to be bonded for about $3,000 I believe. These particulars should be clarified and he informed. We must not be too rigid - as I doubt if we can obtain another contractor at present for the job. He said he would do it for $32,000 when there - so have no alarm - but if separate prints can be obtained fine and good.\n\nThe floors should be of maple and the rest of good quality lumber. - same as that used at McPherson - check and find out type. The accordion doors can be put in by any type of fair carpenter. Lindstrom says as one story wood lattice work or supports above will be plenty strong enough and no iron beam is needed.\nYou could submit to him more details either by 50 word wire or letter - and here is hoping we get going right away. It is possible I've held him down to a fairly fair figure - and he is leary whether he can make it pay or not. It is a good idea that my ideas be submitted by Hoey or Neary to him - also wire telling that they will be sent immediately.\n\nAre there separate prints on the stairs, the framework, the type cement, kind of wood, separate detailed plans of walls, floors, etc. See if so - quite possible this is so. Also showing insulation, lights, plumbing. Be sure you contract for the supplying of everything - wiring, plumbing, etc. There should be details of doors, windows, type of flooring, etc. Perhaps I have a letter yet don't know.\n\nJ. E.

During his discussion of the plans with Mr. Mattson, the latter suggested a cost figure in the neighbourhood of $32,000. However, without the detailed specifications Mr. Mattson was, of course, in no position to submit a definite figure. Mr. McKinnon believes that Mr. Mattson is the only contractor available and prepared to accept the contract.\n\nMr. McKinnon suggests that Mr. Mattson be informed as to the arrangements for financing building operations. With respect to the school building, he suggests that accordion doors be installed between the classrooms, and that arrangements be made as soon as possible regarding the electric wiring and plumbing installations.\n\nYou will, of course, understand that it will be necessary for these preliminary details to receive priority of attention if construction is to get under way as soon as desired.\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

A. Campbell, Hay River Settlement (representative of the Surveys and Engineering Branch).\n\nWe are now advised that Mr. Peter Mattson, Hay River, N. T., is prepared to construct this school and residence on a basis of cost plus ten per cent. Mr. Mattson is stated to be a very reliable contractor. An amount of $30,000.00 is included in the supplementary estimates, 1947-48, for the construction of these buildings.\n\nI enclose Memorandum to Council requesting authority for the construction of the above buildings.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nMcKinnon\n\nRe: 4-room school\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nCartier Building,\nOttawa.\n\nProposed Hay River Indian Day School\n\nOn his return last week from a survey trip throughout the Mackenzie District, Mr. J. W. McKinnon, our Inspector of Schools, discussed with Mr. C. H. Buck of your branch the plans for the above mentioned school.\n\nIn view of the local situation at Hay River Mr. McKinnon was most anxious that some educational facilities be provided as quickly as possible. Since it appeared that the preparation of the detailed specifications for the proposed school would not be completed in time to allow for construction this fall it was decided to ask the contractor if he would accept a contract on a cost plus 10% basis. Should such a procedure be acceptable to the contractor, it was planned to proceed with the immediate construction of the teacher's residence and to use same as temporary classrooms quarters during the coming winter season. A wire received today from the contractor indicates his acceptance of this proposal, and hence this plan will be carried out.\n\nThe teacher's residence will be constructed according to the plans and specifications already prepared by your branch, with the exception of the fact that a furnace room will be substituted for the complete basement and provided in the existing plans.\n\nIt will not be possible to prepare the plans for the school without any undue haste and in the light of all\navailable information concerning construction conditions. In this respect Mr. McKinnon has advanced the following suggestions:\n\n(1) That the basement be eliminated from the proposed new school building and that a furnace room be substituted;\n\n(2) Having in mind the subjects that will be freed by the elimination of the basement stairways that inside toilets be provided in the school building;\n\n(3) That the building be completely equipped with wiring and plumbing installations, to allow for the installation of a Delco light plant and a water-pressure system;\n\n(4) That accordion doors be placed between two of the classrooms so that the rooms may be readily convertible into a small auditorium for school purposes;\n\n(5) That built-in cupboards be installed in each classroom.\n\nR.

In the absence of more exact determination, the amount of surface water may be estimated from the value given in the following:\n\n| AGGREGATE                  | APPROXIMATE QUANTITY OF SURFACE WATER |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Very wet sand              | 3/4 gal. per cu. ft.                 |\n| Moderately wet sand        | 1/2 \"                               |\n| Moist sand                 | 1/4 \"                               |\n| Moist gravel or crushed rock | 1/8 to 1/4 gal. per cu. ft.         |\n\nConsistency and Aggregate Content In all concrete the proportions of fine and coarse aggregate and cement shall be such as to produce a mixture which will work readily into the corners and angles of the forms and around reinforcement with the method of placing employed on the work, but without permitting the material to segregate or excess free water to collect on the surface. The volume of coarse aggregate shall not be less than the volume of fine aggregate and not more than twice the volume of fine aggregate. These proportions do not necessarily apply to light-weight aggregates.\n\nDuring the progress of the work, compressive tests shall be made when required by the Chief Engineer, or his representative.\n\nThe tests shall be carried out in accordance with C.E.S.A. Specification A.23-1942, Appendix VII \"Method of Making and Storing Specimens of Concrete in the Field\". The standard age of test shall be 28 days, but 7-day tests may be used provided the relation between the 7 and 28-day strength of the concrete is established by test for the materials and proportions used.\n\nIn all cases where the average strength of the test specimens falls below the required strength, the Chief Engineer, or his representative, shall have the right to order a change in the mix for the remaining portion of the structure. When conditions are such as to leave reasonable doubt as to the adequacy of the concrete for the purpose for which it is intended the Chief Engineer, or his representative shall have the right to order load tests to be made on the portion of the structure so affected.\n\nThe cost of all tests shall be borne by the Contractor.\n\nWhere cylinder tests are not called for the following quantities of fine and coarse aggregates in cubic feet are to be used per sack of cement measured dry.\n\nSum of separate volumes of fine and coarse aggregate in cubic feet measured dry per sack of cement:\nAssumed Compressive Strength at 28 days Plastic Concrete Slump 0-4\" Moderately Wet Concrete, Slump 5-7\"\n\n2,500 4-1/3 4\n\nMIXING CONCRETE\n\n(a) The mixing of concrete, unless otherwise authorized by the Chief Engineer, or his representative, shall be done in a mechanical batch mixer. The mixer shall be equipped with a suitable charging hopper, water storage and water measuring device. It shall be cleaned at frequent intervals when in use and maintained in such a condition that the mixing action will be unimpaired.\n\n(b) Machine Mixing at the Site The mixing of each batch shall continue until there is a uniform distribution of material and the mass is uniform in colour and consistency. In no case shall the mixing time be less than two minutes after all the materials are put into the mixer.\n\n(c) Ready Mixed Concrete Ready mixed concrete shall be proportioned, mixed and delivered in accordance with the requirements of C.B.S.A. Specification C.94-1936, \"Specification for Ready Mixed Concrete\".\n\n(d) Hand Mixing When hand mixing is permitted by the Chief Engineer, or his representative, 10 per cent extra cement shall be used. Hand mixing shall be carried out on a water-tight platform and great care shall be taken to ensure that the mixing is continued until the mass is uniform in colour and consistency.\n\nPLACING CONCRETE\n\n(a) Conveying Concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to the place of final deposit by methods which will prevent the separation or loss of materials.\n\n(b) Depositing Concrete shall be deposited as nearly as possible in its final position to avoid rehandling. Concreting shall be carried on as a continuous operation until the panel section, or other unit of the operation is complete. The top surface shall be generally level. When construction joints are necessary they shall be made in accordance with Item \"Construction Joints\".\n\n(c) Compacting All concrete shall be properly compacted by suitable means during the operation of placing, and shall be thoroughly worked around reinforcement, around embedded fixtures, and into the corners of the forms.\n\n(d) Re-temping of Concrete The re-temping of concrete that has partially hardened, that is, remixing with or without additional cement, aggregate, or water, will not be permitted.\n\nCURING OF CONCRETE\n\nAfter concrete has set sufficiently, its exposed surfaces shall be kept continuously wet. This shall continue for a period of at least 7 days after the concrete is deposited. In warm weather particular care shall be taken to prevent drying out of the concrete at any time during the curing period.\n\nCOLD WEATHER REQUIREMENTS\n\n(a) Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating the concrete materials and protecting the concrete during freezing, or near freezing weather. No frozen materials, or other materials containing ice shall be used.\n\n(b) All concrete materials and all reinforcement, forms, fillers and ground with which the concrete is to come in contact, shall be free from frost.\n(a) Concrete mixed and deposited when the temperature of the surrounding air is 40\u00b0F or lower shall have a temperature of not less than 50\u00b0F nor more than 90\u00b0F. Effective means shall be provided for maintaining the temperature of the concrete at not less than 50\u00b0F nor more than 80\u00b0F for at least 72 hours after placing. Whenever the atmospheric temperature is less than 50\u00b0F, a continuous record of the atmospheric temperatures in the vicinity of the concrete shall be kept. The housing, covering, or other protection used in connection with the curing shall remain in place and intact at least 24 hours after artificial heating is discontinued. No dependence shall be placed on salt or other chemicals for the prevention of freezing. Manure, when used for protection, shall not be allowed to come into contact with the concrete.\n\nFORMS\n\nForms shall conform to the shape, lines and dimensions of the members, as called for on the plan, and shall be substantial and sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar. They shall be properly braced or tied together so that they will maintain their position and shape. Care shall be taken to ensure that forms do not become dried and warped before concrete is deposited. Temporary openings shall be provided at base of column and wall forms and other places where necessary to facilitate cleaning and inspection. These openings shall be so placed that water for removing debris shall have a clear run to the outside of the forms. Bolts and rods used for internal ties shall be so arranged that when the forms are removed there shall be no metal within one inch of any surface. Wire ties will be permitted on unimportant work; they shall not be used through surfaces where discolouration will be objectionable.\n\nWOOD FORMS\n\nWood forms for exposed surfaces shall be built of lumber dressed to a uniform width and thickness and free from loose knots and other defects. Joists shall be horizontal, or vertical. For unexposed surfaces, plastered surfaces and rough work undressed lumber may be used. Lumber once used in forms shall have the nails withdrawn and surfaces to be in contact with concrete thoroughly cleaned before being reused.\n\nREMOVAL OF FORMS\n\nForms shall be removed in such manner as to ensure the complete safety of the structure. When the structure as a whole is supported on shores, the removable floor forms, beam and girder sides, column and similar vertical forms may be removed after twenty-four hours, providing the concrete is sufficiently hard not to be injured thereby. In no case shall the supporting forms or shoring be removed until the members have acquired sufficient strength to support safely their weight and the load thereon.\n\nBOLTS, ANCHORS, ETC.\n\nBuild into concrete all bolts, anchors, etc., sleeves, pipes, etc., shown on concrete work.\n\nREINFORCEMENT\n\nReinforcement before being placed shall be clean and free from coatings, including ice, that would tend to reduce the bond. Where there is delay in depositing concrete, reinforcement shall be reinspected and cleaned when necessary.\nReinforcement shall be accurately formed, to the dimensions indicated on drawings. Stirrups, column ties and beam ties, under 3/4 inch size, shall be bent around a pin having a diameter not less than twice the size of the bar for bends up to 90 degrees, nor less than three times the size of the bar for bends between 90 and 150 degrees. Where stirrups and ties are 3/4 inch in size and over the corresponding minimum pin diameters shall be three times and four times the bar size respectively. Except in standard hooks, other bars of structural or intermediate grade shall be bent around a pin having a diameter not less than 12 times the size of the bar. Bars of hard grade or rail steel shall be bent around a pin having a diameter not less than 12 times the size of the bar.\n\nReinforcement shall not be straightened or rebent in a manner that will injure the material. Bars with kinks, or bends, not shown on the drawing, shall not be used. Heating of the reinforcement will be permitted only when the entire operation is approved by the Chief Engineer, or his representative.\n\nReinforcement shall be accurately placed and secured against displacement by using annealed iron wire ties, or suitable clips at intersections, and shall be supported by concrete or metal supports, spacers, or metal hangers. Brick, wood, gypsum, tile or other similar materials shall not be used to support reinforcement. When it is necessary to splice reinforcement at points other than shown on the drawings, the character of the splice shall be approved by the Chief Engineer, or his representative.\n\nExposed reinforcement intended for bonding with future extensions shall be effectively protected from corrosion.\n\nAll reinforcement shall be placed so that its distance from the nearest face of the concrete shall not be less than that shown on the drawings.\n\nCONSTRUCTION JOINTS\n\nJoints not indicated on the drawings shall be so made and located as to least impair the strength and appearance of the structure, and shall be subject to the approval of the Chief Engineer or his representative. Construction joints in columns shall be located at the underside of floor members. At least two hours shall elapse after depositing concrete in columns before depositing concrete in the floor system.\n\nConstruction joints in floors shall be located near the middle of slabs, beams or girders, unless a beam intersects a girder at this point, in which case the joints in the girder shall be offset a distance twice the depth of the beam.\n\nWhere a joint is to be made, the surface of the concrete shall be thoroughly cleaned and all laitance removed. In addition to the foregoing, vertical joints shall be thoroughly wetted, but not saturated, and sluished with a coat of neat cement grout immediately before placing new concrete.\n\nFLOOR FINISH\n\nFloor, curb and exterior face of concrete shall be trowelled to a smooth even surface.\nREINFORCED CONCRETE SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFOR\n\nPRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE\n\nAND\n\nELECTRICAL AND HEATING BUILDING\n\nHAY RIVER, N.W.T.\n\nOctober 24, 1947.\nEXTENT\n\nThe contractor shall construct all plain and reinforced concrete work, including all beams and slabs required for the proper completion of the structure in accordance with an to the full extent of drawings and specifications.\n\nMATERIAL\n\nCement All cements used shall be Portland cement, provided that special cements may be used with the permission of the Chief Engineer, or his representative.

Concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to the place of final deposit by methods which will prevent the separation or loss of materials.\n\n(f) Depositing. Concrete shall be deposited as nearly as possible in its final position to avoid reshuffling. Concreting shall be carried on as a continuous operation until the panel, section, or other unit of the operation is complete. The top surface shall be generally level. When construction joints are necessary they shall be made in accordance with Item \"Construction Joints\".\n\n(g) Compacting. All concrete shall be properly compacted by suitable means during the operation of placing, and shall be thoroughly worked around reinforcement, around embedded fixtures, and into the corners of the forms.\n\n(h) Re-tamping of Concrete. The re-tamping of concrete that has partially hardened, that is, remixing with or without additional cement, aggregate, or water, will not be permitted.\n\nCURING OF CONCRETE\n\nAfter concrete has set sufficiently, its exposed surfaces shall be kept continuously wet. This shall continue for a period of at least 7 days after the concrete is deposited. In warm weather particular care shall be taken to prevent drying out of the concrete at any time during the curing periods.\n\nCOLD WEATHER REQUIREMENTS\n\n(a) Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating the concrete materials and protecting the concrete during freezing, or near freezing weather. No frozen materials, or other materials containing ice shall be used.\n\n(b) All concrete materials and all reinforcement, forms, fillers and ground with which the concrete is to come in contact, shall be free from frost.\nConcrete mixed and deposited when the temperature of the surrounding air is 40\u00b0F or lower shall have a temperature of not less than 50\u00b0F nor more than 60\u00b0F. Effective means shall be provided for maintaining the temperature of the concrete at not less than 50\u00b0F nor more than 60\u00b0F for at least 72 hours after placing. Whenever the atmospheric temperature is less than 30\u00b0F, a continuous record of the atmospheric temperatures in the vicinity of the concrete shall be kept. The housing, covering, or other protection used in connection with the curing shall remain in place and intact at least 24 hours after artificial heating is discontinued. No dependence shall be placed on salt or other chemicals for the prevention of freezing. Manure, when used for protection, shall not be allowed to come into contact with the concrete.\n\nFORMS\n\nForms shall conform to the shape, lines and dimensions of the members, as called for on the plan, and shall be substantial and sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar. They shall be properly braced or tied together so that they will maintain their position and shape. Care shall be taken to ensure that forms do not become dried and warped before concrete is deposited. Temporary openings shall be provided at base of column and wall forms and other places where necessary to facilitate cleaning and inspection. These openings shall be so placed that water for removing debris shall have a clear run to the outside of the forms. Bolts and rods used for internal ties shall be so arranged that when the forms are removed there shall be no metal within one inch of any surface. Wire ties will be permitted on unimportant work; they shall not be used through surfaces where discolouration will be objectionable.\n\nWOOD FORMS\n\nWood forms for exposed surfaces shall be built of lumber dressed to a uniform width and thickness and free from loose knots and other defects. Joints shall be horizontal, or vertical. For unexposed surfaces, plastered surfaces and rough work undressed lumber may be used. Lumber once used in forms shall have the nails withdrawn and surfaces to be in contact with concrete thoroughly cleaned before being reused.\n\nREMOVAL OF FORMS\n\nForms shall be removed in such manner as to ensure the complete safety of the structure. When the structure as a whole is supported on shores, the removable floor forms, beam and girder sides, column and similar vertical forms may be removed after twenty-four hours, providing the concrete is sufficiently hard not to be injured thereby. In no case shall the supporting forms or shoring be removed until the members have acquired sufficient strength to support safely their weight and the load therein.\n\nBOLTS, ANCHORS, ETC.\n\nBuild into concrete all bolts, anchors, etc., sleeves, pipes, etc., shown on concrete work.\n\nREINFORCEMENT\n\nReinforcement before being placed shall be clean and free from coatings, including ice, that would tend to reduce the bond. Where there is delay in depositing concrete, reinforcement shall be reinspected and cleaned when necessary.\nReinforcement shall be accurately formed, to the dimensions indicated on drawings. Stirrups, column ties and beam ties, under 3/4 inch size, shall be bent around a pin having a diameter not less than twice the size of the bar for bends up to 90 degrees, nor less than three times the size of the bar for bends between 90 and 150 degrees. Where stirrups and ties are 3/4 inch in size and over the corresponding minimum pin diameters shall be three times and four times the bar size respectively. Except in standard hooks, other bars of structural or intermediate grade shall be bent around a pin having a diameter not less than 12 times the size of the bar. Bars of hard grade or rail steel shall be bent around a pin having a diameter not less than 12 times the size of the bar.\n\nReinforcement shall not be straightened or rebent in a manner that will injure the material. Bars with kinks, or bends, not shown on the drawing, shall not be used. Heating of the reinforcement will be permitted only when the entire operation is approved by the Chief Engineer, or his representative.\n\nReinforcement shall be accurately placed and secured against displacement by using annealed iron wire ties, or suitable clips at intersections, and shall be supported by concrete or metal supports, spacers, or metal hangers. Brick, wood, gypsum, tile or other similar materials shall not be used to support reinforcement. When it is necessary to splice reinforcement at points other than shown on the drawings, the character of the splice shall be approved by the Chief Engineer, or his representative.\n\nExposed reinforcement intended for bonding with future extensions shall be effectively protected from corrosion.\n\nAll reinforcement shall be placed so that its distance from the nearest face of the concrete shall not be less than that shown on the drawings.\n\nCONSTRUCTION JOINTS\n\nJoints not indicated on the drawings shall be so made and located as to least impair the strength and appearance of the structure, and shall be subject to the approval of the Chief Engineer or his representative. Construction joints in columns shall be located at the underside of floor members. At least two hours shall elapse after depositing concrete in columns before depositing concrete in the floor system.\n\nConstruction joints in floors shall be located near the middle of slabs, beams or girders, unless a beam intersects a girder at this point, in which case the joints in the girder shall be offset a distance twice the depth of the beam.\n\nWhere a joint is to be made, the surface of the concrete shall be thoroughly cleaned and all laitance removed. In addition to the foregoing, vertical joints shall be thoroughly wetted, but not saturated, and sluiced with a coat of neat cement grout immediately before placing new concrete.\n\nFLOOR FINISH\n\nFloor, curb and exterior face of concrete shall be trowelled to a smooth even surface.\nOttawa October 29, 1947.\n\nRe: Principals' Residence and Electrical and Heating Building,\nHay River, N.W.T.\n\nWe are sending you herewith four blueprints of proposed piling and foundation details, for above buildings, together with four copies of specifications for reinforced concrete work entailed in the design.\n\nArchitectural drawings and specifications are in course of preparation while water supply and sewage disposal is under study.\n\nIt is hoped that it may yet be possible to have the wood piles placed this year so that adfreezing may take place during the winter.\n\nR.A.

The construction of these buildings at Hay River by Peter Mattson is authorized by Order-in-Council on a cost plus 10% basis, all bills and accounts to be certified by a cost auditor, Department of Finance, and then sent to the Chief Treasury Officer, Indian Affairs Branch, for payment.\n\nThe Director of the Indian Affairs Branch says that your Mr. W.A. Campbell, now at Hay River, would be able to interview Mr. Mattson and to ascertain if he is agreeable to the terms of the sample contract sent to him and if so to arrange to have Mr. Mattson proceed with the placing of the piles of the school building and residence. I am told that as soon as Indian Affairs Branch receives a reply from Mr. Mattson, indicating acceptance of terms, a contract in duplicate will be sent him for completion. In the meantime, however, it seems that no time should be lost.\n\nI gather from our discussion today that Mr. Campbell is coming out shortly on account of ill health but that Mr. G.R.

However, we are finding that this is very far from being the case.\n\nThe specifications for the building being constructed are entirely different from any that has been built previously as an Indian day school. This is due to the permafrost condition which exists at Hay River. Because of this, we have previously requested you to appoint an official who could supervise the rather unusual type of construction necessitated by the climatic condition which exists in this area.\n\nOn August 14 an Order-in-Council No. P.C. 3269 was obtained for the granting of a contract for the erection of this school to Mr. Peter Mattson of Hay River.\n\nYou will recall that on June 17 I received a letter from you in which Mr. Fred Fraser, Mining Recorder at Yellowknife, had sent you a wireless message reading as follows:\n\n\"RETEL THIRTEENTH MATSON REPORTED COMPETENT AND RELIABLE IN EVERY WAY\".\n\nWhen the blueprints and specifications of the proposed piling and foundation details for these buildings were ready, they were forwarded to Mr. Mattson on November 3. On November 4\nour Chief Treasury Officer drew to the attention of our Superintendent of Education the following comment which had been made by G. H. Colson, Treasury Cost Auditor, after a visit to Mr. Mattson at Hay River:\n\n\"I gathered from Mr. Mattson that he is not in a position to finance the purchase of materials and he would be glad to know what arrangements are being made regarding this\".\n\nIt was then decided, before any further steps could be taken, that a sample copy of our standard contract should be sent to Mr. Mattson for his consideration.\n\nWe have now received an answer from Mr. Mattson reading as follows:\n\n\"To your letter of November 5 including sample contract, I have with careful attention noticed difficulties regarding Hay River School contract, which I am fully aware of and capable to fulfill and operate, with the exception of financial obligations as my funds are very limited. Therefore I require your financial backing as far as purchasing and transporting materials to school grounds, wages paid out, operational expenses required for construction.\n\n\"I have on instructions from Chief Engineer Campbell started operational forework, such as preparing holes for piling, road to school grounds, wood supplies for steam jetting, pilings ready for delivery, small building for equipment storage. Trusting you will find this satisfactory and that arrangements can be made for financing.\n\n\"Please notify if above arrangements can be made, as Hay River mail will not arrive until December 5.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that our nearest Indian Agent is Dr. Mulvihill, located at Fort Resolution, which is several\nhundred miles away, it will not be possible for us to arrange the financing of this project as suggested.\n\nDue to the fact that you will have a supervising engineer on the job, it is recommended that your Branch take over the responsibility for the construction of this school and principal's residence. We will set up the necessary encumbrance for the amount voted. While our Education Division is willing to assume the responsibility for the construction of standard one and two room school buildings, it is felt, in view of the technical and other difficulties involved in the erection of this Hay River School plant, that it should be handled by the Lands and Development Services.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 1, 1947.\n\nMr. R.

It will, therefore, be some little time before a legal survey plan is available but the tract is Crown land under the direct jurisdiction of this Department and I can assure you that as soon as the survey plan is received a permanent reservation in favour of your Branch will be made in our records.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nRegarding Hay River Road Construction\n\nI must draw your attention to certain difficulties in digging holes to permafrost which varies from different depths in most cases. I find that I must rely on cribbing to hold pits from washing and falling in about four feet from fresh water to contend with. Therefore, I must have lumber to permit digging down to permafrost, and not have any difficulty in gaining down with the cribbing. I had such experience in quicksand and water, to give an estimate on amount of lumber required in this matter will be very difficult as there unknown depth of cribbing.\nA rough estimate of about 2500 b. ft. (or feet) should do. Therefore, request your permission to order such material urgently needed, for means of transportation of lumber from local saw mills, water to be heated to boilers at all times, more wood for boilers, etc., etc. I am badly in need of a truck, pending at truck or month's rent, dollars, all repairs and possible demurrage of truck at owner's expense.\n\nI would appreciate if you could forward a granting authorizing me of this privilege.\n\nKindly reply by return mail if possible.\n\nBy parcel post express C.P.R., will receive mail 8 to 3 times weekly!\n\nYours very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRay River\nN.W.T.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, December 6, 1947.\n\nHay River School and teacherage\n\nDear Mr. Mattson:\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 26.

Mattson, received a copy of the standard form for cost plus contracts from Mr. Neary, Supt. of Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs Branch. The covering letter was dated Nov.6 but was only received on yesterday's mail plane. Until this contract form was received Mr. Mattson was not aware that he would have to finance the operation and was under the impression that he was to submit accounts for materials and labour to the Indian Department for payment. He advises me that he will now have to go to Edmonton to arrange finances.\n\n\"Mr. Mattson seems to be a competent and conscientious workman but as a contractor will require considerable assistance from the Department in arranging for materials and getting things organized.\"\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDecember 3, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Hay River School and Residency,\nContractor Mattson,\n\nThe following information is submitted in accordance with the verbal request of Mr. Gibson on the above man who will be responsible for the construction of the Hay River school and residency.\n\nThe selection of Mattson to take over the construction was made by officials of the Northwest Territories Bureau. On receipt of foundation plans for the residency by Mr. Mattson a discussion of the contract with him left me with the impression that he would not be able to finance the project. I am of the opinion that though Mr. Mattson would be an excellent tradesman on construction above floor level, his experience and knowledge of foundation work appeared to be limited, more particularly regarding steam jetting. I was not satisfied that Mr. Mattson could infuse sufficient momentum into arranging the necessary equipment and supplies for the preliminary work of piling.\n\nIt is not my intention of underestimating Mattson as being a thorough builder, particularly with timber construction, as I am of the opinion his finished work will pass the most rigid inspection. I would point out that there is no other man in Hay River or perhaps in Yellowknife who could or would undertake this construction.\n\nTo S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.A. Campbell\nRe - Hay River Schools.\n\nWe discussed today with Col. Neary of Indian Affairs, your Messrs. Buck and W. Campbell, and our Mr. McKinnon and Mr. Sinclair, your memorandum of the 3rd instant and Mr. Hoey's of the 2nd instant re problems involved in the construction of the above school.\n\nMr. P. Mattson, the only contractor available, is from all reports a reliable contractor but is unable to finance the purchase of materials. Further, the Indian Affairs Branch wish to be relieved of all responsibility other than turning over of funds.\n\nThe first step is to have the contract with Mr. Mattson completed with the following understanding:\n\n1. Indian Affairs will turn over the $30,000 to this Branch at once.\n\n2. That the placing of piles, under way, should be proceeded with.\n\n3. Your Mr. Bruce Douglas at Hay River will act as Clerk of Works, keep time and record of material used and submit pay lists to our Acting Agent, Mr. A.H. Gibson, Fort Smith, on the 15th and at the end of each month.\n\n4. Mr. Douglas will submit progress reports as often as possible by air mail and estimates of requirements to meet expenditures bi-monthly, a sufficient time in advance to permit funds to be set up in the Fort Smith office on the 15th and end of each month.\n\n5. Payment of accounts and wages will be made by our Fort Smith office on certification by Mr. Mattson and Mr. Douglas.\n\n2...\n(6) Since there will have to be a hold back on Mr. Mattson who is working on a cost-plus basis, advances for himself should be limited to what would be paid a foreman.\n\nThe Comptroller of the Treasury, Mr. McIntyre, agreed over the telephone to advise what arrangements could be made for cost audit.\n\nIt was agreed that if seasoned building material could be secured at comparable laid-down prices by purchasing and dismantling Abasand Oils Limited buildings at McMurray, Alberta, rather than use green local lumber, it would be preferable. Mr. Buck and Mr. W. Campbell are to discuss this at once with Assistant Chief Engineer Goodspeed of the Department of Public Works and Mr. Wilbur Norrish of Mines, Forests and Scientific Services Branch.

A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Glen,\n\nMay I be permitted to offer a few remarks regarding your letter of the 5th instant re the proposed Hay River day school?\n\nIn the first place, I am obliged to say that no arrangement between Mr. Keenleyside and His Excellency Bishop Trocquier has been agreed upon. On the contrary, His Excellency in a written document has exposed his objections and refused in a very explicit manner to accept the offer of the plan of Mr. Keenleyside.\n\nSecondly, I cannot see why the Department has seen fit to proceed with the implementation of a project which His Excellency considers as a violation of the rights guaranteed by law and confirmed by long years of recognition, of white and Indian children of the Catholic Faith.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we respectfully submit that we do not agree with your statement to the effect that \"the arrangement was agreed to and does not contemplate any changes in or disturbs the existing rights of persons of any religious denominations.\"\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"J.

Plans covering all details will arrive as soon as completed. In order to construct these piles I must build heated sheds large enough for storage and heating of material. I have not as yet estimated the amount of lumber required for this purpose but will as soon as I have worked out an estimate and amount of gravel, cement, storage space - maybe room for mixing and pouring cement. Material for this shed must be transported in over winter road as here are no lumber available for this purpose at local mill.\n\nI must draw your attention to the letter of November 24th regarding financial difficulties. Kindly notify possibilities for financing as soon as possible as well as purchasing material urgently needed. I am getting seriously delayed in preparing and putting of timber pilings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPeter Mattson\nOttawa, March 22, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nHay River Indian Day School\n\nIncluded in our 1947-48 Supplementary Estimates was the sum of $30,000.00 for the construction of a four-room Indian Day School at Hay River, Northwest Territories.\n\nEncumbrance certificates to the amount of $30,000.00 have now been raised and this construction is being carried out under the supervision of your Branch.\n\nI have been advised by my Superintendent of Education that your Branch estimates $46,000.00 will be required during the fiscal year to pay for the work being done and the materials being purchased at Hay River. It would therefore seem to be necessary to transfer $16,000.00 to Hay River from other construction projects.\n\nIt would also seem evident that an additional sum will have to be voted in our 1948-49 supplementary estimates.

Henney,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, April 9, 1948.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe - Hay River Indian School and Principal's Residence\n\nBefore the arrangement was made to have the Indian schools in the Mackenzie District erected by your department the Indian Affairs Branch had entered into an arrangement with a contractor named Peter Mattson for the construction of an Indian school and principal's residence at Hay River, N.W.T., the authority for this action being Order in Council P.O. 3256, copy attached.\n\nThe project consists not only of a four-roomed day school but also a principal's residence and connected heating plant. The cost has been variously estimated at $60,000 to $85,000.\n\nAs you know the transportation expenses are higher, also wage rates, and there are the usual difficulties of construction in remote districts. Contractor Mattson is said to be a capable and trustworthy builder and he knows conditions in the district.\n\nOut of funds available for 1947-48 we arranged for the footings which had to be of a special character owing to the perma frost condition. I believe that the orders have been placed for the greater part of the materials required for the construction of the school and principal's residence.\n\nOur difficulty is to arrange for the adequate supervision of this job because the engineer on the Northwest Territories end of the Grimshaw-Great Slave Lake road is pretty\nwell occupied with the task in hand and in any event he is primarily a road builder. We would like to have your district engineer at Edmonton take over the responsibility for the completion of this job and if you approve we will see that your chief engineer here is furnished with full particulars so that the project may be carried to completion under the arrangements authorized.\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\nIndian Education\n\nApril 21, 1948\n\n516 48 49\n\n13-491 905\n\nCompleting construction of new school at Hay River,\nN.W.T. ---- $20,000.00\n\n(This work being done under the supervision of\nthe Lands and Development Services Branch)\nMemorandum\n\nWith regard to Hay River Indian School buildings, Establishment 905, and further to our memorandum of April 3rd, the final expenditure figure for the above project is $41,200.00 in the season 1947-48. This is below estimate for the reason that some of the suppliers' invoices for materials delivered in March will arrive too late for payment out of 1947-48 fiscal year funds. This figure covering expenditures, together with the tentative estimate of $85,000.00, total cost given in our memorandum of April 3rd, should give Indian Affairs Branch some idea as to funds required during 1948-49.\n\nT.S.

BLAIS, CHIEF ENGINEER, D.P.W., OTTAWA.\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of the 19th instant - file Misc.4-1 - with attached copy of letter of the 9th instant from the Acting Deputy Minister, Department of Mines and Resources, to the Deputy Minister of this Department.\n\nThere was not, however, enclosed with your letter a copy of the Order-in-Council P.C.3269, as mentioned in the Acting Deputy Minister's letter.\n\nEnquiry is made if I could take over the supervision of the construction of an Indian School and Principal's Residence, which is now under construction at Hay River, N.W.T. by Mr. Peter Mattson. This project has been under the direction of the Engineer representing the Department of Mines and Resources on the Grimshaw-Hay River road, up to the present.\n\nI would be agreeable to take over the direction of the completion of these two buildings. I should be given all particulars regarding the past procedure which has been adopted in carrying out this project and should also be informed of the cut-off date when the interests of those who have previously directed this project will cease and my responsibility begins.\n\nIt is generally unsatisfactory to take over an unfinished job from another party, but in view of the request from the Acting Deputy Minister of the Department of Mines and Resources, I am, as above stated, willing to undertake this work. I may point out, however, that the work has been initiated by others and if the cost is too high I should not be asked to assume any responsibility for this. This does not mean that there is any intention of negligence here in completing this project, but merely that there has been divided responsibility and that I am called on to continue systems and methods which, when once started, cannot be changed.\n\nI visited Hay River on March 21st in company with Mr. J.W. McKinnon, Inspector of Schools. Mr. McKinnon wished to see the progress made in the construction of this school and while I inspected the construction work to date, with him, my visit at that time had not the same interest in the project but was only of a general nature. From this visit, however, I am aware of the work which has been done to date, and the placing of concrete piles 12 X 12 inches -26 feet- under the school building and timber piles under the proposed residence.\n\nOn account of the project being undertaken by others, and the need of my being fully informed of same and also to ensure proper supervision, I propose to put a Clerk on this job, full time, for a considerable period. A full check must be made of the materials which have been ordered, the prospects of a continuous flow of supplies to ensure the completion of the project, and also the ordering of any shortages which may develop from a study of the situation. Furthermore, if instructed to take over this project, I shall have an Engineer from this Office visit Hay River for several days, learn fully all angles of the work to date, and what is proposed, and leave a clerk there, as a Departmental representative, to keep control of the situation; also from time to time an Engineer will visit the project during the remainder of its construction.\n\nIt will be necessary, providing I am asked to undertake this work, to put a man in charge of it practically immediately. I would therefore ask approval for a Clerk Grade 4, to be assigned to this staff for this work, for a three months' period beginning approximately May 1st.\nIf further extensions are necessary from time to time, I shall advise you.\n\nSgd.

Johnston.\n\nAs explained in our Acting Deputy Minister's letter to your Deputy Minister of the 9th April, we would like Mr. Johnston to take over the responsibility for the completion of this job. Mr. Johnston has asked what out-off date is to be used for this project, and, after discussing the matter with the Chief Engineer of our Engineering and Construction Division, it has been suggested that May 30th be the date when Mr. Johnston should take over the supervision of this job.\n\nMr. Bruce Douglas, who is now in charge of the work at Hay River, will be able to supply Mr. Johnston's engineer with full particulars about supplies, materials and past procedure, and it is suggested that Mr. Johnston arrange to have his engineer visit Hay River during the month of May for this purpose.\n\nThe recommendation made by Mr. Johnston for the employment of a Clerk, Grade IV, to be assigned to this job, is approved, and I have been informed that the Indian Affairs Branch will provide the necessary funds when requested by your department. It is considered that Mr. Johnston should arrange for the employment of this clerk, and as Mr. Johnston will not be taking over direct supervision until May 30th, this will give him plenty of time to secure a suitable employee.\nOrder in Council, P.C. 3269, referred to by Mr. Johnston, covers the employment of Peter Mattson, the contractor, and a copy of this Order in Council will be obtained and forwarded to you shortly for transmission to Mr. Johnston.\n\nsgd.

The accounts received up to May 31 will be made a charge against the financial encumbrance provided for this purpose and any unused balance remaining as at that date will be returned to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn order that there be no misunderstanding regarding the accounts coming for payment after May 31, it is felt that as your department will have both supervisory and financial responsibility, you will wish to have the Indian Affairs Branch provide you with a financial encumbrance to cover the anticipated expenditures for the remainder of the current fiscal year. In this way the accounts would be handled by your Department in the same way as those dealing with our building program in the Mackenzie District for which financial encumbrances have been raised. It is assumed that you will take this matter up direct with Mr. R. A. Hoey, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, to whom a copy of this letter is being forwarded.\n\nH. A.

Misc. 4-1.\n\nWe have been advised by the Director of our Lands and Development Services Branch with regard to the arrangements made in turning over the construction of the Hay River Indian Day School to your Department as from June first.\n\nWe provided a sum of $20,000.00 in our Main 1948-49 Estimates for work on this project. It is understood that this sum has been expended and that additional funds are required. Therefore, we have included in our Supplementary Estimates for 1948/49 the sum of $35,000.00 for this work.\n\nWe have already had to transfer $3,000.00 from other projects to the Hay River School building. We are now advised that another $5,000.00 will be required for the June payroll. We are also advised by Lands and Development Services Branch that $4,000.00 will be required by them to pay accounts anticipated for the period ending May 31, 1948. The situation,\ntherefore, with regard to funds for this school can be summarized as follows:\n\nAmount provided in Supplementary Estimates .......... $35,000.00\n\nTransfers made from other projects .................. 8,000.00\n\nAmount remaining after transfers repaid ............ 27,000.00\n\nAmount required by Lands and Development Services Branch ..................... 4,000.00\n\n$23,000.00\n\nCopy sent to Mr. R.

We are today in receipt of a message to the effect that power will not be available locally for another year.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Mr. Buck, Chief Architect of the Engineering and Construction Division, who has advised that an electric power generating plant should be purchased and installed in the new Hay River school. Since this school is being constructed by your Branch we are passing along this information to you, and we have advised both Mr. Buck and the Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works that further instructions in connection with this matter will originate with your Branch.\n\nSpecifications for a suitable electric generating unit are being prepared by our Engineering and Construction Division, and will be forwarded by Chief Engineer Mills within a few days.\n\nR.

Roey, Esq., Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Booth Building, Ottawa.\n\nWe note by your memorandum of June 8th that there is evidently a misunderstanding as to the need for some source of electrical power in order to supply the new four-room school with separate principal's residence at Hay River. The plans call for these buildings to be heated by forced draught hot air furnaces using oil as a fuel. Since electrical power is necessary to operate both the oil burner and the forced draught system, it will be necessary to ensure that a power supply is available.\n\nIt is, therefore, suggested that your Branch discuss the requirements with Chief Architect Buck of the Engineering and Construction Division in order that provision may be made in the supplementary estimates for the funds necessary to purchase the required equipment.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nHay River Indian Day School\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum of June 11, 1948, that it will be necessary to provide a source of electrical power to operate both the oil burner and the forced draught system.\n\nAs no funds are provided for this additional expenditure in our 1948/49 main or supplementary estimates, could we please be advised as to the additional sum which will be required for this power unit. It will be necessary to include this amount either in our next supplementary estimates or by transfer of funds from another project.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, CANADA\n\n19 June, 1948.\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nWith reference to the construction of Hay River Indian day school, enclosed is copy of report dated 11th June, 1948, from District Engineer W.J. Johnston dealing at some length with the matter of taking over the supervision of construction of the above school. Mr. Johnston seems to have gone very thoroughly into this matter, but would seem to be worrying unduly about the division of cost previous to the 31st May and subsequent to the 1st June. If you want the costs carefully segregated, we will arrange for any accounts covering material ordered previous to the 31st May to be sent in here and forwarded to you for payment, otherwise it would seem that he could arrange payment for any material which has not already been paid for, as the money is all coming from your Department and it is merely a matter of bookkeeping if you want to separate the costs later.\n\nYou will note that he estimates the completed cost of the work at approximately $100,000. and in Mr. White's report he estimates the amount required to complete the work at $40,000.00. Your 193-2-5 of the 3rd June, 1948, indicates that only $23,000.00 will be available after Supplementary Estimates have been passed. If it is not too late, it might be advisable for you to include a further amount of $17,000.00 in your Supplementary Estimates to cover Mr. Johnston's estimated expenditure.\n\nAs money will be required to meet the June pay-lists, will you please transfer as much as possible, as soon as possible, to this Department to cover expected commitments.\n\nKindly let me have your comments on Mr. Johnston's report at your earliest convenience.\n\n(Signed) R.

We feel that your Branch is in the best position to reply to this letter.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nExtract from Annual Report on Fort Resolution Northwest Territories Agency, dated 1947-48.\n\nHay River\n\nIt is expected that the village of Hay River will, on the completion of the highway from Grimshaw, become an important community. Fishing at Hay River is exceptionally good, the people always have sufficient to eat. Because of the good fishing several companies offer employment to Indians during the winter months. Up to the present additional employment with highway construction gangs has been available but I understand that since the Indian is not a reliable worker, there is a growing tendency to import white labour.\n\nThe Indians at Hay River have called for less action on my part than those in any other settlement. Miss Neville of the Anglican Mission attends to most of their medical problems, although she can do nothing about the Tuberculosis situation. There is a need, however, for a new modern nursing station at this community. Constable D. Allan of the R.C.M. Police handles the distribution of Indian welfare rations; his assistance is greatly appreciated.\n\nAlthough the Indians at Hay River are better off financially than those of Fort Resolution since they have a greater opportunity for employment, their houses and persons are not as clean.\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAdditional funds required for the construction of four-room Indian Day School at Hay River, N.W.T. $23,000.00\n\n(This work is being done under the supervision of the Department of Public Works)\n3 July, 1948.\n\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nThe following telegram has been received from District Engineer W.

File 1997-2 and C.S.\nFile Misc. 4-11\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of June 19th, addressed to the Director of Indian Affairs Branch, with the various reports attached dealing with the above project.\n\nWith regard to the division of costs and the handling of accounts from the cut-off period of June 1st, we do not believe that Mr. H.J. Johnston should experience any trouble in dealing with these matters. Most of the material ordered on our Departmental purchase order forms has been invoiced and is included in accounts for the period May 6th to May 31st. It is possible that a few items were not invoiced prior to the end of May but our files at Ray River are open to the inspection of your officers at any time, and there should be no difficulty in keeping the records straight in this manner.\n\nThe following summary is detailed for the information of your officers:\n\nExpenditures - 1948-49\n\nContractor's price costs ........................................ $21,713.96\nCosts other than Contractor's .................................. 54.67\nAdvances on account of fees ................................... 600.00\nTotal ................................................................. $22,868.63\n\nLess rebates, deductions\nfrom wages for board ............................................. 815.45\nNet Expenditures ................................................ $21,953.18\n\nAllotments total .................................................... $23,000.00\nBalance of funds on hand ....................................... 1,466.82\nAccounts on hand for payment ................................. $4,593.51\n\nR.Mais, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLess funds on hand: $1,635.78\n\nAdditional funds required:\n\nPeter Mattson's Fee Account:\n- Credit in holdback, 1947-48: $1,635.78\n- Credit in holdback, 1948-49: $1,572.22\n- 10% fee due on accounts held: $452.51\n- Total credit on account of fee: $3,660.51\n\nTotal Commitments this Department:\n- 1947-48 expenditures (net): $40,795.14\n- 1948-49 expenditures (net): $21,555.18\n- Peter Mattson's credits: $3,892.22\n- Unpaid accounts: $4,593.51\n- Total: $70,846.25\n\nAllotments:\n- 1947-48: $40,795.14\n- 1948-49: $21,555.18\n- Additional funds required: $7,618.71\n\nFunds voted 1948-49:\n- Supplementary estimates: $35,000.00\n- Less funds received: $3,000.00\n- Funds required this Department, additional: $7,018.71\n\nFunds remaining for Dept. of Public Works: $24,287\n\nYou will note from the above figures that net expenditures for 1947-48 were $40,795.14, due to rebates for board deductions amounting to $416.78. Total allotments are, therefore, the net expenditures for 1947-48 amounting to $40,795.14, plus $20,000.00 voted for 1948-49, plus $35,000.00 in the Supplementary Estimates, or a total of $95,795.14. If your estimate of $100,000 is correct the amount of additional funds required is $4,204.86. However, the figures presented herewith will give you a better idea of the situation as it is. It will be possible by this time for your officers to secure definite knowledge as to how much work is yet to be ordered, and what the cost of same will be. Information the unpaid accounts held by us, amounting to nearly $4,600 include all the gravel charges amounting to nearly $4,500. It is understood that the only substantial item of expense is the mill work.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\nWith regard to the $3,892.22 credit to Mattson on account of his 10% fee, as your Department has taken over all matters pertaining to financing and supervision, it would seem advisable now to transfer Mattson's credit on account of his 10% fee to you. However, this Department paid some items of equipment with the understanding that the holdback on account of the Contractor's 10% fee would stand as a guarantee that the equipment would be accounted for in full. We note that your inventory of equipment calls a number of items and we will supply you with a list of equipment purchased by us, shortly.\n\nIn connection with equipment we recently refused payment of Lionel Gagnier's account covering kitchen equipment (which included above at $75.00) amounting to $155.50, on the ground that the Contractor was running up an unreasonable expense on account of kitchen equipment. We advised our officer at Bay River that the Contractor should pay this account himself. It is noted that your inventory of equipment includes a skill saw. We advised our representative, upon receipt of a purchase order covering this item, that we did not approve the purchase of same, and the account has not been presented to us for payment. The responsibility of payment or otherwise for this item will naturally be yours. We are mentioning these matters to make sure that our position is understood.\n\nFor your information we have allowed the Contractor 10% on his prime cost. This cost does not include some amounts spent by our Department.\n\nIt is our understanding that Indian Affairs Branch budgeted to take care of your June paylist estimated at $5,000.00. If you have not received this initial allotment you should contact the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWith reference to the boiler used for steam-jetting holes for piles, as ordered from Reliance Welding Works, 9566 Jasper Avenue, Edmonton, Alta., we wrote to them on June 2nd, asking them to forward their invoice for the agreed price of $500.00, f.o.b. Edmonton, repair work completed and without rental. To date, we have received no reply but it is our intention to forward the invoice to you for payment as soon as same is received. Otherwise, we would have to increase our $7,018.91 requirement by $500.00.\n\nWe will prepare as soon as possible and forward to you a Progress Statement of expense classification, together with equipment list.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nHay River Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Department of Public Works, Hay River, Northwest Territories.\n\nHay River, Northwest Territories.\n\nPurpose for which required\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 20       |            |       |\n| Single School Desks, small. |            |       |\n| 20       |            |       |\n| \"        | medium     |       |\n| 20       |            |       |\n| \"        | large      |       |\n| 2       | Teacher's Desks |       |\n| 2       | Teacher's Chairs |       |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Because of the forced hot air heating system used in these two buildings it is necessary that we provide a source of alternating current power for the coming heating season.\n\nThe estimated cost of lighting plant equipment for a permanent installation is approximately $10,000.00 with an annual operating and maintenance cost of approximately $1,200.00. The probable yearly cost of purchasing power from a local source at the Power Company's proposed revised rate of 18 cents per kilowatt hour is estimated at $1,300.00. In view of these costs, we investigated the possibility of providing a temporary source of power necessary for the operations of the heating equipment until such time as the local power source is available.\n\nThe scheme we propose, consists of providing an automatically controlled generating unit to supply heating equipment only, provision being made for supplying the lighting loads. This plant could be dismantled next year when the local power source is available and re-erected at some other location or retained at this site as a standby unit. Lighting where necessary, could be provided through the use of Coleman or equivalent type of lighting units. Mr. Kosmar of this Division, contacted Messrs B.F. Neary, J.W. McKinnon and H.R. Lamberton and discussed the proposition with them and they were in favour of providing electric power for the buildings as outlined above, as a temporary measure until the local source is available, rather than providing a permanent generating plant installation.\n\nA gasoline driven 5 kw, 110 volts, single phase, 60 cycle, alternating current generating unit with fully automatic control panel is recommended. In this connection we advise that the General Supply Company of Canada Limited, in Ottawa, have in stock a suitable unit which is a war surplus item. This unit is available at a reasonable price of $950.00, and complete with automatic control panel, which can be supplied, the cost of the Department should not exceed $1,100.00 f.o.b. Ottawa.\n\nShould it be decided to proceed on this basis, the Department of Public Works should be advised of the availability of the above mentioned generating unit and it is also suggested that they be requested to enquire as to the type of motors on the heating system equipment and if necessary make arrangements to provide regulation-division motors to limit the starting current. If it were found from test, that power was available after allowance was made for the starting load of the School fan unit motor, it would be possible to provide a number of temporary lighting outlets in advantageous areas.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIt will also be necessary for the Department of Public Works to arrange for distribution conductors to be run between the two buildings and to make provision, as required, for generating unit exhaust and ventilation. It is suggested that the panel feeders be disconnected and temporary connections made between the existing service switches and heating equipment.\n\nWe submit the above scheme for Indian Affairs consideration and advice on their decision in connection with this proposal.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, August 3, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH,\n\nElectrical Power Supply - Hay River Indian Day School\n\nReference your I.A. 1856-9\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum of 5 July, that a gasoline-driven 5 K.W., A.C. generating unit is recommended for use as a temporary power supply at the above school.\n\nYour recommendation in this regard is accepted and it is requested that you advise the Department of Public Works accordingly. It is understood that the cost of this unit should not exceed $1,100.00 T.o.b. Ottawa.

Lighting for the buildings will be provided by the Indian Affairs Branch through the use of fuel burning lamps as required.\n\nThe type of generating unit required is a 5 KW, 110 Volt, single phase, 60 cycle, A.C. unit equipped with fully automatic control panel to start and stop as the heating loads come on and off.\n\nYou are advised that the General Supply Co. of Canada at Ottawa have a war surplus plant in stock of the above capacity which can be supplied subject to prior sale complete with automatic control panel at a cost not exceeding $1,100.00 f.o.b. Ottawa. We suggest that this firm be contacted in an endeavour to provide power at the site as soon as possible.\n\nIt will be necessary for your engineers to provide conductors between the two buildings, use being made of the existing service switches and standpipes, and also to provide ventilation and exhaust openings in the walls for the generating unit.\n\nIt is suggested that the feeders to the lighting panels be disconnected until the local source is available, and that temporary connections be run from the generating unit to the heating equipment thus preventing indiscriminate use of the power. It is also suggested that your engineers consider the motors supplied with the heating equipment and have these replaced with low start type.\nOttawa, August 19, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Hay River Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease find attached copies of letters received from the Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works with regard to a number of accounts incurred prior to June 1st, in connection with the construction of the above school.\n\nIt is understood that you have funds still available for the payment of such accounts.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 18, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Hay River Indian School Buildings,\nYour file C.R. 12967 - and C.E.\nMisc. 4 - 1.\n\nFurther to our letter of June 29th dealing with the transfer of all responsibility for construction of the Hay River Indian School Buildings, we attach the following for your information:\n\n- 2 copies Expense Classification Statement.\n- 2 copies Camp & Kitchen inventory.\n- 2 copies Contractor's Equipment inventory.\n- 2 copies of steel barrels statement.\n\nWe are returning to Indian Affairs Branch the unspent balance of $826.53.\n\nIn the attached Expense Classification summary Peter Mattson's $2648.00 accountable advance is closed out by being treated as a charge against the Contractor's fee.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Director, Indian Affairs Branch, under cover of your letter dated August 17th, your file C.R. 12967-2, C.E. Misc. 4-1.\n\nI am sure you will agree that it would not be advisable for us to continue paying accounts covering the above project, even though they are dated prior to June 1st. You have representatives in the field who are competent to certify accounts and acknowledge receipt of supplies. You will have received by now, my letter of August 15th informing you that the unexpended balance was being transferred to the Indian Affairs Branch, which leaves our Branch without funds for the above project.\n\nG.E.B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCapitol Theatre Building,\nOttawa.\n\nIn order that you might be informed of the building progress at Hay River, I quote from a letter received on August 26th last.\n\n\"The school building itself is progressing slowly, mainly due to non-delivery of ordered materials. Mattson, however, has informed me in general discussion, that it is his plan to put on as many carpenters as he can possibly secure within limits to rush the main building to completion for use this fall. At the present date, the main building is in the studding stage on the upper floor and is sheathed in with ship-lap on the main floor. Foundation work, which is a large factor in the type of building being erected, is of course, completed. Continual rain throughout the last ten days has kept the crew from working most of the time.\n\nThe teacherage itself is much further advanced as is the boiler room attached to it. Shingling and outside finish has been completed and much of the inside work also. My personal estimate (and I wish to stress the point that it is only an estimate), is that the teacherage may be ready for occupancy by the end of September and the mail school building itself, possibly a month later if the ordered materials arrive in the near future. To substantiate such an estimate, I would prefer that you contact others in the area to get their idea\".\nSeveral large families have already moved into Hay River as permanent residents now that the road is open. This should, and I am sure will, assure you of at least fifty pupils and possibly many more.\n\nJ.W. McKinnon.\nCOPY - original sent to L. & D.

No. P P 62, addressed to the Director, Indian Affairs Branch, dealing with the payments due Mr. Peter Mattson as contractor has been referred to this office for reply.\n\nThe contract for the construction of a four-room Indian Day School and teachers' residence at Hay River, Northwest Territories, was awarded to Mr. Peter Mattson under authority of Order in Council P.C. 3269, dated August 14, 1947. It was soon realized that Mr. Mattson was not in a position to finance this construction operation from his own resources. As there was no other qualified contractor available in the district to take over the work, it was decided to continue the contract with Mr. Mattson and to assist him in financing the project by paying all accounts promptly as they came due.\n\nIt was also decided that since there would have to be a hold-back on Mr. Mattson who was working on a 10% cost plus basis, advances to him would be limited to what would be paid a foreman. This advance which was accountable against his 10% fee was set at $300.00 per month. In addition to this monthly advance he was given $500.00 as an accountable advance against his fee, when it appeared that he lacked sufficient financial resources to provide him with ready money for expenses payable in cash.\n\nIt is hoped that the above explanation of the arrangements made to enable Mr. Mattson to carry on the work will clarify for you the procedure which we followed in making payments to him. These arrangements seemed the best at the time but we are aware of no reason why you could not amend them as you see fit within the terms of the Order in Council and the contract with Mr. Mattson, to meet changed conditions.\n\nDirector.\n20 October, 1948.\n\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nAbout the 24th September last you were inquiring as to progress being made on the school building at Hay River. Enclosed is copy of report dated the 18th October from District Engineer W. J. Johnston covering all the school buildings for which he is responsible. It is hoped this is the information you want.\n\nR. Blais\nChief Engineer\n\nAAA/S.\nI am replying to your letter of September 24th - C.R.File PR.82 - making a report on the progress of school buildings at Hay River and other points.\n\nRE: Hay River: Work on this project has not progressed at too rapid a rate owing to the difficulty in obtaining sub-tradesmen as required. This refers to plumbers, electricians, and sheet metal workers for hot-air furnaces and duct installation. This has resulted in having to keep the carpenter crew at a smaller force than would otherwise be the case. However, all these tradesmen have either recently been at that point, or are engaged there now, so that it will be possible shortly to add more carpenters to the labour force. An estimate was given by Mr. Matson of the work load, that with the crew then engaged, the project could be finished in January. However, as soon as it is practicable to do so, I am adding as many carpenters as appears reasonable for the size of the job, so as to be assured of completion during the present calendar year.\n\nRE: Roche River: The E-Glenaroc Day School and Teachers' Quarters has been erected and has outside finish on the walls and a built-up tar and gravel roof recently completed by a roofing contractor from Edmonton. The roughing-in has been done for electricity. The hot-air furnaces and heating ducts are now being installed. It was not possible for the plumbing contractor to deliver materials to destination this year, owing, in part to the lateness in which the contract was let, and also to the fact that there are only about four boats per season from Fort Smith to this point. Carpenter work has advanced to a point where three carpenters could finish by early December. Work on this project was closed down for the season on the 15th instant, due to the impossibility of having a generator delivered, which was necessary for operation of the blower in connection with the hot-air furnace. I wrote you by letter #2961 on October 6th, in reference to specifications calling for a fully automatic electric generating machine, and the reluctance of firms to supply this unit. I am still awaiting your instructions if a manually controlled machine could be installed.\n\nSo far as I know, no desks or schoolroom fittings have been received at Roche River, and there is no furniture on hand for the teacher's quarters. In fact, the arrival of these fittings, furniture, and so forth, at a settlement where there is little, if any, warehouse storage space, presents a problem and it is doubtful if such should be delivered until the school building is ready to receive these articles, which represent a considerable investment. It should, however, be possible to begin work next spring on the school project and have it completed early in June when the first boat arrives there. Incoming shipments of furniture, classroom supplies, fittings, rations for the teacher, and so forth, should be scheduled to arrive on the first boat arriving at Roche River next year. That would permit the opening of school by July 1st if this were desired.\n\n(OWR)\nRE FORT NORMAN: - A carpenter crew is engaged at Fort Norman and is being retained there over freeze-up. The building is closed in with siding in place, and a tar and gravel roof has been proceeded with so as to protect the building, but not wholly completed; cold weather in the late fall preventing its completion. Electrical work has been completed, hot-air heating installed, and in operation. The carpenter crew will finish, it is expected, during January. At that time the class could be transferred if desired, from the present temporary quarters, to the new school building. The alternative would be to retain the school in its present quarters until the spring or early summer, when the weather would not be too severe for the transfer. This, however, is a matter for local decision. Some work will be needed next year, such as outside painting, installation of plumbing, and other small items of unfinished work.\n\nRE FORT FRANKLIN: - Practically all materials have been delivered at Great Bear River and are held in storage there over winter. This department had several prefabricated buildings erected during previous years at Great Bear River and also had a crew of men work there during 1948. This crew had the materials for Fort Franklin placed within the prefabricated buildings, and also under our tarpaulins and tent shelters which were erected. It is intended to move the materials to destination at first hands in June, 1949.\n\nRE FORT HALL NORTH: - Practically all materials have been delivered at this point. The materials are either stored in a local warehouse, or within the shed which was erected by this department on the school property. Thus sufficient materials are on hand to warrant beginning this work when weather conditions permit in 1949.\n\nRE ARTHUR RED RIVER: - The bulk of materials have been delivered at this point and placed within existing buildings, or under tarpaulins, tents, and so forth. It would appear work could begin here in 1949 when weather conditions permit.\n\nRE JOCKEY RIVER: - Approximately 30% of the freight has been delivered at this point and is properly warehoused or stored for over winter. A quantity of gravel was also delivered in readiness for construction next year. Some 90 tons of freight is in custody of Hudson's Bay Company (Mackenzie River Transport) at Niktoyaktuk - some 100 miles north of Athabasca. This material will be forwarded but cannot reach Coppermine until the latter part of July 1949.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS: - The question of delivery of classroom furniture and fittings; of furniture and supplies and foodstuffs for the teacher's quarters, is one which should be given attention. If these articles are not ordered and delivered in 1949 it will mean that the programme of classroom instruction may be deferred a year, in the event of the buildings being completed and no fittings on hand for them. Thus all supplies should be ordered and sent forward for delivery, as follows:\n\n- Jockey River: to reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Hudson's Bay Co., Bay River: to reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Northern Transportation Company;\n- Fort Norman: to reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Northern Transportation Company;\n- Fort Franklin: to reach Waterways Aug. 1st for forwarding by N.T. Company;\n- Fort Good Hope: to reach Waterways July 15th for forwarding by N.T. Company;\n- Arctic Red River: to reach Waterways June 15th for forwarding by N.T. Company;\n- Coppermine: to reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Hudson's Bay Co.\n\nA spare copy of this letter is attached in case you may wish to submit same to the Indian Affairs Branch for attention of its Department of Education.\n\nW.J.

Every effort is, however, being made to have the building completed this calendar year, but I could advise you more closely in this respect in a month's time.\n\nIn regard to shipping teacher's furniture to Hay River, it is doubtful if bulky material of this kind should be sent by truck over the highway beyond what is immediately necessary for the teacher to set up housekeeping.

J. Johnston, who had taken over the completion of the four-classroom day school and teacherage at Hay River, N.W.T., estimated the cost of completion of this work at $17,000, and asked if you could arrange to have this amount placed in your Supplementary Estimates.\n\nUnder date of October 21, 1948 Mr. Johnston reported that the amount now required to finish this school was $25,000. Copy of this letter is attached. As there seems to be some question as to the necessity for this full amount or whether some of it could be provided out of funds already authorized, he was asked to check his statement and say whether the $25,000 was the total required to complete the construction of the school and teacherage in the current fiscal year and whether any money would be required next year or not. He replied under date of November 3rd, copy of which reply is also enclosed, and it will be seen that the full $25,000 is required. May arrangements be made, please, to have this money obtained from some source and transferred to this Department so it may be encumbered for use of the District Engineer in completing this work.\n\nIn this connection I would call attention to the fact that we have today received a wire from Mr. Johnston stating that the necessity for this money is\nurgent and that if he does not receive it immediately, he will have to close down the work. As a result of telephone conversation between our Mr. Anderson and your Mr. Phelan I have sent a wire to District Engineer Johnston that $8,800. is being made available immediately and that the remainder of the $25,000. will be available next week. It is hoped that you will be able to make it available by that time.\n\nR. Blais,\nChief Engineer.\n\nAAA/R\nEncls.\nIt has been practically impossible up to now to give you an idea of the cost of construction of the four-classroom day school and teacher's quarters at Hay River, N.W.T. This was by reason of the fact that this Department (Public Works) took over the project after it had been started, and there was not a clear idea immediately of what materials had been ordered and what were still necessary to obtain. It has taken some time to collect this information.\n\nA summary of the situation insofar as the Department of Public Works is concerned, and, neglecting previous expenditures and authorizations, is as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Accounts received some time ago and awaiting funds | $900.00  |\n| Paylist for two-weeks' period up to Oct. 16th     | 2,300.00 |\n| Additional outstanding accounts now on hand       | 2,650.00 |\n| **Total of outstanding accounts at present**      | **$5,850.00** |\n\n**Estimate of cost to complete work:**\n\nLabour - Paylist for four pay periods of two weeks at $2,300.00 (assumed to Dec.11/45) 9,200.00\n\nMaterials - Additional purchases to be made (including generator at $4,000.00) and contingencies 9,950.00\n\n**Total** 25,000.00\n\nMay the amount of $25,000.00 be released at once to the District Treasury Office here to pay outstanding accounts and also expenses which will be incurred in the near future. For Estimate purposes I have given a completion date of December 11th for this project, but it may not be possible to reach this objective. There is now a considerable labour force at work here and work should be speeded up from now on. There would, however, be an unnecessary expense in adding to the present\nI acknowledge your letter of the 23rd of October in reply to my letter No. 3205 of October 21st in which I ask that $25,000 be released to the District Treasury Office, Edmonton, in order to pay outstanding accounts, and the further sum necessary to complete the 4-Classroom Day School and Teachersage at Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nIn paragraph three of your letter you state the Chief Treasury Officer has pointed out there was a balance on hand in the District Treasury Office in Edmonton of about $5,700 at the end of September. The books in the District Treasury Office here close around the 22nd or 23rd of each month in order to comply with expenditures being made on behalf of the Department of Transport. Thus when my letter of October 21st was written it was practically a month after the closing of the books for the month of September in the District Treasury Office. My letter was written after checking with the District Treasury Office here and learning that their funds were practically exhausted.\n\nAttached hereto is the most recent statement received, of the progress of work at Hay River, N.W.T., for period October 17th to 30th. It will be noted by this report that everything is going ahead in full swing for a project of this size.\n\nPaylist for period October 17th to 30th has just been received amounting to $5,983.47 before deductions have been made. There is at present engaged on this project the following:\n\n| Position                        | Number |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Peter Mattson (Contractor)      | 1      |\n| Carpenters                      | 12     |\n| Carpenter Helpers               | 3      |\n| Bricklayer and Helper           | 2      |\n| Painter                         | 1      |\n| Labourers and Watchman          |        |\n| Cookhouse Staff                 | 3      |\n\nTOTAL - 25\n\nFrom this it will be seen that every effort is being made to complete this project as fast as possible consistent with its size. Hot air heating has been completed, electrical installation is about completed, and in the Teachersage only, the plumbing is about finished.\n\nEvery effort is being made to complete this project during the calendar year, or at most to have it so far along so that the completion would be not later than the middle of January, 1949.\n\nHeavy commitments have been made for purchase of materials and I am still receiving requests for small amounts covering shortages which have developed, in order to complete the project. It must be stressed that the amount of $25,000 is considered necessary; furthermore, that I had no part whatever in the inception of this project and knew nothing of its earlier costs until sometime after I assumed control of the Project on June 1st. Thus, without any further delay, the amount of money should be made available at once.\n\n(over)\nNo provision has been made for purchase of an electric generator and this is necessary for lighting and also to operate the fan in the school which regulates the hot air heating. In fact, without this fan, electrically operated, the hot air system cannot be made to function efficiently. I am, however, withholding making an expenditure to the amount of $4,000 until I am assured that money will be made available to complete the project. It is inconceivable at this time that the project so far advanced and with all steps taken to assure its completion, should be delayed at this stage by not having made available to it the money to complete it.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\nHAY RIVER, N.W.T.\nNovember 1, 1948.\n\nPROGRESS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD OCTOBER 12th TO OCTOBER 30th\n\nOn the school -\n\nGlass brick windows and chimney in the school were put in during this period. The heating installation is now completed and the electrical work is roughed in. Work has been going ahead rapidly on the two upstairs classrooms. These two rooms now have the insulation and gyproc on and the carpenters have started laying the floor. Painting is going ahead on the school and within a day or two the outside primer coat should be on.\n\nOn the residence -\n\nThe outside stairs are ready except for the railing.

I am also requesting a copy of the Policy.\n\nIt was in order for Mr. Mattson, as a Contractor, to do this, as he had no protection otherwise from claims of his workmen in case of injuries. The rate charged is 3\u00bd%, and the payroll is currently running around $5,000 each fortnight. Thus per month, the premium will be in the vicinity of $225.00.\n\nThis Contract is being carried out under an arrangement at present which practically amounts to the Department doing the work on a day labour basis, with Mr. Mattson providing the supervision. In other words, the Department does all purchasing and pays such accounts, and also pays the payrolls, similar to a day labour project.\n\nIt might be possible to eliminate this charge to Whalen Insurance if the project were to be continued for any length of time, but I anticipate it will be concluded about the end of this calendar year and it might not be worthwhile making a change.\n\nI would, however, like to know that this Department pays to the Province of Alberta for Workmen's Compensation and benefits on its day labour projects. I would then have a comparison of costs of the two forms of Insurance.\n\nW.J.

As Mr. Johnston points out that the work should be completed here about the end of the calendar year, it is presumably not worth while making any change in these insurance arrangements.

We tried to get the Employees' Compensation Division, Department of Transport, to accept responsibility for the Hay River Workmen under the Employees' Compensation Act, but were unsuccessful, in spite of the fact that Mattson's men were paid by Government cheque.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n.............2\nWe could hardly permit the employment of men without protection of any sort, and we therefore had to approve Mr. Mattson's action in taking out Workmen's Compensation Insurance.\n\nMr. Johnston refers to Public Liability Insurance in his letter of November 12th to Mr. Blais. The only Insurance paid for in this Branch was Workmen's Compensation. In fact, Mr. B.G. McIntyre, Comptroller of the Treasury, wrote Mr. E.A. Sawyer on March 24th that in his opinion it would not be proper to pay for Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance on the Hay River Project. Mr. McIntyre has since made it clear that his letter to Mr. Sawyer dated March 24th, does not refer to Workmen's Compensation Insurance.\n\nWe passed to Treasury all invoices rendered by the Whalen Insurance Company on account of Workmen's Compensation Insurance to May 31, 1948, and Treasury paid the accounts.\n\nWe have no definite information on the rate of insurance paid to the Province of Alberta by the Department of Transport for workmen employed by the Dominion Government. We do know that the Whalen Insurance Company's rate is below the rate charged by the Alberta Workmen's Compensation Board in all ordinary cases. In any event, the Employees' Compensation Division of the Department of Transport, has refused to insure Mr. Mattson's workmen under the provisions of the act, as noted in the fourth paragraph of this memorandum.\n\nDirector.\nDecember 30, 1948.\n\nMr. L.C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 178. From the wording on the voucher it appears that the charge was incurred in connection with freighting materials required for the erection of the Hay River School. If so, the account should be forwarded to the District Engineer of the Public Works Department under whose direction this school is being constructed.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch provided the funds for the cost of the school but all of these have been transferred to the Public Works Department and consequently this account and any others of a similar nature should be forwarded to the District Engineer, Public Works Department, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nBernard F.

There will be charges for transportation and also for sending an electrician to Hay River especially to install this generator.\n\nThe delivery of this generator is very urgent and I am asking authority to purchase. I have, however, pointed out that there are no funds available for it.\n\nA statement of outstanding funds required as at this date, is as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Accounts Outstanding (which includes account for gravel purchase) | $7,000 |\n| Purchase and installation of Generator            | $5,000 |\n| Additional required for contingencies             | $3,000 |\n| **Total**                                         | **$15,000** |\n\nThe costs of this school have mounted beyond what one might normally expect. It is being operated on a cost plus Contract and has all the disagreeable features of such an arrangement.

The final amount is for additional funds required at Hay River above those already transferred to the Department of Public Works and in addition to the $34,000.00 required by your Branch.\n\nAs soon as Treasury Board approval has been obtained for the transfer of the sum required by your Branch for the payment of these accounts, we will set up the necessary R. R.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. B. Douglas of your Branch arranged for the ordering of most of these supplies. Therefore the accounts are being returned for your necessary action when the funds are transferred.\n\nEncl.\n\nBFN/EM\n\nDirector.\nMr. H. F.

It is noted that the following schools will not be completed during the current fiscal year:\n\nHay River; Roche River; Fort Norman;\nFort Franklin; Fort Good Hope and\nArctic Red River.\n\nAs we will soon be preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1949-50, I would appreciate it if you could let me have an estimate of the amount that will be required to complete each of the above buildings so that funds may be provided in the appropriation for the next fiscal year.\n\nThe Copper Mine School is not under the jurisdiction of this Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Mr. Johnston, District Engineer dated October 13th on an Inspection of the Hay River Day School.\n\nRE: HAY RIVER:\n\nWork on this project has not progressed at the rapid rate owing to the difficulty in obtaining sub-tradesmen as required. This refers to plumbers, heaters, electricians and sheet metal workers for hot-air furnace and duct installation. This has resulted in having to keep the carpenter crew at a smaller force than would otherwise be the case. However, all these tradesmen have either recently been at that point, or are engaged there now, so that it will be possible shortly to add more carpenters to the labour force. An estimate was given by Mr. Mattson on September 22nd, that with the crew then engaged, the project could be finished in January. However, as soon as it is practicable to do so, I am adding as many carpenters as appears reasonable for the size of the job, so as to be assured of completion during the present calendar year.\n\nShipping instructions as follows:\n\nTo reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Northern Transportation Company.\nOttawa, December 17, 1948.\n\nMr. E.A. Sawyer,\nAsst. Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 15th I wish to advise you that this office has no outstanding accounts in connection with the Hay River Indian School.\n\nThe money for this project was all encumbered to your office and to Lands and Development Services, and therefore we do not expect to pay any accounts here.\n\nW. Lauchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nJHF/G\nTreasury Office\nDepartment of Public Works, Canada\n\nOttawa, December 15, 1948.\n\nW. Lauchlan, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you be good enough to advise the amount of unpaid accounts your branch of the Department is holding in connection with the Hay River Indian School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would also advise of any other commitments in connection with this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.A. Sawyer,\nAssistant Treasury Officer.\n\nEAS:MP\nMr. R. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nAdministration of the Northwest Territories,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: School Situation - Hay River\n\nI beg to advise you that I left Fort Smith on the afternoon of the 17th and proceeded to Yellowknife, leaving Yellowknife at 8:00 am., on the morning of the 18th for Hay River. Remained at Hay River until 3:00 p.m., on the 19th, and returned to Fort Smith from Yellowknife on the 20th instant.\n\nOn arriving at Hay River I met Col. Newcomen, Engineer of the Department of Public Works, who was sent to Hay River in December by W.J. Johnston to supervise the contractor in the construction of the school. I might say that I was very surprised at the advance in construction made on the school building since my last visit to Hay River on November 18th. There remains considerable work to be done, particularly on the ground floor. The 2 classrooms on the upper floor have been completed and painted, and there remains only a small amount of varnishing, the sanding of the floors and laying of the 1/4 round. On the ground floor there is a considerable amount of interior finishing to be done, and all of the painting.\n\nI was informed that there is still a shortage of material, which Col. Newcomen had listed and which had not arrived, including the accordion doors which separate the two lower classrooms.\n\nThere is no doubt but that the contractor has been badly handicapped by the lack of electric power, and, as a consequence, adequate heating and lighting. No generator has, as yet, been secured, and I took immediate steps to see what could be done. I sent a wireless message to Mr. McNiven to see if one could be found in Yellowknife, but on my arrival there on the 19th was informed there was no generator of a size which would be suitable, they were either too small or too large, and the expense of shipping one of the larger machines over would be prohibitive.\n\nThe small generator moved to Fort Smith by Mr. Oldham from Trout Lake is exactly right for this job. This generator was loaned\nthe R.C.M.P., until our new installation here was completed. I requested the return of it in November but was informed by the N.C.O. in charge that the generator was under seizure as stolen equipment and could not be released.\n\nWhile in Yellowknife, I contacted Mr. Hunter, Department of Transport, from Edmonton, and he informed me his department were quite willing to turn this generator over to the Department of Mines and Resources and had no objection whatever to the generator being sent to Hay River. I understand all equipment at Trout Lake was taken over from the U.S. Army by the Department of Transport, therefore, I can see no reason why the R.C.M.P. could not release this generator. We could send it to Hay River in our plane, as I will be returning there in a few days.\n\nNow to deal specifically with the complaints made by the Board of Trade.\n\nIt seems that no one has visited Hay River in connection with school matters since March of last year, and, consequently, those responsible have not a clear picture of the requirements of the settlement. There are at present 86 children of school age, and school desks for 40 pupils only have arrived. The principal also informs me that no school books, chalk or other required supplies are on hand \u2014 he has no idea whatever if they have been ordered or when they will be received. Immediate steps should therefore be taken to order, and have shipped, an additional 60 desks, together with all the required text books, etc.\n\nAs there will be a large number of native children attending the school, the citizens are concerned that no x-rays have been taken in Hay River. Many of them state that they will not send their children to school to be confined in a closed space with other children who may have active tuberculosis. I think their stand has some justification. Would it be possible for the Charles Gonnell Hospital to send in a portable x-ray unit with the required medical and technical personnel to carry out x-rays of the Hay River population?\n\nAdequate provision does not appear to have been made for sanitation in the school, although there are washrooms, both upstairs and downstairs the only toilets are outside ones; no pits have been dug nor have any receptacles been provided. Would it not be possible to place sanitary closets in the school, which could be attended to at regular and necessary intervals by the janitor? This would be a much more satisfactory arrangement for the winter months, and the outdoor toilets would be quite satisfactory during the summer months.\nThe principal, who appears to be a competent teacher, states that he will not be able to adequately attend 86 pupils, and that it will be necessary to have 1 more, and preferably 2 more teachers. I understand that about 50 of the 86 pupils will be in the primary grade, and the other 36 pupils will be from grades 4 to 10. The principal is obtaining this detailed information, which will be forwarded to his department within a short time. It does seem, however, that there should be 2 primary teachers for this year.\n\nWe estimated the population of Hay River in August to be between 400 and 500. I am informed by the Fisheries Inspector there have been 515 individual fishing licences issued for the vicinity of Hay River, which does not include Yellowknife. Of these, it is estimated that over 400 are newcomers. With the increased quota allotted by the Fisheries Department, the fishing industry will no longer be seasonal; and I think it is safe to assume that many of these fishermen will bring their families to settle in Hay River this summer. The Board of Trade think that the number of pupils who will be attending school at the commencement of the fall terms this year will be increased to about 120, and I think this figure is not an over-estimate. Arrangements should be made accordingly.\n\nWhen the principal arrived in Hay River, no accommodation being immediately available, he lived with the R.C. priest, and some of the parents complained about this. It looked as though there might be a few narrow-minded people who would object to their children being taught by a teacher of the R.C. faith. We had a discussion on this point, and I pointed out that teachers were not selected on the basis of their religious denomination, and that at Yellowknife and Fort Smith no such question had ever arisen. Religious instruction is not a part of the curriculum. The complaint was settled very amicably indeed, and I sincerely hope we will hear nothing along this line again.\n\nThe Board of Trade complained that the Medical Health Officer at Fort Resolution does not visit Hay River at frequent intervals. In their opinion, the school inspector should be at Hay River when the school opens in order to assist in the organization of classes and meet with the Board of Trade from time to time.\n\nWhen the meeting with the Board of Trade concluded, they expressed their thanks and appreciation of my visit and of the\nI had been able to give them, and I assured them that their representations would be presented to the proper officials and that they would receive immediate and earnest consideration.\n\n(sgd) Fred Fraser\n\nFred Fraser,\nDistrict Administrator.\nOttawa, February 5, 1949.\n\nMr. N.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Day School - Upper Hay River.\n\nIn reference to your letter, File 131-18-1 (E) re buildings at Upper Hay River.\n\nI have just returned from Hay River, and wish to advise that the buildings referred to, were torn down over a year ago, by the Yellowknife Transportation Co. The floors belonging to building are still almost intact, and could be used, but most of the material has disappeared, and all the 5 Ply Veneer ruined, as it was all left exposed to the weather.\n\nThere is a seizure notice on what is left by the Provincial Lands & Mines, so they apparently are going to use what is left. My valuation of the lumber etc. that could still be used is $300.00, that is for the foundations and floors left out of the three buildings, besides rafters and sections still left.\n\nI would suggest that this material be taken over as very soon it will all disappear. A school at Hay River is needed, also at Hay Lake and Little Red River, and think education is the only solution for the disgraceful conditions existing today. You will find the Indians will co-operate when it comes to building, and a start should be made at once. Schools in this part of the country need not be expensive or elaborate, and children even if only counting marbles, ought to be in school. Health education alone would do more to help stamp out T.B. than the Camsell Hospital is doing today.\n\nI have resigned my position here, but will be always interested in Indians and their education, and I trust there will be no time wasted in getting something started.\n\nNeil Walker,\nC.C.

There are two men available: Frank Obermiller (holder of a \"Class A Electrician\" certificate from Victoria, B.C.), and Urie Lehoux having had some experience with motors and being mechanically inclined. Mr. Obermiller expects a monthly salary of $50.00, plus $5.00 for board allowance, plus a free room in the school, plus a small electric stove. Mr. Lehoux would be satisfied with $50.00 net.\n\nThe duties to be performed would be the following: 1. Sweeping and scrubbing of\nthe floor in the school building. - 2. Care of Power Plant and two oil furnaces. - 3. Taking off the storm windows, and installing screens.\n\nThe supplying of water and emptying of toilet receptacles would have to be handled by other men, as these two prospective janitors do not have a truck or horses.\n\nTwo water tanks (barrel type) of about 50-gal capacity would do; sorry I have no Eaton's catalogue.\n\nNo blackboard brushes have been included in shipment of school supplies received about two weeks ago. I would appreciate at least six of them.\n\nI'm afraid I'll need ten window shades 7ft long x 4ft wide for the two classrooms having southern exposure. Right now the sun is dazzling in these rooms, and I'm sure the pupils couldn't stand it without injury to their eyesight.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHerbert Bellavance\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPlease furnish the following Supplies for use of Hay River Indian Day School\n\n| Vote | Primary | Object | Date Required | Immediately |\n|------|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|\n|      |         |        |               |             |\n\nShip to Mr. Herbert Bellavance, Teacher, Hay River Indian Day School\n\nMail Invoices to L.C.

Neary\n\nAttached for your information is copy of letter, dated March 3rd, from District Engineer W. J. Johnston concerning the closing out of the contract for construction of the four-classroom day school and teacherage at Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nYou will note Mr. Johnston recommends the closing out of this contract, in which recommendation I concur. Could I have your approval of this action, please.\n\nR. Blais,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncls.\nMr. P. Mattson, Contractor on construction of 4-Classroom Day School and Teacherage at Hay River, N.W.T., has been in Edmonton during the past several days and has discussed with me the possibility of terminating his Contract. Attached hereto is copy of letter from Mr. Mattson in this connection.\n\nI have previously advised you by letter No. 4716 on February 16th that this Project was likely to close down soon and the actual stoppage of operations was on the evening of February 21st. There was every reason for closing down work as it would have been continued at an excessive cost.\n\nAttached hereto is a memorandum from T. Newcomen, who was Engineer in charge of this Project during its latter stages. This memorandum sets forth the work remaining to be done under the Contract. It will be noted that some of the work could more economically be done during the warm weather of the summer, and in fact the exterior painting should be deferred until this time.\n\nSchool sessions are now being held in an upstairs room in the school. However, with the likelihood of more pupils entering school shortly, I believe it is intended that two classes be operated with one teacher in charge. At that time the two classes will be held in the two rooms downstairs, and for this reason the accordion doors will be left open so that one teacher can supervise both school classes.\n\nThis school Project is still considered under construction and when recently in Ottawa I discussed the matter with Mr. B. Neary, Education Branch, Department of Mines and Resources. I explained to Mr. Neary that I considered the Department of Public Works should retain control of the building until all construction activities were finished and hand over the building as a completed structure. This means that the Department of Public Works is continuing to pay such expenses as lighting, heating, janitor service, and so forth. Such charges may conceivably continue for possibly three months, until all details of construction have been completed. Mr. Neary was agreeable to this proposal.\n\nIn the attached letter from Mr. Mattson he wishes termination of his Contract as at close of work on February 21st. He would thus have no interest in, and receive no profit from, any labour which might subsequently be performed. In regard to purchase of materials, this falls into two classes \u2014 (a) \u2014 materials which had just arrived on cessation of work and on which no labour charges had been incurred to place in the structure. (Statement A.) \u2014 (b) \u2014 materials on order but which through scarcity of materials or other causes, have not yet been received. (Statement B). The total for purchase and delivery charges on these two items under (a) and (b) might amount to around $4500.00. Under the agreement made by Mr. Mattson he agrees to receive no commission on the purchase of such materials. It is considered this arrangement is in the public interest and the best which can be made under the circumstances. I recommend the acceptance of this offer of the termination of the Contract on the terms above outlined.\nIf this proposal is accepted Mr. Mattson will have to supply a statement accompanied by a Statutory Declaration guaranteeing the Department from any defective workmanship, materials, and so forth, for a period of a year. I would like to receive copies of such a form to be completed, if such a statement has been prepared; otherwise if you have any instructions in this matter for me to pass on to Mattson I would be glad to receive same.\n\nA spare copy of this letter is attached for attention of Education Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\nMr. W.J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\n9357 - 103 Street,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to a Contract entered into with me by the Department of Mines and Resources for the construction of a 4-classroom Day School and Teacherage at Hay River, N.W.T., I am writing this letter to you as you are now in charge of the completion of this School Project. As you know, this work was begun under the direction of the Department of Mines and Resources Surveys and Engineering Branch, who retained control of the Project until May 31, 1948, and since June 1st, 1948 it has been under the control of the Department of Public Works, Canada. My Contract in this connection was prepared on March 10, 1948 and the final papers therewith were signed on March 30, 1948 at Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nThe School Project has reached such a stage of completion that I do not feel I should continue as Contractor. All materials which had been received have been placed in the structure and it was considered advisable to close down the work on the evening of February 21st. It would have been expensive and unnecessary to retain carpenters and workmen and keep a cookhouse open after that date, as there were insufficient materials of all kinds on hand for the workmen to proceed.\n\nAnother factor which would make it advisable to terminate my contract now, would be the fact that some work should more properly be delayed to the summer season during warmer weather. This refers particularly to outside painting and other small cleaning up work.\n\nUnder the terms of my Contract I am not permitted to engage in other activities until the termination of this Project, and under these circumstances I am held bound to the job and unable to take other work. This will prove a hardship and hardly appears warranted with the relatively small amount of work remaining to be done.\n\nI am agreeable to terminate my Contract as of the evening of February 21st and to waive all interest in materials which may still be required under the Contract and have not been supplied or delivered. Furthermore, I waive all interest in outstanding accounts in connection with the purchase and delivery of the generator and other items.\n\nThese other items (including delivery charges thrown to Hay River) would include -- (a) -- materials just recently received and not placed in the work and shown in Statement \"A\" attached; (b) miscellaneous items on order and which, through shortage of materials, have been slow in arriving (See Statement \"B\" attached). Both Statements are necessarily of a general nature, as I have not complete particulars at hand of all small orders, but outside of the broad statement of fact, the details are not too important.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, File 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYour field representative can supply you with a statement of the stage of construction reached as of February 21st and the various items of incompleted work now remaining. This incompleted work was in part due, no doubt, to the difficulty of obtaining materials of various descriptions necessary to complete the Project.\n\nTerms of Closing out Project:\n\nIf my request for the cancellation of the Contract that work close down as of February 21st is approved, I would like prompt word that my request is approved so that I may make plans for other work. It is distinctly understood, however, - as I understand the situation - that the approval for cancellation of this Project must come from the Head Office of the Department of Mines and Resources at Ottawa, and I will not expect any expenses for living costs or board after my return to Hay River on March 4th (which is the date of my expected return to Hay River).\n\nIn reference to Section 3 - Cost Plus Percentage - Item (d), paragraph 2, of the Contract, I am prepared, if the Contract is terminated on the terms outlined above, to furnish a statement accompanied by Statutory Declaration. This would be to the effect that should any faults due to inferior workmanship, materials or equipment appear in the work within one year from the date of acceptance by the Minister of Department of Mines and Resources of termination of the Contract, that such faults or deficiencies would be made good. In other words, the Statement and Statutory Declaration would be furnished for the Contract being terminated now, just as would be required had I completed the entire Project under the Contract.\n\nRequest for Funds:\n\nMay I ask that prompt decision be reached in the termination of this Contract, and I would also request, if possible, that a progress payment in the amount of approximately $8000.00 be released to me as a further advance against my percentage of profit in connection with the Contract. The $8000.00 immediately requested, is that I may make plans to engage in other activities very shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWitnessed at Edmonton\n\nthis 8th day of\n\nMarch, 1949.\n\n[T.

The oil burner selected for the job is a pressure gun type and has been arranged for fully automatic operation in accordance with regulations covering this type of system.\n\nThe control consists of a room thermostat which operates an oil burner and runs the fan between normal furnace bonnet temperatures of 120\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 F. A protector relay is arranged to stop the burner on ignition failure or excessive bonnet temperatures. The high limit for the bonnet temperatures has been set at 160\u00b0 F. In addition a switch box and panel are provided.\n\nIt is felt that a reasonably intelligent man familiar with normal care and maintenance duties, would be suitable for the post. His duties in connection with the heating system, would involve periodic inspection and cleaning of the burner in accordance with the attached sheet of instructions regarding \"Care and Maintenance of Oil Burning Equipment and Furnaces\".\n\nIn connection with the electrical power supply, we outlined the situation in our memorandum to you dated June 29, 1948, and our recommendation to provide a temporary source of power until a local supply is available, was concurred in by the director of the Indian Affairs Branch by his memorandum dated August 3, 1948. The Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department was advised accordingly in our memorandum to him dated August 12, 1948.\n\nSince the Public Works Department took over control of this project as of June 1, 1948, this Division has been out of direct contact with the job, and no information appears on our file in connection with electric power developments subsequent to the above mentioned memoranda. We have however learned through Northwest Territories files, that the Public Works Department has placed an order for a generating unit, about which we have no details, and that they have shipped a unit from Fort Smith on a temporary basis until delivery of the other set can be made. Whether or not the Public Works Department intends using the generating set on order as a permanent source of power supply for the school and principal's residence, is something we can not advise on, and we suggest that Indian Affairs contact that Department for further information in connection with the electrical supply situation.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe duties of the caretaker in connection with the electrical system will involve normal replacement of lighting luminaires and the care and maintenance of the lighting plant that is on order by the Public Works Department. It will be necessary that the caretaker familiarize himself with the operation and maintenance of this type of equipment. Booklets are usually made available by the manufacturer of lighting plants showing complete details of the unit and methods of operation and care of same. It is assumed that the District Engineer for the Public Works Department at Edmonton requested, at the time of placing the order, that this information be forwarded with the light plant.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nWe have asked the Northwest Territories Power Commission to consider whether that body could not supply all the electrical power that would be needed by government institutions at Hay River. Mr. Kosmar of the Engineering and Construction Service has prepared a memorandum for the consideration of the Northwest Territories Council on the 24th instant.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 22, 1949.\n\nRe: Care and Maintenance of Oil Burning Equipment and Furnaces.\n\nThe two main reasons resulting in service calls in connection with pressure gun type oil burners, are ignition failure and nozzle blockage.\n\nIgnition spark is produced by a current sparking between two points called electrodes. After a time, these points become covered with carbon deposits and instead of a spark, arcs may be formed. When this happens, oil is not ignited and the combustion chamber of the furnace or boiler becomes saturated with oil. Consequently if an intermittent spark is produced, an explosion which can result in a fire, takes place.\n\nTo avoid this, the caretaker after having been instructed by a competent electrician, should reach in with a soft cloth and rub the carbon deposits off the points. This should be done perhaps once a month to make sure that the points are always clean. No adjustments of the spark gap should be made.\n\nIt would be advisable to have as a standby, an extra set of nozzles of the same type as supplied with the burner. Occasionally the orifice opening in the nozzle will become partially or totally plugged. Under these circumstances the nozzle should be removed and the standby nozzles installed. This operation should not take more than about 45 minutes.\n\nThe dirty nozzle can then be immersed in a 1/2 pint jar of tetra-chloride and thoroughly cleaned and set aside for replacement purposes. Under no circumstances should the orifice opening be enlarged, as it is carefully sized by the manufacturer to permit the exact amount of oil to be admitted to the combustion chamber in consideration of the burning rate required.\n\nFilters at the oil tank and filters at the burner, should be removed and cleaned when the nozzles are replaced.\n\nMechanical failures apart from the above, should receive the attention of a skilled serviceman.\n\nWe see no reason why the caretaker should not be able to carry out the above normal service operations.\nOttawa, March 10, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Hay River Indian School Buildings - Peter Mattson's Board.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Division did not charge Peter Mattson board during March, April and May due to the fact that Mr. Mattson operated the cook house at a personal loss up to February 28th. He purchased supplies locally at the Hudson's Bay Company, and the cost would run over $1.25 per meal. The employees paid fifty cents per meal and the Department paid fifty cents, which means that Mattson took a loss of at least twenty five cents a meal. The Department took over the operation of the cook house on March 1st, reimbursing Mattson for his inventory of supplies on hand.\n\nIn our opinion, the free board supplied Mattson during March, April and May would come close to offsetting his losses during the period when he operated the cook house.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nR. Blais, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nI have today sent you the following message \u2014\n\n\"SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION HAY RIVER EXPECTED TO CLOSE DOWN END OF WEEK STOP TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDITIONAL REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PAY ACCOUNTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT WHICH INCLUDES BALANCE OF MATSON'S FEE PAYABLE BY THIS DEPARTMENT STOP AM WRITING.\"\n\nA situation has been reached in the school construction at Hay River, N.W.T., that practically all materials on hand have been used up in the construction. There are some outstanding items of materials on order, principally hardware fittings and odd size doors, which have been slow arriving. This has resulted in it being impossible to complete all carpenter work. Likewise the generator on order has not yet been received. In view of these circumstances, Mr. Matson has asked that his Contract be terminated and the balance of items not installed would not be considered as part of his Contract.\n\nIf the Contract be not terminated there would arise the question of holding a cookhouse open and the possibility of not having sufficient work for any workmen who might be retained as the final small materials were received. In balancing both sides of this question it appears more desirable to terminate the Contract rather than insist that Mr. Matson remain on the job and place all final fixtures within the buildings. Mr. Matson is to come to Edmonton on February 22nd, when this matter will be discussed and some agreement reached. All indications point, however, to the advisability of terminating the Contract at this time.\n\nA statement of bills outstanding, all paylists, and also an estimate of the labour charges until the work is closed down, would indicate that $20,000 additional is required for this school construction project. This includes the proportion of Mr. Matson's 10% profit on the total cost of the work as done by this Department, with deductions made for advances granted him on account of this Cost Plus Contract.\n\nNo item has been provided for Mr. Matson's 10% profit while the work was being done by the Department of Mines and Resources, as it is my understanding that that Department will not only pay outstanding charges but also the proportion of profit to which Mr. Matson would be entitled, up to and including May 31, 1948.\n\nAn estimate of the total cost for this Project would appear to be as follows:\n\nSEE OVER PAGE -\nPAYMENT BY DEPARTMENT MINES AND RESOURCES:\n\nNet Payments $66,968.61\nOutstanding Accounts 26,798.87\nBalance of 10% profit to P. Mattson 3,777.14\n\nTotal -- $97,544.62\n\nPAYMENT BY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC WORKS:\n\nPayments to date (approx.) $68,000\nAdditional amount requested 20,000\n\nTotal -- $88,000.00\n\nCost of Project (approximately) ........................................... $168,544.62\n\nThere will be under 'Day Labour' a charge of a couple of carpenters and one or two painters for a period of a week or ten days but it is considered these charges can be included within the $20,000 now asked for.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER\n\nMAR 14 1949\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: Colonel B. Neary\n\nI am enclosing copy of letter No. 4716, dated February 16th, from District Engineer W. J. Johnston in which he points out that he requires an additional $20,000. for the Hay River school. Today a telegram was received from the District Engineer stating that this $20,000. is required to pay liabilities to the close of the present fiscal year and that an estimated amount of $7,500. will be required for the work in the next fiscal year.\n\nThese figures do not include Mr. Mattson's profit while working for the Department of Mines and Resources nor for any commitments of the Mines and Resources Department.\n\nAs the pay lists for February are being held and the men are naturally anxious to receive their pay, it would be appreciated if the funds could be released as quickly as possible.\n\nR. Blais,\nChief Engineer.\n22 March, 1949.\n\nHay River Indian Day School.\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 17th, copy of which has been sent to District Engineer W. J. Johnston for his information and guidance. For your information, I am enclosing herewith copy of letter dated March 18th received from Mr. Johnston, to which is attached report from Mr. T. Newcomen giving a summary of the operations on the school at Hay River for the two months' period concluding February 21st.\n\nR. Blais\nChief Engineer.\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a report from Mr. T. Newcomen giving a summary of operations on the school at Hay River, N.W.T., for a two month period, approximately, concluding with February 21st, 1949.\n\nI visited Hay River on the 8th instant. The school was then in session under Mr. Bellavence, Schoolmaster. As the weather had moderated, the classes were being held in the classrooms on the first storey. I inspected the buildings and grounds accompanied by the Caretaker-Watchman. Arrangements were made with Mr. Bellavence to obtain what additional wood fuel was required before spring thaw conditions made delivery impossible. It is necessary to lay in a supply of wood until such time as the generator is installed and conversion is made to oil heating.\n\nIt appears undesirable to reopen work on this Project until the early summer by which time it is expected all materials will be on hand. Furthermore, this Department will have a carpenter crew at Hay River in connection with the erection of other buildings and part of this force can be released for whatever work remains to be done on the school. Thus, as the school is still considered as being under construction, accounts for the watchman service, and any necessary accounts for heating or the maintenance of the building, will be paid through this office.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\n\nWJ-akd.\nEnc.\nI hereewith beg to submit my report for the two months that I was supervising the Indian Day School project at Hay River.\n\nI arrived at Hay River on December 24th. On going over the work the following morning, I found that a considerable amount of delay had been caused by two very important factors; first, the lack of a generating plant made it very hard for the men, especially the wood-finishing carpenters, to work through lack of light and also the extreme cold. They were obliged to use night lanterns for two hours in the morning and an hour and a half in the evening. Temporary heating arrangements were carried out by burning logs in the school furnace and also in a house stove in the teacher's residence. These arrangements, however, were not satisfactory as only the top half of the two buildings could be heated, causing considerable difficulty in carrying out painting work. The other main cause of delay was through the lack of material arriving. In some cases I understand that the shortages had been reported but evidently never ordered; such as seven doors which had not arrived when I left; and in other cases the orders were not able to be filled owing to the lack of materials in the lumber mills.\n\nUpon my arrival, there were employed the following men:\n\n9 carpenters, one of whom was used as a pipe fitter;\n2 painters;\n3 labourers, as well as the usual monthly paid camp staff of four (a women cook, women cookess, watchman and bull cook). As the work progressed and material was used up, this staff was gradually reduced until, on the 5th of February, we retained only three carpenters, two painters and one labourer. At this period I could see that all the material on hand, and which had subsequently arrived after I got there, would be used up and thereby no more work could be done. Furthermore, due to the non-arrival of a generating plant, the sanding and floor finishing could not be done, and the balance of the painting would have to wait also until warmer weather; and, also because of the request of the contractor who wished to have his contract cancelled, I considered it advisable to communicate with you and recommend that we should close down the work until a later period when it could be resumed again after the arrival of the generator. Upon receiving your approval of this, I closed down the work on the evening of February 21st, leaving a watchman-caretaker (Frank Obermuller) at an authorized salary of $150.00 plus $75.00 to defray his board bill.\n\nDue to the fact, as advised by you, that these buildings were still considered under construction status, I assumed that we were still responsible for the heating end, therefore, I made arrangements to have logs(cut) supplied and delivered to the premises, when the school principal who was in residence by this time, considered it necessary to ask for the same. Upon closing down the work, I collected all construction\n\n(OVER)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nmaterial, including spare lumber that was lying in the snow and placed it in the dry shed, which is locked. All camp equipment, such as beds, lanterns, mattresses, etc., were locked up in the bunkhouse. All cooking utensils I had locked up in the cookhouse. As regards this latter building, I might add that there is a certain quantity of kitchen ware belonging to the contractor. This I left untouched, but all kitchen equipment belonging to the Department I had crated up and placed in the adjoining storeroom. There is a summer bathhouse also on the property which I have had locked up. It only contains a round barrel stove for heating the water. All keys were left with the school principal, Mr. Bellavance.\n\nA certain amount of food supplies was still left, and I turned this over to the care of the school principal. I have already turned in, for your information, a detail of work still necessary on this project; also a list of kitchen equipment belonging to the contractor. I am now attaching four further lists showing what is in the dry shed, also list of the food supplies left in the bunkhouse, and the small amount of kitchen property belonging to the Department which is in the shed attached to the cookhouse. During the period I was there, the health of the men on the whole was good, and there was only one occasion of a minor accident.\n\nAs far as the school being used for teaching purposes was concerned, a small class was started by the principal the second week in February. One of the downstairs rooms being used. The number of pupils could have been very easily increased and extra grades handled but, due to the extreme cold of the downstairs rooms, this was found to be impossible, and until the warm weather sets in, or a generating plant arrives, the school cannot possibly be used to anything like its full capacity.\n\nT.

The total cost, amounting to $1,332.30, includes items of freight and express, although some portion of transportation costs from Edmonton to Hay River are not included due to the fact that we were not in a position to segregate freight costs accurately in this office. The kitchen equipment includes many items such as crockery, etc., which are normally written off or charged to operating expenses. The pile driver consists of timber, machine shop charges and steel. It was constructed especially for the job and its commercial value for anything but a similar job would be negligible. Mr. Mattson's offer of $1,352.02 for the $1,332.32 list of equipment is considered fair and reasonable.\n\nBy the terms of a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, a contractor is either permitted or expected to make an offer for surplus materials and equipment but in Peter Mattson's case there have been doubts in some quarters as to whether he can be considered as this kind of contractor. It was assumed that he is a contractor in connection with Workmen's Compensation Insurance, whereas the Comptroller of the Treasury assumed that Peter Mattson was no more than a foreman for the purpose of insurance on the buildings and materials.\n\nIt is essential that a settlement be reached with Peter Mattson during the current fiscal year. We telephoned Col. Craig and Col. Neary, outlining the offer made by Mattson and both considered it a fair offer.\n\nWe are referring this matter to you for a decision in view of the special circumstances and in view of the factor that there is involved the disposal by sale of Government property.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe would, therefore, request a decision as to whether Mr. Mattson's offer may be accepted or if not, instructions as to the disposal of the equipment in question which is now at Hay River.\n\nIt is possible that there may be a further item of a boiler for which the Department will be paying for in the amount of $612.00, for which the decision made for the foregoing material will be used as a precedent for disposing of this latter item.\n\n(Sgd) T.

Your cost, as per inventory, will be set down and my offer will be made on each part.\n\n| Type                  | Cost   | Offer  |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Kitchen Equipment     | $489.55|        |\n| Less 40% due to loss and depreciation which is necessarily high in these small items | $125.32| $293.73|\n| Construction Equipment| $1024.50|        |\n| Less 20% depreciation | $204.30| $819.60|\n\nFile Driver\nLess 25% as mostly timber construction which will have to be rebuilt for further use\n\n| Type                  | Cost   | Offer  |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| File Driver           | $79.56 | $238.69|\n| Total Offer           | $1352.02|\n\nAlso, in connection with the Steam Boiler, as soon as your negotiations have been completed with Reliance Welding I am willing to make an offer. Please advise me as soon as an offer is acceptable.\n\nMail service to Hay River is slow and indefinite and I would appreciate an answer to the above proposition by radio-telegraph. This will also give your office a chance to clear this item before the end of your fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPeter Mattson.\nDEAR SIR: RE YOUR WIRE DATED MARCH 26TH. 1949.

His letter reads as follows:-\n\n\"There are three buildings on school grounds in temporary use by contractor, one building used as kitchen and dining room, one building used as a bunk room and one shed.\n\nWould you kindly inform me if these buildings are for sale and the purchase price as I understand they are not in use at the present time.\"\n\nWould you please refer this matter to Mr. District Engineer Johnston as it is presumed he will be disposing of these buildings in the usual way.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nBTH/AM\nOttawa, 8 July, 1949.\n\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nYour letter of June 21st containing requests from Mr. C.

Strang of Hay River, N.W.T. Mr. Strang was enquiring regarding three temporary buildings on the school grounds at Hay River, N.W.T., and used by the Contractor during the construction project there.\n\nThese buildings are currently in use holding building materials remaining on hand in connection with the school project and are also being occupied by our workmen who are completing carpenter work and other installations on the school project. The buildings should not be declared surplus for some considerable time and Mr. Strang notified accordingly.\n\nThe Dominion Government is this year embarking on other construction projects at Hay River, and buildings similar to the ones above mentioned would have to be provided if the ones now existing were not made use of. Under the circumstances I consider it would be unwise to release custody of these for some considerable time.\n\nN.J.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nA few days ago, I discussed with Indian Agent Kirkby, such matters as furniture and kitchen utensils, temporary methods of attending to local water supply, fuel, janitor supplies, flag, and so forth, for both the Hay River and Roche River Indian Day Schools. Following this discussion, I understand Indian Agent Kirkby submitted requisitions, your file 139-6-1, on or about August 29th, covering the above items. Therefore, I am leaving this matter to his attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\n\nCopy to:\nR.A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nExtract from requisition dated August 20th for supplies for the Hay River Indian Day School.\n\nThe teacher requests:\n\n20 Chair desks, medium\n20 \" large\n2 Teacher's desks\n6 \" Chairs\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find Requisition covering janitor supplies for the Hay River Day school. I cannot find any correspondence on this subject and presume that none of these supplies have been ordered. Please have these shipped by truck via Peace River at an early date. In the mean time we will purchase such items as are a necessity at the local store. It is regretted that no unit price has been quoted but I have no invoice or catalogue from which such prices can be obtained.\n\nNo flag is available for the opening of school and it is felt this item should be sent by parcel post being very light to ship. I believe that the flag used in the Northwest Territories is to be the new Canadian Flag.\n\nIt has been found that the cook stove supplied to the Hay River residence is a wood burning type. When the building was put up and fuel oil lines were put in, a supply line was run from the tank to the position of the kitchen stove. May I suggest that we purchase a oil burning unit to install on the back of the present cook stove. A requisition is enclosed giving the specifications of such a burner. This type bolts to rear of stove and can be installed in a matter of an hour or so without making any modifications to the present stove.\n\nIf it is decided that wood should be used in the cook stove I request authority to have ten cord of cook stove wood cut and piled in the yard ready for immediate use. At present the teacher is burning scraps from around the buildings and as soon as they are gone either wood or the oil burner must be obtained.\n\nNo supplies are on hand for the making of hot noon lunches for the children who come from the opposite side of the river and I have enclosed a Requisition covering these items for immediate shipment to Hay River. A two burner hot plate is requested for use in the school to heat water for these lunches.\n\nAs no water exists in Hay River except where brought to the buildings by tank truck it has become a necessity to provide both the school and residence with galvanized tanks. My Requisition calls for four tanks for immediate delivery via Peace River. These tanks to be used as follows: one for residence kitchen, one for engine room as extra supply for residence, one for boys wash room and one for girls wash room. Pails and wash basins are also included.\n\nI have made up my estimates for the following year and will forward these at an early date. By so doing it is hoped that these last minute requisitions will be avoided.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.F.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAttached, herewith, is copy of letter of September 20th from W. A. Bowerman of the Hay River Indian Day School.\n\nYou will note that a supply of requisition forms is required and additional seats for the children. School supplies and equipment should be shipped to D & S Trucking Service at Edmonton for transmission to Hay River.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\n\nEnclosure.\nHay River Indian Day School,\nSeptember 20th, 1946.\n\nMr. J. W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nThe school is still going strong with the attendance increasing each day. You will notice in my requisition that I ordered 40 more seats, making us a total with the 30 we have here of 120, but our numbers have now exceeded that figure and I would like an additional forty, as I am inclined to believe you will need before Christmas and we will need anyway at the opening of school next September. Unless something radical happens this school will have an attendance next year of two hundred.\n\nI would appreciate anything you could do regarding more seats.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(signed) W.A. Bowerman.\nDuring the past month I have been able to visit the three Indian Day Schools in this Agency as well as the Fort Resolution Residential School. As this trip was made just after the opening of the school term I believe it worth while to report on my observations at each point.\n\nOn September 21st, I visited the Hay River School and at the time there were over 130 pupils with six more to come within a few days. At this school the pupils are sitting on boxes and whatever can be scraped up. The teacher went over to the old Hay River school and picked up all the old desks that were available. Even with these the school is in urgent need of a shipment of new desks.\n\nMr. Bowerman has the school very well organized and the night I arrived at Hay River, a social was being put on to raise money for the Christmas concert. This social was held in the Hay River community hall.\n\nAt this school we have four teachers on full time with an average of over 30 pupils per teacher. With this attendance the teacher has no time to do any janitor work and we must hire a man full time to do this job. The Public Works are still paying the present janitor but only for this month. There are four class rooms to sweep out, two large halls and four stair-ways to the second floor. This work has to be done every evening, and with the school, the residence, and the powerhouse to look after, the man here will be kept busy. At the present time, Mr. Frank Norn is doing the work and I believe he will do this work for possibly $1500.00 although he has asked $1800.00. I do not think we can expect any man to do our janitor work for less as there is\nplenty of work in Hay River and the school job is a full time one, with no time to make extra on the side if not paid enough by us.\n\nMr. Bowerman has been very keen to get out and do welfare work and I have found him very useful in bringing the Indians together whenever I have sent him word that I am coming over for Indian meetings. He has also volunteered to look after the registration of Family Allowances and to help in any way possible with the organization of winter fishing programs for the Indians at this settlement.\n\nThis locality offers great opportunities for the Indians if they are properly organized and a welfare teacher is needed here as much if not more than any other place in the north. If we don't take advantage of the opportunities for the Indians and get them into working, we are going to have the same set up as at Yellowknife, where the Indian sits on the outskirts of the town and does the odd little bit of work though spending most of his time gambling and drinking, and giving us one of our greatest problems in the Agency. From my several contacts with Mr. Bowerman and his cooperation on all subjects, we may find it very hard to find a man better suited as a welfare teacher.\n\nThis school has been supplied with fuel oil by Department of Public Works to cover the construction period but not beyond. The school is in need of oil immediately and I have requested an order be placed with Imperial Oil immediately. As soon as authority is received, I will have IOL Hay River fill our storage tanks.\n\nI have seen enormous progress at all the schools since last term and I believe we can look forward with confidence to the results that will be obtained from the new type of school in the Northwest Territories.\n\n(Sgd.)

As this was a definite fire hazard I sent to Bruce Robinson for a shipment. I find that I had not notified you of this move when the fuses arrived which was an oversight on my part.\n\nFuel oil is being delivered as required and charged to Purchase Order 48819.\n\nOn my last visit to Hay River School it was brought to my attention that there are no repair parts for any of the electrical equipment what-so-ever. As the heating and lighting are entirely dependent on the light plant it seems reasonable to expect that two spare fuel injection lines and two spare nozzle tips should be available at all times. The above two parts sometimes give out on any motor and a two or three day wait in the middle of winter could be very inconvenient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

Kirkby,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\n\nIn response to your Army Signal in connection with a floor polisher and wax for the Hay River Indian Day School, we are forwarding a polisher from Ottawa, and arranging with Mr. Gooderham to forward to the school 24 2 lb. tins of paste wax.\n\nThis machine and wax is being provided the Hay River Day School to be used as a test whether cleanliness of the school can be improved by waxing the floors. It would be appreciated if you would report on this after your next visit to the school, as requests are being made by schools in the North for wax, and we are anxious to know if the cost is justifiable.\n\nIt has been found that best results in the maintenance of floors in Government buildings in Ottawa, can be had by thoroughly scrubbing the floor and allowing it to dry before the wax is applied. The wax should be allowed to set for fifteen to twenty minutes and then polished after each application as if it is not polished, there is extreme danger of children falling especially if their footwear is wet.\n\nTwo pound tins of wax are being provided as it is felt that one tin will be about sufficient for one application. An applicator that is used in the Government buildings is a sack affair filled with the paste wax and tied to a handle. This procedure has proved very satisfactory, however, should the wax ooze too freely a cloth of a finer weave should be used, or vis a versa.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n**T.

During the time our men were there some repairs and unfinished work remaining uncompleted in 1948-49 were being attended to. However, at the same time, our workmen were engaged also on other projects at Hay River so that they were at that location for a longer period than would have been necessary for the work remaining to be done in finishing the school. After our workmen had completed work on the school, there were continual demands that our men be called back to the location for remedying of what at first appeared minor matters, but the recurrence of things to be attended to would lead one to believe that something was wrong when such demands for repairs in new construction and equipment were being asked for.\n\nOn the return to this City of Mr. G.A. Walrath, who was Engineer in charge during the past summer at Hay River, I requested a report on this situation. This report is herewith attached.\n\nIt is apparent that there is a lack of proper supervision of the school buildings, in that proper care is not being taken of same. From Mr. Walrath's report, when one reads that bolts placed in the floor have been ripped from their bearings and the accordion doors damaged, simply because someone has not taken the trouble to raise these bolts and secure same before opening the doors, it is evident that something is wrong at this place. There are other instances of misconduct bordering on vandalism, or lack of responsibility, also in Mr. Walrath's report.\n\nIn order to bring you up to date on what has arisen I mention the following:\n\n(a) POWERHOUSE AT TEACHERAGE: The voltage regulator on the generator was found to be not working satisfactorily and Canadian Fairbanks Morse Limited, who supplied the generator, were requested to send a new voltage regulator to Hay River. Mr. Walrath arranged with Jack Purnell of Bond Construction Company to install this motor (being sent addressed care of Mr. Bowerman) on its arrival and to send the account here. This is one case, however, where a mechanism is apt to go out of kilter without any apparent reason and without any suggestion of lack of attention from any person;\n\n(b) SCHOOL: The 1 H.P. motor of the blower which drives the fan on the furnace has been found to be acting badly and it was apparent that two bearings were likely to be burnt out at any time and require replacement. As information was incomplete, the firm of Electrical Industries in Edmonton were requested to send two sets of two bearings\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 3)\n(total of 4 bearings) so as to be assured that the correct ones might arrive. Mr. Bowerman is being requested to return here the one set of two bearings which are not needed. We have not to date arranged for the installation of these bearings, but shall send word to Bond Construction Company to have their Mr. Jack Parnell install same. These bearings are being sent addressed to Mr. Bowerman, Hay River, via Muskeg Northern Transportation Company. The replacement of these bearings can only be attributed to lack of attention and proper oiling of the installed machinery over the past few months, and is one of the items of neglect mentioned by Mr. Laird in his report.\n\nThe above two items (a) and (b) are particularly mentioned as two instances where this office is attending to replacement of parts in order that the various machines on the school premises may be kept in first-class running condition, and the expenses of same are being paid for here. There is no complaint regarding our paying these expenses and keeping the machinery in working order while our men were at Hay River and in a position to attend to same. I am now advising you, however, that with the withdrawal of our men from Hay River, the construction work is considered fully completed for 1942-30, and any further arrangements for repairs will have to be attended to by you.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nA considerable sum of money has been spent in the construction of school facilities with necessary machinery at Hay River, and as far as possible everything is being left in first-class condition. It is evident the following situation exists:\n\n(a) Lack of discipline for the proper care of the buildings;\n\n(b) Lack of trained personnel to observe ordinary instructions regarding the proper care and maintenance of machinery.\n\nUnless these unsatisfactory conditions are rectified at once there is bound to be a recurrence of trouble with resulting expense in the maintenance and operation of these buildings. I thus consider it my duty at this time to point out the situation which exists at that place.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Col. H.F. Neary, Department of Education, Ottawa, for his information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J. Johnston\n\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\n\nWJJ-akd.\nEncl.\nMEMORANDUM FOR W.J. JOHNSTON, DISTRICT ENGINEER, EDMONTON.\n\nINSPECTION OF HAY RIVER SCHOOL AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAINTENANCE\n\nInspection of School as of December 14, 1949:\n\nWork was completed on the school by December 1st this year and all woodwork was left in first-class condition. As a result of the school being in use previous to this date it was found very difficult to clean the floors and woodwork before they could be varnished and left in good condition.\n\nOn inspection on December 14th several things were not in order and very disappointing to men who had worked so hard to finish a fine building.\n\nSeveral of the flush bolts at the bottom of the accordion doors were broken off due to lack of care in lifting them when the doors were opened.\n\nBoards which held coat hooks were torn off the walls from their proper place and nailed up in the main foyer. The workmanship on this work is very crude.\n\nMud was present on the ceiling of the main foyer.\n\nThere were football marks on the inside of the glass of the glazed doors.\n\nOn one occasion the fan on the furnace was found running dry and howling for oil. Considerable damage has been done to these bearings.\n\nThe main bearings on the 1 H.P. fan motor have become worn so badly that replacements are necessary almost immediately. This is too soon for such bearings to be worn so badly and it appears to be another case of no oil.\n\nOn another occasion the injector fan and motor had a knock in its operation which was remedied by oiling. It is hard to say what damage has been done to this motor.\n\nOn the twelfth of November mechanics took off the generator from the power plant to remedy oil leaking from the crankcase. The leaking oil was found to be coming from a sump that had not been drained. Instructions on the side of the plant require that the sump be drained daily.\n\nDoor-stops in the school have had rubber tips removed and the sharp ends uncovered, have marked the doors.\n\nThe handle on the night-latch on the front door has been twisted off.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAINTENANCE ARE:\n\nSupervision of the school children to stop vandalism.\n\nAccordion doors should not be operated by children, and by only those having authority to do so.\n\n(over)\nA schedule for oiling and checking machinery should be maintained. If personnel cannot do this they should not be employed. Instructions in the manual with the power unit should be followed.\n\nFURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAINTENANCE:\n\nNo changes in the construction and finish of the buildings should be made without proper authority and by competent tradesmen.\n\nProper care of floors requires these to be cleaned and waxed. At present this is not being done to show up the floors to their best advantage. Perhaps the chief difficulty is the lack of a waxer and polisher and it is recommended that such a machine be provided.\n\nDetails of articles necessary to be supplied are as follows:\n\n1 only No.13 LALONDE Floor Polisher\n12\" brush . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 135.00\n\n200 lbs., Linx or Johnson's Traffic Wax - sufficient for six months' supply. (Paste recommended rather than liquid)\nThis should be used sparingly.\nFloor should be washed (mopped) with a damp mop, not a wet one.\n\nC.A.

Gibson, Ed.,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn order to safeguard the lives of children crossing the Hay River to the new Hay River Indian Day School, some type of supervised transportation should be provided. For four months in the year children are required to cross this river by boat. I would recommend that the Department either provide a boat and place same in charge of the Principal or Caretaker of the school or that they endeavour to make arrangements with someone locally to attend to this matter.\n\nThe Park Warden crosses the river each day to bring his children to school. Would it be possible to have him take a little longer route and bring all the children back and forth across the river?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. J.W. McKinnon,\nSupt. of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\n\nNote: Matters relating to the Hay River School, including transportation, are to be considered at the next meeting of the Sub-Committee on Education of the NWT Council, in January, 1950.\n\nENG\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your wire of yesterday's date and as the native janitor has not been too satisfactory it is no doubt the best procedure to have a man brought in by the Civil Service.\n\nAt the present time we have no principal at this school and everyone is well aware of this. Mr. Kennedy has informed Mr. Bowerman that he has just as much authority as he has and consequently no one is in complete control nor is anyone responsible. I am over a hundred miles away and I do well to get into the settlement once a month. If we don't have a principal who can be shouldered with responsibilities, then it becomes extremely difficult to lay the fault at any one man's door.\n\nI do not agree with Mr. Johnston's report in which he tries to place all the blame for faulty equipment on the school and I have discussed the report with Mr. McKinnon in Mr. Johnston's presence. I have also a report from the Head Teacher, Mr. Bowerman and a copy of this is enclosed for your information.\n\nWe do not intend to side step our responsibilities but neither do we wish to be blamed for faulty workmanship or installation that has occurred in more than one school that we have taken over from D.P.W. As Mr. Bowerman has pointed out in his letter he has personally checked the oiling of motors and fans when this was carried out by the janitor. It is also pointed out that several of these motors have never run properly from the day they were put in. I would like to point out that at both Hay River and Rocher River the circulator motors were running backwards and the change over to proper direction had to be made by our local men on the spot or freeze waiting for authority from D.P.W.\n\nI would like to point out that at all the schools taken over so far we find that many things are left to be completed the following year or the year after that. This has been true both at Hay River and at Rocher River with the consequence that the buildings is put in operation in an unfinished state and before the proper changes have been made. In this way floors are improperly maintained and much of the equipment operates poorly, not through any fault of the man in charge, but because the building is used in a semi-complete state.\n\nWe have had furnace troubles at both Hay River and at Rocher River and in both places the floors are the next thing to impossible to heat. Mr. Bowerman's letter will bear out the heating problems and the difficulties encountered with both these schools.\n\nThe present plan of building on piles and to have all the heat above the floor with an insulated floor of\nconsiderable thickness is, as far as I can see, a relatively new idea and unless the workmanship is perfect and insulation is done in a very careful manner it will be impossible to keep the floors at the desired temperature.\n\nI intend to spend a few days in Hay River within the next two weeks and all the points brought out in both Mr. W.J. Johnston's letter and also Mr. Bowerman's letter will be gone into thoroughly to discover, if possible, just what is the matter with Hay River School.\n\nWith the exception of the motors and the fan bearings, which are very probably installation faults, the report has been very petty and when other things are taken into account is, I believe, made to distract one's attention from many of the construction faults we are now finding.\n\nThe offices at the rear of the school and on the second floor are used by Mr. Martin, who is the District Agent at that settlement, and much of the dirt was carried in by people going for interviews. The mud on the ceiling was kicked there by one party who told Mr. Bowerman that he had no authority over him and he would do as he liked. This is just another instance where the principal must be made responsible for the building and the janitor as well. These teachers receive more pay than I do and if they have only one building to look after or supervise as well as their school work I cannot see that they are being asked to do too much, they do not have to do any manual labour, only see that the janitor does his job.\n\nThe present Hay River Administration have several buildings of their own and we have the school and the teacherage. If the Administration are to engage a janitor and if we engage one it will put two men doing the same type of work into Hay River and it would seem to me to be only logical that we get together with the Administration of Hay River and have both janitors come under the Administrator, working these men in two shifts of eight hours each. In this way both parties would get better service and the District Administrator would be able to check up and keep the buildings maintained to the best possible degree of cleanliness. Our school is only about half a mile from the Administration Buildings and each man while on shift could make the rounds of all buildings. In Ft. Smith the janitors at the Administration Buildings look after the school and better service is obtained than by using one man separately at each building.\n\nIf you feel that the above plan would not work out it is imperative that we have a school principal who can be made responsible and also given the necessary authority to ensure that both teachers and janitors will do as they are told. As I pointed out earlier I am unable to visit these schools more than once a month and in the mean time someone must keep things operating.\n\nAt the present time many people take delight in pointing out how dirty the school is and how it is being mis-used, but though pages can be written on each little incident, they are petty and if one man, who is on the spot, can be shouldered with the responsibility and authority that he needs then these criticisms will not exist; or the man in charge will have a good excuse why they happened. I am of the opinion the principal should be this man as his authority covers the teachers, the children, the discipline of the school and should therefore cover the janitors duties.\n\nI would be pleased to see a principal at Hay River and have the responsibility of the school placed on his shoulders as far as cleanliness and daily operation goes.\nHay River Indian Day School,\nDecember 27th, 1949\n\nMr. W. J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\n9937 - 103rd Street,\nEDMONTON, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are certain facts regarding the school and teacherage that I think should be brought to your attention, and necessary action.\n\n1. The teacherage floors are so cold that it is an impossibility to live in it, we cannot mop the floors because the ice freezes on it. I made a test and when the temperature of the thermostat is 80 degrees the floor temperature is 18 degrees. The cupboard in the kitchen, even with the oil stove on full, freezes solidly. This condition is due to faulty construction and lack of insulation.\n\n2. The vibration due to faulty installation of the electric light plant is so great that it is almost an impossibility to keep the controls of the furnace adjusted. This motor was installed on a cement base without any means whatever taken to lessen the vibration. The trouble that we have had with the furnace motors is due to the fact that they were installed running backwards and thus burned themselves out. It is an impossibility to have your diesel engine running at the requested twelve hundred R.P.M. as this would deliver a voltage of over two hundred and eighty. This matter has been drawn to the attention of your resident engineer many times.\n\n3. The electric motor in the school furnace has never run right from the first day we started the motor, as I am not a furnace man, nor a mechanic I did not know what was wrong, but as I told Mr. Walrath that any motor making that noise was not right. I have been informed by the superintendent that proper maintenance of the plant was not being taken, that is true because your men were doing the maintenance until the fifteenth of December, but as far as looking after the plant, changing filters, oiling, and etc., I have personally checked Mr. Norn, the caretaker, when he serviced these machines, I thought it only proper that I draw these matters to your attention.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(signed) W. A. Bowerman\n26 January, 1950.\n\nMr. I. F. Kirkby,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nRay River School\n\nReference your 139-6-1 of January 4.\n\nBy now, you will have received my Army Message concerning Mr. Bowerman and Mr. Kennedy and copies of my letters (a) to Mr. Bowerman, advising him of his reclassification as a Welfare Teacher and as Acting Principal, and (b) to Mr. Kennedy concerning the poor discipline in his classroom.\n\nI have had several telephone conversations with the Engineers of the Department of Public Works and have sent them a copy of Mr. Bowerman's letter of December 27, 1949 and certain extracts of your letter. I believe that by now action will have been taken to fill in under these buildings so that some of the cold will at least have been eliminated.\n\nVentilators will have been left in the fill and the snow pack will be removed before thaw.\n\nYou can make it clear to Mr. Bowerman that you are delegating to him certain responsibilities with regard to the discipline, cleanliness and maintenance of this school. We regard you as the official trustee but naturally, being 100 miles away, the principal must assume more responsibility than is done in provincial schools.\n\nBernard F.

Smith the janitors at the Administration Buildings look after the school and better service is obtained than by using one man separately at each building.\"\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Dec. 30 | Payment of freight on school residence supplies shipped from Eatons. | 13.77  |\n| Jan   | Payment of freight on school books and stationary from Ottawa.         | 14.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Some openings will be left on each side of the buildings to allow ventilation and keep the ground cool. This arrangement should cut down the draught which now passes under the buildings and thereby help to reduce the coldness of the floors.\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Johnston stating that he expects to be absent from his office from February 2nd to the 11th inclusive, to inspect various works throughout the Northwest Territories. I have no definite itinerary from Mr. Johnston and cannot say exactly when he will be in Hay River.\n\nI note that your Mr. Kirkby expects to visit Hay River about this time and I would suggest that you ask him if he can possibly arrange to be there at the same time as Mr. Johnston.

As this school building was constructed by the Department of Public Works for your branch, it is considered you should be advised of Magistrate Martin's comments and the following is an extract from his letter:\n\n\"The large heaters in the two dwellings made no impression on the buildings, even with all the side rooms closed off, and the large heaters burning full on, the floors remain frozen and the inside temperature below zero. The outside temperature has averaged between 25 degrees and 38 degrees below zero during the past ten days.\n\nThe trouble lays in the construction of these buildings, putting them up in the air on piles and open to the elements, it is impossible to heat the floors. The same trouble is being experienced in the Hay River Indian Day School and the Teacherage, with the two furnaces going full blast twenty fours a day, the upstairs in these two buildings reach 80 degrees above and on the ground floors, water spilt on the floor freezes instantly. Frost has formed inside the corners of these two buildings.\"\n\nCopy of Magistrate Martin's letter has been forwarded to the Chief Engineer, Department of Public Works, with a request\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthat he take immediate action to have the space under our buildings properly enclosed with sheeting and building paper. When the matter was discussed with Colonel Anderson of the Department of Public Works he said he would advise Mr. Johnston to investigate the school building and report on present conditions. No doubt you will wish to communicate with Mr. Blais in this connection.\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\n10 February, 1950.\n\nMr. I. F. Kirkby,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N. W.

To this end, a request has been transmitted by wireless asking our Engineer at Hay River for a detailed inspection and report. Recommendation for correction and change in design if necessary will be dependent on this report.\n\nThe matter of vibration caused by the generator set will also be covered and a suitable recommendation made.\n\nChief.\nOttawa 10 February 1950\n\nMR I.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have today returned from a complete survey of the school at Hay river and also the teachers residence. This report is intended as a true picture of what I have been able to observe to be at fault in the construction of these buildings and in the equipment that was installed. I do not intend to try and place the blame for the faulty workmanship as the buildings were up before I came to this Agency.\n\nThe report by Mr. Walruth and the subsequent report by Mr. W.J. Johnston were both received at this office and at yours and in places where we are at fault; which incidently was lack of proper maintenance of the floors due to lack of the right type of equipment has been improved. I must point out that Mr. Bowerman declares he oiled every bearing and motor himself and that from the first time fans and motors were installed they did not operate properly, thus making it necessary to keep calling back the men to check and repair. I can say with absolute certainty that the circulator fans were installed running backwards and it was only after making himself abnoxious, was Mr. Bowerman able to get these motors reversed and running correct. This did not do the motors any good and has shortened their life to some extent.\n\nOn this inspection of the school building it was found that the floors are much improved, all floors were scrubbed and now that the waxer has arrived they are beginning to look much more presentable in the rooms completed. Once all the rooms and halls are complete these floors should be a credit and the small expenditure for wax will save the floors and also the time to do the cleaning up. In appearance only we will not hesitate to take anyone on an inspection trip. My only complaint in this regard is that the polisher is too small and is one only large enough for a house or small office. At Hay River we have upwards of 7000 sq. ft. of floor surface in the school and another 1500 sq. ft. in the residence and I do not believe the polisher can stand up. It is also too light and has no applicator. Even with only one room waxed so far, I could see such an improvement from last trip into Hay River that I consider it a worth while piece of equipment.\n\nWhen in Hay River the temperature was about 20 below with a wind of from four to six miles per hour. The floors of the residence were so cold that after sitting for ten minutes with outdoor footgear on my feet became cold. To touch the floors with the hand proved that they were very little if any above the freezing point. With this revealed to me on a calm day I began a thorough examination and I have the following to report.\n\nIn all the kitchen cupboards the water froze with the kitchen stove on full and the room temperature over 80 degrees. When these kitchen doors were opened up the cold air rushed in with enough force to put out a large candle light. Directly under the sink a small board was broken in the sub-floor and I cut a hole large enough to put my hand in for an examination of the insulation. I declare that there was more cold air.\nbeing forced up through the small hole I made; due to the difference in density of cold and warm air; than one could generate with one of the standard house fans now on the market. This in itself was proof that the space between the floor joists was not a dead air space as it should have been, also it was found that there was only a single two inch batt of insulation when there should have been the full ten or twelve of the floor joists. All around the outside of the building inside walls the air was being forced into the house where the base board joins the floor and here as under the sink the circulation was enough to put out a candle.\n\nI then went under this house and the enclosed sketch will illustrate what I found. The boards are nearly placed between the floor joists and the joints are open enough to slide ones finger in, in places. I could see no paper and the insulation was placed on top of these boards. Without any paper and wind proof cracks the insulation was worthless and all the school residence has on the floor, between the inside and outside air is a double layer of boards; the sub and top floors.\n\nAs an immediate remedy and to save much fuel for the remainder of the season I recommend that two layers of paper be stapled to the under side of the floor joists and that shiplap be nailed over the paper and to the underside of the floor joists. This will stop the air and will make a dead air space between the floor joists of the first floor. Next summer an insulation blower should be brought in and the space between the floor joists blown full of blowing wool (fiber glass) from the underside of the floor by boring a hole between each joist large enough for the nozzle of the blowing machine. If the above two jobs are not done the building will be less than useless every winter and as a building gets older it always gets colder and less efficient.\n\nThe above immediate remedy, as in attached sketch, can be done with 1200 ft. of shiplap, 4 rolls of tar paper, 4 rolls of building (kraft) paper and possibly 30 pounds of nails plus the labour cost and could be done in four or five days. The filling with insulation and the blower work would require an estimate by a man familiar with that kind of work. At the present time the D.P.W. have a supply of dry shiplap stored at the school that could be used if released for the purpose.\n\nOn examination of the cold air registers it was found that in the residence they are placed eight inches above the floor on top of the base board while in the school they are directly on the floor in the base board. This will cause a dead air space of eight inches of cold air on the floor which will not circulate. The registers must be put down to the floor and this is not too much of a job. To obtain better circulation Mr. W.J. Johnston sent me instructions to get two fans and put them above the hot air ducts and pointing downward. This I did and if the floors are fixed and the cold air inlets changed much improvement should be obtained.\n\nOn close examination of the piles on which the building rests, I found one pile had sunk from two to three inches and drawn the spikes out of the main beam. This left the one wall resting on only three instead of four piles. In this respect I request that I be given authority to have this section raised slightly with a jack and the space between beam and pile shimmed.\n\nI do not have a plan of this building and so do not know what is called for as far as the first floor goes but I am sure that no architect would put his name to the type of insulation that is put in this building and it would appear to be the fault of the foreman in charge of building and no one else. These buildings are now up and I wish to do my best to recommend feasible repairs and to see that they are done. It is not my intention to find fault with the builder but we are now left with the job of maintenance and I do not intend that repairs that we have to make either in the near or distant future, be blamed onto lack of supervision when it was faulty construction in the first place.\nThe interior finish of this residence would appear to be well done and if the first floor can be made livable, then the faulty section of this house will be eliminated before more damage has been done.\n\nWith the school building we have the very same floor problem with cold first floors and from the information gained in the house it is to be presumed that the insulation in the school floors are also lacking. These school floors are not healthy for small children and the longer one sits in a desk the colder his feet and legs become. In the school insulation must be improved but presents a much greater problem than in the house.\n\nThe school is on piles and on the top of these there is a complete first floor of concrete, this makes it impossible to add more insulation from the bottom and as I see it insulation must be added from the top. To do this the first floor would have to be lifted and the space between the floor joists blown full of blowing wool, then a two by four on its side placed directly above each floor joist, the space between these filled with a two inch batt of rock wool and then a double floor re laid. This would only raise the floor two and one half inches which is little or nothing with the high ceilings now in the building.\n\nThe present furnace never stops from one day to the next and the floors were cold at 20 below, what will it be like at 50 and 60 below. If floors can be made to warm up then the furnace should cut out for up to half the time and the saving in fuel oil as well as the improvements to the teaching conditions should justify the cost of insulation.\n\nWhen in the portion set aside as a wash room, and used for the past year, by Mr. Martin as his residence the frost has come through the walls in the corners just above the base board and these sections are next to impossible to heat. If it becomes impossible to warm the floors then no amount of heat in the rest of the upper air in the rooms is of much avail and we have to use far more heat than is necessary trying to do the impossible. It is from these observations that I feel I cannot too strongly recommend a complete re-insulation of both school and residence floors, and that the lessons we have learned by trial and error should be guarded against at any other school or building put up.\n\nThe present old warehouse at the front of the school is to be torn down and a small building for storage of windows etc. is to be built at the back of the lot. The front fire escape entrance still has scaffold in it and is to be completed next year. The school needs plank walks from the side door to the street, from the back door to the teachers residence and from the second side door to the toilets. These walks are a must in this town of ankle deep mud in spring and fall and after every rain. The three parts or projects outlined in this paragraph have been drawn to the attention of Mr. W.J. Johnston when he was in Yellowknife and he has made a note of them.\n\nI understand that the lot on which the school is located is to be leveled and some other work done to it. Along this line I have no information but if we are to engage a full time janitor who has the required qualifications then the summer months can be spent in mowing lawns and doing some type of landscaping that I believe will have to be done eventually.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. W.J. Johnston for his information and comments. He may possibly have some recommendations to make as to remedying some of these very urgent insulating problems. If Mr. Johnston is to be in Hay River some time during the winter and wishes to make a thorough inspection of the school and residence in my presence I will make an attempt to be there if I know well in advance when he expects to make the trip.\n\nThe attached sketches are intended to illustrate the\nthe floors as they are at the present time and my suggestions as to repairs that could be done to improve insulation and cut down on fuel bills as well as making the buildings comfortable to live and work in.\n\nI received Mr. Johnston's letter in which he recommended we put an electric fan above each hot air duct; the day before I left for Hay River and I had no time to request authority from you for their purchase. As no electric equipment is available in Hay River I made an immediate purchase in Yellowknife and took them with me. When the invoices arrive I will forward to you for payment if the necessary authority will be granted. The two fans complete with extension cord and some other electric attachments amounts to $24.75.\n\nThese fans did have an effect in circulating the air but it is impossible to heat the floor itself under the present conditions.\n\nWhen in Hay River I discussed the possibility of our janitor and the one doing the janitor work for the Local District Administrator be combined and instead of one man doing each establishment separately they work in two shifts and in this way the buildings will receive twenty four hour service instead of the present set-up where one man works a shift and the building is left for the school teacher to worry about the rest of the day and night. I brought this to Mr. Martin's attention and he feels that it would be a very satisfactory arrangement but he was not sure of the janitor arrangements to be put into effect by his Branch and suggested that we approach Mr. R.A. Gibson with the proposal of our combining janitors in the interest of better service and janitor supervision.\n\nMr. McKinnon has just returned from an inspection trip in which he has visited all schools and in order that we will be able to prevent duplication and much misunderstanding I will be taking the complete responsibility of repairs and maintenance of school buildings and the ordering of supplies and materials for these schools. With this in mind I have written this report and have pointed out the faults that must be rectified in the best interests of maintenance and economy of operation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.F.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nHay River Indian Day School File 905-5 (EL)\n\nI have enclosed corrected voucher No. 267 covering supplies for hot noon lunches for Hay River school. When I made the purchase for these supplies from Hay River Supply Co, they agreed to supply at wholesale price plus freight and 5% for their work of handling. Through some slip up on their part they did not supply me with the cost landed price of each item and the resulting voucher was returned for correction.\n\nThe present invoice has been corrected by the Supply Company and is attached to the corrected voucher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nReference: Hay River School Condition\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour wire regarding dirty condition of Hay River school has been received. As I have just returned from the above school I am able to give an honest report on the condition of the floors and as I have been into Hay River when conditions were as bad as they can get I feel that I am in a position to report on both the good and the poor maintenance conditions that we hear about.\n\nI am not in a position to know who made the report or complaint but I am reasonably sure where it came from and is intended to show how much better the Northwest Territories Administration keep their schools than what we do. It may also have been put forward with the idea that this particular school should be taken from Indian Affairs, if I am right in my guess as to where the complaint originated.\n\nI have had both the Ft. Smith and Yellowknife schools compared to Hay River so far as cleanliness and janitor service is concerned. These two schools are both held up as shining examples and because Hay River does not measure up we are said to be lax and falling down one the job.\n\nThe Ft. Smith school is built in pure sand which does not cling to one's feet and no matter how much it rains there is still no mud. This school has a full basement with running water which can be used for cleaning if need be. This school in conjunction with the other Government buildings has three janitors and with steam heating can be kept warm enough to scrub the floors if need be. At this school they have used a large heavy duty floor washer that probably cost close to $300.00, also the attendance is half of what we have at Hay River and as the building was not used as an Administration office as well as a school the wear on the floors is possibly less than a quarter of the Hay River school.\n\nAt Yellowknife the whole town is built on either rock or gravel and mud is not known around the school or the playground. This school has a large concrete paved area in front of the entrance over which everyone must walk to enter the building. Once in the building the first floor is concrete and if dirt is carried in there is no excuse. This building has running hot and cold water and the floor polisher is a large automatic machine whereby the building can be kept spotless. Here the school is operated by the town with their own trustee board.\n\nI would like to point out that at Hay River we have no walks, no paved expanse in front of any door and everyone who enters must step out of the mud, up half a dozen steps and directly into the school building. As we had over 140\nschool children attending daily as well as an undisclosed number of adults moving through the building to the local Administrator's office, the floors of the school took a lot of hard wear and the varnish was worn completely off the center of the halls and the center of each step where the traffic was heavy. Once the light coat of varnish was removed the dirt was ground right into the wood and even now after the wood work has been thoroughly washed and waxed the halls look dirty and unkept because wooden floors varnished and waxed are very unsatisfactory in localities like Hay River. If we are to close the school every time we get a thaw or a rain storm we will be able to keep the floors \"clean enough to eat off\" as Supt. McKinnon insists they should be.\n\nEvery bucket of water for washing must be heated on the kitchen stove in the residence and carried to the school. This is a large school and one needs a barrel of water not a bucket full to start scrubbing so that it is a major problem to get enough hot water to do the job. To start scrubbing these hardwood floors with strong soap and water every couple of days will result in the floor being completely ruined within a matter of a few months.\n\nAfter freeze up last fall the floors in this building were completely scrubbed and when the waker arrived the janitor began working down the floors in each room. The waker was too late and small for such a large building with floors requiring constant maintenance for little practical purpose.\n\nFrank Horn was found to be very unreliable and it was his lack of maintenance of the mechanical equipment and his lack of ability to learn how to do it properly that prompted me to ask for his release and to let him go. It is impossible for any one man to keep this place clean once the spring thaw comes and the floors will always be people who do not like the way we are doing things, a chance to criticize without any attempt to analyse the reasons behind any of these conditions.\n\nThe floors at this school will require a fresh varnish job at least once or twice a year and this will cover hall floors and stair treads. As stated earlier the halls and the stairs though washed and waxed look dirty and untidy right now this because the varnish has worn off from the action of the fall dirt being ground right into the wood. Invariably most of our critics are not able to visit the schools when the weather is bad or the conditions are at the worst, but do come in when everything is ideal except that our buildings are sometimes still dirty with the man in charge trying to clean up the mess that was caused by no fault of his own. If all these individuals have to do is find fault without looking for the reasons then their reports are only half truths that misrepresent the facts for their own benefit.\n\nThis school at Hay River has no washrooms, no plumbing and no facilities are available by which we can install them. A wash room has been set up in the furnace room, as this is the only place where the floor will stand water to be spilled or where it can be kept from freezing. This gives a very untidy appearance to the furnace room but it does give a wash room which we would not have otherwise. Barrels have been set up to hold fresh water and the janitor removes the waste twice a day. To any one who wished to complain, this furnace room is a very unsightly place but if we train the Indian children to keep clean then we have been well rewarded for the dirt and untidy appearance of the furnace room.\n\nThe present janitor is doing a much better job of work than the last and is making every effort to keep the place clean and tidy. All rooms are kept clean or swept out and floors are waxed and polished as well as they can be. During the Easter Holidays the halls and stairs must be thoroughly scrubbed and varnished before they are waxed. This is the only time work of this type can be done and I request the\nAuthority to purchase varnish, stain, brushes etc., required to do this work during the Easter holidays. The janitor will do the work of sanding rough spots, applying the varnish and we will not require any extra labour.\n\nI wish to see this done so that I will be able to make a report on how well this wax and varnish will stand up during the mud and water of this springs break up. I do not feel that we can keep wood floors in the halls and wooden stair treads in the condition some people feel they should be. If the school continues with 120 to 150 pupils then we must have battleship linoleum on the halls and iron or heavy rubber stair treads, thus we can wash or scrub the halls every night and the stairs will not wear out or scuff. I intend to report on the school condition next spring, but I feel that the above two changes should be put into Hay River school. Each and every locality has a different problem and I feel that the type of soil we are dealing with requires special precautions as far as our floors go.\n\nWhen Mr. W.J. Johnston of the Public Works was last in Yellowknife I asked him about putting board walks from the road to the main entrance, from the back door to the teacher's residence and from the second side entrance to the toilets. I will be seeing Mr. Johnston within the next week and will ask him if these walks can be put in before break up when the mud will be everywhere. I will write you after I have discussed the matter with Mr. Johnston but I feel that we must put the walks in at all cost as I do not want a repetition of last falls mud if it can be helped. I would also like to point out that last fall was the first time this school had enough pupils to call it open and though a great many complaints have been leveled at the janitor work done and the cleanliness obtained those who make the most absurd remarks, forget that the building is still being worked on by D.P.W., the yard has never been leveled nor walks put in and no gravel has been added to try and cut down the mud.\n\nI saw some paper on the floor during the afternoon of my last visit, but the janitor had not swept up after school was out. This new janitor is much more alert than Mr. Horn and I feel he will try and keep things as clean as possible. Though the last Janitor lacked much and was far from what we desired the janitor to be, I do not believe that the building was one quarter as bad as the picture was painted and if the facts had been analyzed thoroughly, the complaint would not have been made but a recommendation sent in showing how the conditions could have been improved for those in charge of maintenance work.\n\nWalls and ceilings were as clean as any school I have been in and the engine room and furnace room had been cleaned up since my last visit. The engine still throws some oil and the floors of these two buildings will need to be scrubbed next spring. I would like to point out that the furnace room floors and the engine room floors are concrete mats set up on posts two or three feet above the ground so that these floors are the same temperature inside as outside; 70 below when the weather is that cold. It then becomes an impossibility to wash these floors and if oil or dirt drips on them it must be left until we get a spring thaw to clean it up.\n\nIf the complaint will specify special points then if it is accurate, we can explain or deny but I do not believe the condition is as reported, or if it is so there was a very good reason behind it being this way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Hay River Indian Day School\n\nMr. W. J. Johnston, Department of Public Works, Edmonton, was in the office a few days ago and gave me a copy of a report dated December 20th concerning the Hay River Indian Day School. In this connection, I would comment as follows:\n\nI read Mr. Johnston's report and informed him that I considered much of his report petty and of little or no value. I am at variance with Mr. Johnston in his view that teachers and pupils should move into schools before they have been completed by the Department of Public Works and feel that the leaving of the school buildings in an unfinished state has resulted in undesirable conditions. You will recall that the teacher and pupils moved into the Hay River School before same was completed. In fact, the main entrance (fire exit) has not been completed. I brought this matter to Mr. Johnston's attention and he said he would attend to it. In contrast, the Department of National Defense completed the Fort Resolution Territorial Day School before handing it over to the Administration. As a result, pupils will have greater respect for the building as it has been kept in first class condition. Whereas, the Hay River School was opened in an unfinished state; cleaning equipment was not provided so that the building could be kept in good condition. The pupils and teacher lived in a cold, unheated, unfurnished building for months. This condition is undesirable, yet, the Department of Public Works again have notified your Branch to move into the Fort Good Hope School in a similar unfinished condition. The opening of these schools in an unfinished condition permits officers of the Department of Public Works to try to pass the blame to our Department for their own shortcomings. For instance, C. A. Walrath has reported that several flush bolts at the bottom of the accordion doors were broken; while at Fort Good Hope, I endeavoured to open one of the accordion doors and found that I had partly jammed one of the bolts as I had not been shown how to properly open these doors. In this connection, I can readily see how several bolts could be accidentally broken. However, while at Hay River, I examined the accordion doors and failed to see any damage to them.\nAs for the coat hooks, these should definitely be in the halls beside each classroom as classes can be dismissed in a more orderly fashion by this arrangement. The Yellowknife School Board have found it practical to move the coat hooks into the halls beside the various rooms. Besides, Magistrate Martin was using one of the coat rooms as an entrance to his living quarters thus necessitating its change. The only mistake is that authority should not have been obtained to move the coat hooks and the change should have been made by a carpenter. This matter will receive our immediate attention as this condition may be rectified by purchasing a few boards to act as a back-stop for the hooks.\n\nMr. Walrath speaks of mud being present on the ceiling of the main foyer. During my inspection, I asked Mr. Bowerman how the mud got on the ceiling. Mr. Bowerman was quite upset about the blotches of mud on the ceiling and informed me that he had noticed a fisherman enter the side door with very muddy feet. He asked him to clean the mud off his boots. The fisherman replied that he didn't have to take any orders from Mr. Bowerman as he was on his way up to see Magistrate Martin on business; the fisherman in question kicked his feet and thus the mud was scattered on the ceiling. Mr. Bowerman gave me the name of this gentleman but I did not take it down as a few minutes with some soap and water would remove all signs of the mud.\n\nAs for the other complaints mentioned in Mr. Walrath's report, I have already informed you of the apparent unsuitability of the present caretaker. I was amazed to find that he could not properly close a door. It may be his lack of care in closing the doors that caused the rubber-stopped door stops to be removed. I spoke to Mr. Bowerman about this at the time of my visit and when I next visited the school, I noticed that the doors were opened and closed properly.\n\nMr. Bowerman will likely argue that he was not made principal of the school, therefore it was not his responsibility to attend to the care of the entire school. I reported to your office the unsuitability of Mr. Kennedy and his inability to control his class. I feel that this has helped to produce this undesirable condition. However, I am of the opinion that neither Mr. Kennedy nor Mr. Bowerman are capable of handling the Hay River School. This school is too large for them and beyond their ability. It is for this reason that I have already suggested Mr. Bowerman's transfer to the Fort Franklin Indian Day School. Mr. Bowerman has done some fine welfare work among the Indians and would be more suitable in an Indian community. In fact, he has already written to you regarding this matter. I am not trying to pass the blame to others for anything which is within my field of responsibility but, at the same time, I do not think it is fair for the Department of Public Works to turn over their buildings to the Department in an unfinished condition and then write long memorandums containing petty complaints to cover up their mistakes.\nThe Officer in Charge of the R.C.O.S. at Fort Good Hope informed me that he had told Mr. Johnston that he could let us have 5 K.V.A. of electricity for our school. As Mr. Johnston wanted 15 K.V.A. for the school, the new generating plant was purchased. You will realize that when the Army Signals inform us that we may have 5 K.V.A. of electricity, they are making sure that they are on the safe side. Incidentally, at Fort Good Hope I learned from discussions with the Officer in Charge of the R.C.O.S. that there was in actuality a surplus of 10 K.V.A. that might be used by the school.\n\nWhen the 16 K.V.A. lighting plants were installed, I argued that they were too large for our schools. I was under the opinion that a 2\u00bd or 3 K.V.A. plant would meet our requirements and still feel that this would have been sufficient. However, I had nothing to do with the selection of these plants as I wasn't invited to attend the meeting when this matter was decided. However, I feel that the large lighting plants are the cause of most of the trouble as they require practically a specialist to attend to them and the cost of operation is excessive. I understand this matter will be settled in the spring when a central plant is installed at Hay River. If the Department of Public Works had installed a small plant along with the large unit, this condition would not prevail as the small plant could be used most of the time -- after school hours, at night, and so forth. This would have greatly reduced the costs of operation. However, this equipment will not go to waste as the large units at Hay River and Fort Good Hope might be moved to centres like Fort Rae and Fort McPherson where they would meet the requirements of a whole settlement. Should you decide to do this, I would suggest that you have the R.C.O.S., or some such group maintain this equipment in return for free light. This would relieve you of a large responsibility.\n\nThere are various matters I might report concerning the unfinished condition of schools but I shall leave this for my individual report on each school. Sufficient to report that all the woodwork at Roche River is not completed. Fort Good Hope is quite incomplete. In spite of the report made by W. J. Johnston that the Hay River Indian Day School is complete, I wish to report that some of the steps and most of the front entrance, which is covered in large glass brick windows, is in a very incomplete state. Apparently Mr. Johnston was unaware of this until I informed him of such at the time of his visit.\n\nIt is quite a contrast between the completely finished school at Fort Resolution and that of schools built by the Department of Public Works. The Department of National Defense did some very fine work at Fort Resolution. The floors were nicely sanded and left in first-class shape. The woodwork was completely varnished and left in good state. Walls were nicely coloured and, in general, the entire school building was a credit to the Army. In contrast, the Department of Public Works have done some very fine work but same is practically ruined by leaving their buildings in an incomplete state.\nI note that in the Manual of Instructions to Indian Agents, that they are held responsible for the care, upkeep and maintenance of school buildings. I have discussed this matter with Indian Agent Hunter and Indian Agent Kirkby and they are assuming this responsibility. At the first opportunity, I shall submit a letter to you covering this matter.\n\nI have written you this confidential letter in order that you will not have any undue concern regarding the Hay River Indian Day School. Both Indian Agent Kirkby and I will do everything possible to insure the proper care of property and equipment. At the same time, I wanted you to know that our main complaint is with caretaking service and the lack of ability of the caretaker to attend to such modern equipment as the electric light plant and the heating system. We shall endeavour to rectify this situation at the earliest date.\n\nI just wish that I could drop in for a chat. It would be an easy matter then to let you know just how slipshod some of the work by the Department of Public Works has been. The apartment where we are living is a perfect example of poor work. Upstairs porches have been set up in such a way that the rain pours into the basement and wets everything in the grocery cupboard below. Ration rooms have been installed in the basement in such a way that everything will freeze. The basement floor is rough and left in an unfinished state. Floors have been left unfinished and so forth. In view of this type of work, I resent the fact that the Department of Public Works have tried to pass the blame to the pupils by pointing out that mud has been thrown on the ceiling when in such event the pupils were not responsible. Naturally, the pupils are not perfect and we shall do everything to improve their behaviour and to retain the buildings and equipment in the very best state.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season and a very successful 1950, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W.

Porret.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI. F. Kirkby,\nSupt of Indian Agencies\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nResidence and School,\nHay River, N.W.T.\n\nWith reference to your marginal notation of the 16th February, on a letter from the Superintendent of Education of Indian Affairs dated the 14th February, in which complaint is made of the difficulty of heating the above buildings, may we comment as follows:\n\nUpon receipt of Mr. Neary's letter, instructions were sent to Mr. Bruce Douglas at Hay River to investigate and report by Army message. Mr. Douglas' reply was received on the 23rd February and he is quite definite that lack of adequate insulation is alone to blame.\n\nPlans prepared by this Service call for four inches of rock wool insulation on floors, walls and ceilings. Mr. Douglas states that wool batts were split into a thickness of one inch in some cases and no thickness of insulation exceeds two inches, while in the residence shiplap is laid parallel to the joists contrary to the plans and leaving open joints and no dead air space.\n\nThe school floor was designed as a 4 inch reinforced concrete slab, 2 inches of cinder concrete and 4 inches of rock wool with a double floor fastened to 2\" x 6\" battens, and the insulation value is equal to that of the exterior walls.\n\nThere is no doubt in our minds that the entire responsibility for the unsatisfactory nature of the heating of these buildings, is that of those who erected the structure, with equal blame attached to those whose duty it was to see that the materials and requirements called for on the plans, were followed.\n\nMr. Douglas states he is forwarding a written report and upon receipt of same you will be informed in more detail of conditions at this school and residence.\n\nWe do not feel that such statements as the one that a wood pile of the residence foundation and which is frozen solid in permafrost has settled some two or three inches, should be so casually made. It is a physical impossibility for the pile to settle, as it would crush and split under load and not settle. We believe the pile was cut short and the beam forced down and then nailed. If the beam has sprung, the obvious method to adjust is to nail an adequate shim between the pile beam.\nWith reference to a copy of a letter dated the 22nd February from Mr. R. Blais, Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works suggesting that the plans of this school be reviewed, our Architect and Structural Engineer have done so and found absolutely nothing wrong with the design. The leaks of which complaint is made are said to be along the base of the dwarf wall and some water is said to follow went pipes into the basement toilets which would seem to indicate lack of proper flashing.\n\nWe are at a loss to understand how a sag of 3 inches could occur at this part of the roof if the plans were followed. We would suggest an inspection of the ceiling under this portion of the roof, as a sag of 3 inches in the roof joists would surely be apparent at the ceiling. In any case instructions are being issued to our Mr. Douglas to have a portion of the ceiling removed which is directly below the 4\" x 12\" beam supporting the dwarf wall in order to determine the direction in which the roof joists were laid, and to clear up the possibility of any faulty construction.\n\nSalient points to amplify the foregoing will be extracted from the report to be furnished by Mr. Douglas and will be embodied in a letter drafted for your signature to the Chief Engineer, Department of Public Works.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief.\nMarch 6th, 1950.\n\nMr. I.F.

From these facts, it may be taken that the design of the roof was never at fault and is definitely adequate.\n\nIn more detail the report explains that a panel of the fibre board ceiling was removed directly under the 4\" x 12\" beam which supports the dwarf wall at the junction of the west and main roof and everything was found to be constructed in accordance with the plans. There was a small inequality of about 3/16 of an inch in the seam of the plaster board at the beam but it was neither serious nor unsightly. Water stains on the beam and joists indicated past leakage, but Mr. Douglas informs us that new copper flashing with soldered joints was placed at the roof and wall in the autumn of 1949 and should now be watertight. This would indicate that leakage was entirely due to faulty workmanship in placing flashing in the first instance.\n\nThe inspection should put at rest any reports indicating inadequacy of the roof design for this building. In future, any reports of a like nature on structures designed by this Service will be fully investigated at once but explanation should be requested from the source of such reports so much at variance with fact.\n\nA full report on the Hay River School is being prepared for your information.\n\nMajor MacKay\nFor your information.

W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education for the Mackenzie District, N.W.T., and a letter from Mr. W. A. Bowerman, Principal of the Hay River Indian Day School, concerning transportation of school children across the Hay River and from the West Channel to the school.\n\nWe should be pleased to have your comments concerning the suggestions contained in these letters relating to the transportation of children to and from school.\n\nWe might add, for your information, that the mouth of the Hay River is split by a large island which lies close to the southwest shore and opposite the Indian village. The channel between this island and Vale Island, on which the new town-site is located, is about 150 yards across and is open to wind and wave action from the main lake. This channel is never too rough for pontoon planes to land. However, any rough water can be avoided by travelling up water in the narrow channel near the Indian village and crossing some distance up river opposite the Game Warden's house. An ordinary skiff or 24 ft. freighter canoe would handle the school children safely.\nThe children on the West Channel belong to families of fishermen. The local Administrative District at Hay River is now incorporated, and is in the same situation as Yellowknife, where transportation of school children is provided at the expense of the local tax-payer. It is thought, therefore, that it is up to the Board of Trustees of the local Administrative District to provide the necessary transportation at Hay River for white children.\n\nEncls.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nBox 117,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\nFebruary 15, 1950.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 20, 1950, I requested a report from Mr. W. A. Bowerman, Principal, Hay River Indian Day School, concerning transportation of children across the Hay River and transportation from West Channel to the school. In that connection, I have attached herewith Mr. Bowerman's letter which is self-explanatory. As either Mr. Bowerman or the caretaker will assume responsibility for bringing the children across the Hay River, I see no reason for not purchasing a boat for this purpose as the Hay River is quite treacherous and several pupils have already nearly drowned.\n\nAs for the transportation of children from the West Channel area, I discussed this matter with Stipendiary Magistrate Martin and Mr. Bowerman. One solution suggested was that the Department purchase a station wagon for transportation purposes. We did not favour this method for the reasons of high cost of maintenance, need of daily care and so forth. The second method was that the people from West Channel contract with the local taxi firms to bring the children to school on the understanding that the Department will pay a certain portion of the cost. This second method seems the better as it appears that the local taxi firms would be responsible for injury caused by accident and so forth. Mr. Bowerman states that the cost would be approximately $1,000 per school year. This amounts to $35.00 per child. On this basis, I would recommend that the Department provide 50% of the cost of transportation up to a maximum of $500.00 on the understanding that the local people at West Channel, or fish companies, provide the balance.\n\nI see no reason for any parent not being able to pay $15.00 per child for transportation purposes, that is providing there are not more than two children of school age in the same family. Should this latter solution meet with your approval, I shall visit West Channel and endeavour to make such an arrangement with the local people. As the children at West Channel are \"Whites\" it appears that this item of expense is the responsibility of our Administration; whereas the matter of transportation across the Hay River is the responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthis matter concerns only Indians.\n\nI shall hold this matter in abeyance until I have your decision regarding the above items.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\nHay River, N.W.T.,\nFebruary 7, 1950.\n\nMr. J. W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nTransportation of children across the Hay River\n\nNumber of Treaty children attending school: 35\nNumber of Non-Treaty children from across the river attending school: 10\n\nThe Hay River is perhaps the most treacherous in the North. This is due to the fact that our prevailing wind piles huge waves into the river, and no small craft can cross. None of the Indians have a boat of sufficient size to cross every day. We almost had a triple drowning when school first began.\n\nI hired and personally paid an Indian fisherman to use his boat to take the children back and forth every day, to and from school. Even with a large freight canoe there has been three days that the children could not cross. This cuts down our attendance and retards their work at the school.\n\nWould it be possible to have our department obtain for the use of the school a boat of sufficient size to bring these children across? If such a craft was available either the caretaker or myself would see that the children were brought over. This seems to me to be the only solution to our problem of getting these children to school. The fact that I used my own money to pay for such service indicates whether I believe it is necessary or not.\n\nTransportation of children from the West Channel area\n\nChildren of the fishing village of West Channel are three miles removed from the school, there is an attendance of 20 pupils from this section.\n\nAt the present time we are hiring two taxis to bring these children to the school, and paying the cost by means of dances, box socials, etc.,\n\nI would recommend that the department either purchase a station wagon for use of the school, or as an alternate assume the cost of taxi service, which would be approximately $1000.00 a year.\n\nBoth of these problems are of utmost importance to the school if we are to maintain our attendance standing and continue to have the pupils in regular attendance. For your attention, Sir, and necessary action.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(signed) W. A. Bowerman.\n\nW.A.

I would like to point out that this pile did settle and that it would have been a physical impossibility for any gang to have forced an 8\" X 12\" beam down to the top of the pile. The piles were sunk in permafrost and then before they were fully frozen back in, the beams were put on with the result that some piles were not to the bottom of the hole and did settle pulling away from the beam. In all the schools built on piles we can expect to have to do a certain amount of shimming and possibly jacking up for the entire life of the structure. As piles will conduct heat there is always the possibility of the permafrost thawing just enough around the pile to allow it to move during the summer when the water level in the area drops.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

B. F. Nerry, from I. F. Kirkby, Supt., Fort Resolution Agency, dated March 16th, 1950.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find requisitions for school supplies from the three Indian Day Schools in this Agency. These supplies cover maintenance, caretaker, hygiene and recreational needs at the various points.\n\nThese supplies are for the normal operation of the schools and the requisitions are to be added to the ones that I had attached to my 1950-51 estimates as submitted last fall. These requisitions are not intended as extra but are to cover items that were estimated for but not requisitioned for at the time. Fuel oil for light and heat, wood for fuel and supplies for noon lunches were requisitioned for at the time the estimates were submitted.\n\nIn the case of fuel oil for Kocher River and Ft. Rae I would like to point out that I requested that this be purchased at Yellowknife and re-shipped from here in preference to having it brought in from Waterways. If purchased at Waterways we must pay approx. 20\u00a2 per gallon, pay freight of approx. 23\u00a2 per gallon to Ft. Rae and pay approx. 6\u00a2 per gallon on return of empty drum to Waterways so that we pay 49\u00a2 per gallon for fuel oil that could be purchased at Yellowknife for 27\u00a2 plus the freight from here to Ft. Rae which should not be more than 8 to 10\u00a2 per gallon. This applies to all pointes on Slave Lake and on last years shipment alone a saving of at least $400.00 could have been made if oil had been purchased at Yellowknife.\n\n(Sgd) I. F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nCONFIRMATION:\nPHONED TO: WB\nPHONED BY: ST\nTIME: 2:10 PM\n\nCOPY 2\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nFour Classroom Day School,\nHay River, N.W.T.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum dated the 6th March, respecting the unsatisfactory conditions at the above school, it is considered that faulty workmanship, lack of supervision and a complete disregard of insulation details as shown on our drawings, are to blame.\n\nAt the outset, the Indian Affairs Branch obtained authority from Council to award a contract for construction of the building to Peter Mattson, whom they understood to be the best qualified person in the area at that time. Considerable concern was felt when it was established that Mr. Mattson would be unable to finance his operations as a contractor, and arrangements were made to restrict his status to that of general foreman; responsibility for organization and supervisory control being assigned to the Department of Public Works. Mr. Mattson's documentary status as contractor nevertheless was never rescinded.\n\nRespecting Mr. Mattson, we quote from a report dated the 22nd November, 1947, from Mr. G.R. Barnes who as an Assistant Engineer, with this Service, supervised the preliminary work. Mr. Barnes said \"Mr. Mattson seems to be a competent and conscientious workman, but, as a contractor, will require considerable assistance from the Department in arranging for materials and getting things organized.\"\n\nResponsibility for faults now evident in the construction of this building lies with those charged with supervision who permitted inefficient workmanship and inexcusable practices to be made use of, on a structure that was simple and straightforward.\n\nOur memorandum dated the 26th February, based on a report from Mr. Bruce Douglas regarding the inadequate insulation, and a further memorandum dated the 7th March based on a later report from Mr. Douglas regarding leakage in the west roof, indicated that all faults are due to the aforementioned causes, and there is no fault in the design.\n\nWhen this school was proposed, considerable research was made into soil and sub-soil conditions. Borings were taken and samples of soil from the site were carefully examined by our structural engineer. It was obvious that the building should be erected without a basement and several designs were investigated which would combine in a compact unit such services as\nheating and electrical supply, suitable access, exits, fenestration and adequate insulation. The design decided upon was approved by Indian Affairs and considered so acceptable that a similar design of school was chosen for Fort Smith.\n\nWe do not know what more can be said than has been presented to you in this and our previous memoranda. The responsibility for leakage of the west roof has been cleared up, and roof repaired and there is no sag in the roof joists. The skimping of insulation material has been proven and the responsibility is not that of this Service.\n\nThe remedy suggested by Mr. Douglas for implementing insulation, namely by blowing in loose material is widely used, but is not what should be employed in a new building.\n\nThe vapour barrier and reinforcement against settlement provided by the treated paper backing on rockwool batts is taken into consideration when calculating heat losses.\n\nNevertheless without practically taking the whole interior finish apart and taking up the floors at a prohibitive cost, nothing better can be suggested.\n\nThe residence is a simple problem and easily rectified by removing present sheathing below the ground floor joists and placing four inches of insulation and masonite base as shown on plans. Wood shutters to close in the space under both buildings, are called for on the plans.\n\nThe deplorable situations being created at Hay River and other points in the North through an apparent lack of interest combined with inefficient construction supervision, and job organization, should not be allowed to recur, and it is felt that only by our own supervision of construction can repetitions be prevented.\n\nChief.\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\nMarch 24th, 1950.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Hay River School Floors\n\nI have just returned from a trip into Hay River and I can report that the building is in much better condition than on any previous trip. The floors have been much improved and will be scrubbed and waxed and varnished during Easter holidays.\n\nI ordered a quantity of varnish and painting supplies on February 22nd, and to date have not received any notification that this has been ordered or shipped. As Easter holidays start two weeks from today I feel we should have a rush order on this varnish. Easter is our only chance to varnish until next summer and with the mud of Hay River to contend with during the break-up I feel we must varnish the halls and stairs now.\n\nPlease advise whether we can expect this varnish in order that we may make the necessary arrangements for the janitor to do this maintenance work during the holidays.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.P. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nHay River Indian Day School\n\nTo complete our memorandum of the 7th February, we now have a report that there is some vibration from the electric generator set. It is also reported that the generator is set directly on the concrete base.\n\nThis generator is in a separate building and is mounted on a concrete floor having a dead weight of more than thirty five tons. Under the circumstances, any vibration transmitted to the adjacent, but separate, principal's residence should be negligible if the generator is running properly. If the usual cushioning material is introduced into the mounting, the vibration will be reduced.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your wire of April 29th, 1950 in which you request the additional information regarding the warehouse to be used at the Hay River School I wish to report the following.\n\nThe enclosed sketch will indicate the Hay River school yard and the various buildings that are now on the lot or will be put up there. The warehouse has not been built but as an old one now exists I have been informed by Mr. Johnston that the D.P.W. are to remove the old warehouse; which is right beside the school and was only a store shed; and will be putting up a new warehouse for the school in the position indicated on the sketch. This building to be put up this summer and as far as I can gather is a part of D.P.W. program necessary to complete the school. I know nothing about Mr. Johnston's instructions but the building is to be put up.\n\nThe plan calls for a building 24' x 36' to be partitioned into three sections as indicated and it was the large section that I requested we be allowed to use this coming winter as a fish store house and weigh room. The building will not be used after the winter season for fish and will be completely cleaned so that no fish waste will be left to decay in the building.\n\nWe will be handling only frozen fish during the winter and have no intention of handling fish at other seasons of the year at any point. As it is an experiment to try and get more revenue to the Indian and at the same time give more Indians a share in this revenue it was my desire to use this building for one season to see if it was profitable and whether the Indians\ncan be depended upon to deliver fish and do the majority of the running of the operation themselves. If it proves out I would then propose to put up a small winter packing house of our own where it would be well away from the school, but one hesitates to put up such a building before the Indians have shown their willingness to make the venture a success. As pointed out this is only a one winter arrangement.\n\nI would expect the Welfare teacher to take enough interest in the project to keep track of what is going on and to be able to advise the Indian as to what to do and to prod them along when ever need be. He would also have to do the actual money transactions but nothing else. I do not think we are asking too much of the teacher seeing that he is a Welfare teacher paid more than Indian Superintendents; to help the Indian out by giving advice and instruction. The present teacher Mr. Bowerman has done this but many might not want to. All weighing of fish, boxing of fish, loading on trucks and everything including all cleaning up will be done by the Indian but actual supervision must be done by the Welfare Teacher.\n\nThe Indian is, by our standards at least, lazy and if no one is handy to prod him every so often then he does nothing. It is for this reason that I wish to have the first years work done near the school so that the teacher can give it the once over every so often. Again I am sure that the Indian would be only too glad to see the Teacher do all the work while they sat around but this is not to be the case and every single bit of manual labor is to be done by the Indian.\n\nI would like to say in closing that the success that was attained last winter in the fishing can be attributed, in no small way, to Mr Bowerman's after school efforts in working for the good of the Indians of Hay River.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.F.

Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nMajor D. MacKey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\nExtracts from the Minutes of the twenty-eighth Meeting of the Local Board of Trustees of the Hay River Administrative District, held on May 9, 1950.\n\nLetter read from Mr. W.G. Brown written on April 29th enclosing copy of letter written by Mr. R.A. Gibson on April 1st, re the Indian Day School in Hay River. It appears to have been suggested that the District take over the Indian Day School. The Board does not wish to have anything to do with the Indian School until various improvements have been made to the school. The insulation is very poor; as an example, the lower floor in winter is freezing while the upper floor is roasting. The residence is in poor condition and is not habitable in the winter time; a case was presented by Trustee Osborne whereby a Christmas tree was brought into the house with a large lump of snow on it and after having the tree in the house for two weeks the lump of snow was still on the tree. Also, the school appears to be run by the children rather than by the teachers; the teachers do not exercise discipline and the parents are objecting to the teachers and their methods of teaching the children. The grounds are in very poor condition; there has been no attempt to landscape them nor plant grass. They have not been levelled. In the spring or whenever it rains, the grounds become a sea of mud which is tracked into the school by the children. Trustee Osborne did not feel that there would be enough taxes in the District to finance the upkeep of the school, the expenses are too great, for example, since the opening of the schools, 7 months ago, there has been $5,000.00 worth of fuel oil used therein. Janitor and teacher expenses also discussed. Council feels that there is only one teacher at present in the school that is worth keeping. Feel they could hire three local teachers and with the one present good teacher, would have a satisfactory staff with more discipline and education taught. Trustee Osborne felt the government should take over the expense but the Council could form a school board and take over the management of the school. The Board members will agree to gather material to present to the Board of Inquiry when it visits Hay River.\nMr. Doucette at Hay River\n\nPlease note that the amount of $3000 has already been transferred to Office of Public Works for renovation to building above.\n\nJune 7/50\nJune 12th, 1950.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Hay River Indian Day School\n\nThe Northwest Territories Administration has forwarded to us a copy of an extract from the Minutes of the twenty-eighth meeting of the Local Board of Trustees of the Hay River Administrative District, held on May 9th, 1950.\n\nWith regard to the Hay River Indian Day School, the Minutes read in part as follows:\n\n\"The insulation is very poor; as an example the lower floor in winter is freezing while the upper floor is roasting.

Marshall of our Engineering and Construction Service has been inspecting our buildings in the Mackenzie District, and in a report dated the 30th of June 1950, he included the following remarks on the Hay River school:\n\n\"Together Mr. Martin and I visited the Hay River four-roomed school. Insulation has not yet been placed. I was informed that it will be started as soon as school is closed. I will be giving a full detailed report later on this school, but I must state now that I noticed some unfinished painting and some unfinished electrical connections. One point that I do not recall mentioned in the files is that both sets of double doors have an open space of at least one-quarter inch when closed. It is a wonder to me how anyone could ever stay in this school in the winter. All entrances need porches.\"\n\nThe above is submitted for your information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Kiekby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sirs:\n\nDuring October of last year we experienced much difficulty with the Roche River Light plant and eventually the post of one cell was burned off. This cell was still good but we had no way of replacing it and when I contacted Dept. of Public Works for a replacement you advised them that the plant would work without the 31 cell and that one would be shipped this summer by water transportation to replace the burned one.\n\nAs the cost of transportation by air was very high I kept the old cell here and it was sent out to you by N.T.C.L. a few days ago and should reach you in due course. Will you kindly send in a new cell as indicated in your letters to Mr. W.J. Johnston of D.F.C. last fall. The burning off of the battery post was due to negligence and faulty installation by the party who set up the plant and is not the fault of operation by any of our staff. The plant is now operating very satisfactory and I would like to install the new cell before another winter season to insure the best results possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.T. Kirby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies,\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 19th regarding repairs to the F.E. model 640 diesel light plant I wish to advise that this plant is in need of an overhaul and I have requested that I be given authority to ship the whole plant out for repairs. With this in mind will you kindly hold the new voltage regulator until I advise you as to whether the plant is to be returned to you for overhaul or whether it will be done locally in Hay River.\n\nThe report I received on the regulator was that the large circular cover that encloses the generator itself and also the voltage regulator became loose and shook onto the regulator shorting the entire regulator and causing it to burn out. On examining the cover it had large burned areas where it had been shorted and it is presumed that this is the reason for the break.\n\nThe Dept. of Public Works advise me that they had been in touch with your office and that new voltmeters and ammeters were to be supplied to replace the originals which did not give service. Will you kindly look into this and if the plant is shipped out replace the old ones or send us new meters when the regulator is returned if I have to do the overhaul locally.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.F.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring a recent visit into Hay River the power plant was inspected and it was found that the voltage regulator had been burned out. This was sent to Edmonton for repairs and the establishment is without any power at all. This being the summer holiday season no great difficulty is being felt.\n\nThe Hay River school light plant has been a very expensive piece of equipment and much time spent in repairs. The plant has run a full year or more without any overhaul and as it must run 24 hours every day it is now in need of a full overhaul to put in shape for next winter. There is a diesel man in Hay River who can do a thorough repair job but I feel that we should send the plant to Fairbanks Morse, Edmonton and get a good job done while at it.\n\nThe plant at Hay River is A.C. and as such must run no matter what power is needed so that we are often running with as little as one K.W. being needed and running at such a small load has resulted in the plant running away with itself and we get excessive wear. I cannot too strongly recommend that we provide a 1500 Watt standby plant at this point to be used at night when the power requirements are small and to provide for heat if a breakdown occurs.\n\nThe Hay River plant being a diesel has some vibration and in its present set up has been mounted on a floor that is supported at the corners only and acts like a diaphragm so that the entire plant, plant house and residence vibrate all the time. With the addition of a three room warehouse just back of the school I feel that the light plant, when it returns from being\noverhauled should be set in one room of the warehouse on a block of concrete to prevent the vibration of the entire residence and also to increase the life of the engine. The cost of this change will be negligible and will make for better operation all round.\n\nI have discussed these points with Mr. Ducett on his recent trip into Hay River and believe he can give you a very clear picture of the Hay River needs.\n\nIn view of the above I would request authority to take the plant out and have it sent to Edmonton by truck. I would feel that a better job can be expected there than at Hay River, and we will be money ahead in the long run.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Hay River light plant has been sent to Fairbanks Morse Edmonton for a good overhaul and will be out until the end of August. I have experienced so much trouble with power units at the schools during the past that I felt it would not be advisable to allow local so called mechanics to operate or work on the machine. The teacher is partly to blame in most cases by not showing much initiative or sense of responsibility.\n\nThese light plants are large complicated machines and with the AC outfit they must run 24 hours per day during cold weather and if they fail no power whatsoever is available to keep the place from freezing up. I cannot see why we are saddled with one large cumbersome plant about twice as large as we need for all but about one or two special occasions and no standbys. Each and every school would have been much easier to operate and much less bother if they had two small plants of possibly 3 KW and we would then always have a standby and the cost of both would have been no more than the one large one we now have. At these out-of-the-way places there are no mechanics and when the plant stops some of the hay wire teachers go at them with a screwdriver and we end up with a big repair bill. In most cases we cannot blame the teacher because to not get the plant going would result in everything freezing up but it does make maintenance a very difficult problem.\n\nAt Hay River we will be doing away with the light plant next summer but in the mean time we should have a small standby of possibly 3 KW. This is the only AC school in my Agency but I know that Mr. Hunter has several in his Agency (Franklin is best example) where a standby is a must. Can we not purchase\na small 3 KW or such like for Hay River with the understanding that it go to what-ever school Mr. Hunter requires it at next year when we hook onto Hay River power. The older these plants get the more grief we will get and with such large units one must get expert mechanics to run them and we do not have these in many points. The A.C. plant must run 24 hours a day and it is only reasonable that they will give out so that a standby is not a unnecessary piece of equipment but a must.

Since this estimate was prepared, additional work has been proposed on this structure for which no funds have been provided, and I now forward an estimate to cover the cost of this additional work amounting to $2,270.00.\n\nThe additional work arises from the experience of last winter and the difficulty of heating, both the 4-classroom school and the teacherage and instructions were then issued that corrective measures must be taken. The corrections suggested are the construction of porches on the north and south entrances in the school, the closing in of the open underfloor to the ground by building a form and packing this with sawdust to effectively close off and insulate the air space under the school and prevent the circulation of air under the concrete slab. It is believed that this construction will eliminate the heat loss that is occurring through this floor, under the present construction. Similar action is required to protect the floors of the teacherage. Detailed estimates are:\n\nPorches - Materials:\n(School) Labour:\n4 men 10 days @ $18.00 720.00\nFreight: 50.00\nTotal - $1,120.00\n\nInsulation: under teacherage\nMaterials\n40 bales insulation 123.20\n3 rolls heavy paper 15.90\nLabour:\ntearing off, 3 men 2 days 108.00\nreplacing 216.00\nfreight 20.00\nTotal - $463.10\n\nInsulation under school\nSawdust, 90 cu. yd. $125.00\nLumber, 1000 2x4 130.00\n1000 shiplap 130.00\nPaper, 5 rolls 26.50\nNails, 1 keg 15.00\nLabour - 10 man days $180.00\nIncidentals 23.50\nTotal - $500.00\n\nTeacherage:\nTotal - $650.00\n\nTOTALS: Porches $1,120.00\nTeacherage 500.00\nSawdust insulation 850.00\nTOTAL---------- $2,270.00\nMaterials must be purchased if this work is to be carried out and I ask that this office be advised by wire when approval is granted on this request as nothing further can be done on the school until further funds are made available. The funds allotted on the regular estimate are sufficient to carry out our original plan of work but will not cover any of the items listed above.\n\n(SGD) J.E. Kallett\ns/District Engineer\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, CANADA\n\nDIRECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\nDEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of letter dated August 17th from Acting District Engineer J.E. Kellett, Edmonton, concerning the four class-room school and Teacherage at Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nMr. Kellett's letter points out the need of additional work to correct difficulties of heating both the school building and the Teacherage, and estimates that this work will involve an additional expenditure of $2,270. You will note by the 2nd paragraph of his letter that he intends to close in the open underfloor to the ground by building a form and packing this with sawdust to close off and insulate the space under the school and teacherage. We think that this would be a good idea but feel that some adjustable ventilation should be provided. However, the provision of sufficient vents would not materially alter the estimated cost as given by Mr. Kellett.\n\nAs materials must be ordered and shipped in to Hay River, if it is decided to carry out this work, I would like to have your comments and further instructions at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD) Robert Bleis\nCHIEF ENGINEER\nOttawa, August 23, 1950.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of a letter, dated the 21st of August, 1950, from Mr. R.

Kellett, Edmonton, to Mr. Blais, concerning alterations to the Hay River day school. As this school is operated by your Branch, I am forwarding this correspondence for whatever action you may deem necessary.\n\nThe Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department has been advised that copies of both letters are being referred to you for attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached herewith please find a letter from J.E. Kellett of the Dept. of Public Works, Edmonton, in which he outlines the proposed work to be carried out to repair the lack of insulation in the school and residence floors at Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nThis work is a must before this coming winter and the school residence must come first as it is much worse than the school, as people must live in it all the time where the school is not used except during the day. Both these buildings should be repaired to save on fuel alone.\n\nNo mention is made of the furnace at the school but this requires a new combustion chamber and the cost of this plus the installation should not be over $50. or $60. This should make it more economical to burn fuel and have better heating with less smoke and dirt.\n\nMr. Kellett has asked for the materials to complete the job but his letter is self explanatory and is the complete information as to school insulation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nFunds in the amount of $3000.00 have been allotted for the completion of the Classroom School and Teachersage at Hay River, N.W.T. Since this estimate was prepared, additional work has been proposed on this structure for which no funds have been provided, and I now forward an estimate to cover the cost of this additional work amounting to $2270.00.\n\nThe additional work arises from the experience of last winter and the difficulty of heating, both the Classroom School and the Teachersage and instructions were then issued that corrective measures must be taken. The corrections suggested are the construction of porches on the north and south entrances in the school, the closing in of the open underfloor to the ground by building a form and packing this with sawdust to effectively close off and insulate the air space under the school and prevent the circulation of air under the concrete slab. It is believed that this construction will eliminate the heat loss that is occurring through this floor under the present construction. Similar action is required to protect the floors of the teachersage. Detailed estimates are:\n\nPorches - Materials: $350.00\n(School) Labor:\n4 men 10 days @ $18.00 720.00\nFreight 50.00\nTotal: $1120.00\n\nInsulation: Under Teachersage -\nMaterials:\n40 bales insulation 123.20\n3 rolls heavy paper 15.90\nLabor:\nTearing off 3 men, 2 days 108.00\nReplacing 216.00\nFreight 20.00\nTotal: $343.10\n\nSay - 500.00\n\nInsulation under school -\nSawdust - 90 cu. yd. 125.00\nLumber - 100 2x4, 1000 Shiplap 130.00\nPaper - 5 rolls 26.50\nNails - 1 keg 15.00\nLabour - 10 man days 180.00\nIncidentals 23.50\nTotal: $500.00\n\nTeachersage:\nTotal: $150.00\n\nTotal: $650.00\nMr I F Kirby\nIndian Superintendent\nYellowknife Northwest Territories\n\nHE INSULATION NAY RIVER SCHOOL YOUR LETTER\nAUGUST THIRTY -stop- D P W AUTHORIZED MAKE EXPENDITURE\nOUTLINED KELLETT'S LETTER -stop- MAKE LOCAL REPAIRS COMBUSTION\nCHAMBER COST SIXTY DOLLARS - ADVISE TEACHERS -\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F Henry\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nTelephoned to: .......\n\" by: ...........\nTime: ..........\n\nBFN/EM\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE | DEGREE OF PRIORITY | TIME OF ORIGIN\n--------- | ------------------ | ---------------\n\nSIGNED\n\nCOPY 3\nSeptember 18, 1950.\n\nMr. R.

Mr. R.A. Campbell asked me particularly to look at the centre piling under the principal's residence. It was reported that the centre pile had dropped. These are the facts: There are seven pilings that have been shimmed. Piling Nos. 7 and 12 were first noticed and shimmed last September by Bauerma. He did not notice any other piling to have dropped then or he would have shimmed them. The remainder were shimmed this spring, including No. 3.\n\n6. The only comment I would make would be to recall to your attention that owing to the lack of proper insulation in this structure, and particularly under the floor, this dwelling was treated just the opposite to that for which it was designed and specified. Instead of having it left open below the floor, in order to keep from freezing Mr. Bauerma banked the walls and opened the furnace wide. How much the thermal regime under this house was disturbed could be a matter of eternal controversy.\"\n\nI also enclosed a sketch showing the numbers given these pilings and the extent of shimming placed under each. A copy of this sketch is attached hereto.\n\n3. From the files I.A. 1356-9 and Mr. W. Campbell's plan 62-17A it would appear:\n\nOriginal boring for permafrost was done prior to July 30th, 1947 (date of Mr. Campbell's log).\n\nIt is difficult to determine from file I.A. 1356-9 just when the placing of piling was done, but wood lath and other building supplies had been ordered and delivered prior to June, 1948.\n\nA contract agreement was signed with Peter Mattson dated March 10, 1948, and final Claim statement was presented under date of April 1st, 1949.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the pilings were jetted down and placed about or before the spring of 1948.\n\n4. Be that as it may seem, it is abundantly apparent that the teacherage pilings have sunk at 7 points in both greater and less degree. The question is - \"what causes these to sink?\" The fact that they did sink can only be explained by reasoning that there was no permafrost gripping those that sank. This could be possible if:\n\n(a) there was no permafrost at those points originally;\n\n(b) in jetting down with steam, the permafrost table and the thermal regime was altered and never recovered.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(c) the permafrost table was altered by other causes.\n\n5. In considering (a) we have one bore hole put down by Mr. Campbell in 1947 as a guide. This was sunk on which is now the south wall of the teacherage proper. This (#9) encountered permafrost at 8 feet. Sixty feet south east another hole (#13) encountered permafrost at 10.5 feet. Directly east and 100 feet from Hole No. 9 permafrost was encountered at 8 feet in Hole No. 8. This hole was checked by the writer. Hole No. 10 at 75 feet due south of Hole No. 9 gave permafrost at 14 feet.\n\n6. All these holes would convey the idea that the permafrost table was constant over 75 to 100 feet, but we cannot be certain about the permafrost table between these distances. A great deal can happen in 100 or less feet in the Hay River area. Consider Hole No. 1 with permafrost (Mr. Campbell's log) at 11 feet while Hole No. 2, 75 feet south had no permafrost at 20 feet of depth. The writer checked this hole and got no permafrost at 25 feet of depth.\n\n7. Turning to (b) and reviewing Mr. Campbell's log we find that one foot of moss and peaty loam was encountered at the surface. The removal of this would in itself tend to disturb the permafrost level to some extent, but its effect at 8 feet of depth would not be great; however, it would have some effect on the rate of restoration of the permafrost table and thermal regime after thawing. A far greater effect would occur during the steam jetting of holes, particularly if the jet was left in any hole or at any point longer than was necessary. There is no information to guide an opinion on this. Nor do we know anything concerning the time and manner in which the permafrost table and thermal regime would recover and regain former horizons. In general terms we know that recovery would depend upon:\n\n(1) the structure and texture of the ground both above and below the thawing limit in depth;\n(2) the thickness of this underlying permafrost and the behaviour of the ground above it;\n(3) the temperature regime of the ground;\n(4) the hydrologic regime of the ground.\n\n8. We know also that in some areas, notably around Yellowknife, recovery of the thermal regime and permafrost table is, at the greatest time, only a matter of a few days but the texture, type of ground, and other characteristics at Yellowknife are much different from Hay River.\n\n9. Considering (c) and (d), the hydrologic regime of the ground, we have one interesting fact. Mr. Campbell's Hole No. 1 struck permafrost at 11 feet with water at 8 feet. The writer's check on this hole gave a very wet layer at 10.5 feet. Ground below this caved badly and had to be abandoned at 16 feet with no permafrost encountered. This shows that the permafrost table had changed at least at one point. Mr. Campbell's Hole No. 2 has already been mentioned. The writer's check substantiated this boring and also that the hole was wet. Mr. Campbell's Hole No. 10 (75 feet south of No. 9) showed a wet layer at 11 feet being 3 feet above permafrost. One hole bored near the West Channel gave a wet layer within permafrost. This horizon was slightly above the water level of the West Channel. All of which would indicate that this ground at Hay River has water layers...\nthrough it at various horizons. When one considers that the river rises as high as 10 or 11 feet above the water level at the time of boring there is ample opportunity for these water horizons to become real water channels with a complete change in the hydrologic regime. The fact that pilings 2, 3, 6, 8 and 11 were not noticed to have sunk until this spring supports very strongly this belief that an alteration in the hydrologic regime had a marked affect.\n\n10. The writer tends to the belief that all (a) (b) and (c) contributed to the sinking. In other words it is possible that the permafrost table even fairly close to Hole No. 9 was not at the horizon that hole indicated; that the thawing completely upset the thermal regime and recovery did not take place in the degree necessary to hold the piling. Finally, this thawing had formed a \"slud\" which permitted entrance to a water horizon which in the spring became a channel.\n\nI. M.

MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am sending you herewith two copies of a report made by Mr. I. M. Marshall of the Engineering and Construction Service covering his inspection of the Principal's Residence at the Hay River school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nHay River Light Plant Operation.\n\nWith reference to your wire of September 1st, I wish to advise that I have taken this matter of plant maintenance up while in Hay River and the services of one good reliable plant operator to service this plant once every week and who will be available at any time to go and check on the plant if it fails has been obtained. This man will be entirely responsible for the plant and no one will be allowed to put a wrench on it.\n\nThis man has offered to do this for the sum of $30.00 per month. The plant will be fuelled up every day by the janitor and will be kept clean and attended by him but he will not be allowed to make any alterations but will report all faults he sees to the mechanic.\n\nThe only terms on which this mechanic would consider the plant was if it were entirely his responsibility in so far as any repairs or adjustment went and he will also set it in operation when it arrives back from Edmonton. I believe this a good arrangement and one that should save us money and breakdowns in the long run. I also consider the wages asked by him to be reasonable even though this work will be done in his after hours spare time.\n\nI trust that the above will meet with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir;\n\nThe Hay River School teacherage was gone over with a carpenter and will be divided into two apartments with a kitchen, combined living room and dining room and a bedroom each. There is very little way to provide two bathrooms so it will be necessary for the two couples to use the one bathroom.\n\nThe work is to be started next week and should be done within two weeks or less from that. This will include the building of a kitchen cupboard and putting in a sink, this to be painted and all other new wood work varnished. As it was a necessity to have the kitchen cupboard put in and I did not have time to wire for authority to purchase plywood for the job while at Hay River I instructed the carpenter to purchase the materials needed and the labour for this work will come out of the advance being sent to me.\n\nAs it is impossible to put in an oil or wood stove as we have no second chimney it is necessary to provide an electric range and put in a stove outlet. An Edmonton electrician, who is doing Government work on contract has enough material and time to put this in. As all the insulation is out of the floor this is the only time to put it in and this will be carried out.\n\nI believe that the arrangement of two apartments should be satisfactory and although the building does not lend itself to making two perfect apartments the present arrangement is the best possible without building another house.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.F.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past few days I have been in Hay River and several visits were paid to the school. The new term has been going for one and a half weeks and I wish to advise that the school both from the point of cleanliness and also discipline has improved many times over last year.\n\nIt was a pleasure to go through the school, the floors were clean and shiny and all rooms were free from dirt and paper. The present janitor has made a wonderful job and though he is not a mechanic who could run the light plant, has done a better job than anyone we have had so far and will be of much more value to the school than any other man in Hay River.\n\nThe class rooms were clean, desks were clean, the children had made a thorough clean-up for the week end and at the end of the day each room marched out instead of a mad scramble as last year. I am very pleased with the appearance of the new teacher and can only say that I wish the rest of our teachers at the other schools were half as good. Hay River, has, I believe, become a credit to the district and to Indian Affairs. If the DPW would complete their work and hand over the completed job and leave the maintenance to us the entire school set-up would be much easier to administer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) I.F.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Hay River Indian Day School, Hay River, N.W.T.\n\nOn June 19th and 20th, I inspected the Hay River Indian Day School and report as follows:\n\n1. The school opened officially on February 28, 1949.\n\n2. Buildings\n\nThe school is a very fine building, but it is not complete. The grounds around the school are very swampy and should be filled in in some places and levelled off in others. As Mr. W. J. Johnson, D.P.W., had told us that the school would be ready by the end of February, we moved in. This was a sad mistake as there was no heat, light or water in the building and the children had to remain in school during the months of March, April and May with their parkas on to keep warm.\n\nThe teachers' residence is also incomplete. There is no light, heat or water and there is insufficient furniture. As a result of the lack of these facilities, Mr. Bellevance, Superintendent Martin and the pupils have suffered a great deal from the cold. This made a very poor beginning for the school and has hindered its progress.\n\nA 10 kilowatt generator is being installed. As it will cost about $100 per month to operate the machine, I discussed this matter with Superintendent Martin who told me that he would have no difficulty in getting some of the local families to connect with the supply and thus reduce the overhead cost.\n\n3. Attendance\n\nWhen the school opened in February, there were 51 pupils in attendance; 21 Indian children, 30 Whites and Half-Breeds. At the time of my visit, there were 30 pupils present, consisting of 19 boys and 11 girls. I found that this attendance of 30 had been approximately 100% from the commencement of school with the exception of the period from April 27th to May 9th when the river was breaking up and it was impossible for them to get across. The group that were there consisted only of Whites and Half-Breeds.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI questioned the fact that no Indians were present. Mr. Bellevance told me that he had found it necessary to scold the Indian children and to use corporal punishment. As a result, the Indian children refused to attend. Again, one of the Indian girls had been reprimanded for chewing gum and thus replied, \"No gum, no school!\" The Indian children went home about the beginning of March and did not return.\n\nIn this regard, I asked Mr. Bellevance if he had visited any of the Indian homes or discussed the matter with the parents. He admitted that he had not visited any of the homes nor done anything to bring them back. He said that the Indians should be in a separate school by themselves. In a discussion shortly following this, the local Priest brought forth the same view that he thought that the Indian children should be in a separate school on the island and that the new school should be used for Whites and Half-Breeds.\n\nDuring the conversation with the Priest, he informed me that there were some 25 children of school age in the area but they were out in the bush. When I questioned him more closely, he admitted that they were on the island all the time.\n\nMr. Todd, a local resident, visited the school towards the beginning of March and asked the Principal to take his sixteen-year-old boy into Grade VIII. Mr. Bellevance told him that he did not have to enroll anyone over sixteen years of age. Shortly after Mr. Bellevance told me this, the local Priest informed me that the Principal of the school did not have to take anyone into school sixteen years of age or over. I informed him that his statement was incorrect as anyone, immaterial of age, may attend school and that it is compulsory for Indian children to attend up to and including the age of sixteen years.\n\nI am inclined to believe that both the local Priest and Mr. Bellevance have done nothing to assure regular attendance and, if anything, have tried to drive the children out.\n\nIn order to assure proper attendance, I would recommend that compulsory attendance be enforced for children up to the age of sixteen years, as laid down by the Indian Act, and that this compulsory attendance commence September 1, 1949. I understand that an Indian Agent is being appointed to the Hay River area and, if this is correct, he could quite easily attend to this as one of his duties, or, if this is not the case, a Truant Officer should be appointed to visit the homes of delinquents and strictly enforce compulsory attendance measures. If it is our wish to keep the Hay River School operating on a proper basis similar to the provinces, compulsory attendance must be enforced at the earliest possible date.\n\n4. Classroom Work.\n\nOn examination of the children in their studies, I found them to be intelligent, clean and co-operative. The age range is from seven to fourteen years. I found that the children in Grade I had not been taught reading\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-6, part 1)\nand that Mr. Bellevance had been emphasizing phonetics, which is a most unprogressive method of teaching. He also had the Grade I pupils attempting to write without first having taught them to print, which method has been found the most satisfactory. He had not taken the trouble to wire Ottawa for Grade I readers nor had he bothered to borrow Grade I readers from the residents who had Grade I readers in their possession, so the Grade I lacked this equipment. You will agree that it must have been a very difficult task for the pupils in Grade I to sit for three months without any reading industry and proper supervision.\n\nAt the time of the visit, he told me that he had requested that Grades I, II and III stay home the following day as he was going to give Grades IV, V and VI a test.\n\nMr. Bellevance had no text books for Grade I and had made out no requisitions for books or supplies to be sent in.\n\nThere has been no hot noon lunch served at all.\n\nThe Priest gave religious instruction in the school from 3:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day.\n\nThere was a holiday on June 13th although the reason for such a holiday is not clear.\n\n5. Sports and Community Life\n\nMr. Bellevance has organized no sports in the school and the school has not been used as a Community Centre. In conversation with both Roman Catholic and Protestant residents at Hay River, I was informed that Mr. Bellevance had not visited their homes nor taken any interest in the Community. When questioned, Mr. Bellevance admitted that he liked living to himself and did not trouble to visit anyone. He said that he did not like Hay River and that the people of Hay River did not like him. He further stated that the Indians of Rocher River were a very hard people to manage and felt that he would like to have an Indian school somewhere else.\n\n6. Qualifications.\n\nMr. Bellevance holds a Second Class Manitoba and Saskatchewan Teaching Certificate and has 24 years of experience, 15 years of which has been spent in Indian schools. He has spent 11 years with the Indian Affairs Branch and is a permanent Civil Servant. Mr. Bellevance is married; 52 years of age.\n\n7. General\n\nSuperintendent Martin informed me that there were some 210 families who took part in the local election. This consisted of about 50 Indian and 160 White and Half-Breed families. About 100 residential lots have been granted in Hay River and, according to the local people, the Hay River School will be filled to capacity within the next year or so. However, there is no need of a separate school on the island as there is adequate accommodation for all the families in the new school for time to come.\nIt is recommended that every effort should be made to have Mr. W. J. Johnson, D.P.W., finish the Hay River school before the fall term starts.\n\nI note that a local Administrative District Unit has been organized in the Hay River area, similar to the one at Yellowknife. This Administrative Unit goes out two miles in all directions from the northwest corner of Lot 71.\n\nI was informed by Superintendent Martin that a local Trustee Board had been formed. Superintendent Martin said that he was of the opinion that the people of Hay River can afford to pay their share of the cost of education. I am of the opinion that the only satisfactory solution to the Hay River School problem would be the formation of an elected School Board, similar to the one at Yellowknife and that the new school be turned over to the local residents on the understanding that they would pay their share of the cost of operating same.\n\nSome of the local people resent the fact that the Indian children are permitted to go to the same school as the Whites and Half-Breeds because of the danger of Tuberculosis. Therefore, every precaution should be taken to ensure that the children are medically examined. Right now, there is an X-Ray Clinic here in Yellowknife which has been sent in by the Charles Camsel Hospital. It is suggested that the same procedure be followed at Hay River.\n\nI discussed the idea of operating the Hay River Indian Day School during the summer vacation with practically all of the local residents and found that they were opposed to this idea as they felt that their children needed a rest. I would concur with them in the view that the school not be operated during the summer holidays as the local people remain in the district throughout the year.\n\nI note that the services of two Protestant teachers, Mr. Bowerman and his wife, have been obtained. I would be very pleased to receive information as to the qualifications and past experience of both teachers. It is vital that teachers appointed to the Hay River Indian Day School fall in the category of Welfare Teacher as there is much welfare work to be done in this area.\n\nAlso, I would recommend that all teachers for the Northwest Territories schools be selected from the Province of Alberta. I make this statement as both Roman Catholic and Protestant teachers in the Province of Alberta take the same Normal School training and, also, it is a very difficult task for outside teachers to adapt the Alberta Curriculum to northern areas. Alberta teachers have a thorough knowledge of the Alberta Curriculum and are qualified to teach all subjects as authorized for Elementary, Intermediate and High School courses. They are also familiar with departmental procedures as laid down by the Alberta Department of Education.\n\nI have discussed with Dr. Lazerte, Dean of the Faculty of Education of the Province of Alberta,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-6, part 1)\nthe type of teacher required for Northwest Territories schools and qualifications necessary. He assured me that he would be willing to select, at our request, the very best type of Roman Catholic and Protestant teachers for Northwest Territories schools. I would be quite willing to go to Edmonton to interview the prospective teachers which had been screened by Dr. Lazerte, should the Department of Mines and Resources wish to follow this procedure.\n\nSchools in the Northwest Territories demand a higher type of teacher than is required anywhere else in the Dominion. This is due to the fact that there is such a great need for welfare work, the number of grades that it is necessary for one teacher to teach, and the general conditions under which the teacher must work.\n\nIn the Hay River Indian Day School it is likely that some pupils will be requiring Grade XII education next September. In this connection, we should bear in mind that a Second Class Teacher from any of the provinces would not be able to teach Grade XII subjects as authorized by the Alberta Curriculum. Teachers from provinces foreign to Alberta also have difficulty in teaching Grade XI and XII subjects as laid down by the Alberta Curriculum. It is for this reason, also, that I recommend the employment of Alberta teachers in the Northwest Territories schools.\n\nI would suggest that the Roman Catholic principal selected for the Hay River Indian Day School have at least a First Class Alberta Certificate and a University Degree. Under regulations set up by the Alberta Department of Education, pupils may not be granted credit for Grade X, XI and XII subjects unless they are taught by a principal who is the holder of a University Degree.\n\nI visited Roche River on July 19th and found the new school well on the way to completion. The Department of Public Works have constructed an excellent school. The carpenter in charge told me that he was waiting for some Ten-Test to finish up some of the rooms. With the necessary materials, it should take about ten days to complete. It will be one of the finest schools in Canada.\n\nThey will burn wood in the furnace. This can be obtained locally. They will use a direct current generator which will be run by batteries. I think that the idea of a direct current generator with batteries is very sound in view of the fact that the over-head cost will be kept at a minimum.\n\nSeeing that we have an excellent school at Roche River, it is essential that a well-qualified First Class Welfare Teacher be employed. Again, I would recommend that a First Class Alberta Teacher be employed. A married male teacher would add stability to the education set-up. I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of the Roche River School commencing operation at the earliest possible date, otherwise, children will leave the area and go to Fort Resolution. If possible, this school should begin operation this month. The local people were very disappointed that the school did not operate last September.\nIf it is possible to engage a First Class Alberta Teacher, married man, at this date, I would recommend that he should be employed for Roche River. However, if it is impossible to do this, there is no alternative but to send Mr. Bellevance there.\n\nIn order to get the best type of teacher, it is most important that transportation be paid to destination and that they be supplied with the very best accommodation. One of the severest criticisms of the teachers in the northern schools is that they are from France and do not speak the English language. In this connection, I might say that Mr. Bellevance speaks a broken English and is not competent to teach non-English children to read and write.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.W.

You will note that the report draws attention to the need for having both the school house and the teacher's residence completed in order to assure normal functioning of the school. However, you will undoubtedly be taking this matter up with the Chief Engineer, Department of Public Works, as it is important that these buildings be completed at an early date.\n\nWe will be glad to discuss with you the features of this report which affect both the Indian Affairs branch and the Northwest Territories Administration.\n\nR.

I am of the opinion that this figure will be 170. In any event, consideration should be given to closing the two stairs of the first floor of the building and the provision of two classrooms, one at each end of the building. This will be absolutely essential for September, 1950. There will be little cost involved as it will be necessary to provide only part of the wall and the flooring material.\n\nFire Exits\n\nIn the event that the Department make alterations, as suggested above, it will be necessary to have outside fire exits built to take the place of the corridors now used.\nTransportation\n\nIn regard to this matter, please refer to my letter of December 5, in which I advised that this matter be left to the local people at West Channel.\n\nHealth\n\nThere should be a medical check-up at this school each year and the school should be provided with vitamin pills.\n\nHot Noon Lunch\n\nTwo large electric hot-plates should be provided for the heating of soup, etc., for the hot noon lunch at this school. These hot-plates should be kept in the classrooms in order that the teachers do not have to leave their classrooms to attend to the preparation of this lunch. At the present time, the teacher has to leave her classroom to heat the soup on the stove in the teachers' residence. This situation is not satisfactory.\n\nFishing Industry\n\nMr. Bowerman is handling the fishing industry for Indian Agent Kirby and is attending to nets, equipment, and so forth. During my visit, he was showing the Indians how to line-up nets and get them ready for the commencement of the fishing season. He will visit the fishing grounds periodically and the homes of the Indians who are out fishing in order to take mail back and forth and supervise them in their work.\n\nMr. Bowerman will also help the Indians in the handling of their money. About 50% of their earnings will be given to the wives for food, clothing, etc., and the other 50% will be banked in order to defray cost of equipment, and so forth, and also to encourage the Indians to save for the future.\n\nReport on Room I - Mrs. Clyna Dussault\n\nClassification of Pupils\n\nGrade I - 30\n\nMusic\n\nThe children sang several songs during my visit and there is no doubt that they are receiving excellent training along this line.\n\nReading\n\nThe pupils read very well.\nArt\n\nPractical Art is being stressed in this room, which is highly commendable. They are receiving good training in this subject.\n\nGeneral\n\nEven though Mrs. Dussault has only a 2nd Class Alberta Certificate, she is rendering excellent service in the Hay River Indian Day School. Without a doubt, Mrs. Dussault has the most difficult task of any teacher of this school in view of the fact that she has practically all Indian children. She understands the psychology of children; has excellent discipline and excellent control; good methods of teaching; and, the pupils like her. As a result, the children like school and are progressing well in their work.\n\nThe notebooks are neat and well-kept. Mrs. Dussault keeps a day-book of work to be taught and has organized her work in the class very systematically. Mrs. Dussault gives the children Folk Dancing and emphasizes physical training and practical health.\n\nThe tone and atmosphere in this room are very good. I consider Mrs. Dussault to be doing excellent work.\n\nReport on Room II - Mrs. Joan Bowerman\n\nClassification of Pupils\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 15     |\n| II    | 16     |\n| Total | 31     |\n\nReading\n\nI found that in reading, my pupils are good readers. However, I stressed the importance of sight reading for the first five or six months of the school year.\n\nNumber Work\n\nWhen I examined the children in number-work, I found them up to standard.\n\nArt\n\nThe children are receiving excellent training in practical art. They are decorating the classroom and using Art in conjunction with other subjects.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 905-6, part 1)\nGeneral\n\nMrs. Bowerman has an excellent personality and fine ability in teaching. She is giving the children excellent training in music and folk dancing. Every day, Mrs. Bowerman has the children singing health songs, which are sung in conjunction with the health programme. Heath is being stressed in this class.\n\nMrs. Bowerman has shown the Indian Children how to bath and has even let them use the bathroom in the residence. This has had a good effect in that the Indian children are now coming to school with clean clothing and are nicely washed. They take pride in showing Mrs. Bowerman their clean underclothing.\n\nReport on Room III - Mr. John Vincent Kennedy\n\nClassification of Pupils\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| II    | 8      |\n| III   | 14     |\n| IV    | 6      |\n| V     | 2      |\n| Total | 32     |\n\nMr. John Vincent Kennedy\n\nMr. Kennedy has no aptitude for teaching. He is unhappy at Hey River and stated that the climate disagreed with him and that he would like to return to Nova Scotia. I would advise his transfer at an early date, January 1, if possible.\n\nI have received criticism from the parents in that he has not been correcting the pupils' work.\n\nMr. Kennedy has no control whatsoever over the children in his classroom. I am of the opinion that his eyesight is so bad that he is unable to see all of the pupils in the classroom. I have been informed that he is partly deaf.\n\nMr. Kennedy gave 90 corporal punishments in October, and, during the past month, he found it necessary to administer 40 more. However, this is just making a mockery out of education and I am of the opinion that he does not hurt any of the children as I was told that he is not very strong. Mr. Bowerman pointed out to him that, during his twenty years of teaching, he found it necessary to use the strap only three times.\n\nIn appearance, Mr. Kennedy is dirty, untidy, and not well-groomed. He lacks the ability to care for equipment.\nThe pupils cannot read well. I feel that Mr. Kennedy has no idea of the techniques to be used in reading. This not only applies to reading but to all other subjects of the curriculum. Teaching is just a hit-and-miss process as far as Mr. Kennedy is concerned.\n\nI visited this school on two occasions and both times I discussed with Mr. Kennedy the proper methods of teaching all subjects of the curriculum. During my last visit I spent some three or four hours discussing educational matters with him in order to improve the work of his room. However, as Mr. Kennedy has no control over his class, I am sure that this time was wasted and thus I would advocate his transfer at an early date.\n\nMr. Kennedy taught Health by putting notes on the blackboard and having the children copy them. I pointed out to him that Health was something to be lived, not learned from blackboard notes\u2014to see that the room was clean, that the children were washed and wore clean clothes, that the children kept their books clean and that the children were taught the value of sleep. The pupils of this room were untidy, dirty and tired.\n\nDuring my visit to Mr. Kennedy's room, no fewer than 25 children went to the toilet in ten minutes.\n\nIf the Department is interested in the welfare of this school, they will remove Mr. Kennedy as soon as possible. I would recommend that Mrs. Wilson, who has submitted her application, be taken on temporarily.\n\nReport on Room IV \u2014 Mr. W. A. Bowerman\n\nClassification of Pupils\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| III   | 1      |\n| V     | 10     |\n| VI    | 9      |\n| VII   | 5      |\n| VIII  | 5      |\n| IX    | 2      |\n| XII   | 1      |\n\nTotal - 32\n\nMathematics\n\nI tested the pupils in the field of mathematics and found them quite efficient and well up to standard in both the Public and High School grades.\n\nMusic\n\nExcellent training is being given in Music. The children of this school, under Mr. Bowerman's leadership, presented a programme of one hour's duration over the local Broadcasting Station. This programme was...\ngreatly enjoyed by the people of Bay River and the surrounding district.\n\nSocial Studies\n\nI feel that the pupils are obtaining fine instruction in the field of Social Studies, under Mr. Bowerman's supervision. He correlates History, Mathematics, Art, and other subjects, which is commendable. In teaching the constitutional history of Canada, he has prepared an excellent chart which simplifies this subject for the pupils. By this means, the children may be well prepared for the final examination in this subject.\n\nArt\n\nThe Art work in this room is well up to standard. The children are being trained to use their own initiative and imagination. The subject is correlated with Social Studies and other subjects of the curriculum. I was pleased with the way this subject was being handled in this room.\n\nGeneral\n\nI found the discipline and general tone of the classroom good; the children were very alert and eager to learn.\n\nMr. Bowerman is neat in appearance; he is most energetic and puts a lot of \"pep\" into his work. Mr. Bowerman is very free with his time and is carrying a tremendous load. The welfare work alone which he is doing is a full-time job.\n\nGeneral\n\nDuring my visit, I found certain conditions about the school which had a great deal to be desired. Firstly, as both Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Bowerman were receiving the same salary, each felt that he did not have to meet the wishes of the other. I found that the lack of a principal for this school has resulted in certain undesirable conditions and, in order to preserve the buildings and further the welfare of the school, I appointed Mr. Bowerman Acting-Principal.\n\nIn order to bring about better discipline in the school as a whole, I suggested to Mr. Bowerman that he have a morning and evening assembly of all the children at which time there could be group singing, a discussion of pertinent matters, daily announcements, etc., and thus foster better discipline in the school.\n\nI also suggested that teachers be present at each corridor during the assembly and dismissal periods. I further pointed out that the children were arriving at the school too early in the morning and, without supervision...\nat this time, they ran all over the school and thus caused a great deal of confusion and in some cases, damage of property. During my last visit, I noted that this matter had been rectified; Mr. Bowerman had requested that the teachers arrive at 8:30 a.m. They were free to leave at 3:30 p.m.\n\nMagistrate Martin informed me that the above suggestions had improved the school a great deal.\n\nI found Mr. Bowerman to be very open-minded and very open to suggestions as, when I made recommendations, he put them into effect immediately. This is a healthy condition. However, to preserve the school and further education at this centre, I would recommend Magistrate Martin be appointed immediately as Official Trustee with authority to dismiss the present caretaker if he is unsuitable to do the required work. This school should be cleaned from top to bottom. Two hundred pounds of wax should be provided and an electric polisher provided to ensure that the building may be put in first class shape. The Government has made a tremendous investment in this school and I see no other way in which it may be preserved for many years.\n\nI would like to emphasize the importance of making Magistrate Martin Official Trustee with the powers of a School Board in order that the Hay River School be streamlined. As there are approximately one hundred white children attending this school, it is vital that it be made one of the best in Canada. The parents of these children come from good schools in the Provinces and thus they will demand the best.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.W.

W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, Northwest Territories, inspected the Hay\nRiver Indian Day School on November 12, 14, 15, and 16 and on\nDecember 1 and 2, 1949.\n\nWe are forwarding to you herewith a copy of Mr. McKinnon's\nreport on his inspection of this school which he conducted on the\ndates as mentioned above.\n\nEnclos.\n\nR. M. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nCol. B.F.

McKinnon, Superintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T., inspected the Hay River Day\nSchool on May 29, 1950. We are forwarding herewith a copy\nof his report.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nR.A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthern Administrations,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn company with Indian Agent Kirkby, I inspected educational facilities at Hay River on May 29th and would report as follows:\n\nTeachers' Residence\n\nThe teachers' residence at Hay River is large and oversize. It is too large for one couple with the result that it costs twice as much to heat as it should.\n\nI can not see the necessity of a seven-room house being needed for one teacher, but, without making it into a duplex I do not consider it at all satisfactory for two couples. I would suggest that some competent builder be asked to make an estimate of the change and that it be proceeded with this summer in time to take care of the new teacher who will be replacing Mr. Kennedy.\n\nI feel that a small, compact residence has a tendency to make people more thrifty and to divide this house will give each party adequate room. We will continue to have many complaints if teachers are expected to live in one common house.\n\nI have discussed the above matter with Indian Agent Kirkby. In view of the fact that the physical plant comes under his jurisdiction, he has submitted to Colonel B.F. Neary, sketch plans indicating the manner in which the teachers' residence might be made into a duplex at little additional cost. It would be possible to put the Principal into the lower suite and to put one couple or, if we had two single teachers, they could both occupy the upstairs suite as it would have two large bedrooms as well as kitchen and bathroom.\n\nAttendance\n\nThe Indians at Hay River have received every assistance. Attendance last fall was kept up by Mr. Bowerman paying a man to bring the children across the river. As Mr. Bowerman is not assisting them this spring, the Indian children are not attending school. Yet, the Indian children do come across the river to visit the soda fountain as soon as school is out.\nIf the Indian took any responsibility on his own shoulders, he would take his own children and his neighbours' children over in their large canoes, but, they are looking for us to do it all. I believe the Indian feels that by staying away and not providing any assistance, he is forcing our hand and we must either provide a boat, cancel the Family Allowance or build a school on his side of the river which would divide Hay River with the result that the Indian and White would drift more apart instead of being assimilated as we are trying to do.\n\nUnder the present regulations, White and Half-Breed children can stay away from school under any pretext they like because we have no organized school districts. In most cases, the Indian and Half-Breed are educated but one is exempt from school regulations with the result that forcing one without the other causes nothing but ill-will for everyone. In this regard, we are badly in need of some unified policy.\n\nInstruction\n\nDuring my short time at Hay River, I observed lessons in all rooms and tested the senior classes. I consider the type of instruction to be fair as there is much room for improvement. Greater care should be given to the selection of our teaching personnel -- particularly to teachers selected by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nHealth\n\nAs Indian Agent Kirkby is responsible for the physical plant, I shall not report in detail in this regard. However, much improvement is required as to the general cleanliness and sanitation of this school. This poor condition may be due in part to the fact that the Caretaker had resigned and that there was no one available at the time of my visit to do caretaking services.\n\nOn January 4, 1950, I reported to Colonel Neary the unsuitability of Mr. Kennedy, and requested a transfer for Mr. Bowerman as he likes working with Indian children and has not the required experience to handle in a satisfactory manner the principalship of the Hay River school. My recent visit confirms these previous recommendations.\n\nElectric Light Plant\n\nI have discussed with Indian Agent Kirkby plans whereby the lighting plant may be operated only a few hours a day, thus creating a considerably saving during the spring and summer period.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSometime last fall a request was forwarded to Mr. D.J. Martin, Magistrate at Hay River to check on the school residence furniture and forward a complete list of all the equipment needed. Mr. Martin and Mr. Bowerman made up a list between them and I understood from them that it had been forwarded direct to you with the result that I did not receive a copy nor did I include any furniture on my requisitions for Hay River.\n\nThe residence at Hay River is very poorly furnished and is in need of the addition of many items that I have been informed, were included in Mr. Martin's list. As the shipping season is about to begin I would like to know whether any of this furniture can be expected so that certain plans can be made for the following summer and to be guided in my future requisitions.\n\nOne also receives enquiries from the teachers as to what they can expect for the following year so that they can make purchases of some items themselves if we are not going to supply. In this respect it would be of some value to be able to advise them what, if anything could be expected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Teacher's Residence Hay River\n\nDuring the past term the school Residence at Hay River has been occupied by the Principal and part of the upstairs by the second man teacher. In this residence there is one kitchen and one bathroom while the second teacher has set up a small electric range in his bedroom and being a single man has managed to get along with a very unsatisfactory arrangement. We have also had the continual complaining by the Principal that this man did nothing towards cleaning the stairs and other items which brings us to the point that two parties cannot live in the same residence and have any type of satisfactory arrangement where they have to use the same kitchen, bathroom, living room, stairs etc. and there will always be a continual complaining by one or both parties that the other man is getting too much.\n\nThe residence at Hay River is a large oversize place that is much too large for one couple with the result that it costs twice as much to heat as it should and we have but one residence where we need two. The size of this house is such that it could be made into two suites with very little work or expense and we would then have quarters for two couples while each would have his own private portion of the house.\n\nThere are two alternatives to making this house into a satisfactory duplex, one is to divide the house into two halves giving each couple two large rooms downstairs and two bedrooms upstairs with both using the same stairway which would possibly result in some friction as to who should do the cleaning. The other alternative is to put an outside\nstairway up the back to the first landing of the present stairs and put in an outside door with the result that the principal would have a four roomed suite downstairs and the second teacher would have a four roomed suite upstairs. In this way no cutting of the building is necessary and all that is required is to put on an outside stairway, put in one outside doorway and one doorway leading downstairs to make the upstairs private. Downstairs one of the large rooms or two for that matter would have to have closets put into them to make bedroom storage with a bathroom off one of these rooms and we could then accommodate two teachers without increasing the cost of heating or maintenance with a small expenditure for minor changes.\n\nI cannot see the necessity of a seven roomed house plus bath, plus halls and with food storage space available in the furnace room being needed for one teacher, but without making it into a duplex I do not consider it at all satisfactory for two couples. When the second teacher is through the day he, or she, should be free to prepare for the next day and not be bothered by trying to please the Principal nor should he have to please the teacher. I would suggest that the DPW or some competent builder be asked to make an estimate of the change and that it be proceeded with this summer in time to take care of the new teacher who will be replacing Mr. Kennedy.\n\nI have enclosed a sketch of the present residence and though I do not know the exact size of the building all the rooms are large with the result that the suites will each have more floor space than most cottages have and each teacher will still have more room than he would get in a large percentage of the teacherages at many schools in the provinces.\n\nThe present power house and furnace room are very good size and once the Hay River central power are put in the light plant can be taken out of that section of the building and shelves and storage space for rations for both teachers will be available. As it is a room off the furnace room it will be heated with no freezing danger. The building is joined to the main residence so that no hardship will be encountered by having to go into this building for rations at meal time.\n\nI feel that a small compact residence has a tendency to make people more thrifty and to divide this house will give each party adequate room that they can look after instead of too much room that is not used nor kept looking neat and clean at all times. During the past year the complaints about two parties living in one common house have been heard but have not been pressed but this spring they are heard more often and we will have much discontent at Hay River among the teachers in our residence if they are all expected to live in one common\nhouse that is plenty large enough for two small families but which has one common kitchen, bathroom etc. and leaves no one with any privacy at all.\n\nThe sketches are herewith enclosed for your consideration and I feel justified in recommending that this residence be made into a duplex for the teaching staff. With the change it would be possible to put the principal into the lower suite and to put one couple upstairs or if we had two single women teachers they could both occupy the upstairs suite as it would have two large bedrooms as well as kitchen and bathroom.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

It was therefore impossible to get anyone to make an estimate or put in a tender to do the complete job of putting in an outside stairway for the residence and putting in cupboards for the upstairs kitchen and a clothes closet for the bedroom downstairs.\n\nI was able to inspect the building in company with the D.P.W. foreman and the enclosed list of materials was made out to cover the work required. These materials would have to be provided in any case and as they are not available in Hay River they might just as well be ordered by us direct from one of the Edmonton lumber yards.\n\nAs the job is of such short duration one cannot bring in an outside carpenter and the D.P.W. foreman has informed me that he will put one of his men on the job provided we pay his wages so that it does not come out of the money he has available for his own work. At the present time they are not too busy and could spare the man.\n\nIf the materials could be ordered immediately for shipment by truck from Edmonton to Hay River it should be possible to complete the work by the time school starts or very shortly after.\n\nIf by the time the materials arrive it is possible to get a carpenter to put in a bid on the job I will wire, but the materials must be provided at once if we are to get the work.\ndone in time to install the new teacher.\n\nThe whole change including stairs, clothes closet and cupboards should not run to more than $300.00 and will provide for two small families instead of the one as it now stands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

The second question was a demand for a day school, idea that some half breed had put in the heads of the Indians, unpracticable, on account of so few Indians staying near the fort, and the high fuel, fish etc., but the idea had been launched with the Indians and they do not realize the difference between day and boarding school, so this will hurt the recruiting of children, and the Mission does not see the utility of a day school more than we do.\n\nC. Bourget, M.D.,\nIndian Agent.\nI was asked last summer by some of these Indians of Rae to give them a day school, which is at present quite a proposition due to the expenses of a building, fuel at excessive costs and the monotony of the life there, but I presume if they do insist, with time it may be a solution that must be found, and then one school teacher could then be engaged to do the two duties. Of course, I am against this day school as it would provide school for a few children only, the majority of Indians being far in the woods part of the year, and it would end the recruiting for the boarding school, but I am afraid the Indians will become more and more insistant on that question, being encouraged by a half breed who is on treaty and put the idea in their heads, and as they do not see the difference between a day school and boarding school they think it is the same thing on a smaller scale than the boarding school.\nFt. Resolution, N.W.T.,\nJuly 31, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report on the Treaty Trip and payment of Annuities to the Indians of the Great Slave Lake Agency for 1935.\n\nThe Indians of Rae do not like to place their children in any residential school for the simple reason that they would like to visit their children occasionally and cannot afford to come to Resolution. They would rather like a day school. I have had enough experience so far with the Indians, to recommend this, and leave it to your discretion.\n\nDr. J. E. Amyot,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 24th, 1936.\n\nDear Doctor Amyot:\n\nThe Department received your telegram of April 18th, with the greatest regret. I think there is a fair prospect of being able to station a nurse at Fort Rae, and to build accommodation for her as soon as such action can be taken in the summer. The present hope is to build a day school there with accommodation for a teacher and a nurse. In the meantime, if mail conditions will at all permit, I wish you would forward any suggestions you have as to the best method of building at Fort Rae, and any other recommendations you may wish to make in regard to the proposal.\n\nx x x\n\nH.

While on patrol in Yellowknife the writer asked Mr. Meikle what the possibilities were of having a school here. He requested that a list of names be forwarded to him of the children who would attend a day school. The parents of prospective students were interviewed and the following is the list of children's names whom the parents wish to send to school.\n\n| NAME OF CHILD     | AGE | STATUS       |\n|-------------------|-----|--------------|\n| Augustine Lafferty| 13  | Treaty Indian|\n| Gabriel Lafferty   | 10  | \"            |\n| Theresa Lafferty   | 8   | \"            |\n| Veronique Lafferty | 6   | \"            |\n| Caroline Lafferty  | 7   | \"            |\n| Dora Lafferty      | 6   | \"            |\n| Florence Smith     | 15  | \"            |\n| Albert Smith       | 9   | \"            |\n| Frank Smith        | 6   | \"            |\n| Rosanna Lafferty   | 14  | Half-breed   |\n| Catherine Lafferty | 11  | \"            |\n| Louise Lafferty    | 9   | \"            |\n| Earnest Lafferty   | 7   | \"            |\n| Marylyn Buffum     | 8   | White        |\n\n3. The children listed reside in the settlement throughout the year with the exception of muskrat hunting in the spring of the year.

A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to my prolonged absence from Fort Smith, I have not had the opportunity of replying sooner to your letter of August 31, relative to the opening of a day school at Fort Rae.\n\nActually it is too late for supplies to be sent to Fort Rae this year. While there are five Sisters resident in the hospital there, it would be difficult to spare one of them for teaching, for they already have sufficient work to keep them busily occupied each day.\n\nAlthough one of the buildings purchased by the mission from the R.C.M.P. detachment would be suitable for class-room purposes, I am of the opinion that very few children could be found to attend. For the greater part of the year, entire families are obliged to live in the bush, in order to live. Those who would necessarily remain in the Fort while their children are going to school, would have no means of sustenance whatsoever. Perhaps half a dozen children might be found, to come to the school, but judging from the means of livelihood of these people, I feel certain that the number of children who could actually attend regularly, would hardly warrant the opening of a school.\n\nI will, however, give the matter serious consideration, trusting to have the occasion of conversing with you personally about it.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n'sgd' M.

The first is that for the past several years it has become evident to the people of this band that there should be a school in Rae to teach our children. More white people are coming into this district all the time and a little education would help our Indians very much in their dealings with the white people. Our lack of education is becoming a considerable handicap.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Jimmy \"X\" Bruno\nMark\n21st June, 1945.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe - Day School at Rae, N.W.T.\n\nThe Commissioner of the R.C.M. Police has sent me copy of a report from his N.C.O. in charge at Rae in which he refers to the need for a day school at that point. It is stated there are eleven children of mixed blood who would in all probability attend the school regularly as their parents are residing in the settlement. This number would likely be increased later and in addition there would be the Indian population which it is understood numbers between eight and twelve of school age.\n\nThe matter of establishing a day school at Rae was taken up with Bishop Trocellier last year and the following information obtained -\n\n(1) The Mission has a building at Rae which could be converted into a suitable day school to accommodate a minimum of thirty-five pupils. This building will require to be fixed for electric lighting and proper fixtures installed. No member of the Rae Mission staff is qualified to do this work and as a consequence someone from the Fort Smith Mission will require to be flown to Rae and returned to Fort Smith.\n\n(2) One of the Mission Staff at Rae is a qualified teacher and arrangements can be made for her release to take over the day school.\n\n(3) The Mission will supply the electric power needed to light the building.\n(4) This Department (either the N.W.T. or Indian Affairs, or jointly) would be expected to assume the following -\n\n(a) Salary of teacher and caretaker, also fuel to heat the school building.\n\n(b) Desks, school books and other necessary equipment and supplies.\n\n(c) Wiring and electrical fixtures or if these are supplied by the Mission the grant should be increased accordingly.\n\n(d) An annual cash grant of $1,200 but if the Mission is required to supply electric wiring and fixtures it should be increased accordingly.\n\nWe find it difficult to deal with these matters at the present time pending the appointment of our School all be glad to have your views on this possible for it will be necessary to is to be done this year.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nFort Rae,\nSeptember 2, 1946.\n\nMr. McKinnon\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen at Rae you were kind enough to ask our opinion about School. Badly impressed by the surrounding at the police barrack, only the two of us, afraid to displease you and the police, not perfectly understanding the meaning of some questions, taken also by surprise, we said things we should never have told and we did not mean at all. People are justly displeased and disapproving us. Beside, as in our language we have only one and same word to mean: protestant and English, a great misunderstanding resulted.\n\nWe don't care who is building the school, the Government or the Roman Catholic Mission, but we never had in mind to have Protestant in Charge.\n\nAs we are all Roman Catholics we want the good Sisters to do the teaching, and if not enough Sister available, Roman Catholic teachers to help them.\n\nMislead, we are now sincerely sorry for what we have said in front of you, it was not the opinion of the people, not our own. Here again in plain words what we all want: a boarding school, like the one at Fort Resolution, big enough to hold all the children of school age and run by the Roman Catholic Mission.\n\nWe thank you for your visit and promised school and hope our children will soon be able to write and read English and make a better living afterward.\n\nWe keep a copy of this letter for reference.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJimmie BRUNO, Chief.\n\nLouis Beaulieu, Headman.\nOttawa, September 16, 1946.\n\nBureau of North West Territories,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. Bracken.\n\nSchool - Fort Rae -\n\nHerewith registered letter opened in error.

I also interviewed Chief J. Bruno and local residents with regard to the proposal. At Bruno's invitation, I visited the Indians in their tents, and saw for myself the urgent need for the provision of school facilities.\n\nDr. Riopel of Fort Resolution advised me that there were about 150 children of school age in the locality, and that they were badly in need of a school. The general opinion appeared to be that ultimately there should be a residential school erected at this point. I discussed this matter with Bishop Trocellier who confirmed this view.\n\nAs a temporary and immediate solution to the problem, I would recommend the following procedure:\n\n(1) That the mission day-school be opened for the remainder of the current school year.\n\n(2) Since the services of a properly qualified teacher are available locally, that the cost of salary, school supplies and a fair rent for the building be borne on a pro rata basis by the Bureau of Northwest Territories and the Indian Affairs Branch.\nWith respect to the building itself, I would add that it is divided into two rooms, one 14 feet by 11 feet, and the other 21 feet by 15 feet, and it has an 8-foot ceiling. I would suggest that a beginning be made with small classes, due to the entire illiteracy of the children.\n\nAlthough I was told by the local priest that not two percent of the Indians in the area could read or write, I saw for myself the possibilities for improving this condition when I inspected the Dog Rib Indian children under Sister MacQuillan at Fort Providence. This sister had such children as young as six years of age reading and speaking English after only a few weeks of schooling.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nCOPY TO: Rev. Fr.

It is understood from Inspector McKinnon that you are aware of the proposal of the Roman Catholic Mission to use a former R.C.M.P. building as a day school.\n\nWhile we are fully aware of the fact that a residential school would probably be a better solution to the educational problem at this point, it is felt impossible to plan such a building under present conditions.\n\nTherefore, the Department is prepared to establish the Port Rae Indian Day School. We are willing to pay the teacher's salary, to provide text books and other school equipment, and to pay for the rent of a suitable building.\n\nIt is realized that this day school would be only a temporary solution to the problem. However, would you approach the Roman Catholic authorities to find out how far they have progressed with this matter. I am sending a copy of this letter directly to the Rev. Father Gillis so that he will be prepared to discuss this matter with you.\n\nB. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nIN REPLY PLEASE QUOTE\n\nDIV.

The members of this Detachment are only too willing to teach the children how to play ball.\n\nTwo complete sets of horseshoes would also be welcomed and this Detachment would undertake to get the Indian men playing horseshoes.\n\nMay it be pointed out that there is absolutely nothing in the way of amusement around Rae and it is hoped the Department will give consideration to this request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nCat.\n(W.A.Coombs) #13677.\ni-c Rae Detachment.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRE: Indian Children, Fort Rae.\n\nThe enclosed letter has been forwarded to me by the R.C.M.P. Fort Rae, regarding amusements for the Indian children during the summer months. As the members of the Detachment at Rae are keenly interested in the welfare of the Indians at that post and I can vouch for the truth of their statements, having spent several days there myself, I hope this matter will be given some consideration.\n\nThere is no Indian School at Rae and the children are left to their own devices in the way of amusement. I feel that anything in the way of teaching them sports would be a worthy effort and also a means of preventing them from getting into trouble, such as the acquiring of Venereal Disease. I am forwarding this letter for your consideration, please.\n\nW.

We have today arranged to forward six playground balls and three playground bats, as requested. These are being shipped via waterways to Constable Coombs. Will you please advise him of our action in this regard.\n\nOn December 30, 1946, I sent a letter, a copy of which is attached, to Dr. Riopel, with a copy to Father Gillis, Fort Smith. To date I have received no answer to this letter. Could you please take the necessary action to promote the opening of a day school at Fort Rae, as indicated.\n\nBernard F.

I have advised Constable Coombs by wireless that the baseball supplies will be shipped to him.\n\nRegarding the opening of a day school at Fort Rae, I have asked the Father Superior about it at this Mission but he states he is entirely ignorant of the plans of the R.C. Mission in opening this school. As Dr. Riopel had already left before December 30th, 46, and there was no doctor here until I arrived on the 10th of February, this is the first time that the matter has been brought to my attention.\n\nAs I expect to be leaving this post next week, I would suggest that this matter should be taken up with my successor, Dr. Mulvahill, who will be arriving on the 23rd of this month. I will also ask him to make enquiries into this matter on his next trip to Fort Rae. As a school is badly needed there, I am sure that every assistance possible will be given towards its opening.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.P. Earle, M.D.\nActing Indian Agent.\nWe have an opportunity to purchase the Buffum Property at Fort Rae for educational purposes. This property consists of a dwelling house thirty-six feet by twenty-two feet. It has on the ground floor, two bedrooms, dining room, and a kitchen and washroom. The upstairs consists of one large finished room. This residence is completely furnished except for linen and bedding. It contains a radio, two stoves, eight dining room chairs, two large beds, two cots, one Winnipeg couch, ice box, washing machine, twelve volt wind charger, storm doors and windows, and a full line of dishes and kitchen utensils. The floors are covered with linoleum and rugs. The building is in an excellent state of repair. It is well insulated and sided and would make an ideal residence for a teacher. About a year ago Mr. George Buffum refused an offer from the I. A. B. to purchase only the house for five thousand dollars. This did not include any of the land or surrounding buildings.\n\nThere is also on this land a store, forty feet by twenty-eight feet. It is of frame construction, well insulated, and in an excellent state of repair. It has a fir flooring and ceiling and was erected at an initial cost of six thousand dollars. It contains two stoves, a large teacher's desk, and some smaller furniture. The upstairs would make a play room. This building would make an excellent classroom which would accommodate about thirty pupils.\n\nBesides the above, the property contains several log shacks of little value, an oil and ice house, and a frame building twenty-four feet by sixteen feet which would make a suitable storehouse.\n\nI have discussed the advisability of purchasing this property with Mr. J. O. McNiven who concurs in the view that we should take advantage of this opportunity, as it would cost considerable more than ten thousand dollars to erect one of the buildings at present cost.\nThis property is free from mortgage and consists of three and one half acres of land on the water front. It is centrally located and is the only suitable site in Rae for a school. There would be plenty of room on this property for a playground, an Indian Agent and Doctor's residence. It would be advisable for the Government to have their own school on Government property, and personally I see such as the only sound educational policy. I was informed that there were about one hundred and fifty children of school age and that about twenty-five would attend school the first year. We could open a day school at this point in the hope that all the residents would gradually become educated to leave their wives and children in the Fort while out trapping. By doing such education would have an elevating effect on the local inhabitants and develop initiative. As Fort Rae is the largest Indian Settlement in the N.W.T., there is great need of an Indian Agent at this point. An ideal combination at this centre would be a man as Agent, whose wife was teacher. By such an arrangement it would be easier to hold and obtain the best type of Government employees.\n\nI suggest that we take advantage of Mr. Buffum's offer and purchase the above property for ten thousand dollars. We should also purchase the fifty-five cords of wood on the said property at twelve dollars a cord as it will be impossible to obtain fuel oil this year. The Hudson's Bay Post Manager informed me that their carpenter will be at Rae for several weeks so we might take advantage of this opportunity to have the store renovated into a class room.\n\nBy purchasing the above property we are taking advantage of the one and only opportunity to attack education from a sound basis at this centre. Kindly advise Mr. George Buffum at Fort Rae as soon as possible of your decision, as he will be leaving soon for his home at 11136 - 67th Street, in Edmonton. Also there are several interested parties desiring this property.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. W.

This should be done.\n\n\"The residence alone is worth $8,000 today; The store would make an ideal classroom.

If the property is leased, the government should take the 55 cords of wood, which would heat all the buildings for the first winter. Oil cannot be had.

Fort Rae\n\nI visited Fort Rae on June 26th and examined the need for a school at this point. In this connection my letter of July 1st addressed to Mr. R. A. Gibson concerning the purchase of the Buffum property should be consulted.\n\nWhile at Fort Rae I discussed the local situation with Cst. Combs of the RCMP, the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company, the independent trader, and the local residents. They all requested that a government-operated day school be opened, together with accommodation for a teacher, in order that education might be placed on a firm foundation at this settlement. I was informed that there would be a minimum of 15 children who would attend school the first year. Since there are over 150 children of school age at Fort Rae, and since it is the largest Indian settlement in the Northwest Territories, there is great need for an Indian Agent and Doctor to be located here.\n\nAll with whom I spoke approved of the purchase of the Buffum property, as they were of the opinion that it was the only suitable site. Should the Indian Affairs Branch make an agreement to purchase this property, I would suggest that within the next few weeks the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company be contacted in order to secure the services of a carpenter for converting the store into a suitable classroom.\n\nI suggest that a well-qualified practical man be appointed Indian Agent at this settlement, and that if possible he be a married man whose wife is a qualified teacher. I would like to emphasize the need for establishing a school and providing a properly furnished modern home. A ration allowance of $360 per person should be granted to the teacher, together with yearly transportation in and out of the Territories. These provisions, coupled with an adequate salary, will attract the desired type of employee, and they are in line with those enjoyed by employees of other government services stationed in the north.\n\nJ.

It has been found to be clear and therefore I am sending you a draft copy of the option for the purchase of this property.\n\nIt will be necessary for the Indian Affairs Branch to obtain an Order-in-Council before I can send you the official option for signature. As soon as this Order-in-Council is obtained, I will write you again. However, I thought that you would like to have an opportunity of seeing the draft option that is proposed. You can expect to hear from me again in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

If you will look at a map of the Territories you will find Rae situated to the north of Yellowknife.\n\nWe have arranged to rent a trading post there and have sent in desks and supplies but the Bishop has been unable to obtain a Catholic teacher for us.\n\nAs this would be pioneering work, we would be prepared to pay two teachers to begin this school. In other words, we could hire both your brother and yourself at the same school. In fact, your services will be fully required as there has never been a school conducted at Rae before so there will be a great deal of ground work to be done.\n\nThe trading post is fully furnished with the exception, of course, of sheets and blankets which we would expect you to provide for yourselves. We could also make a suitable agreement as to the payment of your transportation costs. I would appreciate hearing from you as to whether you would be interested in going in to the north and undertake this worthwhile and deserving work.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your wire re an Indian Day School at Fort Rae, I contacted the Police at that settlement and found that at present there are 12 Indian children of school age residing in the Fort. The Police stated that there were 30 desks and a sufficient quantity of text books, scribblers, pencils, blackboard material and so on, on hand to commence teaching.\n\nI must state that I cannot see how a Day School would function to any advantage in Fort Rae. In the first place, these Indians are constantly leaving the settlement for trapping and hunting and if the school were a Day School it would be necessary that they take their children with them. Even in Fort Resolution there is great difficulty in assuring attendance of Day School pupils and I believe that the difficulties at Rae would be much greater; the attendance of the pupils would be so irregular that very little benefit would be derived from their attending classes.\n\nWhile paying Annuities it is true that one of the complaints of the Indians at Rae was that they did not have a school and wanted one immediately but that is no guarantee that if there is a school available the children will attend.\n\nThe living conditions at Fort Rae could not be considered the best, due mainly to the isolation of the post. You mention that the girl is crippled - if her incapacity is marked she will have a very difficult time. However, I would not like to state that she could not handle the job, she may have the type of personality that could overcome such a handicap and possibly may render her more suitable and valuable as a teacher but she would undoubtedly be hindered trying to move around, particularly in the winter. At the present time there is only one other white woman at Fort Rae, excluding the Sisters, so her social activities would be limited.\n\nIn conclusion, I can only repeat that I do not recommend the opening of a Day School at Fort Rae at this time. It may be possible to run a Day School for two or three months in the summer when most of the Indians of the Band congregate at the settlement but even then I believe that the attendance figures would be disappointing. In my opinion Fort Rae requires a Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 906-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nL C HUNTER\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\nFORT NORMAN Northwest Territories\n\nHAVE RECEIVED YOUR TELEGRAM NOVEMBER TWENTY-SIX -stop-\nI SENT SIMILAR TELEGRAM TO DOCTOR MULVIBILL FORT RESOLUTION\nHE HAS DAY SCHOOL AS SENT YOU -stop- PLEASE CONTACT HIM BY\nTELEGRAM AND ADVISE CONCERNING INFORMATION LAST PARAGRAPH YOUR\nTELEGRAM TO ME -stop- HE MAY BE WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU -stop-\n\nBernard F Neary\nIndian Affairs\n\nConfirmation\n\nPhoned to:\nPhoned by:\nTime:\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nDEGREE OF PRIORITY\n\nTIME OF ORIGIN\n\nSIGNED\n\nCOPY 3\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nMost Reverend J.

Mulvihill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Resolution, Northwest Territories.\n\nProposed Indian Day School at Fort Rae\n\nI have received your army signal and airmail letter concerning the above Indian Day School.\n\nIt was decided last Spring to open a day school at Rae on a temporary basis. Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Inspector of Schools for the Northwest Territories, had recommended this procedure because of the delays which will occur before we can consider the opening of a residential school there. At the present time the Department has many requests before it for residential schools and we realize that due to building and other conditions, we can only build a few of those required.\n\nTherefore it was decided to open a day school at Rae, in order to educate at least a few of these children, and to accustom them to going to school, even if only during the summer months. In view of the information contained in your letter of November 27, I have today sent the following telegram to Bishop Trocellier at Fort Smith:\n\n\"RE DAY SCHOOL FORT RAE -stop- UNDERSTAND TWELVE CHILDREN AVAILABLE THIS POST FOR SCHOOL DURING WINTER -stop- ONLY CATHOLIC TEACHER INTERESTED IS CRIPPLED GIRL WITH BROTHER BOTH OF WHOM ARE TEACHERS -stop- ATTENDANCE OF TWELVE DOES NOT WARRANT TWO TEACHERS -stop- IN VIEW OF FACT MOST OF INDIANS AWAY FROM POST COULD ONE OF SISTERS FROM HOSPITAL TEACH THIS SCHOOL DURING SLACK SEASON -stop- SCHOOL WOULD BE CONDUCTED IN BUFFUM PROPERTY WHICH WE HAVE RENTED -stop- ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE CARING FOR DESKS AND OTHER SCHOOL SUPPLIES WHICH HAVE BEEN SENT NORTH TO RAEE -stop- HAVE PROTESTANT TEACHER AVAILABLE BUT WILL TRY LOCATE HIM ELSEWHERE -stop- HAVE DISCUSSED MATTER LONG DISTANCE SISTER SARRASIN GREY NUNS MONTREAL\".\n\nI will advise you by Army Signal of any further developments in this case.\n\nBernard Beary,\nSUPT.

A copy of this letter is attached for your information.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector.\nFort Rae:\n\nThere are 708 Indians in the Fort Rae Band; of these, 660 were present for annuity payment last summer. Others had wandered into the Bear Lake regions where they probably will remain.\n\nThe Fort Rae Indians are the most primitive in the agency. They have absolutely no conception of the state of affairs anywhere except in their own small area. Very few have any education, very few speak English. The Indians live by hunting and trapping, there is very little opportunity for employment in other lines. The Hudson's Bay Post Manager figures the average income to be $300.00 a year. Fishing is satisfactory and the caribou are plentiful in season.\n\nWhen the white fox was valuable these people trapped far out in the Barrens and were quite wealthy. But now they are poor, dressed in ragged clothing and at times, particularly in summer, are really hungry. They no longer dry considerable quantities of fish and caribou and for the most part, wear store-bought clothing and live in tents.\n\nSince this is the largest band of Indians in the Territories I think that plans for the betterment of the Indians should include the immediate construction of a Residential school at Fort Rae.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, Ottawa.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your memoranda dated June 24th and June 28th requesting that the Inspector of Schools, Mr. J. W. McKinnon, submit recommendations regarding the seasonal school now in operation at Fort Rae, Northwest Territories.\n\nMr. McKinnon recommends that the seasonal school be extended to cover the full 1948-49 school year, and that Mr. Allard's sister be engaged to proceed to Fort Rae and assist her brother with the conduct of this school. Both teachers should be informed that this step is of an experimental nature, and that subsequent decisions will depend upon the enrolment and progress of the school.\n\nMr. McKinnon recommends that the present seasonal school be continued for the months of July and August, and that the school cease to function on a seasonal basis at the end of August. This will assist in making a division of the teaching load when a second teacher arrives, because one of the teachers can take the children who have already received some instruction.\n\nDr. Pett of the Nutrition Services, Department of National Health and Welfare, is now making some revisions in a ration list which he prepared several years ago for use in the Northwest Territories. We expect to receive this revised ration list within the next day or so, at which time a copy will be forwarded to your office. It is suggested that this ration list be mimeographed and forwarded to all teaching personnel who will require to order rations for the coming school year. In a recent\nconversation, Mr. Cheshire of the Hudson's Bay Company suggested that copies of the ration list be forwarded to the teachers who will indicate therein the articles they desire to purchase, and will return same to your office. The ration list should then be forwarded to the Wholesale Department of the Hudson's Bay Company at Edmonton; where it will be filled on a wholesale price basis and forwarded to the destination. In order that the teacher may enjoy the wholesale price for commodities, payment will have to be made within thirty days. This means that the Government should pay for the rations and deduct same from whatever living allowance may be made.\n\nThe time factor may make this arrangement regarding rations unsuitable in the case of Mr. Allard. He might be advised by wire to submit his ration order without delay to your office for transmission to the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nARMY MESSAGE\n\nFile: 139-5-1 (S)\n\nOttawa July 9 1948\n\nMr L Allard\nRAE Northwest Territories\n\nDEPARTMENT WILLING TO HIRE YOUR SISTER AS\nSECOND TEACHER RAE DAY SCHOOL ON TRIAL BASIS ONE YEAR -stop-\nWE WILL WRITE HER ACCORDINGLY -stop- I AM SENDING YOU\nAIRMAIL LETTER RE RATION SUPPLY -stop- SUGGEST YOU\nPREPARE LIST NECESSARY RATIONS IMMEDIATELY PENDING\nARRIVAL MY LETTER -\n\nBernard F Neary\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nPhoned to: A.S.\nPhoned by: .......\nTime: ..........\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 906-1, part 1)\nJuly 15, 1948.\n\nRae Indian Day School.\n\nDear Miss Allard:\n\nYou will probably have heard from your brother by now that we have been considering sending a second teacher to help him at Fort Rae. Naturally, we thought of you and I am writing you therefore in this regard.\n\nUpon the recommendation of the Inspector of Schools, we are prepared to operate the Rae School on a full-time basis and to engage you as the second teacher. This step is of an experimental nature only for the 1948-49 academic year and subsequent decisions will depend upon the enrolment and the progress of the school.\n\nThe question of your salary will be settled when a decision has been reached by the Civil Service Commission concerning the Living Allowance to be paid to the employees in the Northwest Territories.\n\nI have already written to your brother with regard to your food supplies for next winter. Before making any further arrangements, however, I would like to know from you whether you would be interested in teaching at Rae during the next academic year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMiss T.

Gibson, Deputy Commissioner, Northwest Territories Administration, concerning the provision of food supplies for our school teachers in the North.\n\nI have written to two of our teachers concerning the provision of these supplies and now wish to place an order for the attached list of rations for:\n\nMr. L. Allard,\nIndian Day School,\nRae, Northwest Territories.\n\nWould you please supply this list of rations to Mr. Allard and forward the account here. We will make arrangements to deduct an amount each month from Mr. Allard's living allowance in order to recover the cost of providing these food supplies.\n\nThe second teacher mentioned above is Miss Hinds at Fort McPherson. I understand that she has made arrangements with your store in Edmonton to provide her with the rations which she will be requiring. It would be appreciated if you could make every effort to have Mr. Allard's supplies forwarded to him on the last boat north.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR.H.

The mission would have been pleased to help us out but unfortunately they are not getting their new battery back which I counter when I wrote to you. So that leaves us with an available talkie projector and no juice. But I still don't give it up as a bad job included as a suggestion which I think should force service to us and saving to your Department.\n\nSuggested by the mission that you provide a new battery back for their plant in exchange of electricity for both school and house for the life of the battery. For your information their plant is well equipped with both diesel motor and wind charger providing us with constant light. The Fathers are quite capable of taking good care of the batteries, their past\nset is going on its eight year of continuous service. To my knowledge this is cheap electricity for our north. Keep in mind that we use lights all day for at least four full months and part time for two.\n\nOur present setup depends on the wind and according to Mr. Biffin the lamps are used most of the time for both house and school. If you accept this deal it will cut off all lamp equipment, batteries for our plant, repairs and last but not least danger of fire.\n\nMuch to the contrary of needless talk against the R.C. mission I find them all for the school and its success. That is why I suggest such a transaction which is for the good of the school.\n\nThe good attendance of the pupils has kept up in July and all is progressing slow but sure as expected. I am sending under separate cover samples of our needle craft which is an all Doxie product made by young native girls. Would it be possible for you to arrange outside sale of such products. Their articles vary from novelty to practical such as slippers, gloves, moccasins, book marks etc. The work made by older girls and women is much better. Advise?\nI included in a list of various articles which we would need if you decide on buying batteries for the mission. I would suggest you making the order and sending it by the H.B.C.-M.R.T boat.\n\n1 set of 2 globelites or other make of 110-DC battery bank which consists of 54 - 2 cell batteries. 76 heavy duties are recommended.\n1000 ft. of no. 8 outside wiring.\n12 glass insulators no. 9\n12 Insulators brackets (cab)\n6 Porcelain strain insulators\n6 Porcelain tubes\n2 Panel boards\n1 dog size 15 standard fuses.\n2 desk lights\n2 service entrance switches\n1 dog 50 watt bulb for 110 volt DC plant.\n\nI didn't write to Dr. Mulvihill in order to save time you could contact him earlier by wire. awaiting your answer I remain yours very truly,\n\nLeon A. Allard\nMr. McKinnon,\nIndian Day School Inspector,\nDept. of Indian's Affair Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nRe: your proposal as to our salary and that of revised salary schedule on the June Bulletin. I was greatly disappointed when I read the report. Would you blame a person for not wanting to stay at such a salary? Why the ordinary labourer is well off compared to us. I presume it is the reason why my sister is not here yet. Needless to remind you that you will be facing difficulties to secure teachers in the future.\n\nI have previously mentioned a few words to Mr. Neary regarding the janitor salary I am to get. I have paid out of my own funds for washing of school and attended to other duties myself. I wouldn't like to insist too much with Mr. Neary as I have been corresponding steady for other requisitions. I therefore leave it to you to re-introduce it in a diplomatic way.\n\nThe boarding school question is proving itself of utmost importance if any success is to be expected. On the other hand a successful schooling for other young and old would be by far more fruitful than the latter. I hope I make myself clear, so far from what I can see of the pupils coming back from Resolution. The odd will keep up the healthy routine but as a whole they go back to the same habits. While if both young and old benefited of the teachings there would be greater possibilities of improvement. I don't know but it sure sounds like a loss of time to me to educate them and cure them of disease if any, and then send them back to sick and uneducated parents.\n\nWhat about our school remodeling program? If we are to be two teachers would you send material and permission for partitioning in two? The Fathers are willing to give a hand sometimes this fall. I presume you have plans for the sliding partitions and could supply us the needed material. Or would the carpenters working on the Hay River contract come to remodel our school? We haven't as yet received windows and remodeling supplies, but there is still time if you transfer the woodson the H.B.C. - M.R.T. boat seeing that the N. T.\nWe have already made their one and only trip to Rae. The school dimensions are roughly 24 x 9 x 40 ft. It would also be advisable to build a porch for wood supplies and wind break if we are to make two classrooms out of the building.\n\nYour silence has greatly disappointed me with regards to our requisitions. Although I still expect more material by the H.B.C. boat. Received last year's stationery and various small articles plus some equipment and the books you promised me. I haven't as yet received the Look and See book. I got one from Yellowknife and my pupils are doing alright with it. The progress is as I expected it but I am not too disappointed with their work. Hoping that all will turn for a successful schooling for our little natives,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) Leon A. Allard\nTeacher Rae Indian Day School.\n\nP. S.

I do not think it would be advisable to move Mr. Allard of Fort Rae, to Fort Norman. My reasons for this are; Mr. Allard has been at Fort Rae since April of this year and is now acquainted with the situation at that point. Your suggestion of Mr. Allard's sister as teacher at Fort Rae is advisable providing she acts as assistant to Mr. Allard but Fort Rae is too remote and rugged a settlement to expect any woman to carry on alone in. Further, I am of the opinion that the Fort Rae School requires the services of two teachers and the only means of accomplishing this would be to have brother and sister, or husband and wife.\nRE YOUR TEL TEACHERS FT.

As this school was then being operated on a seasonal basis, his salary was at the rate of $200.00 per month.\n\nWe have now been able to convert this to a full-time school, and Mr. Allard has thus become eligible for the northern living allowance (P.C. 57/4777 of October 20, 1948), effective 1 August, 1948.\n\nThis means that he will revert, effective August 1, 1948, to his normal classification of a Grade I Welfare Teacher at a salary of $1,500.00 an academic year plus a northern living allowance of $900.00 per year. Would you please make the necessary adjustments in his salary.\n\nWe will forward to you from the Hudson Bay Company the accounts for the food which has been shipped into Mr. Allard. These will be a charge monthly against a certain amount of his northern living allowance. I will discuss this matter further with you when these accounts are received.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nCorrespondence Course for Teacher at Fort Rae (Mr. L.A. Allard):\n\nIt is my understanding that our teachers are required to pay the costs of any courses they attend or take by mail. Either Mr. Allard or myself should be put right on this point.\n\nI gather that Mr. Allard is under the impression that by completing this course he is qualifying for a salary increment. As he has no certificate and this course will not give him a teaching certificate, he should be set right on that point, too.\n\nIt appears that he proposes to spend 35 hours a week studying Grade XI and XII academic subjects. This might leave little time for attention to lesson-preparation. As he is only 21 he might be well advised to slow down on correspondence work during the school term.\n\nCAT Clark\nIn December Mr. Allard was paid $125 in salary and $5 for northern allowance. The deductions for the month were $31.25 towards Retirement Fund, retroactive to August 1, 1948; the date he was made a full-time teacher from the seasonal position, and $23.75 was deducted for Income Tax. His pay for the month was $145, net $140 as a status.\n\nIn January he was paid $125, and $6.25 was deducted for the Retirement Fund and $2.50 for Income Tax. The Retirement Fund is deducted from all full-time employees at the rate of 5% of his gross salary. This money is kept in a fund and can be transferred towards superannuation on appointment as a permanent full-time employee, or is refunded with interest on the employee leaving the service.\n\nMr. Allard will be able to find his deductions by checking out the cheque stubs that come with every cheque received.\n\nM.

As this trip was made just after the opening of the schools, I believe it worthwhile to report on my observations at each point.\n\nOn September 22nd, I proceeded to Fort Rae to check on progress of repairs to this building. This work is nearing completion and a very good job has been obtained. The entire building has been insulated and the second story as well. This gives a manual training room for future use. The first floor has been divided into two with all old partitions removed, giving two good class rooms. The dividing partition is movable and the school will now make a good hall. All walls of first floor have been lined with gypsum wallboard and painted. Part of the second story has been lined as well, but there was a shortage of material and this will be obtained next year when the work can be completed. This gives a very good fireproof interior and very durable.\n\nThe whole interior has been painted including the ceiling. The windows, which just arrived by last boat of the season, are being put in and when the teacher returns from his holidays, the building should be complete ready for school.\n\nThe two new oil stoves have arrived as well as fuel oil, all noon lunch materials and the teachers' ration have been put into Fort Rae on the last boat.\n\nI expect to pick up the carpenter by plane before the middle of October and will then pay all wages and incidentals and send an accounting to your office.\n\nI have seen enormous progress at all the schools since last term and I believe we can look forward with confidence to the results that will be obtained from the new type of school in the Northwest Territories.\n\n(Sgd.) T.E.Kirby,\nSup't Indian Agencies.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMr. Leon Allard, Fort Rae Indian Day School, Fort Rae, Northwest Territories, enquires of the possibility of obtaining a typewriter for personal and school use at a reduced rate through the Department. I don't think this is possible, however, you may have some definite information in this regard. He wishes to purchase the typewriter for his own personal property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nRed Rockenzie District, N.W.T.\nNovember 10, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nRae Indian Day School\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 7th.\n\nIt is not possible to purchase a typewriter under the conditions suggested by Mr. Allard as naturally, this would lead to other Departments being swamped with similar applications.\n\nThe only exception I know of in cases like this is where the Department purchases a sewing machine for an Indian girl graduating and who has proved of outstanding ability in domestic science work and who is about to be married.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. J.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nBox 117,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\n\nBFN/HM\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have given some thought to the type of teacher required at Fort Rae and would recommend that Mr. Leon Allard be replaced by his sister, who is a qualified teacher.\n\nMr. Allard has done some fine work in getting the school established but it is regretted that he has not the ability to organize this school. He has no teacher training and thus he is not in a position to give this community the type of education required. About two weeks ago, he called at the office and inquired of the possibility of placing his sister, Miss Terry Allard, in charge of the school and having her father live with her; the father would attend to the fires and do caretaking services. Mr. Leon Allard inquired of this possibility on the understanding that he would be appointed to one of the schools operated by the Department elsewhere.\n\nMiss Allard is a qualified teacher. She has a fine personality and a knowledge of the techniques of teaching; this is vital as far as teaching Indian children is concerned. Her ability as a teacher is reflected in her work. The children like her and learn quite well under her supervision. The parents are aware of this difference as they prefer their children to be taught by Miss Allard in preference to her brother.\n\nI have had various complaints to the effect that Mr. Allard is becoming \"bushed\". I know that he is not liked as well as his sister. The Indians are of the opinion that their children learned far better under Miss Allard's supervision. I am also of the opinion that Mr. Allard might be more interested in organizing a trading company than a school as he inquired from me when I last visited Fort Rae of the possibility of his sister teaching in the school on the understanding that he be permitted to trade on the side and then teach during the seasonal periods. I squelched this idea by informing him that the Department would not grant him a trading license and that we were not interested...\nin having our teachers act as traders and teachers as the two professions did not go together.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Allard be appointed teacher in charge of this school in June and that her father be engaged as Caretaker. Mr. Leon Allard might complete his High School course and obtain teacher training on the understanding that he would receive every consideration at that time. As no action will be necessary regarding the appointment of a teacher to this school until June, I shall give Mr. Allard every opportunity to measure up to our expectations in the meantime. I shall submit a report on his work sometime in June as he may show considerable improvement in the intervening time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\nNovember 14, 1949.\n\nMr. J. W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nRAE Indian Day School.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI have answered your letter of November 8 and I agree entirely with you concerning Mr. Allard.\n\nI have been in correspondence with Miss Allard and offered her a school in Manitoba but did not receive any reply. I do not know whether she has returned to university or not.\n\nI note your recommendation concerning the employment of her father as janitor. We would allow an amount of $30.00 per month to cover his wages. As we will be providing him with a free house, fuel and light, it will not be possible to pay him more than this without establishing a position.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

I prolong my stay at Rae Waiting to hear from you. I have your wire of the eighth of August saying that option regards the Building at Rae was being Air Mailed that day. I have never received the letter as yet. Wish you would look up and see what has happened to it or mail another copy of the Option to me here at Edmonton, Alta.\n\nJust before I left Rae your school supplies arrived. They were the Desks, Books, Blackboard and Naptha gas for the lights. I turned the Keys over to Allen Dick, The N.C.O. in charge Of the R.C.M.P. Police at Rae. There are six glass type lighting Batteries in the house use for Light. These will freeze and burst as soon as the weather gets cold up there so I gave him instructions to removed them as soon as the weather got cold if there was no one in the house. It is just about Freezing up in Rae now and I don't presume you will be able to get any one in there before it does. This means that you wont be able to get any one in there before middle of November. It will be that long before the ice will safe for planes to land on.\n\nHoping to be Favoured with a reply at an early date, I Am,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nGeorge Puffum\nOttawa, October 17, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Buffum:\n\nI was very pleased to receive your letter of September 26th and am having typed another copy of the Option.\n\nWe have been having considerable difficulty locating a teacher for this school. The one whom we originally engaged was forced to change her plans in the last minute. I was pleased to hear that the school supplies had arrived and of the care which you have taken of them.\n\nWe are now negotiating with another teacher whom we hope will take this position.\n\nYou can expect the arrival of the Option in a few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

As soon as this Order-in-Council is obtained, I will write you again. However, I thought that you would like to have an opportunity of seeing the draft option that is proposed. You can expect to hear from me again in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. George Buffum,\n11136 - 67th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour Airmail letter of 8th inst. to hand along with a draft of option that is proposed. In regards of the option it somewhat different than agreed on with your inspector Mr. MacKinnon last summer. He stated that you had no fund available at present for purchase of the property but wanted to rent same from first of September 1947 until the first of May 1948. The rental to be at the rate of fifty Dollars per month. It was understood that you were very anxious of getting this property and that you had the option of purchasing until the first of May 1948.\n\nI note by the by-the draft of the option you sent there is no mention of the rental instead a payment of seventy five Dollars is proposed to secure the option. This payment does not half pay the fire insurance carried on the property at the present time. I also note you state in the option that it expires on the first of June 1948, instead of May first 1948.\n\nHere is a Radiogram received from A.P. Harvey Aklavic dated August 8th, 1947.\n\nGeorge Buffum, Fort Rae.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch advises will rent teachers building recommend by inspector MacKinnon for school and teachers residence at fifty dollars per month stop Ley forwarded Air Mail option to purchase May first 1948 understand you will sell fifty cords of wood at sight please advise if rental O.K. and what price for wood stop advise regards option as soon as you receive it.\n\nA.P. Harvey\n\nI wired Mr. Harvey that the this proposition of rentals O.K. and that the wood would be Five hundred dollars. But the option He mentioned in the wire I never did receive and this is the reason I wrote direct to Ottawa in September. Wish you would please let me know the reason of the change of option from the above term stated by Mr. Harvey.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeorge Buffum\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of 15th, Inst. which clarifies the situation regards rental of property. As to the expiry date of the option if June 1, would suite your plan better than May 1, It would be quite all right with me.\n\nIn relation to the option in part. It states I agree to sell household effects and all contents presently within the said buildings. I have store upstairs in the warehouses some personal effects along with equipment that does not go along with the buildings. This is not anything that belong to the building or has been used in their connection. It consists of clothing, tents, camp stoves, tarps, ropes and blocks and fishing equipment. In the house everything in the way of equipment is there except linen and bedding which you will have to notify taking over.\n\nI also have a stock of paint for the building left in the store and warehouse. It consists of twenty gallons of roof paint and around eight gallons of outside white and inside paint for the house. This paint was purchased several years ago at wholesale prices and therefore is somewhat cheaper than at present. I presume you will be wanting this paint if you purchase the buildings. They are in all good state of repair except the inside of the house there are three rooms that could do with a coat of paint, the living room, dinning room and one bed room they could do with a coat of paint to brighten them up.\n\nThis equipment I have left in the buildings don't think will be in your way as there is all the lower part of these warehouses to store your supplies in. I am planning going north to Rae in the spring and will remove this stuff as soon as you purchase the buildings.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the transportation into the north this coming season. Up until the present there has been two major companies handling freight but the coming season there will be only one, The Northern Transportation Co. No doubt they will have all the freight they can handle and perhaps more if they should have a bad season. So I would advise you to make arrangements for any freight you have at an early date so as to be assured of delivery.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeorge Buffum\nOttawa, November 25, 1947.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are some 740 Indians living at Rae in the Northwest Territories of whom some 143 are of school age;\n\nTHAT the Indian Affairs Branch is preparing to conduct a day school in the trading post owned by George C.

It has been recommended, both by Inspector of Schools McKinnon and by the Chief of our Reserves Division, Mr. McCrimmon, that we purchase this property. Both of these officials have inspected the property and in fact Mr. McCrimmon has stayed at the trader's house. The property consists of the following:\n\n(a) Store (40 x 28)\n(b) Dwelling house (36 x 22)\n(c) Oil and ice house\n(d) Store-house (24 x 16)\n(e) The log shacks located in the property\n(f) 4.44 acres of land on the water front upon which the above buildings are located, Lot 3, Settlement of Rae, N.W.T.\n\nThe house is furnished with a radio, two stoves, an ice box, a washing machine, 8 dining room chairs, 2 large beds, 2 cots, a Winnipeg couch, a 12 volt wind charger, storm doors and windows and a full line of dishes and kitchen utensils.\n\nTherefore it is felt that the purchase of this\nproperty for $10,000.00 is a good investment, especially in view of the fact that we could not build a day school there for less than $40,000.00. At the present time we propose to rent this property from Mr. Buffum so that we can operate a school in it during the winter months. Our Superintendent of Education is now making final negotiations with a teacher who is willing to go in to Rae for this purpose.\n\nWe do not have the funds available in our present estimates for the purchase of this building and therefore the Departmental Solicitor has prepared a draft option or purchase agreement, as attached. I would recommend that this be approved by the Minister as a submission for an Order-in-Council.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 906-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 15, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 12th.\n\nThe rental of your building at $50.00 per month is a separate agreement from the option to purchase. I regret this misunderstanding and wish to assure you that the original plan for renting your building until we can purchase it still stands.\n\nWe also could be prepared to change the expiry date of the option to May 1, 1948.\n\nIt is suggested that you submit an account for the rental of your property for the months of September and October at the rate of $50.00 per month. We can then arrange to pay this account separately.\n\nI hope that this clarifies the situation and will expect to hear from you in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nThe enclosed report on the school newly opened at Fort Rae has been received from Inspector McKinnon, together with the enclosed requisition for school supplies, and the same are being forwarded for your attention.\n\nH. R. Lumberton.\nMR. R.A.Gibson, Deputy Commissioner,\nBureau of N.W.T. & Yukon Affairs, OTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: School - Fort Rae, Northwest Territories.\n\nEnclosed herewith are three copies of a requisition given to me by Mr. Allard, teacher at Fort Rae school.\n\nAs this school is mostly Indian, the provision of these supplies is the responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch, so I would be very pleased if the additional copy of this requisition were forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch, for their attention. Indian agent, Hunter, I understand, is submitting a similar requisition, so it will be necessary to check both requisitions in order to avoid any duplication of supplies.\n\nAs the school at Rae has just been opened, you will note that the amount of supplies needed will be considerably more than will be required next year. Mr. Lamberton and Colonel Neary will be in a position to add to this requisition, all the necessary supplies which will be needed during the coming year.\n\nWhen school opened, there were seventeen children in attendance, and information available at Rae indicates that the pupilage will begin to increase about June 15th, and that there will be from fifty to one hundred and thirty children of school age in the settlement during a seasonal period of from four to five months depending upon fur conditions.\n\nMr. Allard, the teacher, is very anxious to receive a full line of hand tools and sufficient soft wood for manual training purposes. After seeing the fine woodwork produced by the grade 1 Eskimo children at Port Erbant, I am convinced that there is great value in this type of training and would recommend the purchase of all necessary supplies in this connection.\n\nAs the children at Rae have had no schooling, I suggest that all children be X-rayed at the earliest possible date. There is a hospital in this settlement, with equipment available, so I am of the opinion that this can be attended to quite easily.\n\nAs there is a regular monthly mail service between Yellowknife and Rae, and as Rae is the largest Indian Settlement in the Northwest Territories, I recommend that a delco plant and projector be provided for this school in order that the educational films may be shown to the child and adult population of this community.\n\nAll in the north country with whom I have conversed are of the opinion that visual education - particularly the showing of health films - is one of the greatest elevating factors in bettering the conditions of the people. So if one large delco\nplant were installed, it could be used to meet the needs of the Hudson's Bay Company, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the school; and at the same time, by avoiding a duplication of this service, a greater measure of economy would be secured and the fire hazard would be reduced. It is most important that the fire extinguishers requisitioned for, be provided at the earliest possible date, as none are available at the present time.\n\nShould the government purchase the Buffum property this way, it will be necessary to have a carpenter recut a full length of windows on one side of the class-rooms, as there is need of more light. One of the Brothers in the Roman Catholic Mission is trained in carpentry, and I understand he would be willing to remodel the class-room, installing windows and blackboards.\n\nMr. Allard appears to be a very capable young man, and informed me he would be willing to remain in the settlement for several years, provided he was given all necessary assistance and equipment. I assured him that the Government of Canada is vitally interested in the welfare of its people; and in this connection I plan to interview his sister, a qualified teacher, in order to determine her suitability as an additional teacher for the Fort Rae community.\n\nWhile at Rae, Mr. Allard said that it was going to cost him a great deal to live at Rae, and wondered if the Indian Affairs Branch would allow him $50.00 a month for caretaking services, in connection with the school. As such, he would be responsible for sweeping, attending to the fires, and the bringing in of water, and any other incidental activities in connection with the care of the school property. I suggest that the Indian Affairs Branch grant him this allowance in view of the high cost of living, and in the interests of fire prevention, as I do not think that children should be entrusted with attending of school fires. At Fort Macpherson, where the children had been attending to the fires, I noticed the floors splattered with oil, which doubtless creates a fire hazard.\n\nKindly consider this in the nature of an interim report, as I will be submitting at a later date, a complete report concerning each school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nNote:\n\nI understand that Indian Agent, L.C. Hunter, is placing a Requisition with your Branch for school supplies at Fort Rae, thus it will be necessary to check this requisition along with that presented by him in order to avoid a duplication of supplies.\n\nEQUIPMENT:\n\n1 flag\n1 complete set of blinds for school\n1 typewriter\n1 teacher's desk\n1 tent - 8' x 10'\n1 20' square stern canoe\n1 First Aid Kit\n1 Radio\n1 Film strip projector\n1 Record-player and records for same.\n500 Square Feet of chicken wire for back-stop of ballfield.\n2 brooms\n2 rakes\n2 hoes\n2 spades\n1 1000 hr. eveready air cell 2 volts.\n3 45 volt batteries\n2 C Batteries\n1 Bubbler foundation and stand (see Moyer's catalogue)\n2 foam fire extinguishers\n2 soda fire extinguishers\n2 pyrene fire extinguishers\n4 doz. glass cups\n4 \" spoons\n4 \" washbasins\n1 case of \"only-one\" paper towels & holder\n100 rolls toilet tissue\n5 gallons husky oil for floors\n1 2500 watt alternating current delco plant with rectifier.\n1 bank of 110 watt batteries for same\n1 case of 60 watt bulbs\n3 duo therm oil heaters\n1 16 mm. projector\n300 gallons fuel oil\n1 tap (for large hole of 45-gal. steel drum)\n2 45-gallon cans\n\nFOR SCHOOL LUNCH:\n\n10 drums of true milk\n100 lbs. sugar\n60 \" cocoa\n1500 pilot biscuits.\n100 lbs. potatoes\n25 \" rice\n50 \" macaroni\n5 \" barley\n\nEnough slate material for blackboards on 2 sides of school room.\n1 doz. brushes\n1000 sheets assorted construction paper.\n\nover\nFOR SHOP WORK:\n\n1 complete set of hand tools, as prescribed for Ontario schools\n10 lbs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Requisition, Fort Rae Day School.\nFor School year 1948/49.\n\nI am submitting herewith the annual requisition requirements for the Fort Rae Indian Day School for the school year 1948-49.\n\nThe articles listed on this requisition were taken from a list of requirements as drawn up by Mr. J.W. MacKinnon, Inspector of Schools for the N.W.T. and are being submitted at his request.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the only Transportation Company serving the settlement of Ft. Rae, is the Hudson's Bay Transport Company. I believe that this Company will only carry freight for other than Hudson's Bay Company Posts, by special request, I would therefore suggest that arrangements be made with this Company to handle the Fort Rae school requirements.\n\nL.C.

Others had wandered into the Bear Lake regions where they probably will remain.\n\nThe Fort Rae Indians are the most primitive in the agency. They have absolutely no conception of the state of affairs anywhere except in their own small area. Very few have any education, very few speak English. The Indians live by hunting and trapping; there is very little opportunity for employment in other lines. The Hudson's Bay Post Manager figures the average income to be $300.00 a year. Fishing is satisfactory and the caribou are plentiful in season.\n\nWhen the white fox was valuable these people trapped far out in the Barrens and were quite wealthy. But now they are poor, dressed in ragged clothing and at times, particularly in summer, are really hungry. They no longer dry considerable quantities of fish and caribou and for the most part, wear store-bought clothing and live in tents.\n\nSince this is the largest band of Indians in the Territories I think that plans for the betterment of the Indians should include the immediate construction of a Residential school at Fort Rae.\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI am in receipt of an invoice with regards to hardware goods and a teacher's desk which is to be sent through the Northern Transportation.\n\nI take it for granted that this is only half of what I am to get. However seeing that every minute counts in order to have other goods delivered, I will grant myself permission to send you a little reminder.\n\nThe following articles I consider of utmost importance for the success of the school:\n\n1. Game equipment (we have none of any kind) in and out doors.\n2. School Bell. Big enough so as to be heard a mile around.\n\nRae Indian Day School\nRae, N.W.T.\nJune 24, 1948\n3.

Batteries for radio.\n10. \" for light plant.\n11. Rations for school lunch.\n12. Illustrated picture cards.\n\nPlease note that the northern transportation have boats in Yellowknife until late September, giving us enough time to forward our goods to Yellowknife and the special occasion to Red.\n\nI would also like to hear definite news as to James' caretaker job for the school.\n\nI intend organizing a committee reading centre this winter, so kindly sending material you will find suitable. Old magazine, books, various pictures etc. It would also be advisable to send an atlas and maps of Canada for various references.\nI thank you for your\nso great for handicraft material, so that\nitem 4238 not in stock in Eaton's catalogue.\n\nRe: Mr. R.

Gibson, Deputy Commissioner, Northwest Territories Administration, concerning the provision of food supplies for our school teachers in the North.\n\nI have written to two of our teachers concerning the provision of these supplies and now wish to place an order for the attached list of rations for:\n\nMr. L. Allard,\nIndian Day School,\nRae, Northwest Territories.\n\nWould you please supply this list of rations to Mr. Allard and forward the account here. We will make arrangements to deduct an amount each month from Mr. Allard's living allowance in order to recover the cost of providing these food supplies.\n\nThe second teacher mentioned above is Miss Hinds at Fort McPherson. I understand that she has made arrangements with your store in Edmonton to provide her with the rations which she will be requiring. It would be appreciated if you could make every effort to have Mr. Allard's supplies forwarded to him on the last boat north.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR.H.

I would suggest your purchasing these and some for other articles in acquisition and sending them through the M.R.T.'s H.B.C. boat no later than the beginning of August. However you are in a better position to find by contacting the H.B.C. Co. for more accurate details.\n\nI am sorry to inform you that your said letter has not as yet reached me and I don't suppose it will until the second week in August as we get mail once a month. It will then be too late to send my list. According to your last wire I was to wait the arrival of your letter but in view of circumstances I am unable to follow orders. I will however contact you by radiogram if\nby chance we do get our mail before the\n2nd week in August.\n\nI most thankfully congrat-\nulate you on behalf of your wise decision\nwith regards to Rae Indian Day School.\nTrusting that all will turn out for the\nbest I remain\n\nYours very truly,\nLeon A.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fort Rae Indian Day School.\n\nI have recently returned from visiting the Fort Rae Indian Day School and have found the majority of the supplies, as ordered for this school, have not yet arrived. As the navigation season to this point has expired for this season arrangements will necessarily have to be made for the transportation of these supplies from Yellowknife to Fort Rae.\n\nWhile in Yellowknife I checked with the transportation companies and found that these supplies were in storage at Yellowknife. I was assured that transportation of these supplies would be made should any boat be going within the vicinity of Fort Rae, and further, if this can not be done I will be notified by these companies, which will necessitate the hiring of aircraft by this department.\n\nThe supplies which have not arrived at Fort Rae include food for the teachers and rations for the pupils mid-day meal. As can be seen these supplies are definitely necessary for the carrying on of this school, therefore I would request your authority to make arrangements for the hire of aircraft to transport these supplies should they not arrive by boat this season. It may further be stated the Northwest Territories Administration have aircraft at their disposal in this locality and it may be possible to use same for this purpose.\n\nI have checked the other supplies and am vouchering the accounts immediately.\n\nL. C. Hunter, Indian Superintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. L.C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant,\nfile C-45.\n\nThe Department approves you making the\nbest possible arrangements to transport the supplies\nfrom Yellow Knife to the Fort Rae School.\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Gran.

We have now received the enclosed account amounting to $290.49.\n\nPlease issue authority for the payment of the account as submitted. The coding is as follows:\n\n906-516-02-221\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nRae Indian Day School,\nRae, N.W.T.\nNov. 27th, 1948.\n\nMr. L.G. Hunter,\nFort Norman.\n\nDear Mr. Hunter,\n\nI am sending under separate cover signed waybill for freight received at Yellowknife. I presume these will be forwarded to you for payment. You will notice one article, #36/25 has been checked short. As I haven't received invoices from the H.R.C. I am not able to describe the contents. I am fairly sure that these must be cheese and honey the only articles that I didn't get. Are you in a position to claim these parcels? I have marked it short and signed it thus on the waybill.\n\nYou will also receive bills from Mr. Wilson H.R.C. Ras, for transportation of freight from Yellowknife. The high rate is due to the shortage of freight to make it a worthwhile trip. However it is cheaper than airfreight and the possibility of freezing the supplies has been avoided. In view of the high rate through no fault of mine but that of a Departmental delay I suggest that the overcharge be paid by the Department.\n\nIncluded is a description of the school. By doing this I aim at furnishing all the necessary details so that you can decide for yourself or let Ottawa decide what the construction programme is to be. I would like to point out the necessity of a ventilation system, windows and complete reconstruction of the interior. I now have two stoves in the classroom and it isn't any too warm.\n\nHere is my suggestions:\n\n(1) That at least twelve windows be added.\n(2) That ten Test or other similar material be used inside.\n(3) That a proper ventilation system be introduced.\n(4) That some heating system or material be added to keep the floor warm.\n(5) That a heated porch be added large enough to be used as a cloak room.\n(6) That a sliding partition be built to separate the two classrooms.\n(7) That the upstairs be finished and rebuilt into a convenient kitchenette, washroom, lunchroom and library.\n\nAlthough I don't recommend such high expenditures for two such small classrooms which would never accommodate the summer attendance I would like to bring to your attention then importance of this question. Besides being too small for two classrooms it is also in a poor location being in the midst of the summer sidewalks and the winter dog trails. The playground...\nLAYGROUND problem \"unless we clear, bulldoze and level a ground at the back of Father's garden\" is also to be considered.\n\nPlease advise on what arrangements I'm to make for the payment of (1) Floor washing, (2) general clean-up of School, (3) Putting up ice for summer use, (4) Building of a slide. The charges suggested are $4.00 for washing the floor, $8.00 for walls and ceiling about $25.00 for the slide and $15.00 for the ice. Items 1-2 and 3 need no explanation, regarding the slide it has been my desire to build a slide similar to that of Resolution school. I intend building it entirely of poles, snow and water. It will prove itself very useful for recreational activities.\n\nIn order to avoid such side charges I would suggest your increasing the handy man's salary. It would all turn out even as there is a lot of work such as painting, wood cutting, nailing of wood, keeping the buildings repaired, interpreting, cleaning of school and a thousand other jobs. At $25.00 a month one can't expect much. By the way my handyman Mr. Bouvier was very disappointed, he hasn't received a penny yet?\n\nRequested that library books be furnished for teacher As you already know the important role books play in Northern Life I need not explain this requisition.\n\nIncluded is a list of Handy craft material. If Ottawa won't pay the air rate kindly cancel last items. The delay in answering your last wire was that I wired N.T.C.L. for information, their office being closed it was forwarded to Edmonton which all took time. The three pupils for Grade III, IV and V are from Yellowknife and are now regular pupils of Rae. As stated their former school is Resolution. They are now permanent citizens of Fort Rae. Wishing you a Merry Xmas and Happy New Year I remain,\n\nYours truly\nL.A. Allard.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nDecember 28th, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nRe; Fort Rae, Indian Day School,\nFort Rae N.W.T.\n\nI am attaching herewith a copy of a letter recently received from the teacher of the Fort Rae Indian Day School. I will attempt to deal with each point as raised by the teacher, separately, for your information.\n\nIt will be noted that the school supplies and teachers provisions arrived at Fort Rae. I do not consider the charge for the carrying of these supplies from Yellowknife to Ft. Rae exorbitant and am therefore passing the account for payment this date. As for the parcel that was short shipped, I await the waybills of the transportation Company at which time a claim will be submitted for the shortage.\n\nAs you will note from the attached letter, Mr. Allard has put forth suggestions for the remodeling the present school building. I concur with the suggestions that this work should be done during the coming summer, as the attendance at this school should warrant such an expenditure. Should the Department agree that this work be done may I please be advised so that the necessary material may be ordered. I am of the opinion that the work as described by Mr. Allard could be done by the R.C. Mission Church Brothers, if the material were supplied. I do not agree with Mr. Allard that the location of the school is wrong, as the property is owned by our Department it would only be necessary to have a fence placed around the grounds to stop people from using it as a main thoroughfare.\n\nThe present system that we have for paying janitors in the schools in the N.W.T. will necessarily have to\nHAVE TO be changed. The fact that other Departments are paying from one hundred dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars per month for the services of a janitor and handy man, is causing considerable dissension. I would suggest that for a school such as Ft. Rae that a position be established for a casual laborer at a salary of one hundred dollars per month and that the person employed do all cleaning and repair jobs. This salary would include all tasks connected with the school, except for jobs that would require a tradesman. I am also covering this matter under separate letter on the Fort McPherson Indian Day school, and I would request that I be advised on your opinion. I have vouchered for the salary of the handyman of the Fort Rae School for the period Sept. 1st, 1946 to Nov. 30th, 1948.\n\nI am advising the teacher of the Fort Rae school to withhold any charges or work for general cleaning of the school. Should the handyman or janitor be given an increase in salary such cleaning would be his responsibility. I may further mention that if the school is to be remodeled that the cleaning of the walls etc. would not be necessary at the present time.\n\nI am instructing Mr. Allard to submit to me the entire requirements of the Ft. Rae School for the school year 1946/50, so that requisitions may be submitted to the Department in sufficient time to avoid any trouble in having our freight carried by the Transportation Companies.\n\nThe handy-craft material as mentioned in the letter of Mr. Allard, has been ordered from Eaton's with the request that they prepay the Air Express and submit same with their invoice. The Air Express on these articles should be very small amount.\n\nIt would be appreciated if I could be advised at the earliest, regarding the remodeling of this school and the increase of the salary for a casual laborer.\n\n[Signature]\nI.O.

I am taking the liberty of sending him a part of Mr. Allard's letter so that this matter can be further investigated. Unfortunately, I do not know when Mr. McKinnon is again proceeding North or I would prefer delaying this project until he has provided a sketch plan of the suggested changes. If a janitor is paid a salary in excess of $400.00 per year, it is necessary to establish a Civil Service position for the school concerned. This matter will therefore have to receive your further consideration as you can appreciate the fact that the establishment of these positions with high salaries will naturally increase greatly our educational expenses in the Northwest Territories.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 24, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nFort Rae Indian Day School -\nAlteration of Classroom.\n\nWe have received a letter from Mr. Indian Superintendent Hunter with regard to suggested changes in the classroom and teachersage at the above school. Mr. Allard has made the following recommendations:-\n\n\"Included is a description of the school. By doing this I aim at furnishing all the necessary details so that you can decide for yourself or let Ottawa decide what the construction programme is to be. I would like to point out the necessity of a ventilation system, windows and complete reconstruction of the interior. I now have two stoves in the classroom and it isn't any too warm.\n\nHere is my suggestions: -\n\n(1) That at least twelve windows be added.\n\n(2) That ten Test or other similar material be used inside.\n\n(3) That a proper ventilation system be introduced.\n\n(4) That some heating system or material be added to keep the floor warm.\n\n(5) That a heated porch be added large enough to be used as a cloak room.\n\n(6) That a sliding partition be built to separate the two classrooms.\n\n..... (7)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 906-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(7) That the upstairs be finished and rebuilt into a convenient kitchenet, washroom lunchroom and library.\n\n\"Although I don't recommend such high expenditures for two such small classrooms which would never accommodate the summer attendance I would like to bring to your attention the importance of this question. Besides being too small for two classrooms it is also in a poor location being in the midst of the summer sidewalks and the winter dog trails. The playground problem 'unless we clear, bulldoze and level a ground at the back of Father's garden' is also to be considered.\n\n\"Please advise on what arrangements I'm to make for the payment of (1) Floor washing, (2) general clean-up of School, (3) Putting up ice for summer use, (4) Building of a slide. The charges suggested are $4.00 for washing the floor, $8.00 for walls and ceiling about $25.00 for the slide and $15.00 for the ice. Items 1-2 and 3 need no explanation, regarding the slide it has been my desire to build a slide similar to that of Resolution School. I intend building it entirely of poles snow and water. It will prove itself very useful for recreational activities.\n\n\"In order to avoid such side charges I would suggest your increasing the handy man's salary. It would all turn out even as there is a lot of work such as painting, wood cutting, piling of wood, keeping the buildings repaired, interpreting, cleaning of school and a thousand other jobs. At $25.00 a month one can't expect much. By the way my handyman Mr. Bouvier was very disappointed, he hasn't received a penny yet.\"\n\nIn forwarding Mr. Allard's letter Mr. Hunter has the following comments to make:\n\n\"As you will note from the attached letter, Mr. Allard has put forth suggestions for the remodelling of the present school building. I concur with the suggestions that this work should be done during the coming summer, as...\nattendance at this school should warrant such an expenditure. Should the Department agree that this work be done may I please be advised so that the necessary material may be ordered. I am of the opinion that the work as described by Mr. Allard could be done by the R.C. Mission Church Brothers, if the material were supplied. I do not agree with Mr. Allard that the location of the school is wrong, as the property is owned by our Department it would only be necessary to have a fence placed around the grounds to stop people from using it as a main thoroughfare.\n\n\"The present system that we have for paying janitors in the schools in the N.W.T. will necessarily have to be changed. The fact that other Departments are paying from one hundred dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars per month for the services of a janitor and handy man, is causing considerable dissension. I would suggest that for a school such as Ft. Rae that a position be established for a casual labourer at a salary of one hundred dollars per month and that the person employed do all cleaning and repair jobs. This salary would include all tasks connected with the school, except for jobs that would require a tradesman. I am also covering this matter under separate letter on the Fort McPherson Indian Day School, and I would request that I be advised on your opinion. I have vouchered for the salary of the handyman of the Fort Rae School for the period Sept. 1st, 1948, to Nov. 30th, 1948.\n\n\"I am advising the teacher of the Fort Rae School to withhold any charges or work for general cleaning of the school. Should the handyman or janitor be given an increase in salary such cleaning would be his responsibility. I may further mention that if the school is to be remodeled that the cleaning of the walls, etc. would not be necessary at the present time.\"\n\nI would like to receive from Mr. McKinnon an expression of his views concerning the proposed changes which Mr. Allard has recommended for the Rae Indian Day School.\n\nI would suggest also that the question of janitor's or caretaker's salary be placed on the agenda for discussion at the next meeting of the Sub-committee on Education of the North-west Territories Council.\n\nDirector.\n**Hudson's Bay Company**\n\n**INVOICE**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n**FORT RAB INDIAN DAY SCHOOL**\n**OTTAWA, ONT.**\n\n| Date | Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Dec 1 | 1 ea Tea Pot                 |          | 24.25      |       |\n|      | 2 yd Cotton                   |          | 1.00       |       |\n|      | 1 ea Wrench                   |          | 2.50       | 5.75  |\n| 16   | 1 da Mantles                  |          | 75         |       |\n|      | Cash Advanced for Radio License |        | 2.00       | 2.75  |\n| 31   | 1 ea Coleman Pump             |          | 1.25       |       |\n|      | 1 pkt Matches                 |          | 35         | 1.60  |\n| 24   | 1 pkt Tacks                   |          | 25         |       |\n| 27   | 2 ea Padlocks                 |          | 1.50       | 1.50  |\n\n**Total:** $11.55\n\nReceipt of above acknowledged\n\nCertified correct as rendered\n\n---\n\nPlease send cheques & direct inquiries to the Manager\n\n**HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY**\n**MACKENZIE RIVER SECTION**\n**10129 - 103rd Street**\n**EDMONTON, ALBERTA.**\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 906-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nC-45 (142)\n\nPay to The Manager, Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nAddress District Office, 10129-103rd St., Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec. 31 | To: Supplies and materials for use of the Ft.

A. Allard,\nRes Indian Day School,\nRes, Northwest Territories.\n\nDear Mr. Allard:\n\nYou will recall that I wrote to you previously concerning the employment of your sister as a second teacher at your school during the summer holidays. We have now received a letter from her indicating that she will be free from April 25 to September 30. I am writing to her today indicating that we are prepared to engage her services during this period. Mr. McKinnon and I discussed this matter recently and we realize that you will have a very large enrolment of Indian children during the summer months. Her salary would be at the rate of $200.00 per month as a seasonal school teacher.\n\nYou will recall my letter to you of November 30 concerning your Northern Living Allowance. At that time I told you that you would be advised further in detail with regard to deductions from your Northern Living Allowance.\n\nBy Order-in-Council 5912 of December 21, 1948, new regulations were brought into effect dealing with Northern Living Allowances. The rate for single employees is still $900.00 per annum but we are required to make the following deductions:\n\n(a) House, fuel and light - 10% of the maximum of the class range.\n\nThe highest salary for a Grade One welfare teacher is $1,560.00 per year; therefore the monthly deduction for house, fuel and light will be $13.00.\n\n(b) For furniture the deduction shall be at the rate of $60.00 per annum. Therefore $5.00 per month will be deducted from your allowance for this purpose.\nThe total of your bill with the Hudson's Bay Company for rations came to $544.17. I presume that you are anxious to get this paid off as fast as possible and therefore I have advised Treasury that a deduction at the rate of $57.00 per month should be made from your Northern Living Allowance so that this account can be met.\n\nTherefore, until your grocery bill has been paid off in entirety, your Northern Living Allowance will be used up as follows:\n\n$13.00 for house, fuel and light,\n$5.00 for furniture,\n$57.00 for rations.\n\nI hope that the above explains clearly to you how we are handling your Northern Living Allowance payment at the present time.\n\nWe have received your ration requisition for 1949-50 and will take the necessary action to forward these supplies.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 29, 1949.\n\nMr. L. C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nRae Indian Day School.\n\nYour letter of December 28 has been the subject of several discussions between Mr. McKinnon and myself. Please find attached a copy of plan 888 which is our standard one-room school with attached teacher's residence. If you alter the classroom to conform generally to the classroom in this plan, I feel you should have a satisfactory school. I note that if the Department provides the materials, we can have the work done locally by Mr. Allard and the Roman Catholic Brothers. Would you please therefore submit, by airmail, the requisition for the windows, doors, etc., required to convert this building to a proper classroom or classrooms.\n\nWe are not prepared to move the school and agree with your comments about its location. With regard to the payment of janitor services, we certainly cannot pay $100 to $150.00 per month. Any position over $400.00 must be established by the Civil Service Commission. We cannot permit the cost of operating day schools to rise by hiring caretakers and janitors for each individual school. At the present time we are prepared to pay an amount of approximately $20.00 per classroom for caretaking duties. The sweeping and dusting should be done by the pupils. This is standard practice at all our Indian day schools and also in most provincial rural schools. The children can be rewarded by candies or similar prizes. The Department is prepared to allow an amount of $5.00 per month for the purchase of these items. We are prepared to pay for the putting up of ice at the standard rate in the neighbourhood.\n\nBernard F.

I expected an answer to my last letter giving me further explanation to the 47/50 school year in Rae. I am willing to stay in Rae but it is at all possible to transfer me to another school in the territories I would appreciate it. I don't know if your department permits it but the Manitoba Department of Education permitted such exchange of schools. It is only a suggestion of course but a change in locality would do a lot of good to the teachers.\n\nI have lately heard of raise in pay for all social welfare workers?

W. J. Johnston\nMay 27, 1949.\n\nMr. L. C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nAlterations - Indian Day School, Fort Rae, N.W.T.\n\nUnfortunately, we have a very heavy building programme this year and it has been difficult to have an engineer prepare the bill of materials felt to be necessary for alterations to the Fort Rae School.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of the requisition sent to the Departmental Purchasing Agent, covering the windows, lumber, nails and paint thought to be necessary. It has been a real problem to draft this bill of materials and we can only hope that it will be sufficient for your needs. As I visualize it, your main problems are:\n\n(a) To improve the insulation in the schoolroom,\n\n(b) To provide more windows.\n\nTherefore, we have ordered mineral wool insulation, plywood, and plaster board. The plaster board can be used above the blackboard level and the plywood below blackboard level.\n\nWe have also ordered 10 windows which I think, with the present ones, should prove more than adequate.\n\nI would suggest that we plan on making any other alterations next summer and that you then submit a requisition\nduring the winter, based on the supplies being sent to you this summer.\n\nPlease advise me as to the size of the accountable advance which you will require to have this work carried out by local labour. I presume that Mr. Allard will be available to supervise and help with this work.\n\nBernard F.

Kirkby\nSuptl Indian agency\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 15th I inspected the school building at Ft. Rae, N.W.T., with a view to improving insulation, providing more windows, and general improvement of the interior.\n\nIf this building is to be insulated with the rock wool batts that are being supplied it will be necessary to remove the entire inside sheathing of the building first. This sheathing is shiplap, old and brittle, and by the time it has been removed will be of little value to put back on the walls. No extra shiplap has been provided for this work.\n\nI request that I be given permission to insulate this building with shavings that can be procured from saw mills in the Resolution area. These shavings can be poured damp between the wall studs without cutting or removing any sheathing since the studs are open above the ceiling. It would then be possible to completely insulate this building in no more than one week whereas the installation of rock wool will require at least one month with the help available.\n\nIt has been proposed to insulate the ceiling of the second story with rock wool and sheath with shiplap. This will give a good manual training room at some later date.\n\nThe second story floor is constructed of flooring and the ceiling of the downstairs is also constructed of flooring. Either would invariably be ruined if it is decided to insulate the ceiling of the downstairs instead of the ceiling of the second floor. Consequently I believe it is best to insulate the second story ceiling.\n\nExtra windows are to be installed in both ends of the building, and existing partitions should be removed giving added space for class rooms.\n\nOne movable sectional partition should be erected to divide the floor space into two sections if there are enough pupils for two rooms; or to cut down the size of the class room when fewer pupils are attending classes during the winter, when the smaller room will be easier to heat.\n\nLabour costs if shavings are used.\n\n| Task                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Insulating walls with shavings | $150.00|\n| Insulating ceiling with rock wool | $100.00|\n| Sheathing ceiling of second floor | $150.00|\n| Installing windows and doors   | $150.00|\n| Sheathing with plywood & gyprock | $150.00|\n| Painting inside and outside    | $250.00|\n| Constructing partition         | $50.00 |\n\nTotal labour........................$1000.00\n\nBoard & room.........................$200.00\nMR I F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRepairs to Indian Day School, Ft. Rae, N.W.T.\n\nFurther to my letter of July 18th, and your wire of July 22nd, it would appear that I had made my letter a little ambiguous as to insulating the second story of this school. The first story up to level of top plate will be insulated with shavings to save time and expense. I had then proposed to insulate between the rafters and the second story ceiling with the rock wool bats supplied. This portion of the building had never been sheathed so no need to do any extra dismantling. The rockwool for this section would give a much better finished job than shavings.\n\nOn checking with Northern Transportation Co., I find that all materials ordered for Ft. Rae with the exception of shiplap and paint had been held at Ft. Smith on orders from Hayward Lumber Co. From this I presume that no additional windows are to be put in; walls insulated with shavings, ceiling insulated with rock wool and sheathed, sectional partition constructed and building painted, will be only repairs completed.\n\nMaterial had been en-route to finish entire classrooms with wallboard but this was also held at Ft. Smith so will not be doing any interior improvement except as outlined in your wire.\n\nI do believe that this building should have been covered inside with wallboard as it is very dingy but if it is the policy of the Department to build a new modern school; a building which must be considered soon at this point; then there is little point in spending more than just enough to make this old building comfortable for the present time.\n\nAs soon as I can get a cost of shavings from Wynn's Mill will advise you as requested in wire.\nI have just received the file on Ft. Rae School from Supt. Hunter of Ft. Norman and while checking over the requisition he sent in find that quantities of nails sent in or ordered are very inadequate for the work. Will it be in order for me to make local purchase of such items as are necessary to complete the repairs as set out in your wire.\n\nI regret that these shortages appear but I have had little time to check back correspondence and only find them at the last minute. I do not believe the quantities will be excessive in any instance but as it is now too late to receive shipments from Edmonton require authority to make small local purchases. If you require I will wire each time a local purchase becomes necessary.\n\nThe shipments have not gone forward to Ft. Rae from here so believe it will be the end of second week in August at the very earliest before we can start work on this school.\n\nYours very truly\n\nI.F.

Neary,\nSupt.of Indian Education.\n\nPHONED TO:\nPHONED BY:\nTIME:\n\nCOPY 3\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRepairs to Indian Day School, Ft. Rae, N.W.T.\n\nI have been advised by the teacher at Ft. Rae that all the materials on order have been delivered and with the exception of the shavings all necessary material is at the school. These shavings are to be delivered to Mr. Wynn to me at Yellowknife next week and I will then send them to Ft. Rae.\n\nI intend to take in one carpenter foreman to Ft. Rae on August 15th and will start him to work repairing the school as indicated. We will be engaging two native laborers at that point to assist in completing the work.\n\nWith the material available there is at least three weeks repair work to be done before there is need to insulate with the shavings so I intend to start whether the shavings have been delivered or not.\n\nMr. Wynn has notified me that his shavings will be priced at $2.50 per bale delivered at Yellowknife. We will need sixty bales which will indicate we need an expenditure of $150.00 for this purpose. I am of the opinion that a small quantity of slaked lime should be put in with the shavings to prevent vermin from entering the building. Three sacks purchased locally will be all that is required.\n\nIt is quite obvious after I made a second check of the requisition, that we will need a small quantity of 2 x 4 inch nails extra. We will be using some heavy material where it is possible and the extra nails will be needed for this.\n\nThe accountable advance for the labour costs of this school has not been deposited at the bank in Yellowknife. If this has not gone forward could I receive same at an early date as all help in this country expect their pay at the end of every week.\n\nThis is an Indian Day School, will the Treaty Indians whom I engage as helpers be subjected to Income Tax? These people are not eligible for the Northern Allowance and I do not feel they should have to pay tax. I request this information for making up my pay list and for making deductions where necessary.\n\nThe following work will be completed at this school:\n\n1. All exterior walls insulated with shavings.\n2. Ceiling between rafters to be insulated with rockwool and sheathed with shiplap.\n3. Existing partitions to be removed and a movable partition constructed to divide the building into two rooms.\n4. Bottom four feet of walls to be sheathed with plywood. Top section of walls sheathed with Gyprock wallboard.\n5. Interior of downstairs; or class room section, to be painted.\n6. Exterior of building to be painted.\n7. Doors and windows to be weatherproofed and position of windows changed to provide more light as indicated in your letter of May 27, 1949.\n\nAfter I have been to Ft. Rae and have started the crew I will further indicate to you what is being done and progress made.\nThe present supply of wood at Ft. Rae is no more than enough to do this winter and if the fuel oil on special requisition of May 1st. is not delivered we will be short of wood. At the present time native labour is available and we can get wood cut without any difficulty. During the winter and spring all the natives will be able to get fur and will not want to cut wood. I therefore request authority to have Thirty-two cords of wood cut and piled in the school yard this fall. If this wood is not needed this winter it will be needed next and we will need to have it cut next spring at the latest.\n\nAs stated earlier, now is the best time to get native labour to cut wood when they are in need of money and desire some work. Transportation is always a problem at Ft. Rae and at this time of year wood can be brought in by boat.\n\nIf this wood can be cut I will instruct that those natives who desire work will be engaged and I will then submit the vouchers for payment in the usual way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nMemorandum:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe: Heating equipment for Fort Rae Indian School and Teachers quarters.\n\nThe above requisition is dated May 1st and was received at this office on the 11th instant, which does not give us sufficient time to arrange for a purchase in the usual manner.\n\nOur information is that shipments for points north of Fort Smith and as far as Fort Norman, on the Mackenzie River, must be delivered to Northern Transportation Co., Ltd., at Waterways not later than the 18th instant.\n\nIf Superintendent Robertson can arrange for purchase and delivery of the 10 items on Mr. Hunter's requisition before the closing of navigation, I would suggest that you authorize him to do so.\n\nW.
